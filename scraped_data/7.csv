5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay. 


If you want to try something new, I&apos;d recommend:

- This Little Piggy Went to China: Definitely would recommend if you enjoy asian flavors and breakfast sandwiches. This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered. The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"
5,"The following review is based on experiences before the COVID-19 pandemic:

This was one of the last places I visited before the lockdown started in March. Like The Girl and The Goat, I was delighted with the creativity of the dishes with bold flavors, but with a reasonable price. Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."
3,(Pre covid visit) My only issue with the goat franchise is that all the food is SO SALTY!!!!!! WHY!!! There&apos;s so much potential and the presentation is great but my blood pressure increases by 10 with each bite.

Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered. The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"
5,"The following review is based on experiences before the COVID-19 pandemic:

This was one of the last places I visited before the lockdown started in March. Like The Girl and The Goat, I was delighted with the creativity of the dishes with bold flavors, but with a reasonable price. Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."
3,(Pre covid visit) My only issue with the goat franchise is that all the food is SO SALTY!!!!!! WHY!!! There&apos;s so much potential and the presentation is great but my blood pressure increases by 10 with each bite.
5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay. 


If you want to try something new, I&apos;d recommend:

- This Little Piggy Went to China: Definitely would recommend if you enjoy asian flavors and breakfast sandwiches.

We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"
5,"The following review is based on experiences before the COVID-19 pandemic:

This was one of the last places I visited before the lockdown started in March. Like The Girl and The Goat, I was delighted with the creativity of the dishes with bold flavors, but with a reasonable price. Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."
3,(Pre covid visit) My only issue with the goat franchise is that all the food is SO SALTY!!!!!! WHY!!! There&apos;s so much potential and the presentation is great but my blood pressure increases by 10 with each bite.
5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay. 


If you want to try something new, I&apos;d recommend:

- This Little Piggy Went to China: Definitely would recommend if you enjoy asian flavors and breakfast sandwiches. This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered. The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."
3,(Pre covid visit) My only issue with the goat franchise is that all the food is SO SALTY!!!!!! WHY!!! There&apos;s so much potential and the presentation is great but my blood pressure increases by 10 with each bite.
5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

We thank them for being our safety heroes

Never knew you could eat fries for breakfast

This is America

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay. 


If you want to try something new, I&apos;d recommend:

- This Little Piggy Went to China: Definitely would recommend if you enjoy asian flavors and breakfast sandwiches. This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered. The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"
5,"The following review is based on experiences before the COVID-19 pandemic:

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay. 


If you want to try something new, I&apos;d recommend:

- This Little Piggy Went to China: Definitely would recommend if you enjoy asian flavors and breakfast sandwiches. This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered. The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"
5,"The following review is based on experiences before the COVID-19 pandemic:

This was one of the last places I visited before the lockdown started in March. Like The Girl and The Goat, I was delighted with the creativity of the dishes with bold flavors, but with a reasonable price. Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."

The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered. The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"
5,"The following review is based on experiences before the COVID-19 pandemic:

This was one of the last places I visited before the lockdown started in March. Like The Girl and The Goat, I was delighted with the creativity of the dishes with bold flavors, but with a reasonable price. Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."
3,(Pre covid visit) My only issue with the goat franchise is that all the food is SO SALTY!!!!!! WHY!!! There&apos;s so much potential and the presentation is great but my blood pressure increases by 10 with each bite.
5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay.

The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"
5,"The following review is based on experiences before the COVID-19 pandemic:

This was one of the last places I visited before the lockdown started in March. Like The Girl and The Goat, I was delighted with the creativity of the dishes with bold flavors, but with a reasonable price. Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."
3,(Pre covid visit) My only issue with the goat franchise is that all the food is SO SALTY!!!!!! WHY!!! There&apos;s so much potential and the presentation is great but my blood pressure increases by 10 with each bite.
5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay. 


If you want to try something new, I&apos;d recommend:

- This Little Piggy Went to China: Definitely would recommend if you enjoy asian flavors and breakfast sandwiches. This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered.

Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."
3,(Pre covid visit) My only issue with the goat franchise is that all the food is SO SALTY!!!!!! WHY!!! There&apos;s so much potential and the presentation is great but my blood pressure increases by 10 with each bite.
5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

This is America

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay. 


If you want to try something new, I&apos;d recommend:

- This Little Piggy Went to China: Definitely would recommend if you enjoy asian flavors and breakfast sandwiches. This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered. The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"

5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay. 


If you want to try something new, I&apos;d recommend:

- This Little Piggy Went to China: Definitely would recommend if you enjoy asian flavors and breakfast sandwiches. This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered. The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"
5,"The following review is based on experiences before the COVID-19 pandemic:

This was one of the last places I visited before the lockdown started in March. Like The Girl and The Goat, I was delighted with the creativity of the dishes with bold flavors, but with a reasonable price. Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."

This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered. The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"
5,"The following review is based on experiences before the COVID-19 pandemic:

This was one of the last places I visited before the lockdown started in March. Like The Girl and The Goat, I was delighted with the creativity of the dishes with bold flavors, but with a reasonable price. Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."
3,(Pre covid visit) My only issue with the goat franchise is that all the food is SO SALTY!!!!!! WHY!!! There&apos;s so much potential and the presentation is great but my blood pressure increases by 10 with each bite.
5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay.

The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"
5,"The following review is based on experiences before the COVID-19 pandemic:

This was one of the last places I visited before the lockdown started in March. Like The Girl and The Goat, I was delighted with the creativity of the dishes with bold flavors, but with a reasonable price. Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."
3,(Pre covid visit) My only issue with the goat franchise is that all the food is SO SALTY!!!!!! WHY!!! There&apos;s so much potential and the presentation is great but my blood pressure increases by 10 with each bite.
5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay. 


If you want to try something new, I&apos;d recommend:

- This Little Piggy Went to China: Definitely would recommend if you enjoy asian flavors and breakfast sandwiches. This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered.

Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."
3,(Pre covid visit) My only issue with the goat franchise is that all the food is SO SALTY!!!!!! WHY!!! There&apos;s so much potential and the presentation is great but my blood pressure increases by 10 with each bite.
5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

This is America

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay. 


If you want to try something new, I&apos;d recommend:

- This Little Piggy Went to China: Definitely would recommend if you enjoy asian flavors and breakfast sandwiches. This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered. The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"

5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay. 


If you want to try something new, I&apos;d recommend:

- This Little Piggy Went to China: Definitely would recommend if you enjoy asian flavors and breakfast sandwiches. This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered. The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"
5,"The following review is based on experiences before the COVID-19 pandemic:

This was one of the last places I visited before the lockdown started in March. Like The Girl and The Goat, I was delighted with the creativity of the dishes with bold flavors, but with a reasonable price. Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."

This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered. The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"
5,"The following review is based on experiences before the COVID-19 pandemic:

This was one of the last places I visited before the lockdown started in March. Like The Girl and The Goat, I was delighted with the creativity of the dishes with bold flavors, but with a reasonable price. Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."
3,(Pre covid visit) My only issue with the goat franchise is that all the food is SO SALTY!!!!!! WHY!!! There&apos;s so much potential and the presentation is great but my blood pressure increases by 10 with each bite.
5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay.

The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"
5,"The following review is based on experiences before the COVID-19 pandemic:

This was one of the last places I visited before the lockdown started in March. Like The Girl and The Goat, I was delighted with the creativity of the dishes with bold flavors, but with a reasonable price. Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."
3,(Pre covid visit) My only issue with the goat franchise is that all the food is SO SALTY!!!!!! WHY!!! There&apos;s so much potential and the presentation is great but my blood pressure increases by 10 with each bite.
5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay. 


If you want to try something new, I&apos;d recommend:

- This Little Piggy Went to China: Definitely would recommend if you enjoy asian flavors and breakfast sandwiches. This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered.

Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."
3,(Pre covid visit) My only issue with the goat franchise is that all the food is SO SALTY!!!!!! WHY!!! There&apos;s so much potential and the presentation is great but my blood pressure increases by 10 with each bite.
5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

This is America

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay. 


If you want to try something new, I&apos;d recommend:

- This Little Piggy Went to China: Definitely would recommend if you enjoy asian flavors and breakfast sandwiches. This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered. The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"

5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay. 


If you want to try something new, I&apos;d recommend:

- This Little Piggy Went to China: Definitely would recommend if you enjoy asian flavors and breakfast sandwiches. This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered. The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"
5,"The following review is based on experiences before the COVID-19 pandemic:

This was one of the last places I visited before the lockdown started in March. Like The Girl and The Goat, I was delighted with the creativity of the dishes with bold flavors, but with a reasonable price. Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."

This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered. The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"
5,"The following review is based on experiences before the COVID-19 pandemic:

This was one of the last places I visited before the lockdown started in March. Like The Girl and The Goat, I was delighted with the creativity of the dishes with bold flavors, but with a reasonable price. Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."
3,(Pre covid visit) My only issue with the goat franchise is that all the food is SO SALTY!!!!!! WHY!!! There&apos;s so much potential and the presentation is great but my blood pressure increases by 10 with each bite.
5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay.

The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"
5,"The following review is based on experiences before the COVID-19 pandemic:

This was one of the last places I visited before the lockdown started in March. Like The Girl and The Goat, I was delighted with the creativity of the dishes with bold flavors, but with a reasonable price. Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."
3,(Pre covid visit) My only issue with the goat franchise is that all the food is SO SALTY!!!!!! WHY!!! There&apos;s so much potential and the presentation is great but my blood pressure increases by 10 with each bite.
5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay. 


If you want to try something new, I&apos;d recommend:

- This Little Piggy Went to China: Definitely would recommend if you enjoy asian flavors and breakfast sandwiches. This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered.

Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."
3,(Pre covid visit) My only issue with the goat franchise is that all the food is SO SALTY!!!!!! WHY!!! There&apos;s so much potential and the presentation is great but my blood pressure increases by 10 with each bite.
5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

This is America

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay. 


If you want to try something new, I&apos;d recommend:

- This Little Piggy Went to China: Definitely would recommend if you enjoy asian flavors and breakfast sandwiches. This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered. The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"

5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay. 


If you want to try something new, I&apos;d recommend:

- This Little Piggy Went to China: Definitely would recommend if you enjoy asian flavors and breakfast sandwiches. This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered. The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"
5,"The following review is based on experiences before the COVID-19 pandemic:

This was one of the last places I visited before the lockdown started in March. Like The Girl and The Goat, I was delighted with the creativity of the dishes with bold flavors, but with a reasonable price. Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."

This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered. The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"
5,"The following review is based on experiences before the COVID-19 pandemic:

This was one of the last places I visited before the lockdown started in March. Like The Girl and The Goat, I was delighted with the creativity of the dishes with bold flavors, but with a reasonable price. Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."
3,(Pre covid visit) My only issue with the goat franchise is that all the food is SO SALTY!!!!!! WHY!!! There&apos;s so much potential and the presentation is great but my blood pressure increases by 10 with each bite.
5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay.

The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"
5,"The following review is based on experiences before the COVID-19 pandemic:

This was one of the last places I visited before the lockdown started in March. Like The Girl and The Goat, I was delighted with the creativity of the dishes with bold flavors, but with a reasonable price. Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."
3,(Pre covid visit) My only issue with the goat franchise is that all the food is SO SALTY!!!!!! WHY!!! There&apos;s so much potential and the presentation is great but my blood pressure increases by 10 with each bite.
5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay. 


If you want to try something new, I&apos;d recommend:

- This Little Piggy Went to China: Definitely would recommend if you enjoy asian flavors and breakfast sandwiches. This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered.

Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."
3,(Pre covid visit) My only issue with the goat franchise is that all the food is SO SALTY!!!!!! WHY!!! There&apos;s so much potential and the presentation is great but my blood pressure increases by 10 with each bite.
5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

This is America

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay. 


If you want to try something new, I&apos;d recommend:

- This Little Piggy Went to China: Definitely would recommend if you enjoy asian flavors and breakfast sandwiches. This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered. The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"

5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay. 


If you want to try something new, I&apos;d recommend:

- This Little Piggy Went to China: Definitely would recommend if you enjoy asian flavors and breakfast sandwiches. This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered. The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"
5,"The following review is based on experiences before the COVID-19 pandemic:

This was one of the last places I visited before the lockdown started in March. Like The Girl and The Goat, I was delighted with the creativity of the dishes with bold flavors, but with a reasonable price. Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."

This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered. The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"
5,"The following review is based on experiences before the COVID-19 pandemic:

This was one of the last places I visited before the lockdown started in March. Like The Girl and The Goat, I was delighted with the creativity of the dishes with bold flavors, but with a reasonable price. Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."
3,(Pre covid visit) My only issue with the goat franchise is that all the food is SO SALTY!!!!!! WHY!!! There&apos;s so much potential and the presentation is great but my blood pressure increases by 10 with each bite.
5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay.

The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"
5,"The following review is based on experiences before the COVID-19 pandemic:

This was one of the last places I visited before the lockdown started in March. Like The Girl and The Goat, I was delighted with the creativity of the dishes with bold flavors, but with a reasonable price. Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."
3,(Pre covid visit) My only issue with the goat franchise is that all the food is SO SALTY!!!!!! WHY!!! There&apos;s so much potential and the presentation is great but my blood pressure increases by 10 with each bite.
5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay. 


If you want to try something new, I&apos;d recommend:

- This Little Piggy Went to China: Definitely would recommend if you enjoy asian flavors and breakfast sandwiches. This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered.

Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."
3,(Pre covid visit) My only issue with the goat franchise is that all the food is SO SALTY!!!!!! WHY!!! There&apos;s so much potential and the presentation is great but my blood pressure increases by 10 with each bite.
5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

This is America

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay. 


If you want to try something new, I&apos;d recommend:

- This Little Piggy Went to China: Definitely would recommend if you enjoy asian flavors and breakfast sandwiches. This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered. The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"

5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay. 


If you want to try something new, I&apos;d recommend:

- This Little Piggy Went to China: Definitely would recommend if you enjoy asian flavors and breakfast sandwiches. This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered. The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"
5,"The following review is based on experiences before the COVID-19 pandemic:

This was one of the last places I visited before the lockdown started in March. Like The Girl and The Goat, I was delighted with the creativity of the dishes with bold flavors, but with a reasonable price. Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."

This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered. The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"
5,"The following review is based on experiences before the COVID-19 pandemic:

This was one of the last places I visited before the lockdown started in March. Like The Girl and The Goat, I was delighted with the creativity of the dishes with bold flavors, but with a reasonable price. Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."
3,(Pre covid visit) My only issue with the goat franchise is that all the food is SO SALTY!!!!!! WHY!!! There&apos;s so much potential and the presentation is great but my blood pressure increases by 10 with each bite.
5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay.

The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"
5,"The following review is based on experiences before the COVID-19 pandemic:

This was one of the last places I visited before the lockdown started in March. Like The Girl and The Goat, I was delighted with the creativity of the dishes with bold flavors, but with a reasonable price. Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."
3,(Pre covid visit) My only issue with the goat franchise is that all the food is SO SALTY!!!!!! WHY!!! There&apos;s so much potential and the presentation is great but my blood pressure increases by 10 with each bite.
5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay. 


If you want to try something new, I&apos;d recommend:

- This Little Piggy Went to China: Definitely would recommend if you enjoy asian flavors and breakfast sandwiches. This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered.

Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."
3,(Pre covid visit) My only issue with the goat franchise is that all the food is SO SALTY!!!!!! WHY!!! There&apos;s so much potential and the presentation is great but my blood pressure increases by 10 with each bite.
5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

This is America

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay. 


If you want to try something new, I&apos;d recommend:

- This Little Piggy Went to China: Definitely would recommend if you enjoy asian flavors and breakfast sandwiches. This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered. The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"

5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay. 


If you want to try something new, I&apos;d recommend:

- This Little Piggy Went to China: Definitely would recommend if you enjoy asian flavors and breakfast sandwiches. This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered. The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"
5,"The following review is based on experiences before the COVID-19 pandemic:

This was one of the last places I visited before the lockdown started in March. Like The Girl and The Goat, I was delighted with the creativity of the dishes with bold flavors, but with a reasonable price. Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."

This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered. The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"
5,"The following review is based on experiences before the COVID-19 pandemic:

This was one of the last places I visited before the lockdown started in March. Like The Girl and The Goat, I was delighted with the creativity of the dishes with bold flavors, but with a reasonable price. Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."
3,(Pre covid visit) My only issue with the goat franchise is that all the food is SO SALTY!!!!!! WHY!!! There&apos;s so much potential and the presentation is great but my blood pressure increases by 10 with each bite.
5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay.

The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"
5,"The following review is based on experiences before the COVID-19 pandemic:

This was one of the last places I visited before the lockdown started in March. Like The Girl and The Goat, I was delighted with the creativity of the dishes with bold flavors, but with a reasonable price. Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."
3,(Pre covid visit) My only issue with the goat franchise is that all the food is SO SALTY!!!!!! WHY!!! There&apos;s so much potential and the presentation is great but my blood pressure increases by 10 with each bite.
5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay. 


If you want to try something new, I&apos;d recommend:

- This Little Piggy Went to China: Definitely would recommend if you enjoy asian flavors and breakfast sandwiches. This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered.

Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."
3,(Pre covid visit) My only issue with the goat franchise is that all the food is SO SALTY!!!!!! WHY!!! There&apos;s so much potential and the presentation is great but my blood pressure increases by 10 with each bite.
5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

This is America

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay. 


If you want to try something new, I&apos;d recommend:

- This Little Piggy Went to China: Definitely would recommend if you enjoy asian flavors and breakfast sandwiches. This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered. The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"

5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay. 


If you want to try something new, I&apos;d recommend:

- This Little Piggy Went to China: Definitely would recommend if you enjoy asian flavors and breakfast sandwiches. This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered. The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"
5,"The following review is based on experiences before the COVID-19 pandemic:

This was one of the last places I visited before the lockdown started in March. Like The Girl and The Goat, I was delighted with the creativity of the dishes with bold flavors, but with a reasonable price. Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."

This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered. The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"
5,"The following review is based on experiences before the COVID-19 pandemic:

This was one of the last places I visited before the lockdown started in March. Like The Girl and The Goat, I was delighted with the creativity of the dishes with bold flavors, but with a reasonable price. Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."
3,(Pre covid visit) My only issue with the goat franchise is that all the food is SO SALTY!!!!!! WHY!!! There&apos;s so much potential and the presentation is great but my blood pressure increases by 10 with each bite.
5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay.

The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"
5,"The following review is based on experiences before the COVID-19 pandemic:

This was one of the last places I visited before the lockdown started in March. Like The Girl and The Goat, I was delighted with the creativity of the dishes with bold flavors, but with a reasonable price. Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."
3,(Pre covid visit) My only issue with the goat franchise is that all the food is SO SALTY!!!!!! WHY!!! There&apos;s so much potential and the presentation is great but my blood pressure increases by 10 with each bite.
5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay. 


If you want to try something new, I&apos;d recommend:

- This Little Piggy Went to China: Definitely would recommend if you enjoy asian flavors and breakfast sandwiches. This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered.

Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."
3,(Pre covid visit) My only issue with the goat franchise is that all the food is SO SALTY!!!!!! WHY!!! There&apos;s so much potential and the presentation is great but my blood pressure increases by 10 with each bite.
5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

This is America

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay. 


If you want to try something new, I&apos;d recommend:

- This Little Piggy Went to China: Definitely would recommend if you enjoy asian flavors and breakfast sandwiches. This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered. The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"

5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay. 


If you want to try something new, I&apos;d recommend:

- This Little Piggy Went to China: Definitely would recommend if you enjoy asian flavors and breakfast sandwiches. This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered. The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"
5,"The following review is based on experiences before the COVID-19 pandemic:

This was one of the last places I visited before the lockdown started in March. Like The Girl and The Goat, I was delighted with the creativity of the dishes with bold flavors, but with a reasonable price. Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."

This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered. The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"
5,"The following review is based on experiences before the COVID-19 pandemic:

This was one of the last places I visited before the lockdown started in March. Like The Girl and The Goat, I was delighted with the creativity of the dishes with bold flavors, but with a reasonable price. Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."
3,(Pre covid visit) My only issue with the goat franchise is that all the food is SO SALTY!!!!!! WHY!!! There&apos;s so much potential and the presentation is great but my blood pressure increases by 10 with each bite.
5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay.

The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"
5,"The following review is based on experiences before the COVID-19 pandemic:

This was one of the last places I visited before the lockdown started in March. Like The Girl and The Goat, I was delighted with the creativity of the dishes with bold flavors, but with a reasonable price. Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."
3,(Pre covid visit) My only issue with the goat franchise is that all the food is SO SALTY!!!!!! WHY!!! There&apos;s so much potential and the presentation is great but my blood pressure increases by 10 with each bite.
5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay. 


If you want to try something new, I&apos;d recommend:

- This Little Piggy Went to China: Definitely would recommend if you enjoy asian flavors and breakfast sandwiches. This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered.

Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."
3,(Pre covid visit) My only issue with the goat franchise is that all the food is SO SALTY!!!!!! WHY!!! There&apos;s so much potential and the presentation is great but my blood pressure increases by 10 with each bite.
5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

This is America

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay. 


If you want to try something new, I&apos;d recommend:

- This Little Piggy Went to China: Definitely would recommend if you enjoy asian flavors and breakfast sandwiches. This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered. The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"

5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay. 


If you want to try something new, I&apos;d recommend:

- This Little Piggy Went to China: Definitely would recommend if you enjoy asian flavors and breakfast sandwiches. This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered. The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"
5,"The following review is based on experiences before the COVID-19 pandemic:

This was one of the last places I visited before the lockdown started in March. Like The Girl and The Goat, I was delighted with the creativity of the dishes with bold flavors, but with a reasonable price. Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."

This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered. The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"
5,"The following review is based on experiences before the COVID-19 pandemic:

This was one of the last places I visited before the lockdown started in March. Like The Girl and The Goat, I was delighted with the creativity of the dishes with bold flavors, but with a reasonable price. Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."
3,(Pre covid visit) My only issue with the goat franchise is that all the food is SO SALTY!!!!!! WHY!!! There&apos;s so much potential and the presentation is great but my blood pressure increases by 10 with each bite.
5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay.

The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"
5,"The following review is based on experiences before the COVID-19 pandemic:

This was one of the last places I visited before the lockdown started in March. Like The Girl and The Goat, I was delighted with the creativity of the dishes with bold flavors, but with a reasonable price. Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."
3,(Pre covid visit) My only issue with the goat franchise is that all the food is SO SALTY!!!!!! WHY!!! There&apos;s so much potential and the presentation is great but my blood pressure increases by 10 with each bite.
5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay. 


If you want to try something new, I&apos;d recommend:

- This Little Piggy Went to China: Definitely would recommend if you enjoy asian flavors and breakfast sandwiches. This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered.

Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."
3,(Pre covid visit) My only issue with the goat franchise is that all the food is SO SALTY!!!!!! WHY!!! There&apos;s so much potential and the presentation is great but my blood pressure increases by 10 with each bite.
5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

This is America

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay. 


If you want to try something new, I&apos;d recommend:

- This Little Piggy Went to China: Definitely would recommend if you enjoy asian flavors and breakfast sandwiches. This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered. The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"

5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay. 


If you want to try something new, I&apos;d recommend:

- This Little Piggy Went to China: Definitely would recommend if you enjoy asian flavors and breakfast sandwiches. This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered. The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"
5,"The following review is based on experiences before the COVID-19 pandemic:

This was one of the last places I visited before the lockdown started in March. Like The Girl and The Goat, I was delighted with the creativity of the dishes with bold flavors, but with a reasonable price. Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."

This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered. The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"
5,"The following review is based on experiences before the COVID-19 pandemic:

This was one of the last places I visited before the lockdown started in March. Like The Girl and The Goat, I was delighted with the creativity of the dishes with bold flavors, but with a reasonable price. Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."
3,(Pre covid visit) My only issue with the goat franchise is that all the food is SO SALTY!!!!!! WHY!!! There&apos;s so much potential and the presentation is great but my blood pressure increases by 10 with each bite.
5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay.

The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"
5,"The following review is based on experiences before the COVID-19 pandemic:

This was one of the last places I visited before the lockdown started in March. Like The Girl and The Goat, I was delighted with the creativity of the dishes with bold flavors, but with a reasonable price. Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."
3,(Pre covid visit) My only issue with the goat franchise is that all the food is SO SALTY!!!!!! WHY!!! There&apos;s so much potential and the presentation is great but my blood pressure increases by 10 with each bite.
5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay. 


If you want to try something new, I&apos;d recommend:

- This Little Piggy Went to China: Definitely would recommend if you enjoy asian flavors and breakfast sandwiches. This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered.

Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."
3,(Pre covid visit) My only issue with the goat franchise is that all the food is SO SALTY!!!!!! WHY!!! There&apos;s so much potential and the presentation is great but my blood pressure increases by 10 with each bite.
5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

This is America

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay. 


If you want to try something new, I&apos;d recommend:

- This Little Piggy Went to China: Definitely would recommend if you enjoy asian flavors and breakfast sandwiches. This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered. The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"

5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay. 


If you want to try something new, I&apos;d recommend:

- This Little Piggy Went to China: Definitely would recommend if you enjoy asian flavors and breakfast sandwiches. This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered. The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"
5,"The following review is based on experiences before the COVID-19 pandemic:

This was one of the last places I visited before the lockdown started in March. Like The Girl and The Goat, I was delighted with the creativity of the dishes with bold flavors, but with a reasonable price. Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."

This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered. The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"
5,"The following review is based on experiences before the COVID-19 pandemic:

This was one of the last places I visited before the lockdown started in March. Like The Girl and The Goat, I was delighted with the creativity of the dishes with bold flavors, but with a reasonable price. Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."
3,(Pre covid visit) My only issue with the goat franchise is that all the food is SO SALTY!!!!!! WHY!!! There&apos;s so much potential and the presentation is great but my blood pressure increases by 10 with each bite.
5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay.

The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"
5,"The following review is based on experiences before the COVID-19 pandemic:

This was one of the last places I visited before the lockdown started in March. Like The Girl and The Goat, I was delighted with the creativity of the dishes with bold flavors, but with a reasonable price. Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."
3,(Pre covid visit) My only issue with the goat franchise is that all the food is SO SALTY!!!!!! WHY!!! There&apos;s so much potential and the presentation is great but my blood pressure increases by 10 with each bite.
5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay. 


If you want to try something new, I&apos;d recommend:

- This Little Piggy Went to China: Definitely would recommend if you enjoy asian flavors and breakfast sandwiches. This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered.

Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."
3,(Pre covid visit) My only issue with the goat franchise is that all the food is SO SALTY!!!!!! WHY!!! There&apos;s so much potential and the presentation is great but my blood pressure increases by 10 with each bite.
5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

This is America

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay. 


If you want to try something new, I&apos;d recommend:

- This Little Piggy Went to China: Definitely would recommend if you enjoy asian flavors and breakfast sandwiches. This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered. The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"

5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay. 


If you want to try something new, I&apos;d recommend:

- This Little Piggy Went to China: Definitely would recommend if you enjoy asian flavors and breakfast sandwiches. This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered. The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"
5,"The following review is based on experiences before the COVID-19 pandemic:

This was one of the last places I visited before the lockdown started in March. Like The Girl and The Goat, I was delighted with the creativity of the dishes with bold flavors, but with a reasonable price. Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."

This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered. The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"
5,"The following review is based on experiences before the COVID-19 pandemic:

This was one of the last places I visited before the lockdown started in March. Like The Girl and The Goat, I was delighted with the creativity of the dishes with bold flavors, but with a reasonable price. Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."
3,(Pre covid visit) My only issue with the goat franchise is that all the food is SO SALTY!!!!!! WHY!!! There&apos;s so much potential and the presentation is great but my blood pressure increases by 10 with each bite.
5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay.

The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"
5,"The following review is based on experiences before the COVID-19 pandemic:

This was one of the last places I visited before the lockdown started in March. Like The Girl and The Goat, I was delighted with the creativity of the dishes with bold flavors, but with a reasonable price. Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."
3,(Pre covid visit) My only issue with the goat franchise is that all the food is SO SALTY!!!!!! WHY!!! There&apos;s so much potential and the presentation is great but my blood pressure increases by 10 with each bite.
5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay. 


If you want to try something new, I&apos;d recommend:

- This Little Piggy Went to China: Definitely would recommend if you enjoy asian flavors and breakfast sandwiches. This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered.

Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."
3,(Pre covid visit) My only issue with the goat franchise is that all the food is SO SALTY!!!!!! WHY!!! There&apos;s so much potential and the presentation is great but my blood pressure increases by 10 with each bite.
5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

This is America

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay. 


If you want to try something new, I&apos;d recommend:

- This Little Piggy Went to China: Definitely would recommend if you enjoy asian flavors and breakfast sandwiches. This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered. The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"

5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay. 


If you want to try something new, I&apos;d recommend:

- This Little Piggy Went to China: Definitely would recommend if you enjoy asian flavors and breakfast sandwiches. This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered. The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"
5,"The following review is based on experiences before the COVID-19 pandemic:

This was one of the last places I visited before the lockdown started in March. Like The Girl and The Goat, I was delighted with the creativity of the dishes with bold flavors, but with a reasonable price. Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."

This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered. The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"
5,"The following review is based on experiences before the COVID-19 pandemic:

This was one of the last places I visited before the lockdown started in March. Like The Girl and The Goat, I was delighted with the creativity of the dishes with bold flavors, but with a reasonable price. Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."
3,(Pre covid visit) My only issue with the goat franchise is that all the food is SO SALTY!!!!!! WHY!!! There&apos;s so much potential and the presentation is great but my blood pressure increases by 10 with each bite.
5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay.

The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"
5,"The following review is based on experiences before the COVID-19 pandemic:

This was one of the last places I visited before the lockdown started in March. Like The Girl and The Goat, I was delighted with the creativity of the dishes with bold flavors, but with a reasonable price. Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."
3,(Pre covid visit) My only issue with the goat franchise is that all the food is SO SALTY!!!!!! WHY!!! There&apos;s so much potential and the presentation is great but my blood pressure increases by 10 with each bite.
5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay. 


If you want to try something new, I&apos;d recommend:

- This Little Piggy Went to China: Definitely would recommend if you enjoy asian flavors and breakfast sandwiches. This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered.

Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."
3,(Pre covid visit) My only issue with the goat franchise is that all the food is SO SALTY!!!!!! WHY!!! There&apos;s so much potential and the presentation is great but my blood pressure increases by 10 with each bite.
5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

This is America

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay. 


If you want to try something new, I&apos;d recommend:

- This Little Piggy Went to China: Definitely would recommend if you enjoy asian flavors and breakfast sandwiches. This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered. The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"

5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay. 


If you want to try something new, I&apos;d recommend:

- This Little Piggy Went to China: Definitely would recommend if you enjoy asian flavors and breakfast sandwiches. This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered. The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"
5,"The following review is based on experiences before the COVID-19 pandemic:

This was one of the last places I visited before the lockdown started in March. Like The Girl and The Goat, I was delighted with the creativity of the dishes with bold flavors, but with a reasonable price. Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."

This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered. The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"
5,"The following review is based on experiences before the COVID-19 pandemic:

This was one of the last places I visited before the lockdown started in March. Like The Girl and The Goat, I was delighted with the creativity of the dishes with bold flavors, but with a reasonable price. Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."
3,(Pre covid visit) My only issue with the goat franchise is that all the food is SO SALTY!!!!!! WHY!!! There&apos;s so much potential and the presentation is great but my blood pressure increases by 10 with each bite.
5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay.

The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"
5,"The following review is based on experiences before the COVID-19 pandemic:

This was one of the last places I visited before the lockdown started in March. Like The Girl and The Goat, I was delighted with the creativity of the dishes with bold flavors, but with a reasonable price. Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."
3,(Pre covid visit) My only issue with the goat franchise is that all the food is SO SALTY!!!!!! WHY!!! There&apos;s so much potential and the presentation is great but my blood pressure increases by 10 with each bite.
5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay. 


If you want to try something new, I&apos;d recommend:

- This Little Piggy Went to China: Definitely would recommend if you enjoy asian flavors and breakfast sandwiches. This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered.

Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."
3,(Pre covid visit) My only issue with the goat franchise is that all the food is SO SALTY!!!!!! WHY!!! There&apos;s so much potential and the presentation is great but my blood pressure increases by 10 with each bite.
5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

This is America

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay. 


If you want to try something new, I&apos;d recommend:

- This Little Piggy Went to China: Definitely would recommend if you enjoy asian flavors and breakfast sandwiches. This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered. The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"

5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay. 


If you want to try something new, I&apos;d recommend:

- This Little Piggy Went to China: Definitely would recommend if you enjoy asian flavors and breakfast sandwiches. This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered. The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"
5,"The following review is based on experiences before the COVID-19 pandemic:

This was one of the last places I visited before the lockdown started in March. Like The Girl and The Goat, I was delighted with the creativity of the dishes with bold flavors, but with a reasonable price. Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."

This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered. The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"
5,"The following review is based on experiences before the COVID-19 pandemic:

This was one of the last places I visited before the lockdown started in March. Like The Girl and The Goat, I was delighted with the creativity of the dishes with bold flavors, but with a reasonable price. Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."
3,(Pre covid visit) My only issue with the goat franchise is that all the food is SO SALTY!!!!!! WHY!!! There&apos;s so much potential and the presentation is great but my blood pressure increases by 10 with each bite.
5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay.

The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"
5,"The following review is based on experiences before the COVID-19 pandemic:

This was one of the last places I visited before the lockdown started in March. Like The Girl and The Goat, I was delighted with the creativity of the dishes with bold flavors, but with a reasonable price. Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."
3,(Pre covid visit) My only issue with the goat franchise is that all the food is SO SALTY!!!!!! WHY!!! There&apos;s so much potential and the presentation is great but my blood pressure increases by 10 with each bite.
5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay. 


If you want to try something new, I&apos;d recommend:

- This Little Piggy Went to China: Definitely would recommend if you enjoy asian flavors and breakfast sandwiches. This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered.

Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."
3,(Pre covid visit) My only issue with the goat franchise is that all the food is SO SALTY!!!!!! WHY!!! There&apos;s so much potential and the presentation is great but my blood pressure increases by 10 with each bite.
5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

This is America

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay. 


If you want to try something new, I&apos;d recommend:

- This Little Piggy Went to China: Definitely would recommend if you enjoy asian flavors and breakfast sandwiches. This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered. The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"

5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay. 


If you want to try something new, I&apos;d recommend:

- This Little Piggy Went to China: Definitely would recommend if you enjoy asian flavors and breakfast sandwiches. This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered. The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"
5,"The following review is based on experiences before the COVID-19 pandemic:

This was one of the last places I visited before the lockdown started in March. Like The Girl and The Goat, I was delighted with the creativity of the dishes with bold flavors, but with a reasonable price. Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."

This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered. The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"
5,"The following review is based on experiences before the COVID-19 pandemic:

This was one of the last places I visited before the lockdown started in March. Like The Girl and The Goat, I was delighted with the creativity of the dishes with bold flavors, but with a reasonable price. Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."
3,(Pre covid visit) My only issue with the goat franchise is that all the food is SO SALTY!!!!!! WHY!!! There&apos;s so much potential and the presentation is great but my blood pressure increases by 10 with each bite.
5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay.

The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"
5,"The following review is based on experiences before the COVID-19 pandemic:

This was one of the last places I visited before the lockdown started in March. Like The Girl and The Goat, I was delighted with the creativity of the dishes with bold flavors, but with a reasonable price. Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."
3,(Pre covid visit) My only issue with the goat franchise is that all the food is SO SALTY!!!!!! WHY!!! There&apos;s so much potential and the presentation is great but my blood pressure increases by 10 with each bite.
5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay. 


If you want to try something new, I&apos;d recommend:

- This Little Piggy Went to China: Definitely would recommend if you enjoy asian flavors and breakfast sandwiches. This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered.

Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."
3,(Pre covid visit) My only issue with the goat franchise is that all the food is SO SALTY!!!!!! WHY!!! There&apos;s so much potential and the presentation is great but my blood pressure increases by 10 with each bite.
5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

This is America

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay. 


If you want to try something new, I&apos;d recommend:

- This Little Piggy Went to China: Definitely would recommend if you enjoy asian flavors and breakfast sandwiches. This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered. The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"

5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay. 


If you want to try something new, I&apos;d recommend:

- This Little Piggy Went to China: Definitely would recommend if you enjoy asian flavors and breakfast sandwiches. This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered. The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"
5,"The following review is based on experiences before the COVID-19 pandemic:

This was one of the last places I visited before the lockdown started in March. Like The Girl and The Goat, I was delighted with the creativity of the dishes with bold flavors, but with a reasonable price. Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."

This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered. The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"
5,"The following review is based on experiences before the COVID-19 pandemic:

This was one of the last places I visited before the lockdown started in March. Like The Girl and The Goat, I was delighted with the creativity of the dishes with bold flavors, but with a reasonable price. Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."
3,(Pre covid visit) My only issue with the goat franchise is that all the food is SO SALTY!!!!!! WHY!!! There&apos;s so much potential and the presentation is great but my blood pressure increases by 10 with each bite.
5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay.

The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"
5,"The following review is based on experiences before the COVID-19 pandemic:

This was one of the last places I visited before the lockdown started in March. Like The Girl and The Goat, I was delighted with the creativity of the dishes with bold flavors, but with a reasonable price. Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."
3,(Pre covid visit) My only issue with the goat franchise is that all the food is SO SALTY!!!!!! WHY!!! There&apos;s so much potential and the presentation is great but my blood pressure increases by 10 with each bite.
5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay. 


If you want to try something new, I&apos;d recommend:

- This Little Piggy Went to China: Definitely would recommend if you enjoy asian flavors and breakfast sandwiches. This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered.

Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."
3,(Pre covid visit) My only issue with the goat franchise is that all the food is SO SALTY!!!!!! WHY!!! There&apos;s so much potential and the presentation is great but my blood pressure increases by 10 with each bite.
5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

This is America

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay. 


If you want to try something new, I&apos;d recommend:

- This Little Piggy Went to China: Definitely would recommend if you enjoy asian flavors and breakfast sandwiches. This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered. The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"

5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay. 


If you want to try something new, I&apos;d recommend:

- This Little Piggy Went to China: Definitely would recommend if you enjoy asian flavors and breakfast sandwiches. This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered. The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"
5,"The following review is based on experiences before the COVID-19 pandemic:

This was one of the last places I visited before the lockdown started in March. Like The Girl and The Goat, I was delighted with the creativity of the dishes with bold flavors, but with a reasonable price. Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."

This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered. The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"
5,"The following review is based on experiences before the COVID-19 pandemic:

This was one of the last places I visited before the lockdown started in March. Like The Girl and The Goat, I was delighted with the creativity of the dishes with bold flavors, but with a reasonable price. Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."
3,(Pre covid visit) My only issue with the goat franchise is that all the food is SO SALTY!!!!!! WHY!!! There&apos;s so much potential and the presentation is great but my blood pressure increases by 10 with each bite.
5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay.

The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"
5,"The following review is based on experiences before the COVID-19 pandemic:

This was one of the last places I visited before the lockdown started in March. Like The Girl and The Goat, I was delighted with the creativity of the dishes with bold flavors, but with a reasonable price. Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."
3,(Pre covid visit) My only issue with the goat franchise is that all the food is SO SALTY!!!!!! WHY!!! There&apos;s so much potential and the presentation is great but my blood pressure increases by 10 with each bite.
5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay. 


If you want to try something new, I&apos;d recommend:

- This Little Piggy Went to China: Definitely would recommend if you enjoy asian flavors and breakfast sandwiches. This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered.

Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."
3,(Pre covid visit) My only issue with the goat franchise is that all the food is SO SALTY!!!!!! WHY!!! There&apos;s so much potential and the presentation is great but my blood pressure increases by 10 with each bite.
5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

This is America

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay. 


If you want to try something new, I&apos;d recommend:

- This Little Piggy Went to China: Definitely would recommend if you enjoy asian flavors and breakfast sandwiches. This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered. The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"

5,"I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 

Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well."
5,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can&apos;t get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. 

I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I&apos;ve also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
5,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It&apos;s been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it&apos;ll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another &quot;must have.&quot; We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
5,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. 

For breakfast:
Okonomiyaki
Paratha Burrito
This Little Piggy Went To China

For more lunch:
Tonkatsu
Reuben
Fried Chicken Sammie
Kimchi Burger"

We thank them for being our safety heroes

Never knew you could eat fries for breakfast

4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. 
The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there."
4,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay. 


If you want to try something new, I&apos;d recommend:

- This Little Piggy Went to China: Definitely would recommend if you enjoy asian flavors and breakfast sandwiches. This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it&apos;s not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it&apos;ll still taste good. 

- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won&apos;t feel healthy for eating it, but it&apos;s yummy. 


If you&apos;re looking to be wow&apos;ed, I&apos;d pass on:

- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. 

- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it&apos;s cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn&apos;t tell. 

- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it&apos;s not much of a burrito and the flavors didn&apos;t go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
4,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the &quot;This Little Piggy Went to China&quot; and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it&apos;s essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn&apos;t stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. 

Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I&apos;m glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. 

My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered &quot;The Little Piggy Went to China.&quot; Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I&apos;m very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this dish again. 

My wife&apos;s French toast was also very tasty. A sweet &amp; savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. 

We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered. The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn&apos;t mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
5,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"
5,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). 

Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American &amp; Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. 

Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else."
4,"We didn&apos;t need to stand by long to be situated after we put our name in. I additionally attempted the Pork Belly Pancake which was so acceptable in case you&apos;re searching for something more on the exquisite side. It&apos;s not your customary flapjack, it has an Asian curve and has a decent firm surface. Unquestionably suggest halting by, you won&apos;t think twice about it."
5,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don&apos;t forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
5,"Long overdue, but tis not like they&apos;re really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they&apos;ve handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that&apos;s often pretty packed).  

The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  

The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  

Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. 

Thanks lil Goat people, I&apos;ll be back again some day..."
5,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables.

Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don&apos;t think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"
5,"The following review is based on experiences before the COVID-19 pandemic:

This was one of the last places I visited before the lockdown started in March. Like The Girl and The Goat, I was delighted with the creativity of the dishes with bold flavors, but with a reasonable price. Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options.

Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it&apos;s not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night.

The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:

Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn&apos;t be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience.

Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich.

Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can&apos;t stop eating, even when you feel full.

Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
4,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server&apos;s recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. 

At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
5,"Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...

The food was great, the service was great. 

my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!

the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!"
5,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the &quot;The little piggy went to China.&quot; This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn&apos;t ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull&apos;s-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."
