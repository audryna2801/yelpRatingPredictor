5,"I had an appointment downtown and it was cold out!  I&apos;ve been meaning to try this place for quite some time.  Eating out during Covid times are quite different.  Ramen SAN take no chances.  The place was immaculate and they take your temperature at the entrance.  The social distancing tables are far enough apart and quite safe.  The staff wears masks and gloves and there&apos;s sanitizer there for you.  

As for the food, I tried the chicken and vegetable Gyoza and the Imperial Shio.  The food came out quickly and super hot.  Everything tasted so nice and looked so clean.  

My experience was very positive even during these tough times."
4,"My mouth is watering just thinking about this place. The ramen noodles had so much body, but were so light at the same time, the broth was flavorful, and the pork belly was a true star of the show. The flavor was out of this word and melts in your mouth. The ramen was priced well for both quality and quantity, however the pork buns were very kind of expensive. 1 bun for $5 is steep for something that you can eat in 2-3 bites.

The gentleman that helped with my order was kind, but there was a lady who was running orders who was really rude. My friend and I sat at a table and she got mad. There was no &quot;reserved&quot; sign, and nobody said anything about how carry out worked. She was not pleasant at all. 

If you&apos;ve got a ramen craving (or even if you&apos;re not) this place will hit the spot. It&apos;s the perfect meal for lunch or dinner and carry out orders have great instructions on how to heat and handle them to get the best experience."
4,"When we visited, there was only outside dining due to CoVid regulations, and you had to make a reservation because there was a limited number of tables. The service was great! Our waitress was very friendly and even thought to ask us about any allergies. My husband has a shellfish allergy, so she was able to steer him in the correct direction regarding the ramen he should eat. 

I chose the fried chicken kimchi ramen which was delicious. I was worried that it would be too spicy, but it wasn&apos;t it, and it was really good. If you order any of the ramen entrees, make sure you are hungry, because all of them are enough for two meals. As a group, we shared the Berkshire dumplings and the Mantou Bun with Pork Belly. Both dishes were delicious, but the bun was amazing and almost enough food for a meal.

If you are interested in cocktails, I recommend the Pencillian #2."
4,"My boyfriend and I went to Chicago for a little couples vacation. After a night of drinking way to much Hennessy we decided to go for ramen for lunch since it&apos;s been a while since we&apos;ve had good ramen. On the Midwest anyway.... Jinya will always be my home favorite in Burbank CA. 
Anyway! The food!! It was so mouth watering I couldn&apos;t believe it. At first I thought it was weird and wasn&apos;t sure if I even wanted to order the kimchi and fried chicken. After reading the great reviews I had to try it. The place was cozy and welcoming the lighting was dim the employees in the front were so helpful to. The parking is shit so definitely DO NOT park across the street we seen a girl get towed because sometimes they don&apos;t allow it. We parked right in front per the waiter the safest place to park. 
We sat down and our waiter seemed like he just wanted us to rush ... weird. It got weirder. We literally had about 3-4 waiters/waitresses; didn&apos;t seem like they communicated that well with each other it was kind of all over the place. They rarely checked on us we had to flag them down. We ordered the kimchi fried chicken ramen and Sumo Ramen my boyfriend loved his until he tried mine and was like I&apos;m deff ordering that next time! We also had a house salad ... not that great loved how fresh the greens were the ginger dressing just seemed a bit off. We also had the sticky Thai chicken wings which were super delicious if you order them make sure you use your towelette after your hands get super sticky! Overall I loved the food didn&apos;t care for the customer service still tipped super well because hands down the ramen was SOOO good. The music is also super annoying we went about 1Pm on a Tuesday and the music was blasting as if I was in a house party. I&apos;m 28 not a old lady LOL not  exaggerating just was pretty annoying that me and my boyfriend were struggling the entire time for a conversation because we couldn&apos;t hear each other. 
Deff a must try! Get the kimchi fried chicken ramen you won&apos;t be disappointed!!"
5,"Great experience ! Good ramen and excellent service !
We do live in &quot;the new normal&quot; life - thank you for our waiter making a superb experience ! 
Loved Food !"
4,"I wasn&apos;t sure what I was expecting from this place. I&apos;ve had Lettuce Entertain You Ramen before from Tokio Pub so I was expecting roughly the same. I was thankfully incorrect as this food rocks (yes, I still love you Tokio Pub). 

We had a reservation and were promptly seated. My mom got a Yuzu Margarita. My dad got the Aschi beer and I had an Old Fashioned. All of our drinks were awesome, but special shout-out to my dads beer. I tried it and I was the real star. 

For appetizers, we got a little bit of everything. We were not sure on the fried chicken bun, but that was a huge surprise. It was crispy and had a nice spice. We also got the pork dumplings and chicken dumplings. The chicken dumplings were good, but the pork dumplings were really great! We finished the appetizers with the spicy Szechuan wings. It was a spice that was dry and snuck up on you. Still delicious! 

For our main course, we had the special crispy bacon ramen. It&apos;s around until the end of the month, but RUN to eat it. It was outstanding. It was so tasty! It was also huge! I got it with the Chili inside which gave a nice heat to it. The ramen already had a bit of a peppery kick so the chili might not have been needed. 

We finished up with a dessert of doughnuts with a Carmel vanilla dipping sauce. Heavenly! 

The only downside of the dinner was the environment. This is NOT a place for kids or families. I know that there are a lot of places like that, but not in LEYE. The seating was a bit restrictive and the music they play has quite a bit of swearing. I was there with my parents and felt a little weird, but It would be my scene with my friends! Our server was also fantastic so that&apos;s a big plus. 

In closing! I was floored by the quality of food at this place. I&apos;ll for sure be back, but with friends, not family :)"
5,"I&apos;m a pretty hard critique of Japanese ramen and to be honest, the ramen wasn&apos;t the best I&apos;ve had but I thoroughly enjoyed my overall experience here. The outdoor seating has a partially covered hut and heated lamps overhead the raised tables. Your legs will get chilly so I suggest bringing a blanket or scarf to wrap around your legs to stay warm if dining outside in the winter. Our waiter and staff were very efficient and polite - they visited often but not an annoying amount.  

I ordered the tonkatsu ramen and my boyfriend ordered the katsu tonkatsu (limited edition). Despite the weather being cold outside, our ramen came out very hot and stayed relatively hot until we finished our bowls. I believe the chasu in the tonkatsu was smoked - which was new to me. It surprisingly worked! It didn&apos;t look like a large quantity of meat but it was VERY dense. It filled me up pretty quickly. My ramen had too many bamboo shoots and wakame. I wish there was something light like mung bean sprouts to balance the heaviness and add some texture. The fried garlic was a GREAT addition  though - compliments to the chef on that one. 

The katsu tonkatsu had katsu sauce (like a sweet Japanese worchestire) and mustard wasabi. It significantly impacts the taste of the broth. It wasn&apos;t my cup of tea but my boyfriend enjoyed it. 

Giving this a 5 star because we were treated very well and had an overall good experience. Plus the many cute river north puppies walking by and saying hello put us in an especially good mood. 

Ramen-San is part of lettuce entertain you so make sure you have the app and collect points for dining in!"
4,"Walked in on the whim for lunch on a early Sunday afternoon. Was able to get a table right away. My bf and I both ordered the express lunch for $15.95, which included a ramen, a fried rice, a small salad and pickled cucumbers. Each item was a nicely sized portion and the food hit the spot. I&apos;d definitely recommend the express lunch route if it&apos;s available.

Service overall was attentive and friendly, but one person felt slightly pushy and should maybe reconsider his wording when asking us if we&apos;d like to try some Japanese whiskey instead of the &quot;well whiskey&quot; we originally ordered. The recommendation the first time around was fine, but his second attempt sounded pretty snarky and condescending. I&apos;m going to assume that wasn&apos;t his intention, but it def didn&apos;t encourage us to order more drinks."
3,"@BJH.  Thank you for the follow up.  When I&apos;m in Chicago next I will check in with you to see if the comments I made here have been resolved and will update this review. Thank you for taking the time to address my comments.  

A nice filling meal.  Chicago is not up there yet when it comes to Japanese restos. Los Angeles reigns supreme on Japanese food options on the mainland.  Still I&apos;m glad that Ramen-San exists albeit owned by Lettuce and not a Japan entity. 

First I had the vegan broth ramen.  It was good, the broth tepid, the tofu still cold in the middle.  

On a second visit I had the express lunch option with salmon over rice and small kimchee ramen with a &quot;molten&quot; egg. The broth was good, the &quot;molten&quot; egg was perfect but I only got a half an egg.  The salmon was bathed in sugary sweet sauce that was off putting.  It didn&apos;t go well with the kimchee ramen as next to it, I felt I was eating dessert over steamed rice. 

Loved the service, the outdoor eating options and the coo coo Captain America mugs."
4,"Chicago literally has the best food! The last time I came to Chicago I went to their sister restaurant sushi San which has amazing food. I love a great Ramen!
Due to Covid and the new mandate we had to sit outside, but luckily they had heating lamps and it was a very sunny day.

The Ramen had thick pork pieces that were so tender and juicy. The broth was so delicious, I wish I could eat about 3 bowls of it... lol. 

Ramen san definitely did not disappoint and I will definitely be coming back the next time I visit Chicago"
1,"Server was more concerned about us wearing masks than getting the order right. They completely messed up our order. Also, the seats are extremely uncomfortable wooden benches meant for little kids. Never going here again."
2,"Hate to do this. Excellent packaging, good enough service, no heating outside, and mediocre ramen. 

Try another spot or make instant."
5,"Chicago was cold sooo cold so my boyfriend and I were eager to get something warm in our tummies. Due to covid the wait was longer than expected even tho we had reservations, but the service and amazing food triumphed that small negative for me. The ramen....bruh the ramen was so freaking delicious. It&apos;s def a top two on my ramen list. The Penicillin # 2 wasn&apos;t too strong in my opinion, but still tasty. Because we had to wait longer than expected they offered us some complimentary hot donuts. I thought the gesture was very kind. Lowkey want to take a trip back up there to get back in on this goodness."
2,"I try to order from local spots 1-2x/week during the pandemic to support local businesses. It&apos;s a cold evening so ramen sounded good and I haven&apos;t ordered from Ramen-San yet. 

I ordered via Uber Eats for delivery because it was a little too far for pick up. It estimated 65-85 minutes which was okay and I can understand given it&apos;s a weekend evening. 

But it took over 2 hours to get my food. I watched the tracker and it was clear that the delay was due to the restaurant, not Uber. When I got it, it was ice cold. The fried chicken was soft and appeared to have been sitting for a long time - way longer than the 20 minutes from pick up to my door. Also, there were no utensils! What kind of ramen place doesn&apos;t give chop sticks with an order?!

The food was okay tasting - no better than other places I&apos;ve tried in the city. At the beginning of the pandemic I gave restaurants a lot of grace because of the pivots that most needed to make. But we are a year into this and an efficient delivery process should be in place so food isn&apos;t ice cold and basic utensils are given. With all the great food places in Chicago, probably won&apos;t come back."
4,My husband insisted on trying this spot after a recommendation from friends.  They did not steer us wrong. We tried a fried chicken bowl &amp; a miso bowl with an egg.  Extra noodles are a must my friends!  The broth....wow. Such depth that elevated the toppings. Will definitely try again in the future.
4,Pretty good place. Service was spot on. Server was kind and friendly. Food was tasty and serving size was appropriate. Nothing really beats a steaming hot bowl of ramen on a freezing night. Also got the miso Brussels sprouts but found them a touch too salty but still good. Will come back to try more.
5,"We sample a little everything...drinks, wings, Brussels sprouts, ramen and salad. All delicious!"
4,"Took Ramen-San to go on a rainy night for some comfort food. Super easy to pick up and the ramen toppings were packaged separately from the broth so sogginess was not an issue. 

I ordered the Tonkatsu ramen, the Kimchi Fried Chicken ramen, and the sticky Thai chicken wings. The Tonkatsu was overall really delicious and the broth was on point. I&apos;d definitely order this a second time! The Kimchi Fried Chicken ramen broth was nice and spicy, the chicken pieces were large, but the noodles were a little crusty. I would describe the ramen dishes as mainstream, but they still keep most of the traditional elements of an authentic ramen bowl."
4,"I came here with a party of 4 during the COVID pandemic and appreciated how well organized and accommodating the staff was during these interesting times! This is one of the limited indoor/outdoor dining places outside of Chicago and our party really appreciated the time and effort this restaurant put in! 
The hot broth, hot sake, on a cold winter night in Chicago, how can you go wrong? 
To start we order the karaage chicken with ailoi and it&apos;s perfect to start without getting yourself too full. We ended up ordering ordering 2 orders because of the sides, but this was because we were blinded on the sizes of the ramen! Which is a great segway to: 
The Ramen:
You can&apos;t go wrong with the toncatshu ramen, comes with a soft-boil egg and pork belly! The rest of the group ordered the spicy ramen and apparently it was just as spicy as our waiter warned us. So if you&apos;re not into spice, please double check with your waiter! 
The broth was perfect and creamy, not too overwhelming to the point where you can&apos;t drink it by itself. The egg noodles was fresh and plentiful! If you want you can order a refill, but I barely finished my first serving. 
The pork belly was fresh and nicely fried and made a great compliant with the soft-boiled egg. 
All in all I can say, the next time I&apos;m in Chicago, I will be sure to make a ramen stop here, especially with the weather and location of the restaurant! 
Great job Ramen-San"
3,"Karraage chicken (chicken nuggets) - my Fiancé enjoyed these. They were lightly battered and lightly seasoned as well.

Raw tuna- this was delicious! The tuna and avocado were fresh &amp; completed each other. The chip it was a little too salty for me but it was still enjoyable! 

Buns 
Fried chicken buns- was not a fan of the horseradish in it. I felt like it over powered the flavor of the chicken and had too much in mine. 

Chicken wings 
Spicy Szechuan- this was dry rub and had a great sauce to go with it. I would have liked a little more flavor in these wings otherwise I probably would not get this again. 

Sticky Thai- these were wet and flavorful definitely enjoyed these more than the Szechuan 

Dumpling
Crispy Berkshire- these were crispy and had a decent amount of meat in the dumpling. 

Ramen 
Kimchi &amp; fried chicken- first time trying fried chicken ramen and was not a fan. I will definitely be sticking to my regular pork. The noddles were also harder than usual, it might have needed to be cooked for longer 

Drinks 
Yuzu margarita- this was refreshing and decent

yuzu Saki- very sweet with a strong taste of lemon and grapefruit"

Kimchi &amp; fried chicken- first time trying fried chicken ramen and was not a fan. I will definitely be sticking to my regular pork. The noddles were also harder than usual, it might have needed to be cooked for longer 

Drinks 
Yuzu margarita- this was refreshing and decent

yuzu Saki- very sweet with a strong taste of lemon and grapefruit"
5,"I had an appointment downtown and it was cold out!  I&apos;ve been meaning to try this place for quite some time.  Eating out during Covid times are quite different.  Ramen SAN take no chances.  The place was immaculate and they take your temperature at the entrance.  The social distancing tables are far enough apart and quite safe.  The staff wears masks and gloves and there&apos;s sanitizer there for you.  

As for the food, I tried the chicken and vegetable Gyoza and the Imperial Shio.  The food came out quickly and super hot.  Everything tasted so nice and looked so clean.  

My experience was very positive even during these tough times."
4,"My mouth is watering just thinking about this place. The ramen noodles had so much body, but were so light at the same time, the broth was flavorful, and the pork belly was a true star of the show. The flavor was out of this word and melts in your mouth. The ramen was priced well for both quality and quantity, however the pork buns were very kind of expensive. 1 bun for $5 is steep for something that you can eat in 2-3 bites.

The gentleman that helped with my order was kind, but there was a lady who was running orders who was really rude. My friend and I sat at a table and she got mad. There was no &quot;reserved&quot; sign, and nobody said anything about how carry out worked. She was not pleasant at all. 

If you&apos;ve got a ramen craving (or even if you&apos;re not) this place will hit the spot. It&apos;s the perfect meal for lunch or dinner and carry out orders have great instructions on how to heat and handle them to get the best experience."
4,"When we visited, there was only outside dining due to CoVid regulations, and you had to make a reservation because there was a limited number of tables. The service was great! Our waitress was very friendly and even thought to ask us about any allergies. My husband has a shellfish allergy, so she was able to steer him in the correct direction regarding the ramen he should eat. 

I chose the fried chicken kimchi ramen which was delicious. I was worried that it would be too spicy, but it wasn&apos;t it, and it was really good. If you order any of the ramen entrees, make sure you are hungry, because all of them are enough for two meals. As a group, we shared the Berkshire dumplings and the Mantou Bun with Pork Belly. Both dishes were delicious, but the bun was amazing and almost enough food for a meal.

If you are interested in cocktails, I recommend the Pencillian #2."
4,"My boyfriend and I went to Chicago for a little couples vacation. After a night of drinking way to much Hennessy we decided to go for ramen for lunch since it&apos;s been a while since we&apos;ve had good ramen. On the Midwest anyway.... Jinya will always be my home favorite in Burbank CA. 
Anyway! The food!! It was so mouth watering I couldn&apos;t believe it. At first I thought it was weird and wasn&apos;t sure if I even wanted to order the kimchi and fried chicken. After reading the great reviews I had to try it. The place was cozy and welcoming the lighting was dim the employees in the front were so helpful to. The parking is shit so definitely DO NOT park across the street we seen a girl get towed because sometimes they don&apos;t allow it. We parked right in front per the waiter the safest place to park. 
We sat down and our waiter seemed like he just wanted us to rush ... weird. It got weirder. We literally had about 3-4 waiters/waitresses; didn&apos;t seem like they communicated that well with each other it was kind of all over the place. They rarely checked on us we had to flag them down. We ordered the kimchi fried chicken ramen and Sumo Ramen my boyfriend loved his until he tried mine and was like I&apos;m deff ordering that next time! We also had a house salad ... not that great loved how fresh the greens were the ginger dressing just seemed a bit off. We also had the sticky Thai chicken wings which were super delicious if you order them make sure you use your towelette after your hands get super sticky! Overall I loved the food didn&apos;t care for the customer service still tipped super well because hands down the ramen was SOOO good. The music is also super annoying we went about 1Pm on a Tuesday and the music was blasting as if I was in a house party. I&apos;m 28 not a old lady LOL not  exaggerating just was pretty annoying that me and my boyfriend were struggling the entire time for a conversation because we couldn&apos;t hear each other. 
Deff a must try! Get the kimchi fried chicken ramen you won&apos;t be disappointed!!"
5,"Great experience ! Good ramen and excellent service !
We do live in &quot;the new normal&quot; life - thank you for our waiter making a superb experience ! 
Loved Food !"
4,"I wasn&apos;t sure what I was expecting from this place. I&apos;ve had Lettuce Entertain You Ramen before from Tokio Pub so I was expecting roughly the same. I was thankfully incorrect as this food rocks (yes, I still love you Tokio Pub). 

We had a reservation and were promptly seated. My mom got a Yuzu Margarita. My dad got the Aschi beer and I had an Old Fashioned. All of our drinks were awesome, but special shout-out to my dads beer. I tried it and I was the real star. 

For appetizers, we got a little bit of everything. We were not sure on the fried chicken bun, but that was a huge surprise. It was crispy and had a nice spice. We also got the pork dumplings and chicken dumplings. The chicken dumplings were good, but the pork dumplings were really great! We finished the appetizers with the spicy Szechuan wings. It was a spice that was dry and snuck up on you. Still delicious! 

For our main course, we had the special crispy bacon ramen. It&apos;s around until the end of the month, but RUN to eat it. It was outstanding. It was so tasty! It was also huge! I got it with the Chili inside which gave a nice heat to it. The ramen already had a bit of a peppery kick so the chili might not have been needed. 

We finished up with a dessert of doughnuts with a Carmel vanilla dipping sauce. Heavenly! 

The only downside of the dinner was the environment. This is NOT a place for kids or families. I know that there are a lot of places like that, but not in LEYE. The seating was a bit restrictive and the music they play has quite a bit of swearing. I was there with my parents and felt a little weird, but It would be my scene with my friends! Our server was also fantastic so that&apos;s a big plus. 

In closing! I was floored by the quality of food at this place. I&apos;ll for sure be back, but with friends, not family :)"
5,"I&apos;m a pretty hard critique of Japanese ramen and to be honest, the ramen wasn&apos;t the best I&apos;ve had but I thoroughly enjoyed my overall experience here. The outdoor seating has a partially covered hut and heated lamps overhead the raised tables. Your legs will get chilly so I suggest bringing a blanket or scarf to wrap around your legs to stay warm if dining outside in the winter. Our waiter and staff were very efficient and polite - they visited often but not an annoying amount.  

I ordered the tonkatsu ramen and my boyfriend ordered the katsu tonkatsu (limited edition). Despite the weather being cold outside, our ramen came out very hot and stayed relatively hot until we finished our bowls. I believe the chasu in the tonkatsu was smoked - which was new to me. It surprisingly worked! It didn&apos;t look like a large quantity of meat but it was VERY dense. It filled me up pretty quickly. My ramen had too many bamboo shoots and wakame. I wish there was something light like mung bean sprouts to balance the heaviness and add some texture. The fried garlic was a GREAT addition  though - compliments to the chef on that one. 

The katsu tonkatsu had katsu sauce (like a sweet Japanese worchestire) and mustard wasabi. It significantly impacts the taste of the broth. It wasn&apos;t my cup of tea but my boyfriend enjoyed it. 

Giving this a 5 star because we were treated very well and had an overall good experience. Plus the many cute river north puppies walking by and saying hello put us in an especially good mood. 

Ramen-San is part of lettuce entertain you so make sure you have the app and collect points for dining in!"
4,"Walked in on the whim for lunch on a early Sunday afternoon. Was able to get a table right away. My bf and I both ordered the express lunch for $15.95, which included a ramen, a fried rice, a small salad and pickled cucumbers. Each item was a nicely sized portion and the food hit the spot. I&apos;d definitely recommend the express lunch route if it&apos;s available.

Service overall was attentive and friendly, but one person felt slightly pushy and should maybe reconsider his wording when asking us if we&apos;d like to try some Japanese whiskey instead of the &quot;well whiskey&quot; we originally ordered. The recommendation the first time around was fine, but his second attempt sounded pretty snarky and condescending. I&apos;m going to assume that wasn&apos;t his intention, but it def didn&apos;t encourage us to order more drinks."
3,"@BJH.  Thank you for the follow up.  When I&apos;m in Chicago next I will check in with you to see if the comments I made here have been resolved and will update this review. Thank you for taking the time to address my comments.  

A nice filling meal.  Chicago is not up there yet when it comes to Japanese restos. Los Angeles reigns supreme on Japanese food options on the mainland.  Still I&apos;m glad that Ramen-San exists albeit owned by Lettuce and not a Japan entity. 

First I had the vegan broth ramen.  It was good, the broth tepid, the tofu still cold in the middle.  

On a second visit I had the express lunch option with salmon over rice and small kimchee ramen with a &quot;molten&quot; egg. The broth was good, the &quot;molten&quot; egg was perfect but I only got a half an egg.  The salmon was bathed in sugary sweet sauce that was off putting.  It didn&apos;t go well with the kimchee ramen as next to it, I felt I was eating dessert over steamed rice. 

Loved the service, the outdoor eating options and the coo coo Captain America mugs."
4,"Chicago literally has the best food! The last time I came to Chicago I went to their sister restaurant sushi San which has amazing food. I love a great Ramen!
Due to Covid and the new mandate we had to sit outside, but luckily they had heating lamps and it was a very sunny day.

The Ramen had thick pork pieces that were so tender and juicy. The broth was so delicious, I wish I could eat about 3 bowls of it... lol. 

Ramen san definitely did not disappoint and I will definitely be coming back the next time I visit Chicago"
1,"Server was more concerned about us wearing masks than getting the order right. They completely messed up our order. Also, the seats are extremely uncomfortable wooden benches meant for little kids. Never going here again."
2,"Hate to do this. Excellent packaging, good enough service, no heating outside, and mediocre ramen. 

Try another spot or make instant."
5,"Chicago was cold sooo cold so my boyfriend and I were eager to get something warm in our tummies. Due to covid the wait was longer than expected even tho we had reservations, but the service and amazing food triumphed that small negative for me. The ramen....bruh the ramen was so freaking delicious. It&apos;s def a top two on my ramen list. The Penicillin # 2 wasn&apos;t too strong in my opinion, but still tasty. Because we had to wait longer than expected they offered us some complimentary hot donuts. I thought the gesture was very kind. Lowkey want to take a trip back up there to get back in on this goodness."
2,"I try to order from local spots 1-2x/week during the pandemic to support local businesses. It&apos;s a cold evening so ramen sounded good and I haven&apos;t ordered from Ramen-San yet. 

I ordered via Uber Eats for delivery because it was a little too far for pick up. It estimated 65-85 minutes which was okay and I can understand given it&apos;s a weekend evening. 

But it took over 2 hours to get my food. I watched the tracker and it was clear that the delay was due to the restaurant, not Uber. When I got it, it was ice cold. The fried chicken was soft and appeared to have been sitting for a long time - way longer than the 20 minutes from pick up to my door. Also, there were no utensils! What kind of ramen place doesn&apos;t give chop sticks with an order?!

The food was okay tasting - no better than other places I&apos;ve tried in the city. At the beginning of the pandemic I gave restaurants a lot of grace because of the pivots that most needed to make. But we are a year into this and an efficient delivery process should be in place so food isn&apos;t ice cold and basic utensils are given. With all the great food places in Chicago, probably won&apos;t come back."
4,My husband insisted on trying this spot after a recommendation from friends.  They did not steer us wrong. We tried a fried chicken bowl &amp; a miso bowl with an egg.  Extra noodles are a must my friends!  The broth....wow. Such depth that elevated the toppings. Will definitely try again in the future.
4,Pretty good place. Service was spot on. Server was kind and friendly. Food was tasty and serving size was appropriate. Nothing really beats a steaming hot bowl of ramen on a freezing night. Also got the miso Brussels sprouts but found them a touch too salty but still good. Will come back to try more.
5,"We sample a little everything...drinks, wings, Brussels sprouts, ramen and salad. All delicious!"
4,"Took Ramen-San to go on a rainy night for some comfort food. Super easy to pick up and the ramen toppings were packaged separately from the broth so sogginess was not an issue. 

I ordered the Tonkatsu ramen, the Kimchi Fried Chicken ramen, and the sticky Thai chicken wings. The Tonkatsu was overall really delicious and the broth was on point. I&apos;d definitely order this a second time! The Kimchi Fried Chicken ramen broth was nice and spicy, the chicken pieces were large, but the noodles were a little crusty. I would describe the ramen dishes as mainstream, but they still keep most of the traditional elements of an authentic ramen bowl."
4,"I came here with a party of 4 during the COVID pandemic and appreciated how well organized and accommodating the staff was during these interesting times! This is one of the limited indoor/outdoor dining places outside of Chicago and our party really appreciated the time and effort this restaurant put in! 
The hot broth, hot sake, on a cold winter night in Chicago, how can you go wrong? 
To start we order the karaage chicken with ailoi and it&apos;s perfect to start without getting yourself too full. We ended up ordering ordering 2 orders because of the sides, but this was because we were blinded on the sizes of the ramen! Which is a great segway to: 
The Ramen:
You can&apos;t go wrong with the toncatshu ramen, comes with a soft-boil egg and pork belly! The rest of the group ordered the spicy ramen and apparently it was just as spicy as our waiter warned us. So if you&apos;re not into spice, please double check with your waiter! 
The broth was perfect and creamy, not too overwhelming to the point where you can&apos;t drink it by itself. The egg noodles was fresh and plentiful! If you want you can order a refill, but I barely finished my first serving. 
The pork belly was fresh and nicely fried and made a great compliant with the soft-boiled egg. 
All in all I can say, the next time I&apos;m in Chicago, I will be sure to make a ramen stop here, especially with the weather and location of the restaurant! 
Great job Ramen-San"
3,"Karraage chicken (chicken nuggets) - my Fiancé enjoyed these. They were lightly battered and lightly seasoned as well.

Raw tuna- this was delicious! The tuna and avocado were fresh &amp; completed each other. The chip it was a little too salty for me but it was still enjoyable! 

Buns 
Fried chicken buns- was not a fan of the horseradish in it. I felt like it over powered the flavor of the chicken and had too much in mine. 

Chicken wings 
Spicy Szechuan- this was dry rub and had a great sauce to go with it. I would have liked a little more flavor in these wings otherwise I probably would not get this again. 

Sticky Thai- these were wet and flavorful definitely enjoyed these more than the Szechuan 

Dumpling
Crispy Berkshire- these were crispy and had a decent amount of meat in the dumpling. 

Ramen

Spicy Szechuan- this was dry rub and had a great sauce to go with it. I would have liked a little more flavor in these wings otherwise I probably would not get this again. 

Sticky Thai- these were wet and flavorful definitely enjoyed these more than the Szechuan 

Dumpling
Crispy Berkshire- these were crispy and had a decent amount of meat in the dumpling. 

Ramen 
Kimchi &amp; fried chicken- first time trying fried chicken ramen and was not a fan. I will definitely be sticking to my regular pork. The noddles were also harder than usual, it might have needed to be cooked for longer 

Drinks 
Yuzu margarita- this was refreshing and decent

yuzu Saki- very sweet with a strong taste of lemon and grapefruit"
5,"I had an appointment downtown and it was cold out!  I&apos;ve been meaning to try this place for quite some time.  Eating out during Covid times are quite different.  Ramen SAN take no chances.  The place was immaculate and they take your temperature at the entrance.  The social distancing tables are far enough apart and quite safe.  The staff wears masks and gloves and there&apos;s sanitizer there for you.  

As for the food, I tried the chicken and vegetable Gyoza and the Imperial Shio.  The food came out quickly and super hot.  Everything tasted so nice and looked so clean.  

My experience was very positive even during these tough times."
4,"My mouth is watering just thinking about this place. The ramen noodles had so much body, but were so light at the same time, the broth was flavorful, and the pork belly was a true star of the show. The flavor was out of this word and melts in your mouth. The ramen was priced well for both quality and quantity, however the pork buns were very kind of expensive. 1 bun for $5 is steep for something that you can eat in 2-3 bites.

The gentleman that helped with my order was kind, but there was a lady who was running orders who was really rude. My friend and I sat at a table and she got mad. There was no &quot;reserved&quot; sign, and nobody said anything about how carry out worked. She was not pleasant at all. 

If you&apos;ve got a ramen craving (or even if you&apos;re not) this place will hit the spot. It&apos;s the perfect meal for lunch or dinner and carry out orders have great instructions on how to heat and handle them to get the best experience."
4,"When we visited, there was only outside dining due to CoVid regulations, and you had to make a reservation because there was a limited number of tables. The service was great! Our waitress was very friendly and even thought to ask us about any allergies. My husband has a shellfish allergy, so she was able to steer him in the correct direction regarding the ramen he should eat. 

I chose the fried chicken kimchi ramen which was delicious. I was worried that it would be too spicy, but it wasn&apos;t it, and it was really good. If you order any of the ramen entrees, make sure you are hungry, because all of them are enough for two meals. As a group, we shared the Berkshire dumplings and the Mantou Bun with Pork Belly. Both dishes were delicious, but the bun was amazing and almost enough food for a meal.

If you are interested in cocktails, I recommend the Pencillian #2."
4,"My boyfriend and I went to Chicago for a little couples vacation. After a night of drinking way to much Hennessy we decided to go for ramen for lunch since it&apos;s been a while since we&apos;ve had good ramen. On the Midwest anyway.... Jinya will always be my home favorite in Burbank CA. 
Anyway! The food!! It was so mouth watering I couldn&apos;t believe it. At first I thought it was weird and wasn&apos;t sure if I even wanted to order the kimchi and fried chicken. After reading the great reviews I had to try it. The place was cozy and welcoming the lighting was dim the employees in the front were so helpful to. The parking is shit so definitely DO NOT park across the street we seen a girl get towed because sometimes they don&apos;t allow it. We parked right in front per the waiter the safest place to park. 
We sat down and our waiter seemed like he just wanted us to rush ... weird. It got weirder. We literally had about 3-4 waiters/waitresses; didn&apos;t seem like they communicated that well with each other it was kind of all over the place. They rarely checked on us we had to flag them down. We ordered the kimchi fried chicken ramen and Sumo Ramen my boyfriend loved his until he tried mine and was like I&apos;m deff ordering that next time! We also had a house salad ... not that great loved how fresh the greens were the ginger dressing just seemed a bit off. We also had the sticky Thai chicken wings which were super delicious if you order them make sure you use your towelette after your hands get super sticky! Overall I loved the food didn&apos;t care for the customer service still tipped super well because hands down the ramen was SOOO good. The music is also super annoying we went about 1Pm on a Tuesday and the music was blasting as if I was in a house party. I&apos;m 28 not a old lady LOL not  exaggerating just was pretty annoying that me and my boyfriend were struggling the entire time for a conversation because we couldn&apos;t hear each other. 
Deff a must try! Get the kimchi fried chicken ramen you won&apos;t be disappointed!!"
5,"Great experience ! Good ramen and excellent service !
We do live in &quot;the new normal&quot; life - thank you for our waiter making a superb experience ! 
Loved Food !"
4,"I wasn&apos;t sure what I was expecting from this place. I&apos;ve had Lettuce Entertain You Ramen before from Tokio Pub so I was expecting roughly the same. I was thankfully incorrect as this food rocks (yes, I still love you Tokio Pub). 

We had a reservation and were promptly seated. My mom got a Yuzu Margarita. My dad got the Aschi beer and I had an Old Fashioned. All of our drinks were awesome, but special shout-out to my dads beer. I tried it and I was the real star. 

For appetizers, we got a little bit of everything. We were not sure on the fried chicken bun, but that was a huge surprise. It was crispy and had a nice spice. We also got the pork dumplings and chicken dumplings. The chicken dumplings were good, but the pork dumplings were really great! We finished the appetizers with the spicy Szechuan wings. It was a spice that was dry and snuck up on you. Still delicious! 

For our main course, we had the special crispy bacon ramen. It&apos;s around until the end of the month, but RUN to eat it. It was outstanding. It was so tasty! It was also huge! I got it with the Chili inside which gave a nice heat to it. The ramen already had a bit of a peppery kick so the chili might not have been needed. 

We finished up with a dessert of doughnuts with a Carmel vanilla dipping sauce. Heavenly! 

The only downside of the dinner was the environment. This is NOT a place for kids or families. I know that there are a lot of places like that, but not in LEYE. The seating was a bit restrictive and the music they play has quite a bit of swearing. I was there with my parents and felt a little weird, but It would be my scene with my friends! Our server was also fantastic so that&apos;s a big plus. 

In closing! I was floored by the quality of food at this place. I&apos;ll for sure be back, but with friends, not family :)"
5,"I&apos;m a pretty hard critique of Japanese ramen and to be honest, the ramen wasn&apos;t the best I&apos;ve had but I thoroughly enjoyed my overall experience here. The outdoor seating has a partially covered hut and heated lamps overhead the raised tables. Your legs will get chilly so I suggest bringing a blanket or scarf to wrap around your legs to stay warm if dining outside in the winter. Our waiter and staff were very efficient and polite - they visited often but not an annoying amount.  

I ordered the tonkatsu ramen and my boyfriend ordered the katsu tonkatsu (limited edition). Despite the weather being cold outside, our ramen came out very hot and stayed relatively hot until we finished our bowls. I believe the chasu in the tonkatsu was smoked - which was new to me. It surprisingly worked! It didn&apos;t look like a large quantity of meat but it was VERY dense. It filled me up pretty quickly. My ramen had too many bamboo shoots and wakame. I wish there was something light like mung bean sprouts to balance the heaviness and add some texture. The fried garlic was a GREAT addition  though - compliments to the chef on that one. 

The katsu tonkatsu had katsu sauce (like a sweet Japanese worchestire) and mustard wasabi. It significantly impacts the taste of the broth. It wasn&apos;t my cup of tea but my boyfriend enjoyed it. 

Giving this a 5 star because we were treated very well and had an overall good experience. Plus the many cute river north puppies walking by and saying hello put us in an especially good mood. 

Ramen-San is part of lettuce entertain you so make sure you have the app and collect points for dining in!"
4,"Walked in on the whim for lunch on a early Sunday afternoon. Was able to get a table right away. My bf and I both ordered the express lunch for $15.95, which included a ramen, a fried rice, a small salad and pickled cucumbers. Each item was a nicely sized portion and the food hit the spot. I&apos;d definitely recommend the express lunch route if it&apos;s available.

Service overall was attentive and friendly, but one person felt slightly pushy and should maybe reconsider his wording when asking us if we&apos;d like to try some Japanese whiskey instead of the &quot;well whiskey&quot; we originally ordered. The recommendation the first time around was fine, but his second attempt sounded pretty snarky and condescending. I&apos;m going to assume that wasn&apos;t his intention, but it def didn&apos;t encourage us to order more drinks."
3,"@BJH.  Thank you for the follow up.  When I&apos;m in Chicago next I will check in with you to see if the comments I made here have been resolved and will update this review. Thank you for taking the time to address my comments.  

A nice filling meal.  Chicago is not up there yet when it comes to Japanese restos. Los Angeles reigns supreme on Japanese food options on the mainland.  Still I&apos;m glad that Ramen-San exists albeit owned by Lettuce and not a Japan entity. 

First I had the vegan broth ramen.  It was good, the broth tepid, the tofu still cold in the middle.  

On a second visit I had the express lunch option with salmon over rice and small kimchee ramen with a &quot;molten&quot; egg. The broth was good, the &quot;molten&quot; egg was perfect but I only got a half an egg.  The salmon was bathed in sugary sweet sauce that was off putting.  It didn&apos;t go well with the kimchee ramen as next to it, I felt I was eating dessert over steamed rice. 

Loved the service, the outdoor eating options and the coo coo Captain America mugs."
4,"Chicago literally has the best food! The last time I came to Chicago I went to their sister restaurant sushi San which has amazing food. I love a great Ramen!
Due to Covid and the new mandate we had to sit outside, but luckily they had heating lamps and it was a very sunny day.

The Ramen had thick pork pieces that were so tender and juicy. The broth was so delicious, I wish I could eat about 3 bowls of it... lol. 

Ramen san definitely did not disappoint and I will definitely be coming back the next time I visit Chicago"
1,"Server was more concerned about us wearing masks than getting the order right. They completely messed up our order. Also, the seats are extremely uncomfortable wooden benches meant for little kids. Never going here again."
2,"Hate to do this. Excellent packaging, good enough service, no heating outside, and mediocre ramen. 

Try another spot or make instant."
5,"Chicago was cold sooo cold so my boyfriend and I were eager to get something warm in our tummies. Due to covid the wait was longer than expected even tho we had reservations, but the service and amazing food triumphed that small negative for me. The ramen....bruh the ramen was so freaking delicious. It&apos;s def a top two on my ramen list. The Penicillin # 2 wasn&apos;t too strong in my opinion, but still tasty. Because we had to wait longer than expected they offered us some complimentary hot donuts. I thought the gesture was very kind. Lowkey want to take a trip back up there to get back in on this goodness."
2,"I try to order from local spots 1-2x/week during the pandemic to support local businesses. It&apos;s a cold evening so ramen sounded good and I haven&apos;t ordered from Ramen-San yet. 

I ordered via Uber Eats for delivery because it was a little too far for pick up. It estimated 65-85 minutes which was okay and I can understand given it&apos;s a weekend evening. 

But it took over 2 hours to get my food. I watched the tracker and it was clear that the delay was due to the restaurant, not Uber. When I got it, it was ice cold. The fried chicken was soft and appeared to have been sitting for a long time - way longer than the 20 minutes from pick up to my door. Also, there were no utensils! What kind of ramen place doesn&apos;t give chop sticks with an order?!

The food was okay tasting - no better than other places I&apos;ve tried in the city. At the beginning of the pandemic I gave restaurants a lot of grace because of the pivots that most needed to make. But we are a year into this and an efficient delivery process should be in place so food isn&apos;t ice cold and basic utensils are given. With all the great food places in Chicago, probably won&apos;t come back."
4,My husband insisted on trying this spot after a recommendation from friends.  They did not steer us wrong. We tried a fried chicken bowl &amp; a miso bowl with an egg.  Extra noodles are a must my friends!  The broth....wow. Such depth that elevated the toppings. Will definitely try again in the future.
4,Pretty good place. Service was spot on. Server was kind and friendly. Food was tasty and serving size was appropriate. Nothing really beats a steaming hot bowl of ramen on a freezing night. Also got the miso Brussels sprouts but found them a touch too salty but still good. Will come back to try more.
5,"We sample a little everything...drinks, wings, Brussels sprouts, ramen and salad. All delicious!"
4,"Took Ramen-San to go on a rainy night for some comfort food. Super easy to pick up and the ramen toppings were packaged separately from the broth so sogginess was not an issue. 

I ordered the Tonkatsu ramen, the Kimchi Fried Chicken ramen, and the sticky Thai chicken wings. The Tonkatsu was overall really delicious and the broth was on point. I&apos;d definitely order this a second time! The Kimchi Fried Chicken ramen broth was nice and spicy, the chicken pieces were large, but the noodles were a little crusty. I would describe the ramen dishes as mainstream, but they still keep most of the traditional elements of an authentic ramen bowl."
4,"I came here with a party of 4 during the COVID pandemic and appreciated how well organized and accommodating the staff was during these interesting times! This is one of the limited indoor/outdoor dining places outside of Chicago and our party really appreciated the time and effort this restaurant put in! 
The hot broth, hot sake, on a cold winter night in Chicago, how can you go wrong? 
To start we order the karaage chicken with ailoi and it&apos;s perfect to start without getting yourself too full. We ended up ordering ordering 2 orders because of the sides, but this was because we were blinded on the sizes of the ramen! Which is a great segway to: 
The Ramen:
You can&apos;t go wrong with the toncatshu ramen, comes with a soft-boil egg and pork belly! The rest of the group ordered the spicy ramen and apparently it was just as spicy as our waiter warned us. So if you&apos;re not into spice, please double check with your waiter! 
The broth was perfect and creamy, not too overwhelming to the point where you can&apos;t drink it by itself. The egg noodles was fresh and plentiful! If you want you can order a refill, but I barely finished my first serving. 
The pork belly was fresh and nicely fried and made a great compliant with the soft-boiled egg. 
All in all I can say, the next time I&apos;m in Chicago, I will be sure to make a ramen stop here, especially with the weather and location of the restaurant! 
Great job Ramen-San"
3,"Karraage chicken (chicken nuggets) - my Fiancé enjoyed these. They were lightly battered and lightly seasoned as well.

Raw tuna- this was delicious! The tuna and avocado were fresh &amp; completed each other. The chip it was a little too salty for me but it was still enjoyable!

Raw tuna- this was delicious! The tuna and avocado were fresh &amp; completed each other. The chip it was a little too salty for me but it was still enjoyable! 

Buns 
Fried chicken buns- was not a fan of the horseradish in it. I felt like it over powered the flavor of the chicken and had too much in mine. 

Chicken wings 
Spicy Szechuan- this was dry rub and had a great sauce to go with it. I would have liked a little more flavor in these wings otherwise I probably would not get this again. 

Sticky Thai- these were wet and flavorful definitely enjoyed these more than the Szechuan 

Dumpling
Crispy Berkshire- these were crispy and had a decent amount of meat in the dumpling. 

Ramen 
Kimchi &amp; fried chicken- first time trying fried chicken ramen and was not a fan. I will definitely be sticking to my regular pork. The noddles were also harder than usual, it might have needed to be cooked for longer 

Drinks 
Yuzu margarita- this was refreshing and decent

yuzu Saki- very sweet with a strong taste of lemon and grapefruit"
5,"I had an appointment downtown and it was cold out!  I&apos;ve been meaning to try this place for quite some time.  Eating out during Covid times are quite different.  Ramen SAN take no chances.  The place was immaculate and they take your temperature at the entrance.  The social distancing tables are far enough apart and quite safe.  The staff wears masks and gloves and there&apos;s sanitizer there for you.  

As for the food, I tried the chicken and vegetable Gyoza and the Imperial Shio.  The food came out quickly and super hot.  Everything tasted so nice and looked so clean.  

My experience was very positive even during these tough times."
4,"My mouth is watering just thinking about this place. The ramen noodles had so much body, but were so light at the same time, the broth was flavorful, and the pork belly was a true star of the show. The flavor was out of this word and melts in your mouth. The ramen was priced well for both quality and quantity, however the pork buns were very kind of expensive. 1 bun for $5 is steep for something that you can eat in 2-3 bites.

The gentleman that helped with my order was kind, but there was a lady who was running orders who was really rude. My friend and I sat at a table and she got mad. There was no &quot;reserved&quot; sign, and nobody said anything about how carry out worked. She was not pleasant at all. 

If you&apos;ve got a ramen craving (or even if you&apos;re not) this place will hit the spot. It&apos;s the perfect meal for lunch or dinner and carry out orders have great instructions on how to heat and handle them to get the best experience."
4,"When we visited, there was only outside dining due to CoVid regulations, and you had to make a reservation because there was a limited number of tables. The service was great! Our waitress was very friendly and even thought to ask us about any allergies. My husband has a shellfish allergy, so she was able to steer him in the correct direction regarding the ramen he should eat. 

I chose the fried chicken kimchi ramen which was delicious. I was worried that it would be too spicy, but it wasn&apos;t it, and it was really good. If you order any of the ramen entrees, make sure you are hungry, because all of them are enough for two meals. As a group, we shared the Berkshire dumplings and the Mantou Bun with Pork Belly. Both dishes were delicious, but the bun was amazing and almost enough food for a meal.

If you are interested in cocktails, I recommend the Pencillian #2."
4,"My boyfriend and I went to Chicago for a little couples vacation. After a night of drinking way to much Hennessy we decided to go for ramen for lunch since it&apos;s been a while since we&apos;ve had good ramen. On the Midwest anyway.... Jinya will always be my home favorite in Burbank CA. 
Anyway! The food!! It was so mouth watering I couldn&apos;t believe it. At first I thought it was weird and wasn&apos;t sure if I even wanted to order the kimchi and fried chicken. After reading the great reviews I had to try it. The place was cozy and welcoming the lighting was dim the employees in the front were so helpful to. The parking is shit so definitely DO NOT park across the street we seen a girl get towed because sometimes they don&apos;t allow it. We parked right in front per the waiter the safest place to park. 
We sat down and our waiter seemed like he just wanted us to rush ... weird. It got weirder. We literally had about 3-4 waiters/waitresses; didn&apos;t seem like they communicated that well with each other it was kind of all over the place. They rarely checked on us we had to flag them down. We ordered the kimchi fried chicken ramen and Sumo Ramen my boyfriend loved his until he tried mine and was like I&apos;m deff ordering that next time! We also had a house salad ... not that great loved how fresh the greens were the ginger dressing just seemed a bit off. We also had the sticky Thai chicken wings which were super delicious if you order them make sure you use your towelette after your hands get super sticky! Overall I loved the food didn&apos;t care for the customer service still tipped super well because hands down the ramen was SOOO good. The music is also super annoying we went about 1Pm on a Tuesday and the music was blasting as if I was in a house party. I&apos;m 28 not a old lady LOL not  exaggerating just was pretty annoying that me and my boyfriend were struggling the entire time for a conversation because we couldn&apos;t hear each other. 
Deff a must try! Get the kimchi fried chicken ramen you won&apos;t be disappointed!!"
5,"Great experience ! Good ramen and excellent service !
We do live in &quot;the new normal&quot; life - thank you for our waiter making a superb experience ! 
Loved Food !"
4,"I wasn&apos;t sure what I was expecting from this place. I&apos;ve had Lettuce Entertain You Ramen before from Tokio Pub so I was expecting roughly the same. I was thankfully incorrect as this food rocks (yes, I still love you Tokio Pub). 

We had a reservation and were promptly seated. My mom got a Yuzu Margarita. My dad got the Aschi beer and I had an Old Fashioned. All of our drinks were awesome, but special shout-out to my dads beer. I tried it and I was the real star. 

For appetizers, we got a little bit of everything. We were not sure on the fried chicken bun, but that was a huge surprise. It was crispy and had a nice spice. We also got the pork dumplings and chicken dumplings. The chicken dumplings were good, but the pork dumplings were really great! We finished the appetizers with the spicy Szechuan wings. It was a spice that was dry and snuck up on you. Still delicious! 

For our main course, we had the special crispy bacon ramen. It&apos;s around until the end of the month, but RUN to eat it. It was outstanding. It was so tasty! It was also huge! I got it with the Chili inside which gave a nice heat to it. The ramen already had a bit of a peppery kick so the chili might not have been needed. 

We finished up with a dessert of doughnuts with a Carmel vanilla dipping sauce. Heavenly! 

The only downside of the dinner was the environment. This is NOT a place for kids or families. I know that there are a lot of places like that, but not in LEYE. The seating was a bit restrictive and the music they play has quite a bit of swearing. I was there with my parents and felt a little weird, but It would be my scene with my friends! Our server was also fantastic so that&apos;s a big plus. 

In closing! I was floored by the quality of food at this place. I&apos;ll for sure be back, but with friends, not family :)"
5,"I&apos;m a pretty hard critique of Japanese ramen and to be honest, the ramen wasn&apos;t the best I&apos;ve had but I thoroughly enjoyed my overall experience here. The outdoor seating has a partially covered hut and heated lamps overhead the raised tables. Your legs will get chilly so I suggest bringing a blanket or scarf to wrap around your legs to stay warm if dining outside in the winter. Our waiter and staff were very efficient and polite - they visited often but not an annoying amount.  

I ordered the tonkatsu ramen and my boyfriend ordered the katsu tonkatsu (limited edition). Despite the weather being cold outside, our ramen came out very hot and stayed relatively hot until we finished our bowls. I believe the chasu in the tonkatsu was smoked - which was new to me. It surprisingly worked! It didn&apos;t look like a large quantity of meat but it was VERY dense. It filled me up pretty quickly. My ramen had too many bamboo shoots and wakame. I wish there was something light like mung bean sprouts to balance the heaviness and add some texture. The fried garlic was a GREAT addition  though - compliments to the chef on that one. 

The katsu tonkatsu had katsu sauce (like a sweet Japanese worchestire) and mustard wasabi. It significantly impacts the taste of the broth. It wasn&apos;t my cup of tea but my boyfriend enjoyed it. 

Giving this a 5 star because we were treated very well and had an overall good experience. Plus the many cute river north puppies walking by and saying hello put us in an especially good mood. 

Ramen-San is part of lettuce entertain you so make sure you have the app and collect points for dining in!"
4,"Walked in on the whim for lunch on a early Sunday afternoon. Was able to get a table right away. My bf and I both ordered the express lunch for $15.95, which included a ramen, a fried rice, a small salad and pickled cucumbers. Each item was a nicely sized portion and the food hit the spot. I&apos;d definitely recommend the express lunch route if it&apos;s available.

Service overall was attentive and friendly, but one person felt slightly pushy and should maybe reconsider his wording when asking us if we&apos;d like to try some Japanese whiskey instead of the &quot;well whiskey&quot; we originally ordered. The recommendation the first time around was fine, but his second attempt sounded pretty snarky and condescending. I&apos;m going to assume that wasn&apos;t his intention, but it def didn&apos;t encourage us to order more drinks."
3,"@BJH.  Thank you for the follow up.  When I&apos;m in Chicago next I will check in with you to see if the comments I made here have been resolved and will update this review. Thank you for taking the time to address my comments.  

A nice filling meal.  Chicago is not up there yet when it comes to Japanese restos. Los Angeles reigns supreme on Japanese food options on the mainland.  Still I&apos;m glad that Ramen-San exists albeit owned by Lettuce and not a Japan entity. 

First I had the vegan broth ramen.  It was good, the broth tepid, the tofu still cold in the middle.  

On a second visit I had the express lunch option with salmon over rice and small kimchee ramen with a &quot;molten&quot; egg. The broth was good, the &quot;molten&quot; egg was perfect but I only got a half an egg.  The salmon was bathed in sugary sweet sauce that was off putting.  It didn&apos;t go well with the kimchee ramen as next to it, I felt I was eating dessert over steamed rice. 

Loved the service, the outdoor eating options and the coo coo Captain America mugs."
4,"Chicago literally has the best food! The last time I came to Chicago I went to their sister restaurant sushi San which has amazing food. I love a great Ramen!
Due to Covid and the new mandate we had to sit outside, but luckily they had heating lamps and it was a very sunny day.

The Ramen had thick pork pieces that were so tender and juicy. The broth was so delicious, I wish I could eat about 3 bowls of it... lol. 

Ramen san definitely did not disappoint and I will definitely be coming back the next time I visit Chicago"
1,"Server was more concerned about us wearing masks than getting the order right. They completely messed up our order. Also, the seats are extremely uncomfortable wooden benches meant for little kids. Never going here again."
2,"Hate to do this. Excellent packaging, good enough service, no heating outside, and mediocre ramen. 

Try another spot or make instant."
5,"Chicago was cold sooo cold so my boyfriend and I were eager to get something warm in our tummies. Due to covid the wait was longer than expected even tho we had reservations, but the service and amazing food triumphed that small negative for me. The ramen....bruh the ramen was so freaking delicious. It&apos;s def a top two on my ramen list. The Penicillin # 2 wasn&apos;t too strong in my opinion, but still tasty. Because we had to wait longer than expected they offered us some complimentary hot donuts. I thought the gesture was very kind. Lowkey want to take a trip back up there to get back in on this goodness."
2,"I try to order from local spots 1-2x/week during the pandemic to support local businesses. It&apos;s a cold evening so ramen sounded good and I haven&apos;t ordered from Ramen-San yet. 

I ordered via Uber Eats for delivery because it was a little too far for pick up. It estimated 65-85 minutes which was okay and I can understand given it&apos;s a weekend evening. 

But it took over 2 hours to get my food. I watched the tracker and it was clear that the delay was due to the restaurant, not Uber. When I got it, it was ice cold. The fried chicken was soft and appeared to have been sitting for a long time - way longer than the 20 minutes from pick up to my door. Also, there were no utensils! What kind of ramen place doesn&apos;t give chop sticks with an order?!

The food was okay tasting - no better than other places I&apos;ve tried in the city. At the beginning of the pandemic I gave restaurants a lot of grace because of the pivots that most needed to make. But we are a year into this and an efficient delivery process should be in place so food isn&apos;t ice cold and basic utensils are given. With all the great food places in Chicago, probably won&apos;t come back."
4,My husband insisted on trying this spot after a recommendation from friends.  They did not steer us wrong. We tried a fried chicken bowl &amp; a miso bowl with an egg.  Extra noodles are a must my friends!  The broth....wow. Such depth that elevated the toppings. Will definitely try again in the future.
4,Pretty good place. Service was spot on. Server was kind and friendly. Food was tasty and serving size was appropriate. Nothing really beats a steaming hot bowl of ramen on a freezing night. Also got the miso Brussels sprouts but found them a touch too salty but still good. Will come back to try more.
5,"We sample a little everything...drinks, wings, Brussels sprouts, ramen and salad. All delicious!"
4,"Took Ramen-San to go on a rainy night for some comfort food. Super easy to pick up and the ramen toppings were packaged separately from the broth so sogginess was not an issue. 

I ordered the Tonkatsu ramen, the Kimchi Fried Chicken ramen, and the sticky Thai chicken wings. The Tonkatsu was overall really delicious and the broth was on point. I&apos;d definitely order this a second time! The Kimchi Fried Chicken ramen broth was nice and spicy, the chicken pieces were large, but the noodles were a little crusty. I would describe the ramen dishes as mainstream, but they still keep most of the traditional elements of an authentic ramen bowl."
4,"I came here with a party of 4 during the COVID pandemic and appreciated how well organized and accommodating the staff was during these interesting times! This is one of the limited indoor/outdoor dining places outside of Chicago and our party really appreciated the time and effort this restaurant put in! 
The hot broth, hot sake, on a cold winter night in Chicago, how can you go wrong? 
To start we order the karaage chicken with ailoi and it&apos;s perfect to start without getting yourself too full. We ended up ordering ordering 2 orders because of the sides, but this was because we were blinded on the sizes of the ramen! Which is a great segway to: 
The Ramen:
You can&apos;t go wrong with the toncatshu ramen, comes with a soft-boil egg and pork belly! The rest of the group ordered the spicy ramen and apparently it was just as spicy as our waiter warned us. So if you&apos;re not into spice, please double check with your waiter! 
The broth was perfect and creamy, not too overwhelming to the point where you can&apos;t drink it by itself. The egg noodles was fresh and plentiful! If you want you can order a refill, but I barely finished my first serving. 
The pork belly was fresh and nicely fried and made a great compliant with the soft-boiled egg. 
All in all I can say, the next time I&apos;m in Chicago, I will be sure to make a ramen stop here, especially with the weather and location of the restaurant! 
Great job Ramen-San"

The pork belly was fresh and nicely fried and made a great compliant with the soft-boiled egg. 
All in all I can say, the next time I&apos;m in Chicago, I will be sure to make a ramen stop here, especially with the weather and location of the restaurant! 
Great job Ramen-San"
3,"Karraage chicken (chicken nuggets) - my Fiancé enjoyed these. They were lightly battered and lightly seasoned as well.

Raw tuna- this was delicious! The tuna and avocado were fresh &amp; completed each other. The chip it was a little too salty for me but it was still enjoyable! 

Buns 
Fried chicken buns- was not a fan of the horseradish in it. I felt like it over powered the flavor of the chicken and had too much in mine. 

Chicken wings 
Spicy Szechuan- this was dry rub and had a great sauce to go with it. I would have liked a little more flavor in these wings otherwise I probably would not get this again. 

Sticky Thai- these were wet and flavorful definitely enjoyed these more than the Szechuan 

Dumpling
Crispy Berkshire- these were crispy and had a decent amount of meat in the dumpling. 

Ramen 
Kimchi &amp; fried chicken- first time trying fried chicken ramen and was not a fan. I will definitely be sticking to my regular pork. The noddles were also harder than usual, it might have needed to be cooked for longer 

Drinks 
Yuzu margarita- this was refreshing and decent

yuzu Saki- very sweet with a strong taste of lemon and grapefruit"
5,"I had an appointment downtown and it was cold out!  I&apos;ve been meaning to try this place for quite some time.  Eating out during Covid times are quite different.  Ramen SAN take no chances.  The place was immaculate and they take your temperature at the entrance.  The social distancing tables are far enough apart and quite safe.  The staff wears masks and gloves and there&apos;s sanitizer there for you.  

As for the food, I tried the chicken and vegetable Gyoza and the Imperial Shio.  The food came out quickly and super hot.  Everything tasted so nice and looked so clean.  

My experience was very positive even during these tough times."
4,"My mouth is watering just thinking about this place. The ramen noodles had so much body, but were so light at the same time, the broth was flavorful, and the pork belly was a true star of the show. The flavor was out of this word and melts in your mouth. The ramen was priced well for both quality and quantity, however the pork buns were very kind of expensive. 1 bun for $5 is steep for something that you can eat in 2-3 bites.

The gentleman that helped with my order was kind, but there was a lady who was running orders who was really rude. My friend and I sat at a table and she got mad. There was no &quot;reserved&quot; sign, and nobody said anything about how carry out worked. She was not pleasant at all. 

If you&apos;ve got a ramen craving (or even if you&apos;re not) this place will hit the spot. It&apos;s the perfect meal for lunch or dinner and carry out orders have great instructions on how to heat and handle them to get the best experience."
4,"When we visited, there was only outside dining due to CoVid regulations, and you had to make a reservation because there was a limited number of tables. The service was great! Our waitress was very friendly and even thought to ask us about any allergies. My husband has a shellfish allergy, so she was able to steer him in the correct direction regarding the ramen he should eat. 

I chose the fried chicken kimchi ramen which was delicious. I was worried that it would be too spicy, but it wasn&apos;t it, and it was really good. If you order any of the ramen entrees, make sure you are hungry, because all of them are enough for two meals. As a group, we shared the Berkshire dumplings and the Mantou Bun with Pork Belly. Both dishes were delicious, but the bun was amazing and almost enough food for a meal.

If you are interested in cocktails, I recommend the Pencillian #2."
4,"My boyfriend and I went to Chicago for a little couples vacation. After a night of drinking way to much Hennessy we decided to go for ramen for lunch since it&apos;s been a while since we&apos;ve had good ramen. On the Midwest anyway.... Jinya will always be my home favorite in Burbank CA. 
Anyway! The food!! It was so mouth watering I couldn&apos;t believe it. At first I thought it was weird and wasn&apos;t sure if I even wanted to order the kimchi and fried chicken. After reading the great reviews I had to try it. The place was cozy and welcoming the lighting was dim the employees in the front were so helpful to. The parking is shit so definitely DO NOT park across the street we seen a girl get towed because sometimes they don&apos;t allow it. We parked right in front per the waiter the safest place to park. 
We sat down and our waiter seemed like he just wanted us to rush ... weird. It got weirder. We literally had about 3-4 waiters/waitresses; didn&apos;t seem like they communicated that well with each other it was kind of all over the place. They rarely checked on us we had to flag them down. We ordered the kimchi fried chicken ramen and Sumo Ramen my boyfriend loved his until he tried mine and was like I&apos;m deff ordering that next time! We also had a house salad ... not that great loved how fresh the greens were the ginger dressing just seemed a bit off. We also had the sticky Thai chicken wings which were super delicious if you order them make sure you use your towelette after your hands get super sticky! Overall I loved the food didn&apos;t care for the customer service still tipped super well because hands down the ramen was SOOO good. The music is also super annoying we went about 1Pm on a Tuesday and the music was blasting as if I was in a house party. I&apos;m 28 not a old lady LOL not  exaggerating just was pretty annoying that me and my boyfriend were struggling the entire time for a conversation because we couldn&apos;t hear each other. 
Deff a must try! Get the kimchi fried chicken ramen you won&apos;t be disappointed!!"
5,"Great experience ! Good ramen and excellent service !
We do live in &quot;the new normal&quot; life - thank you for our waiter making a superb experience ! 
Loved Food !"
4,"I wasn&apos;t sure what I was expecting from this place. I&apos;ve had Lettuce Entertain You Ramen before from Tokio Pub so I was expecting roughly the same. I was thankfully incorrect as this food rocks (yes, I still love you Tokio Pub). 

We had a reservation and were promptly seated. My mom got a Yuzu Margarita. My dad got the Aschi beer and I had an Old Fashioned. All of our drinks were awesome, but special shout-out to my dads beer. I tried it and I was the real star. 

For appetizers, we got a little bit of everything. We were not sure on the fried chicken bun, but that was a huge surprise. It was crispy and had a nice spice. We also got the pork dumplings and chicken dumplings. The chicken dumplings were good, but the pork dumplings were really great! We finished the appetizers with the spicy Szechuan wings. It was a spice that was dry and snuck up on you. Still delicious! 

For our main course, we had the special crispy bacon ramen. It&apos;s around until the end of the month, but RUN to eat it. It was outstanding. It was so tasty! It was also huge! I got it with the Chili inside which gave a nice heat to it. The ramen already had a bit of a peppery kick so the chili might not have been needed. 

We finished up with a dessert of doughnuts with a Carmel vanilla dipping sauce. Heavenly! 

The only downside of the dinner was the environment. This is NOT a place for kids or families. I know that there are a lot of places like that, but not in LEYE. The seating was a bit restrictive and the music they play has quite a bit of swearing. I was there with my parents and felt a little weird, but It would be my scene with my friends! Our server was also fantastic so that&apos;s a big plus. 

In closing! I was floored by the quality of food at this place. I&apos;ll for sure be back, but with friends, not family :)"
5,"I&apos;m a pretty hard critique of Japanese ramen and to be honest, the ramen wasn&apos;t the best I&apos;ve had but I thoroughly enjoyed my overall experience here. The outdoor seating has a partially covered hut and heated lamps overhead the raised tables. Your legs will get chilly so I suggest bringing a blanket or scarf to wrap around your legs to stay warm if dining outside in the winter. Our waiter and staff were very efficient and polite - they visited often but not an annoying amount.  

I ordered the tonkatsu ramen and my boyfriend ordered the katsu tonkatsu (limited edition). Despite the weather being cold outside, our ramen came out very hot and stayed relatively hot until we finished our bowls. I believe the chasu in the tonkatsu was smoked - which was new to me. It surprisingly worked! It didn&apos;t look like a large quantity of meat but it was VERY dense. It filled me up pretty quickly. My ramen had too many bamboo shoots and wakame. I wish there was something light like mung bean sprouts to balance the heaviness and add some texture. The fried garlic was a GREAT addition  though - compliments to the chef on that one. 

The katsu tonkatsu had katsu sauce (like a sweet Japanese worchestire) and mustard wasabi. It significantly impacts the taste of the broth. It wasn&apos;t my cup of tea but my boyfriend enjoyed it. 

Giving this a 5 star because we were treated very well and had an overall good experience. Plus the many cute river north puppies walking by and saying hello put us in an especially good mood. 

Ramen-San is part of lettuce entertain you so make sure you have the app and collect points for dining in!"
4,"Walked in on the whim for lunch on a early Sunday afternoon. Was able to get a table right away. My bf and I both ordered the express lunch for $15.95, which included a ramen, a fried rice, a small salad and pickled cucumbers. Each item was a nicely sized portion and the food hit the spot. I&apos;d definitely recommend the express lunch route if it&apos;s available.

Service overall was attentive and friendly, but one person felt slightly pushy and should maybe reconsider his wording when asking us if we&apos;d like to try some Japanese whiskey instead of the &quot;well whiskey&quot; we originally ordered. The recommendation the first time around was fine, but his second attempt sounded pretty snarky and condescending. I&apos;m going to assume that wasn&apos;t his intention, but it def didn&apos;t encourage us to order more drinks."
3,"@BJH.  Thank you for the follow up.  When I&apos;m in Chicago next I will check in with you to see if the comments I made here have been resolved and will update this review. Thank you for taking the time to address my comments.  

A nice filling meal.  Chicago is not up there yet when it comes to Japanese restos. Los Angeles reigns supreme on Japanese food options on the mainland.  Still I&apos;m glad that Ramen-San exists albeit owned by Lettuce and not a Japan entity. 

First I had the vegan broth ramen.  It was good, the broth tepid, the tofu still cold in the middle.  

On a second visit I had the express lunch option with salmon over rice and small kimchee ramen with a &quot;molten&quot; egg. The broth was good, the &quot;molten&quot; egg was perfect but I only got a half an egg.  The salmon was bathed in sugary sweet sauce that was off putting.  It didn&apos;t go well with the kimchee ramen as next to it, I felt I was eating dessert over steamed rice. 

Loved the service, the outdoor eating options and the coo coo Captain America mugs."
4,"Chicago literally has the best food! The last time I came to Chicago I went to their sister restaurant sushi San which has amazing food. I love a great Ramen!
Due to Covid and the new mandate we had to sit outside, but luckily they had heating lamps and it was a very sunny day.

The Ramen had thick pork pieces that were so tender and juicy. The broth was so delicious, I wish I could eat about 3 bowls of it... lol. 

Ramen san definitely did not disappoint and I will definitely be coming back the next time I visit Chicago"
1,"Server was more concerned about us wearing masks than getting the order right. They completely messed up our order. Also, the seats are extremely uncomfortable wooden benches meant for little kids. Never going here again."
2,"Hate to do this. Excellent packaging, good enough service, no heating outside, and mediocre ramen. 

Try another spot or make instant."
5,"Chicago was cold sooo cold so my boyfriend and I were eager to get something warm in our tummies. Due to covid the wait was longer than expected even tho we had reservations, but the service and amazing food triumphed that small negative for me. The ramen....bruh the ramen was so freaking delicious. It&apos;s def a top two on my ramen list. The Penicillin # 2 wasn&apos;t too strong in my opinion, but still tasty. Because we had to wait longer than expected they offered us some complimentary hot donuts. I thought the gesture was very kind. Lowkey want to take a trip back up there to get back in on this goodness."
2,"I try to order from local spots 1-2x/week during the pandemic to support local businesses. It&apos;s a cold evening so ramen sounded good and I haven&apos;t ordered from Ramen-San yet. 

I ordered via Uber Eats for delivery because it was a little too far for pick up. It estimated 65-85 minutes which was okay and I can understand given it&apos;s a weekend evening. 

But it took over 2 hours to get my food. I watched the tracker and it was clear that the delay was due to the restaurant, not Uber. When I got it, it was ice cold. The fried chicken was soft and appeared to have been sitting for a long time - way longer than the 20 minutes from pick up to my door. Also, there were no utensils! What kind of ramen place doesn&apos;t give chop sticks with an order?!

The food was okay tasting - no better than other places I&apos;ve tried in the city. At the beginning of the pandemic I gave restaurants a lot of grace because of the pivots that most needed to make. But we are a year into this and an efficient delivery process should be in place so food isn&apos;t ice cold and basic utensils are given. With all the great food places in Chicago, probably won&apos;t come back."
4,My husband insisted on trying this spot after a recommendation from friends.  They did not steer us wrong. We tried a fried chicken bowl &amp; a miso bowl with an egg.  Extra noodles are a must my friends!  The broth....wow. Such depth that elevated the toppings. Will definitely try again in the future.
4,Pretty good place. Service was spot on. Server was kind and friendly. Food was tasty and serving size was appropriate. Nothing really beats a steaming hot bowl of ramen on a freezing night. Also got the miso Brussels sprouts but found them a touch too salty but still good. Will come back to try more.
5,"We sample a little everything...drinks, wings, Brussels sprouts, ramen and salad. All delicious!"
4,"Took Ramen-San to go on a rainy night for some comfort food. Super easy to pick up and the ramen toppings were packaged separately from the broth so sogginess was not an issue. 

I ordered the Tonkatsu ramen, the Kimchi Fried Chicken ramen, and the sticky Thai chicken wings. The Tonkatsu was overall really delicious and the broth was on point. I&apos;d definitely order this a second time! The Kimchi Fried Chicken ramen broth was nice and spicy, the chicken pieces were large, but the noodles were a little crusty. I would describe the ramen dishes as mainstream, but they still keep most of the traditional elements of an authentic ramen bowl."
4,"I came here with a party of 4 during the COVID pandemic and appreciated how well organized and accommodating the staff was during these interesting times! This is one of the limited indoor/outdoor dining places outside of Chicago and our party really appreciated the time and effort this restaurant put in! 
The hot broth, hot sake, on a cold winter night in Chicago, how can you go wrong? 
To start we order the karaage chicken with ailoi and it&apos;s perfect to start without getting yourself too full. We ended up ordering ordering 2 orders because of the sides, but this was because we were blinded on the sizes of the ramen! Which is a great segway to: 
The Ramen:
You can&apos;t go wrong with the toncatshu ramen, comes with a soft-boil egg and pork belly! The rest of the group ordered the spicy ramen and apparently it was just as spicy as our waiter warned us. So if you&apos;re not into spice, please double check with your waiter!

To start we order the karaage chicken with ailoi and it&apos;s perfect to start without getting yourself too full. We ended up ordering ordering 2 orders because of the sides, but this was because we were blinded on the sizes of the ramen! Which is a great segway to: 
The Ramen:
You can&apos;t go wrong with the toncatshu ramen, comes with a soft-boil egg and pork belly! The rest of the group ordered the spicy ramen and apparently it was just as spicy as our waiter warned us. So if you&apos;re not into spice, please double check with your waiter! 
The broth was perfect and creamy, not too overwhelming to the point where you can&apos;t drink it by itself. The egg noodles was fresh and plentiful! If you want you can order a refill, but I barely finished my first serving. 
The pork belly was fresh and nicely fried and made a great compliant with the soft-boiled egg. 
All in all I can say, the next time I&apos;m in Chicago, I will be sure to make a ramen stop here, especially with the weather and location of the restaurant! 
Great job Ramen-San"
3,"Karraage chicken (chicken nuggets) - my Fiancé enjoyed these. They were lightly battered and lightly seasoned as well.

Raw tuna- this was delicious! The tuna and avocado were fresh &amp; completed each other. The chip it was a little too salty for me but it was still enjoyable! 

Buns 
Fried chicken buns- was not a fan of the horseradish in it. I felt like it over powered the flavor of the chicken and had too much in mine. 

Chicken wings 
Spicy Szechuan- this was dry rub and had a great sauce to go with it. I would have liked a little more flavor in these wings otherwise I probably would not get this again. 

Sticky Thai- these were wet and flavorful definitely enjoyed these more than the Szechuan 

Dumpling
Crispy Berkshire- these were crispy and had a decent amount of meat in the dumpling. 

Ramen 
Kimchi &amp; fried chicken- first time trying fried chicken ramen and was not a fan. I will definitely be sticking to my regular pork. The noddles were also harder than usual, it might have needed to be cooked for longer 

Drinks 
Yuzu margarita- this was refreshing and decent

yuzu Saki- very sweet with a strong taste of lemon and grapefruit"
5,"I had an appointment downtown and it was cold out!  I&apos;ve been meaning to try this place for quite some time.  Eating out during Covid times are quite different.  Ramen SAN take no chances.  The place was immaculate and they take your temperature at the entrance.  The social distancing tables are far enough apart and quite safe.  The staff wears masks and gloves and there&apos;s sanitizer there for you.  

As for the food, I tried the chicken and vegetable Gyoza and the Imperial Shio.  The food came out quickly and super hot.  Everything tasted so nice and looked so clean.  

My experience was very positive even during these tough times."
4,"My mouth is watering just thinking about this place. The ramen noodles had so much body, but were so light at the same time, the broth was flavorful, and the pork belly was a true star of the show. The flavor was out of this word and melts in your mouth. The ramen was priced well for both quality and quantity, however the pork buns were very kind of expensive. 1 bun for $5 is steep for something that you can eat in 2-3 bites.

The gentleman that helped with my order was kind, but there was a lady who was running orders who was really rude. My friend and I sat at a table and she got mad. There was no &quot;reserved&quot; sign, and nobody said anything about how carry out worked. She was not pleasant at all. 

If you&apos;ve got a ramen craving (or even if you&apos;re not) this place will hit the spot. It&apos;s the perfect meal for lunch or dinner and carry out orders have great instructions on how to heat and handle them to get the best experience."
4,"When we visited, there was only outside dining due to CoVid regulations, and you had to make a reservation because there was a limited number of tables. The service was great! Our waitress was very friendly and even thought to ask us about any allergies. My husband has a shellfish allergy, so she was able to steer him in the correct direction regarding the ramen he should eat. 

I chose the fried chicken kimchi ramen which was delicious. I was worried that it would be too spicy, but it wasn&apos;t it, and it was really good. If you order any of the ramen entrees, make sure you are hungry, because all of them are enough for two meals. As a group, we shared the Berkshire dumplings and the Mantou Bun with Pork Belly. Both dishes were delicious, but the bun was amazing and almost enough food for a meal.

If you are interested in cocktails, I recommend the Pencillian #2."
4,"My boyfriend and I went to Chicago for a little couples vacation. After a night of drinking way to much Hennessy we decided to go for ramen for lunch since it&apos;s been a while since we&apos;ve had good ramen. On the Midwest anyway.... Jinya will always be my home favorite in Burbank CA. 
Anyway! The food!! It was so mouth watering I couldn&apos;t believe it. At first I thought it was weird and wasn&apos;t sure if I even wanted to order the kimchi and fried chicken. After reading the great reviews I had to try it. The place was cozy and welcoming the lighting was dim the employees in the front were so helpful to. The parking is shit so definitely DO NOT park across the street we seen a girl get towed because sometimes they don&apos;t allow it. We parked right in front per the waiter the safest place to park. 
We sat down and our waiter seemed like he just wanted us to rush ... weird. It got weirder. We literally had about 3-4 waiters/waitresses; didn&apos;t seem like they communicated that well with each other it was kind of all over the place. They rarely checked on us we had to flag them down. We ordered the kimchi fried chicken ramen and Sumo Ramen my boyfriend loved his until he tried mine and was like I&apos;m deff ordering that next time! We also had a house salad ... not that great loved how fresh the greens were the ginger dressing just seemed a bit off. We also had the sticky Thai chicken wings which were super delicious if you order them make sure you use your towelette after your hands get super sticky! Overall I loved the food didn&apos;t care for the customer service still tipped super well because hands down the ramen was SOOO good. The music is also super annoying we went about 1Pm on a Tuesday and the music was blasting as if I was in a house party. I&apos;m 28 not a old lady LOL not  exaggerating just was pretty annoying that me and my boyfriend were struggling the entire time for a conversation because we couldn&apos;t hear each other. 
Deff a must try! Get the kimchi fried chicken ramen you won&apos;t be disappointed!!"
5,"Great experience ! Good ramen and excellent service !
We do live in &quot;the new normal&quot; life - thank you for our waiter making a superb experience ! 
Loved Food !"
4,"I wasn&apos;t sure what I was expecting from this place. I&apos;ve had Lettuce Entertain You Ramen before from Tokio Pub so I was expecting roughly the same. I was thankfully incorrect as this food rocks (yes, I still love you Tokio Pub). 

We had a reservation and were promptly seated. My mom got a Yuzu Margarita. My dad got the Aschi beer and I had an Old Fashioned. All of our drinks were awesome, but special shout-out to my dads beer. I tried it and I was the real star. 

For appetizers, we got a little bit of everything. We were not sure on the fried chicken bun, but that was a huge surprise. It was crispy and had a nice spice. We also got the pork dumplings and chicken dumplings. The chicken dumplings were good, but the pork dumplings were really great! We finished the appetizers with the spicy Szechuan wings. It was a spice that was dry and snuck up on you. Still delicious! 

For our main course, we had the special crispy bacon ramen. It&apos;s around until the end of the month, but RUN to eat it. It was outstanding. It was so tasty! It was also huge! I got it with the Chili inside which gave a nice heat to it. The ramen already had a bit of a peppery kick so the chili might not have been needed. 

We finished up with a dessert of doughnuts with a Carmel vanilla dipping sauce. Heavenly! 

The only downside of the dinner was the environment. This is NOT a place for kids or families. I know that there are a lot of places like that, but not in LEYE. The seating was a bit restrictive and the music they play has quite a bit of swearing. I was there with my parents and felt a little weird, but It would be my scene with my friends! Our server was also fantastic so that&apos;s a big plus. 

In closing! I was floored by the quality of food at this place. I&apos;ll for sure be back, but with friends, not family :)"
5,"I&apos;m a pretty hard critique of Japanese ramen and to be honest, the ramen wasn&apos;t the best I&apos;ve had but I thoroughly enjoyed my overall experience here. The outdoor seating has a partially covered hut and heated lamps overhead the raised tables. Your legs will get chilly so I suggest bringing a blanket or scarf to wrap around your legs to stay warm if dining outside in the winter. Our waiter and staff were very efficient and polite - they visited often but not an annoying amount.  

I ordered the tonkatsu ramen and my boyfriend ordered the katsu tonkatsu (limited edition). Despite the weather being cold outside, our ramen came out very hot and stayed relatively hot until we finished our bowls. I believe the chasu in the tonkatsu was smoked - which was new to me. It surprisingly worked! It didn&apos;t look like a large quantity of meat but it was VERY dense. It filled me up pretty quickly. My ramen had too many bamboo shoots and wakame. I wish there was something light like mung bean sprouts to balance the heaviness and add some texture. The fried garlic was a GREAT addition  though - compliments to the chef on that one. 

The katsu tonkatsu had katsu sauce (like a sweet Japanese worchestire) and mustard wasabi. It significantly impacts the taste of the broth. It wasn&apos;t my cup of tea but my boyfriend enjoyed it. 

Giving this a 5 star because we were treated very well and had an overall good experience. Plus the many cute river north puppies walking by and saying hello put us in an especially good mood. 

Ramen-San is part of lettuce entertain you so make sure you have the app and collect points for dining in!"
4,"Walked in on the whim for lunch on a early Sunday afternoon. Was able to get a table right away. My bf and I both ordered the express lunch for $15.95, which included a ramen, a fried rice, a small salad and pickled cucumbers. Each item was a nicely sized portion and the food hit the spot. I&apos;d definitely recommend the express lunch route if it&apos;s available.

Service overall was attentive and friendly, but one person felt slightly pushy and should maybe reconsider his wording when asking us if we&apos;d like to try some Japanese whiskey instead of the &quot;well whiskey&quot; we originally ordered. The recommendation the first time around was fine, but his second attempt sounded pretty snarky and condescending. I&apos;m going to assume that wasn&apos;t his intention, but it def didn&apos;t encourage us to order more drinks."
3,"@BJH.  Thank you for the follow up.  When I&apos;m in Chicago next I will check in with you to see if the comments I made here have been resolved and will update this review. Thank you for taking the time to address my comments.  

A nice filling meal.  Chicago is not up there yet when it comes to Japanese restos. Los Angeles reigns supreme on Japanese food options on the mainland.  Still I&apos;m glad that Ramen-San exists albeit owned by Lettuce and not a Japan entity. 

First I had the vegan broth ramen.  It was good, the broth tepid, the tofu still cold in the middle.  

On a second visit I had the express lunch option with salmon over rice and small kimchee ramen with a &quot;molten&quot; egg. The broth was good, the &quot;molten&quot; egg was perfect but I only got a half an egg.  The salmon was bathed in sugary sweet sauce that was off putting.  It didn&apos;t go well with the kimchee ramen as next to it, I felt I was eating dessert over steamed rice. 

Loved the service, the outdoor eating options and the coo coo Captain America mugs."
4,"Chicago literally has the best food! The last time I came to Chicago I went to their sister restaurant sushi San which has amazing food. I love a great Ramen!
Due to Covid and the new mandate we had to sit outside, but luckily they had heating lamps and it was a very sunny day.

The Ramen had thick pork pieces that were so tender and juicy. The broth was so delicious, I wish I could eat about 3 bowls of it... lol. 

Ramen san definitely did not disappoint and I will definitely be coming back the next time I visit Chicago"
1,"Server was more concerned about us wearing masks than getting the order right. They completely messed up our order. Also, the seats are extremely uncomfortable wooden benches meant for little kids. Never going here again."
2,"Hate to do this. Excellent packaging, good enough service, no heating outside, and mediocre ramen. 

Try another spot or make instant."
5,"Chicago was cold sooo cold so my boyfriend and I were eager to get something warm in our tummies. Due to covid the wait was longer than expected even tho we had reservations, but the service and amazing food triumphed that small negative for me. The ramen....bruh the ramen was so freaking delicious. It&apos;s def a top two on my ramen list. The Penicillin # 2 wasn&apos;t too strong in my opinion, but still tasty. Because we had to wait longer than expected they offered us some complimentary hot donuts. I thought the gesture was very kind. Lowkey want to take a trip back up there to get back in on this goodness."
2,"I try to order from local spots 1-2x/week during the pandemic to support local businesses. It&apos;s a cold evening so ramen sounded good and I haven&apos;t ordered from Ramen-San yet. 

I ordered via Uber Eats for delivery because it was a little too far for pick up. It estimated 65-85 minutes which was okay and I can understand given it&apos;s a weekend evening. 

But it took over 2 hours to get my food. I watched the tracker and it was clear that the delay was due to the restaurant, not Uber. When I got it, it was ice cold. The fried chicken was soft and appeared to have been sitting for a long time - way longer than the 20 minutes from pick up to my door. Also, there were no utensils! What kind of ramen place doesn&apos;t give chop sticks with an order?!

The food was okay tasting - no better than other places I&apos;ve tried in the city. At the beginning of the pandemic I gave restaurants a lot of grace because of the pivots that most needed to make. But we are a year into this and an efficient delivery process should be in place so food isn&apos;t ice cold and basic utensils are given. With all the great food places in Chicago, probably won&apos;t come back."
4,My husband insisted on trying this spot after a recommendation from friends.  They did not steer us wrong. We tried a fried chicken bowl &amp; a miso bowl with an egg.  Extra noodles are a must my friends!  The broth....wow. Such depth that elevated the toppings. Will definitely try again in the future.
4,Pretty good place. Service was spot on. Server was kind and friendly. Food was tasty and serving size was appropriate. Nothing really beats a steaming hot bowl of ramen on a freezing night. Also got the miso Brussels sprouts but found them a touch too salty but still good. Will come back to try more.
5,"We sample a little everything...drinks, wings, Brussels sprouts, ramen and salad. All delicious!"
4,"Took Ramen-San to go on a rainy night for some comfort food. Super easy to pick up and the ramen toppings were packaged separately from the broth so sogginess was not an issue. 

I ordered the Tonkatsu ramen, the Kimchi Fried Chicken ramen, and the sticky Thai chicken wings. The Tonkatsu was overall really delicious and the broth was on point. I&apos;d definitely order this a second time! The Kimchi Fried Chicken ramen broth was nice and spicy, the chicken pieces were large, but the noodles were a little crusty. I would describe the ramen dishes as mainstream, but they still keep most of the traditional elements of an authentic ramen bowl."

I would describe the ramen dishes as mainstream, but they still keep most of the traditional elements of an authentic ramen bowl."
4,"I came here with a party of 4 during the COVID pandemic and appreciated how well organized and accommodating the staff was during these interesting times! This is one of the limited indoor/outdoor dining places outside of Chicago and our party really appreciated the time and effort this restaurant put in! 
The hot broth, hot sake, on a cold winter night in Chicago, how can you go wrong? 
To start we order the karaage chicken with ailoi and it&apos;s perfect to start without getting yourself too full. We ended up ordering ordering 2 orders because of the sides, but this was because we were blinded on the sizes of the ramen! Which is a great segway to: 
The Ramen:
You can&apos;t go wrong with the toncatshu ramen, comes with a soft-boil egg and pork belly! The rest of the group ordered the spicy ramen and apparently it was just as spicy as our waiter warned us. So if you&apos;re not into spice, please double check with your waiter! 
The broth was perfect and creamy, not too overwhelming to the point where you can&apos;t drink it by itself. The egg noodles was fresh and plentiful! If you want you can order a refill, but I barely finished my first serving. 
The pork belly was fresh and nicely fried and made a great compliant with the soft-boiled egg. 
All in all I can say, the next time I&apos;m in Chicago, I will be sure to make a ramen stop here, especially with the weather and location of the restaurant! 
Great job Ramen-San"
3,"Karraage chicken (chicken nuggets) - my Fiancé enjoyed these. They were lightly battered and lightly seasoned as well.

Raw tuna- this was delicious! The tuna and avocado were fresh &amp; completed each other. The chip it was a little too salty for me but it was still enjoyable! 

Buns 
Fried chicken buns- was not a fan of the horseradish in it. I felt like it over powered the flavor of the chicken and had too much in mine. 

Chicken wings 
Spicy Szechuan- this was dry rub and had a great sauce to go with it. I would have liked a little more flavor in these wings otherwise I probably would not get this again. 

Sticky Thai- these were wet and flavorful definitely enjoyed these more than the Szechuan 

Dumpling
Crispy Berkshire- these were crispy and had a decent amount of meat in the dumpling. 

Ramen 
Kimchi &amp; fried chicken- first time trying fried chicken ramen and was not a fan. I will definitely be sticking to my regular pork. The noddles were also harder than usual, it might have needed to be cooked for longer 

Drinks 
Yuzu margarita- this was refreshing and decent

yuzu Saki- very sweet with a strong taste of lemon and grapefruit"
5,"I had an appointment downtown and it was cold out!  I&apos;ve been meaning to try this place for quite some time.  Eating out during Covid times are quite different.  Ramen SAN take no chances.  The place was immaculate and they take your temperature at the entrance.  The social distancing tables are far enough apart and quite safe.  The staff wears masks and gloves and there&apos;s sanitizer there for you.  

As for the food, I tried the chicken and vegetable Gyoza and the Imperial Shio.  The food came out quickly and super hot.  Everything tasted so nice and looked so clean.  

My experience was very positive even during these tough times."
4,"My mouth is watering just thinking about this place. The ramen noodles had so much body, but were so light at the same time, the broth was flavorful, and the pork belly was a true star of the show. The flavor was out of this word and melts in your mouth. The ramen was priced well for both quality and quantity, however the pork buns were very kind of expensive. 1 bun for $5 is steep for something that you can eat in 2-3 bites.

The gentleman that helped with my order was kind, but there was a lady who was running orders who was really rude. My friend and I sat at a table and she got mad. There was no &quot;reserved&quot; sign, and nobody said anything about how carry out worked. She was not pleasant at all. 

If you&apos;ve got a ramen craving (or even if you&apos;re not) this place will hit the spot. It&apos;s the perfect meal for lunch or dinner and carry out orders have great instructions on how to heat and handle them to get the best experience."
4,"When we visited, there was only outside dining due to CoVid regulations, and you had to make a reservation because there was a limited number of tables. The service was great! Our waitress was very friendly and even thought to ask us about any allergies. My husband has a shellfish allergy, so she was able to steer him in the correct direction regarding the ramen he should eat. 

I chose the fried chicken kimchi ramen which was delicious. I was worried that it would be too spicy, but it wasn&apos;t it, and it was really good. If you order any of the ramen entrees, make sure you are hungry, because all of them are enough for two meals. As a group, we shared the Berkshire dumplings and the Mantou Bun with Pork Belly. Both dishes were delicious, but the bun was amazing and almost enough food for a meal.

If you are interested in cocktails, I recommend the Pencillian #2."
4,"My boyfriend and I went to Chicago for a little couples vacation. After a night of drinking way to much Hennessy we decided to go for ramen for lunch since it&apos;s been a while since we&apos;ve had good ramen. On the Midwest anyway.... Jinya will always be my home favorite in Burbank CA. 
Anyway! The food!! It was so mouth watering I couldn&apos;t believe it. At first I thought it was weird and wasn&apos;t sure if I even wanted to order the kimchi and fried chicken. After reading the great reviews I had to try it. The place was cozy and welcoming the lighting was dim the employees in the front were so helpful to. The parking is shit so definitely DO NOT park across the street we seen a girl get towed because sometimes they don&apos;t allow it. We parked right in front per the waiter the safest place to park. 
We sat down and our waiter seemed like he just wanted us to rush ... weird. It got weirder. We literally had about 3-4 waiters/waitresses; didn&apos;t seem like they communicated that well with each other it was kind of all over the place. They rarely checked on us we had to flag them down. We ordered the kimchi fried chicken ramen and Sumo Ramen my boyfriend loved his until he tried mine and was like I&apos;m deff ordering that next time! We also had a house salad ... not that great loved how fresh the greens were the ginger dressing just seemed a bit off. We also had the sticky Thai chicken wings which were super delicious if you order them make sure you use your towelette after your hands get super sticky! Overall I loved the food didn&apos;t care for the customer service still tipped super well because hands down the ramen was SOOO good. The music is also super annoying we went about 1Pm on a Tuesday and the music was blasting as if I was in a house party. I&apos;m 28 not a old lady LOL not  exaggerating just was pretty annoying that me and my boyfriend were struggling the entire time for a conversation because we couldn&apos;t hear each other. 
Deff a must try! Get the kimchi fried chicken ramen you won&apos;t be disappointed!!"
5,"Great experience ! Good ramen and excellent service !
We do live in &quot;the new normal&quot; life - thank you for our waiter making a superb experience ! 
Loved Food !"
4,"I wasn&apos;t sure what I was expecting from this place. I&apos;ve had Lettuce Entertain You Ramen before from Tokio Pub so I was expecting roughly the same. I was thankfully incorrect as this food rocks (yes, I still love you Tokio Pub). 

We had a reservation and were promptly seated. My mom got a Yuzu Margarita. My dad got the Aschi beer and I had an Old Fashioned. All of our drinks were awesome, but special shout-out to my dads beer. I tried it and I was the real star. 

For appetizers, we got a little bit of everything. We were not sure on the fried chicken bun, but that was a huge surprise. It was crispy and had a nice spice. We also got the pork dumplings and chicken dumplings. The chicken dumplings were good, but the pork dumplings were really great! We finished the appetizers with the spicy Szechuan wings. It was a spice that was dry and snuck up on you. Still delicious! 

For our main course, we had the special crispy bacon ramen. It&apos;s around until the end of the month, but RUN to eat it. It was outstanding. It was so tasty! It was also huge! I got it with the Chili inside which gave a nice heat to it. The ramen already had a bit of a peppery kick so the chili might not have been needed. 

We finished up with a dessert of doughnuts with a Carmel vanilla dipping sauce. Heavenly! 

The only downside of the dinner was the environment. This is NOT a place for kids or families. I know that there are a lot of places like that, but not in LEYE. The seating was a bit restrictive and the music they play has quite a bit of swearing. I was there with my parents and felt a little weird, but It would be my scene with my friends! Our server was also fantastic so that&apos;s a big plus. 

In closing! I was floored by the quality of food at this place. I&apos;ll for sure be back, but with friends, not family :)"
5,"I&apos;m a pretty hard critique of Japanese ramen and to be honest, the ramen wasn&apos;t the best I&apos;ve had but I thoroughly enjoyed my overall experience here. The outdoor seating has a partially covered hut and heated lamps overhead the raised tables. Your legs will get chilly so I suggest bringing a blanket or scarf to wrap around your legs to stay warm if dining outside in the winter. Our waiter and staff were very efficient and polite - they visited often but not an annoying amount.  

I ordered the tonkatsu ramen and my boyfriend ordered the katsu tonkatsu (limited edition). Despite the weather being cold outside, our ramen came out very hot and stayed relatively hot until we finished our bowls. I believe the chasu in the tonkatsu was smoked - which was new to me. It surprisingly worked! It didn&apos;t look like a large quantity of meat but it was VERY dense. It filled me up pretty quickly. My ramen had too many bamboo shoots and wakame. I wish there was something light like mung bean sprouts to balance the heaviness and add some texture. The fried garlic was a GREAT addition  though - compliments to the chef on that one. 

The katsu tonkatsu had katsu sauce (like a sweet Japanese worchestire) and mustard wasabi. It significantly impacts the taste of the broth. It wasn&apos;t my cup of tea but my boyfriend enjoyed it. 

Giving this a 5 star because we were treated very well and had an overall good experience. Plus the many cute river north puppies walking by and saying hello put us in an especially good mood. 

Ramen-San is part of lettuce entertain you so make sure you have the app and collect points for dining in!"
4,"Walked in on the whim for lunch on a early Sunday afternoon. Was able to get a table right away. My bf and I both ordered the express lunch for $15.95, which included a ramen, a fried rice, a small salad and pickled cucumbers. Each item was a nicely sized portion and the food hit the spot. I&apos;d definitely recommend the express lunch route if it&apos;s available.

Service overall was attentive and friendly, but one person felt slightly pushy and should maybe reconsider his wording when asking us if we&apos;d like to try some Japanese whiskey instead of the &quot;well whiskey&quot; we originally ordered. The recommendation the first time around was fine, but his second attempt sounded pretty snarky and condescending. I&apos;m going to assume that wasn&apos;t his intention, but it def didn&apos;t encourage us to order more drinks."
3,"@BJH.  Thank you for the follow up.  When I&apos;m in Chicago next I will check in with you to see if the comments I made here have been resolved and will update this review. Thank you for taking the time to address my comments.  

A nice filling meal.  Chicago is not up there yet when it comes to Japanese restos. Los Angeles reigns supreme on Japanese food options on the mainland.  Still I&apos;m glad that Ramen-San exists albeit owned by Lettuce and not a Japan entity. 

First I had the vegan broth ramen.  It was good, the broth tepid, the tofu still cold in the middle.  

On a second visit I had the express lunch option with salmon over rice and small kimchee ramen with a &quot;molten&quot; egg. The broth was good, the &quot;molten&quot; egg was perfect but I only got a half an egg.  The salmon was bathed in sugary sweet sauce that was off putting.  It didn&apos;t go well with the kimchee ramen as next to it, I felt I was eating dessert over steamed rice. 

Loved the service, the outdoor eating options and the coo coo Captain America mugs."
4,"Chicago literally has the best food! The last time I came to Chicago I went to their sister restaurant sushi San which has amazing food. I love a great Ramen!
Due to Covid and the new mandate we had to sit outside, but luckily they had heating lamps and it was a very sunny day.

The Ramen had thick pork pieces that were so tender and juicy. The broth was so delicious, I wish I could eat about 3 bowls of it... lol. 

Ramen san definitely did not disappoint and I will definitely be coming back the next time I visit Chicago"
1,"Server was more concerned about us wearing masks than getting the order right. They completely messed up our order. Also, the seats are extremely uncomfortable wooden benches meant for little kids. Never going here again."
2,"Hate to do this. Excellent packaging, good enough service, no heating outside, and mediocre ramen. 

Try another spot or make instant."
5,"Chicago was cold sooo cold so my boyfriend and I were eager to get something warm in our tummies. Due to covid the wait was longer than expected even tho we had reservations, but the service and amazing food triumphed that small negative for me. The ramen....bruh the ramen was so freaking delicious. It&apos;s def a top two on my ramen list. The Penicillin # 2 wasn&apos;t too strong in my opinion, but still tasty. Because we had to wait longer than expected they offered us some complimentary hot donuts. I thought the gesture was very kind. Lowkey want to take a trip back up there to get back in on this goodness."
2,"I try to order from local spots 1-2x/week during the pandemic to support local businesses. It&apos;s a cold evening so ramen sounded good and I haven&apos;t ordered from Ramen-San yet. 

I ordered via Uber Eats for delivery because it was a little too far for pick up. It estimated 65-85 minutes which was okay and I can understand given it&apos;s a weekend evening. 

But it took over 2 hours to get my food. I watched the tracker and it was clear that the delay was due to the restaurant, not Uber. When I got it, it was ice cold. The fried chicken was soft and appeared to have been sitting for a long time - way longer than the 20 minutes from pick up to my door. Also, there were no utensils! What kind of ramen place doesn&apos;t give chop sticks with an order?!

The food was okay tasting - no better than other places I&apos;ve tried in the city. At the beginning of the pandemic I gave restaurants a lot of grace because of the pivots that most needed to make. But we are a year into this and an efficient delivery process should be in place so food isn&apos;t ice cold and basic utensils are given. With all the great food places in Chicago, probably won&apos;t come back."
4,My husband insisted on trying this spot after a recommendation from friends.  They did not steer us wrong. We tried a fried chicken bowl &amp; a miso bowl with an egg.  Extra noodles are a must my friends!  The broth....wow. Such depth that elevated the toppings. Will definitely try again in the future.
4,Pretty good place. Service was spot on. Server was kind and friendly. Food was tasty and serving size was appropriate. Nothing really beats a steaming hot bowl of ramen on a freezing night. Also got the miso Brussels sprouts but found them a touch too salty but still good. Will come back to try more.
5,"We sample a little everything...drinks, wings, Brussels sprouts, ramen and salad. All delicious!"
4,"Took Ramen-San to go on a rainy night for some comfort food. Super easy to pick up and the ramen toppings were packaged separately from the broth so sogginess was not an issue. 

I ordered the Tonkatsu ramen, the Kimchi Fried Chicken ramen, and the sticky Thai chicken wings. The Tonkatsu was overall really delicious and the broth was on point. I&apos;d definitely order this a second time! The Kimchi Fried Chicken ramen broth was nice and spicy, the chicken pieces were large, but the noodles were a little crusty.

4,"Took Ramen-San to go on a rainy night for some comfort food. Super easy to pick up and the ramen toppings were packaged separately from the broth so sogginess was not an issue. 

I ordered the Tonkatsu ramen, the Kimchi Fried Chicken ramen, and the sticky Thai chicken wings. The Tonkatsu was overall really delicious and the broth was on point. I&apos;d definitely order this a second time! The Kimchi Fried Chicken ramen broth was nice and spicy, the chicken pieces were large, but the noodles were a little crusty. I would describe the ramen dishes as mainstream, but they still keep most of the traditional elements of an authentic ramen bowl."
4,"I came here with a party of 4 during the COVID pandemic and appreciated how well organized and accommodating the staff was during these interesting times! This is one of the limited indoor/outdoor dining places outside of Chicago and our party really appreciated the time and effort this restaurant put in! 
The hot broth, hot sake, on a cold winter night in Chicago, how can you go wrong? 
To start we order the karaage chicken with ailoi and it&apos;s perfect to start without getting yourself too full. We ended up ordering ordering 2 orders because of the sides, but this was because we were blinded on the sizes of the ramen! Which is a great segway to: 
The Ramen:
You can&apos;t go wrong with the toncatshu ramen, comes with a soft-boil egg and pork belly! The rest of the group ordered the spicy ramen and apparently it was just as spicy as our waiter warned us. So if you&apos;re not into spice, please double check with your waiter! 
The broth was perfect and creamy, not too overwhelming to the point where you can&apos;t drink it by itself. The egg noodles was fresh and plentiful! If you want you can order a refill, but I barely finished my first serving. 
The pork belly was fresh and nicely fried and made a great compliant with the soft-boiled egg. 
All in all I can say, the next time I&apos;m in Chicago, I will be sure to make a ramen stop here, especially with the weather and location of the restaurant! 
Great job Ramen-San"
3,"Karraage chicken (chicken nuggets) - my Fiancé enjoyed these. They were lightly battered and lightly seasoned as well.

Raw tuna- this was delicious! The tuna and avocado were fresh &amp; completed each other. The chip it was a little too salty for me but it was still enjoyable! 

Buns 
Fried chicken buns- was not a fan of the horseradish in it. I felt like it over powered the flavor of the chicken and had too much in mine. 

Chicken wings 
Spicy Szechuan- this was dry rub and had a great sauce to go with it. I would have liked a little more flavor in these wings otherwise I probably would not get this again. 

Sticky Thai- these were wet and flavorful definitely enjoyed these more than the Szechuan 

Dumpling
Crispy Berkshire- these were crispy and had a decent amount of meat in the dumpling. 

Ramen 
Kimchi &amp; fried chicken- first time trying fried chicken ramen and was not a fan. I will definitely be sticking to my regular pork. The noddles were also harder than usual, it might have needed to be cooked for longer 

Drinks 
Yuzu margarita- this was refreshing and decent

yuzu Saki- very sweet with a strong taste of lemon and grapefruit"
5,"I had an appointment downtown and it was cold out!  I&apos;ve been meaning to try this place for quite some time.  Eating out during Covid times are quite different.  Ramen SAN take no chances.  The place was immaculate and they take your temperature at the entrance.  The social distancing tables are far enough apart and quite safe.  The staff wears masks and gloves and there&apos;s sanitizer there for you.  

As for the food, I tried the chicken and vegetable Gyoza and the Imperial Shio.  The food came out quickly and super hot.  Everything tasted so nice and looked so clean.  

My experience was very positive even during these tough times."
4,"My mouth is watering just thinking about this place. The ramen noodles had so much body, but were so light at the same time, the broth was flavorful, and the pork belly was a true star of the show. The flavor was out of this word and melts in your mouth. The ramen was priced well for both quality and quantity, however the pork buns were very kind of expensive. 1 bun for $5 is steep for something that you can eat in 2-3 bites.

The gentleman that helped with my order was kind, but there was a lady who was running orders who was really rude. My friend and I sat at a table and she got mad. There was no &quot;reserved&quot; sign, and nobody said anything about how carry out worked. She was not pleasant at all. 

If you&apos;ve got a ramen craving (or even if you&apos;re not) this place will hit the spot. It&apos;s the perfect meal for lunch or dinner and carry out orders have great instructions on how to heat and handle them to get the best experience."
4,"When we visited, there was only outside dining due to CoVid regulations, and you had to make a reservation because there was a limited number of tables. The service was great! Our waitress was very friendly and even thought to ask us about any allergies. My husband has a shellfish allergy, so she was able to steer him in the correct direction regarding the ramen he should eat. 

I chose the fried chicken kimchi ramen which was delicious. I was worried that it would be too spicy, but it wasn&apos;t it, and it was really good. If you order any of the ramen entrees, make sure you are hungry, because all of them are enough for two meals. As a group, we shared the Berkshire dumplings and the Mantou Bun with Pork Belly. Both dishes were delicious, but the bun was amazing and almost enough food for a meal.

If you are interested in cocktails, I recommend the Pencillian #2."
4,"My boyfriend and I went to Chicago for a little couples vacation. After a night of drinking way to much Hennessy we decided to go for ramen for lunch since it&apos;s been a while since we&apos;ve had good ramen. On the Midwest anyway.... Jinya will always be my home favorite in Burbank CA. 
Anyway! The food!! It was so mouth watering I couldn&apos;t believe it. At first I thought it was weird and wasn&apos;t sure if I even wanted to order the kimchi and fried chicken. After reading the great reviews I had to try it. The place was cozy and welcoming the lighting was dim the employees in the front were so helpful to. The parking is shit so definitely DO NOT park across the street we seen a girl get towed because sometimes they don&apos;t allow it. We parked right in front per the waiter the safest place to park. 
We sat down and our waiter seemed like he just wanted us to rush ... weird. It got weirder. We literally had about 3-4 waiters/waitresses; didn&apos;t seem like they communicated that well with each other it was kind of all over the place. They rarely checked on us we had to flag them down. We ordered the kimchi fried chicken ramen and Sumo Ramen my boyfriend loved his until he tried mine and was like I&apos;m deff ordering that next time! We also had a house salad ... not that great loved how fresh the greens were the ginger dressing just seemed a bit off. We also had the sticky Thai chicken wings which were super delicious if you order them make sure you use your towelette after your hands get super sticky! Overall I loved the food didn&apos;t care for the customer service still tipped super well because hands down the ramen was SOOO good. The music is also super annoying we went about 1Pm on a Tuesday and the music was blasting as if I was in a house party. I&apos;m 28 not a old lady LOL not  exaggerating just was pretty annoying that me and my boyfriend were struggling the entire time for a conversation because we couldn&apos;t hear each other. 
Deff a must try! Get the kimchi fried chicken ramen you won&apos;t be disappointed!!"
5,"Great experience ! Good ramen and excellent service !
We do live in &quot;the new normal&quot; life - thank you for our waiter making a superb experience ! 
Loved Food !"
4,"I wasn&apos;t sure what I was expecting from this place. I&apos;ve had Lettuce Entertain You Ramen before from Tokio Pub so I was expecting roughly the same. I was thankfully incorrect as this food rocks (yes, I still love you Tokio Pub). 

We had a reservation and were promptly seated. My mom got a Yuzu Margarita. My dad got the Aschi beer and I had an Old Fashioned. All of our drinks were awesome, but special shout-out to my dads beer. I tried it and I was the real star. 

For appetizers, we got a little bit of everything. We were not sure on the fried chicken bun, but that was a huge surprise. It was crispy and had a nice spice. We also got the pork dumplings and chicken dumplings. The chicken dumplings were good, but the pork dumplings were really great! We finished the appetizers with the spicy Szechuan wings. It was a spice that was dry and snuck up on you. Still delicious! 

For our main course, we had the special crispy bacon ramen. It&apos;s around until the end of the month, but RUN to eat it. It was outstanding. It was so tasty! It was also huge! I got it with the Chili inside which gave a nice heat to it. The ramen already had a bit of a peppery kick so the chili might not have been needed. 

We finished up with a dessert of doughnuts with a Carmel vanilla dipping sauce. Heavenly! 

The only downside of the dinner was the environment. This is NOT a place for kids or families. I know that there are a lot of places like that, but not in LEYE. The seating was a bit restrictive and the music they play has quite a bit of swearing. I was there with my parents and felt a little weird, but It would be my scene with my friends! Our server was also fantastic so that&apos;s a big plus. 

In closing! I was floored by the quality of food at this place. I&apos;ll for sure be back, but with friends, not family :)"
5,"I&apos;m a pretty hard critique of Japanese ramen and to be honest, the ramen wasn&apos;t the best I&apos;ve had but I thoroughly enjoyed my overall experience here. The outdoor seating has a partially covered hut and heated lamps overhead the raised tables. Your legs will get chilly so I suggest bringing a blanket or scarf to wrap around your legs to stay warm if dining outside in the winter. Our waiter and staff were very efficient and polite - they visited often but not an annoying amount.  

I ordered the tonkatsu ramen and my boyfriend ordered the katsu tonkatsu (limited edition). Despite the weather being cold outside, our ramen came out very hot and stayed relatively hot until we finished our bowls. I believe the chasu in the tonkatsu was smoked - which was new to me. It surprisingly worked! It didn&apos;t look like a large quantity of meat but it was VERY dense. It filled me up pretty quickly. My ramen had too many bamboo shoots and wakame. I wish there was something light like mung bean sprouts to balance the heaviness and add some texture. The fried garlic was a GREAT addition  though - compliments to the chef on that one. 

The katsu tonkatsu had katsu sauce (like a sweet Japanese worchestire) and mustard wasabi. It significantly impacts the taste of the broth. It wasn&apos;t my cup of tea but my boyfriend enjoyed it. 

Giving this a 5 star because we were treated very well and had an overall good experience. Plus the many cute river north puppies walking by and saying hello put us in an especially good mood. 

Ramen-San is part of lettuce entertain you so make sure you have the app and collect points for dining in!"
4,"Walked in on the whim for lunch on a early Sunday afternoon. Was able to get a table right away. My bf and I both ordered the express lunch for $15.95, which included a ramen, a fried rice, a small salad and pickled cucumbers. Each item was a nicely sized portion and the food hit the spot. I&apos;d definitely recommend the express lunch route if it&apos;s available.

Service overall was attentive and friendly, but one person felt slightly pushy and should maybe reconsider his wording when asking us if we&apos;d like to try some Japanese whiskey instead of the &quot;well whiskey&quot; we originally ordered. The recommendation the first time around was fine, but his second attempt sounded pretty snarky and condescending. I&apos;m going to assume that wasn&apos;t his intention, but it def didn&apos;t encourage us to order more drinks."
3,"@BJH.  Thank you for the follow up.  When I&apos;m in Chicago next I will check in with you to see if the comments I made here have been resolved and will update this review. Thank you for taking the time to address my comments.  

A nice filling meal.  Chicago is not up there yet when it comes to Japanese restos. Los Angeles reigns supreme on Japanese food options on the mainland.  Still I&apos;m glad that Ramen-San exists albeit owned by Lettuce and not a Japan entity. 

First I had the vegan broth ramen.  It was good, the broth tepid, the tofu still cold in the middle.  

On a second visit I had the express lunch option with salmon over rice and small kimchee ramen with a &quot;molten&quot; egg. The broth was good, the &quot;molten&quot; egg was perfect but I only got a half an egg.  The salmon was bathed in sugary sweet sauce that was off putting.  It didn&apos;t go well with the kimchee ramen as next to it, I felt I was eating dessert over steamed rice. 

Loved the service, the outdoor eating options and the coo coo Captain America mugs."
4,"Chicago literally has the best food! The last time I came to Chicago I went to their sister restaurant sushi San which has amazing food. I love a great Ramen!
Due to Covid and the new mandate we had to sit outside, but luckily they had heating lamps and it was a very sunny day.

The Ramen had thick pork pieces that were so tender and juicy. The broth was so delicious, I wish I could eat about 3 bowls of it... lol. 

Ramen san definitely did not disappoint and I will definitely be coming back the next time I visit Chicago"
1,"Server was more concerned about us wearing masks than getting the order right. They completely messed up our order. Also, the seats are extremely uncomfortable wooden benches meant for little kids. Never going here again."
2,"Hate to do this. Excellent packaging, good enough service, no heating outside, and mediocre ramen. 

Try another spot or make instant."
5,"Chicago was cold sooo cold so my boyfriend and I were eager to get something warm in our tummies. Due to covid the wait was longer than expected even tho we had reservations, but the service and amazing food triumphed that small negative for me. The ramen....bruh the ramen was so freaking delicious. It&apos;s def a top two on my ramen list. The Penicillin # 2 wasn&apos;t too strong in my opinion, but still tasty. Because we had to wait longer than expected they offered us some complimentary hot donuts. I thought the gesture was very kind. Lowkey want to take a trip back up there to get back in on this goodness."
2,"I try to order from local spots 1-2x/week during the pandemic to support local businesses. It&apos;s a cold evening so ramen sounded good and I haven&apos;t ordered from Ramen-San yet. 

I ordered via Uber Eats for delivery because it was a little too far for pick up. It estimated 65-85 minutes which was okay and I can understand given it&apos;s a weekend evening. 

But it took over 2 hours to get my food. I watched the tracker and it was clear that the delay was due to the restaurant, not Uber. When I got it, it was ice cold. The fried chicken was soft and appeared to have been sitting for a long time - way longer than the 20 minutes from pick up to my door. Also, there were no utensils! What kind of ramen place doesn&apos;t give chop sticks with an order?!

The food was okay tasting - no better than other places I&apos;ve tried in the city. At the beginning of the pandemic I gave restaurants a lot of grace because of the pivots that most needed to make. But we are a year into this and an efficient delivery process should be in place so food isn&apos;t ice cold and basic utensils are given. With all the great food places in Chicago, probably won&apos;t come back."
4,My husband insisted on trying this spot after a recommendation from friends.  They did not steer us wrong. We tried a fried chicken bowl &amp; a miso bowl with an egg.  Extra noodles are a must my friends!  The broth....wow. Such depth that elevated the toppings. Will definitely try again in the future.
4,Pretty good place. Service was spot on. Server was kind and friendly. Food was tasty and serving size was appropriate. Nothing really beats a steaming hot bowl of ramen on a freezing night. Also got the miso Brussels sprouts but found them a touch too salty but still good. Will come back to try more.

Extra noodles are a must my friends!  The broth....wow. Such depth that elevated the toppings. Will definitely try again in the future.
4,Pretty good place. Service was spot on. Server was kind and friendly. Food was tasty and serving size was appropriate. Nothing really beats a steaming hot bowl of ramen on a freezing night. Also got the miso Brussels sprouts but found them a touch too salty but still good. Will come back to try more.
5,"We sample a little everything...drinks, wings, Brussels sprouts, ramen and salad. All delicious!"
4,"Took Ramen-San to go on a rainy night for some comfort food. Super easy to pick up and the ramen toppings were packaged separately from the broth so sogginess was not an issue. 

I ordered the Tonkatsu ramen, the Kimchi Fried Chicken ramen, and the sticky Thai chicken wings. The Tonkatsu was overall really delicious and the broth was on point. I&apos;d definitely order this a second time! The Kimchi Fried Chicken ramen broth was nice and spicy, the chicken pieces were large, but the noodles were a little crusty. I would describe the ramen dishes as mainstream, but they still keep most of the traditional elements of an authentic ramen bowl."
4,"I came here with a party of 4 during the COVID pandemic and appreciated how well organized and accommodating the staff was during these interesting times! This is one of the limited indoor/outdoor dining places outside of Chicago and our party really appreciated the time and effort this restaurant put in! 
The hot broth, hot sake, on a cold winter night in Chicago, how can you go wrong? 
To start we order the karaage chicken with ailoi and it&apos;s perfect to start without getting yourself too full. We ended up ordering ordering 2 orders because of the sides, but this was because we were blinded on the sizes of the ramen! Which is a great segway to: 
The Ramen:
You can&apos;t go wrong with the toncatshu ramen, comes with a soft-boil egg and pork belly! The rest of the group ordered the spicy ramen and apparently it was just as spicy as our waiter warned us. So if you&apos;re not into spice, please double check with your waiter! 
The broth was perfect and creamy, not too overwhelming to the point where you can&apos;t drink it by itself. The egg noodles was fresh and plentiful! If you want you can order a refill, but I barely finished my first serving. 
The pork belly was fresh and nicely fried and made a great compliant with the soft-boiled egg. 
All in all I can say, the next time I&apos;m in Chicago, I will be sure to make a ramen stop here, especially with the weather and location of the restaurant! 
Great job Ramen-San"
3,"Karraage chicken (chicken nuggets) - my Fiancé enjoyed these. They were lightly battered and lightly seasoned as well.

Raw tuna- this was delicious! The tuna and avocado were fresh &amp; completed each other. The chip it was a little too salty for me but it was still enjoyable! 

Buns 
Fried chicken buns- was not a fan of the horseradish in it. I felt like it over powered the flavor of the chicken and had too much in mine. 

Chicken wings 
Spicy Szechuan- this was dry rub and had a great sauce to go with it. I would have liked a little more flavor in these wings otherwise I probably would not get this again. 

Sticky Thai- these were wet and flavorful definitely enjoyed these more than the Szechuan 

Dumpling
Crispy Berkshire- these were crispy and had a decent amount of meat in the dumpling. 

Ramen 
Kimchi &amp; fried chicken- first time trying fried chicken ramen and was not a fan. I will definitely be sticking to my regular pork. The noddles were also harder than usual, it might have needed to be cooked for longer 

Drinks 
Yuzu margarita- this was refreshing and decent

yuzu Saki- very sweet with a strong taste of lemon and grapefruit"
5,"I had an appointment downtown and it was cold out!  I&apos;ve been meaning to try this place for quite some time.  Eating out during Covid times are quite different.  Ramen SAN take no chances.  The place was immaculate and they take your temperature at the entrance.  The social distancing tables are far enough apart and quite safe.  The staff wears masks and gloves and there&apos;s sanitizer there for you.  

As for the food, I tried the chicken and vegetable Gyoza and the Imperial Shio.  The food came out quickly and super hot.  Everything tasted so nice and looked so clean.  

My experience was very positive even during these tough times."
4,"My mouth is watering just thinking about this place. The ramen noodles had so much body, but were so light at the same time, the broth was flavorful, and the pork belly was a true star of the show. The flavor was out of this word and melts in your mouth. The ramen was priced well for both quality and quantity, however the pork buns were very kind of expensive. 1 bun for $5 is steep for something that you can eat in 2-3 bites.

The gentleman that helped with my order was kind, but there was a lady who was running orders who was really rude. My friend and I sat at a table and she got mad. There was no &quot;reserved&quot; sign, and nobody said anything about how carry out worked. She was not pleasant at all. 

If you&apos;ve got a ramen craving (or even if you&apos;re not) this place will hit the spot. It&apos;s the perfect meal for lunch or dinner and carry out orders have great instructions on how to heat and handle them to get the best experience."
4,"When we visited, there was only outside dining due to CoVid regulations, and you had to make a reservation because there was a limited number of tables. The service was great! Our waitress was very friendly and even thought to ask us about any allergies. My husband has a shellfish allergy, so she was able to steer him in the correct direction regarding the ramen he should eat. 

I chose the fried chicken kimchi ramen which was delicious. I was worried that it would be too spicy, but it wasn&apos;t it, and it was really good. If you order any of the ramen entrees, make sure you are hungry, because all of them are enough for two meals. As a group, we shared the Berkshire dumplings and the Mantou Bun with Pork Belly. Both dishes were delicious, but the bun was amazing and almost enough food for a meal.

If you are interested in cocktails, I recommend the Pencillian #2."
4,"My boyfriend and I went to Chicago for a little couples vacation. After a night of drinking way to much Hennessy we decided to go for ramen for lunch since it&apos;s been a while since we&apos;ve had good ramen. On the Midwest anyway.... Jinya will always be my home favorite in Burbank CA. 
Anyway! The food!! It was so mouth watering I couldn&apos;t believe it. At first I thought it was weird and wasn&apos;t sure if I even wanted to order the kimchi and fried chicken. After reading the great reviews I had to try it. The place was cozy and welcoming the lighting was dim the employees in the front were so helpful to. The parking is shit so definitely DO NOT park across the street we seen a girl get towed because sometimes they don&apos;t allow it. We parked right in front per the waiter the safest place to park. 
We sat down and our waiter seemed like he just wanted us to rush ... weird. It got weirder. We literally had about 3-4 waiters/waitresses; didn&apos;t seem like they communicated that well with each other it was kind of all over the place. They rarely checked on us we had to flag them down. We ordered the kimchi fried chicken ramen and Sumo Ramen my boyfriend loved his until he tried mine and was like I&apos;m deff ordering that next time! We also had a house salad ... not that great loved how fresh the greens were the ginger dressing just seemed a bit off. We also had the sticky Thai chicken wings which were super delicious if you order them make sure you use your towelette after your hands get super sticky! Overall I loved the food didn&apos;t care for the customer service still tipped super well because hands down the ramen was SOOO good. The music is also super annoying we went about 1Pm on a Tuesday and the music was blasting as if I was in a house party. I&apos;m 28 not a old lady LOL not  exaggerating just was pretty annoying that me and my boyfriend were struggling the entire time for a conversation because we couldn&apos;t hear each other. 
Deff a must try! Get the kimchi fried chicken ramen you won&apos;t be disappointed!!"
5,"Great experience ! Good ramen and excellent service !
We do live in &quot;the new normal&quot; life - thank you for our waiter making a superb experience ! 
Loved Food !"
4,"I wasn&apos;t sure what I was expecting from this place. I&apos;ve had Lettuce Entertain You Ramen before from Tokio Pub so I was expecting roughly the same. I was thankfully incorrect as this food rocks (yes, I still love you Tokio Pub). 

We had a reservation and were promptly seated. My mom got a Yuzu Margarita. My dad got the Aschi beer and I had an Old Fashioned. All of our drinks were awesome, but special shout-out to my dads beer. I tried it and I was the real star. 

For appetizers, we got a little bit of everything. We were not sure on the fried chicken bun, but that was a huge surprise. It was crispy and had a nice spice. We also got the pork dumplings and chicken dumplings. The chicken dumplings were good, but the pork dumplings were really great! We finished the appetizers with the spicy Szechuan wings. It was a spice that was dry and snuck up on you. Still delicious! 

For our main course, we had the special crispy bacon ramen. It&apos;s around until the end of the month, but RUN to eat it. It was outstanding. It was so tasty! It was also huge! I got it with the Chili inside which gave a nice heat to it. The ramen already had a bit of a peppery kick so the chili might not have been needed. 

We finished up with a dessert of doughnuts with a Carmel vanilla dipping sauce. Heavenly! 

The only downside of the dinner was the environment. This is NOT a place for kids or families. I know that there are a lot of places like that, but not in LEYE. The seating was a bit restrictive and the music they play has quite a bit of swearing. I was there with my parents and felt a little weird, but It would be my scene with my friends! Our server was also fantastic so that&apos;s a big plus. 

In closing! I was floored by the quality of food at this place. I&apos;ll for sure be back, but with friends, not family :)"
5,"I&apos;m a pretty hard critique of Japanese ramen and to be honest, the ramen wasn&apos;t the best I&apos;ve had but I thoroughly enjoyed my overall experience here. The outdoor seating has a partially covered hut and heated lamps overhead the raised tables. Your legs will get chilly so I suggest bringing a blanket or scarf to wrap around your legs to stay warm if dining outside in the winter. Our waiter and staff were very efficient and polite - they visited often but not an annoying amount.  

I ordered the tonkatsu ramen and my boyfriend ordered the katsu tonkatsu (limited edition). Despite the weather being cold outside, our ramen came out very hot and stayed relatively hot until we finished our bowls. I believe the chasu in the tonkatsu was smoked - which was new to me. It surprisingly worked! It didn&apos;t look like a large quantity of meat but it was VERY dense. It filled me up pretty quickly. My ramen had too many bamboo shoots and wakame. I wish there was something light like mung bean sprouts to balance the heaviness and add some texture. The fried garlic was a GREAT addition  though - compliments to the chef on that one. 

The katsu tonkatsu had katsu sauce (like a sweet Japanese worchestire) and mustard wasabi. It significantly impacts the taste of the broth. It wasn&apos;t my cup of tea but my boyfriend enjoyed it. 

Giving this a 5 star because we were treated very well and had an overall good experience. Plus the many cute river north puppies walking by and saying hello put us in an especially good mood. 

Ramen-San is part of lettuce entertain you so make sure you have the app and collect points for dining in!"
4,"Walked in on the whim for lunch on a early Sunday afternoon. Was able to get a table right away. My bf and I both ordered the express lunch for $15.95, which included a ramen, a fried rice, a small salad and pickled cucumbers. Each item was a nicely sized portion and the food hit the spot. I&apos;d definitely recommend the express lunch route if it&apos;s available.

Service overall was attentive and friendly, but one person felt slightly pushy and should maybe reconsider his wording when asking us if we&apos;d like to try some Japanese whiskey instead of the &quot;well whiskey&quot; we originally ordered. The recommendation the first time around was fine, but his second attempt sounded pretty snarky and condescending. I&apos;m going to assume that wasn&apos;t his intention, but it def didn&apos;t encourage us to order more drinks."
3,"@BJH.  Thank you for the follow up.  When I&apos;m in Chicago next I will check in with you to see if the comments I made here have been resolved and will update this review. Thank you for taking the time to address my comments.  

A nice filling meal.  Chicago is not up there yet when it comes to Japanese restos. Los Angeles reigns supreme on Japanese food options on the mainland.  Still I&apos;m glad that Ramen-San exists albeit owned by Lettuce and not a Japan entity. 

First I had the vegan broth ramen.  It was good, the broth tepid, the tofu still cold in the middle.  

On a second visit I had the express lunch option with salmon over rice and small kimchee ramen with a &quot;molten&quot; egg. The broth was good, the &quot;molten&quot; egg was perfect but I only got a half an egg.  The salmon was bathed in sugary sweet sauce that was off putting.  It didn&apos;t go well with the kimchee ramen as next to it, I felt I was eating dessert over steamed rice. 

Loved the service, the outdoor eating options and the coo coo Captain America mugs."
4,"Chicago literally has the best food! The last time I came to Chicago I went to their sister restaurant sushi San which has amazing food. I love a great Ramen!
Due to Covid and the new mandate we had to sit outside, but luckily they had heating lamps and it was a very sunny day.

The Ramen had thick pork pieces that were so tender and juicy. The broth was so delicious, I wish I could eat about 3 bowls of it... lol. 

Ramen san definitely did not disappoint and I will definitely be coming back the next time I visit Chicago"
1,"Server was more concerned about us wearing masks than getting the order right. They completely messed up our order. Also, the seats are extremely uncomfortable wooden benches meant for little kids. Never going here again."
2,"Hate to do this. Excellent packaging, good enough service, no heating outside, and mediocre ramen. 

Try another spot or make instant."
5,"Chicago was cold sooo cold so my boyfriend and I were eager to get something warm in our tummies. Due to covid the wait was longer than expected even tho we had reservations, but the service and amazing food triumphed that small negative for me. The ramen....bruh the ramen was so freaking delicious. It&apos;s def a top two on my ramen list. The Penicillin # 2 wasn&apos;t too strong in my opinion, but still tasty. Because we had to wait longer than expected they offered us some complimentary hot donuts. I thought the gesture was very kind. Lowkey want to take a trip back up there to get back in on this goodness."
2,"I try to order from local spots 1-2x/week during the pandemic to support local businesses. It&apos;s a cold evening so ramen sounded good and I haven&apos;t ordered from Ramen-San yet. 

I ordered via Uber Eats for delivery because it was a little too far for pick up. It estimated 65-85 minutes which was okay and I can understand given it&apos;s a weekend evening. 

But it took over 2 hours to get my food. I watched the tracker and it was clear that the delay was due to the restaurant, not Uber. When I got it, it was ice cold. The fried chicken was soft and appeared to have been sitting for a long time - way longer than the 20 minutes from pick up to my door. Also, there were no utensils! What kind of ramen place doesn&apos;t give chop sticks with an order?!

The food was okay tasting - no better than other places I&apos;ve tried in the city. At the beginning of the pandemic I gave restaurants a lot of grace because of the pivots that most needed to make. But we are a year into this and an efficient delivery process should be in place so food isn&apos;t ice cold and basic utensils are given. With all the great food places in Chicago, probably won&apos;t come back."

The food was okay tasting - no better than other places I&apos;ve tried in the city. At the beginning of the pandemic I gave restaurants a lot of grace because of the pivots that most needed to make. But we are a year into this and an efficient delivery process should be in place so food isn&apos;t ice cold and basic utensils are given. With all the great food places in Chicago, probably won&apos;t come back."
4,My husband insisted on trying this spot after a recommendation from friends.  They did not steer us wrong. We tried a fried chicken bowl &amp; a miso bowl with an egg.  Extra noodles are a must my friends!  The broth....wow. Such depth that elevated the toppings. Will definitely try again in the future.
4,Pretty good place. Service was spot on. Server was kind and friendly. Food was tasty and serving size was appropriate. Nothing really beats a steaming hot bowl of ramen on a freezing night. Also got the miso Brussels sprouts but found them a touch too salty but still good. Will come back to try more.
5,"We sample a little everything...drinks, wings, Brussels sprouts, ramen and salad. All delicious!"
4,"Took Ramen-San to go on a rainy night for some comfort food. Super easy to pick up and the ramen toppings were packaged separately from the broth so sogginess was not an issue. 

I ordered the Tonkatsu ramen, the Kimchi Fried Chicken ramen, and the sticky Thai chicken wings. The Tonkatsu was overall really delicious and the broth was on point. I&apos;d definitely order this a second time! The Kimchi Fried Chicken ramen broth was nice and spicy, the chicken pieces were large, but the noodles were a little crusty. I would describe the ramen dishes as mainstream, but they still keep most of the traditional elements of an authentic ramen bowl."
4,"I came here with a party of 4 during the COVID pandemic and appreciated how well organized and accommodating the staff was during these interesting times! This is one of the limited indoor/outdoor dining places outside of Chicago and our party really appreciated the time and effort this restaurant put in! 
The hot broth, hot sake, on a cold winter night in Chicago, how can you go wrong? 
To start we order the karaage chicken with ailoi and it&apos;s perfect to start without getting yourself too full. We ended up ordering ordering 2 orders because of the sides, but this was because we were blinded on the sizes of the ramen! Which is a great segway to: 
The Ramen:
You can&apos;t go wrong with the toncatshu ramen, comes with a soft-boil egg and pork belly! The rest of the group ordered the spicy ramen and apparently it was just as spicy as our waiter warned us. So if you&apos;re not into spice, please double check with your waiter! 
The broth was perfect and creamy, not too overwhelming to the point where you can&apos;t drink it by itself. The egg noodles was fresh and plentiful! If you want you can order a refill, but I barely finished my first serving. 
The pork belly was fresh and nicely fried and made a great compliant with the soft-boiled egg. 
All in all I can say, the next time I&apos;m in Chicago, I will be sure to make a ramen stop here, especially with the weather and location of the restaurant! 
Great job Ramen-San"
3,"Karraage chicken (chicken nuggets) - my Fiancé enjoyed these. They were lightly battered and lightly seasoned as well.

Raw tuna- this was delicious! The tuna and avocado were fresh &amp; completed each other. The chip it was a little too salty for me but it was still enjoyable! 

Buns 
Fried chicken buns- was not a fan of the horseradish in it. I felt like it over powered the flavor of the chicken and had too much in mine. 

Chicken wings 
Spicy Szechuan- this was dry rub and had a great sauce to go with it. I would have liked a little more flavor in these wings otherwise I probably would not get this again. 

Sticky Thai- these were wet and flavorful definitely enjoyed these more than the Szechuan 

Dumpling
Crispy Berkshire- these were crispy and had a decent amount of meat in the dumpling. 

Ramen 
Kimchi &amp; fried chicken- first time trying fried chicken ramen and was not a fan. I will definitely be sticking to my regular pork. The noddles were also harder than usual, it might have needed to be cooked for longer 

Drinks 
Yuzu margarita- this was refreshing and decent

yuzu Saki- very sweet with a strong taste of lemon and grapefruit"
5,"I had an appointment downtown and it was cold out!  I&apos;ve been meaning to try this place for quite some time.  Eating out during Covid times are quite different.  Ramen SAN take no chances.  The place was immaculate and they take your temperature at the entrance.  The social distancing tables are far enough apart and quite safe.  The staff wears masks and gloves and there&apos;s sanitizer there for you.  

As for the food, I tried the chicken and vegetable Gyoza and the Imperial Shio.  The food came out quickly and super hot.  Everything tasted so nice and looked so clean.  

My experience was very positive even during these tough times."
4,"My mouth is watering just thinking about this place. The ramen noodles had so much body, but were so light at the same time, the broth was flavorful, and the pork belly was a true star of the show. The flavor was out of this word and melts in your mouth. The ramen was priced well for both quality and quantity, however the pork buns were very kind of expensive. 1 bun for $5 is steep for something that you can eat in 2-3 bites.

The gentleman that helped with my order was kind, but there was a lady who was running orders who was really rude. My friend and I sat at a table and she got mad. There was no &quot;reserved&quot; sign, and nobody said anything about how carry out worked. She was not pleasant at all. 

If you&apos;ve got a ramen craving (or even if you&apos;re not) this place will hit the spot. It&apos;s the perfect meal for lunch or dinner and carry out orders have great instructions on how to heat and handle them to get the best experience."
4,"When we visited, there was only outside dining due to CoVid regulations, and you had to make a reservation because there was a limited number of tables. The service was great! Our waitress was very friendly and even thought to ask us about any allergies. My husband has a shellfish allergy, so she was able to steer him in the correct direction regarding the ramen he should eat. 

I chose the fried chicken kimchi ramen which was delicious. I was worried that it would be too spicy, but it wasn&apos;t it, and it was really good. If you order any of the ramen entrees, make sure you are hungry, because all of them are enough for two meals. As a group, we shared the Berkshire dumplings and the Mantou Bun with Pork Belly. Both dishes were delicious, but the bun was amazing and almost enough food for a meal.

If you are interested in cocktails, I recommend the Pencillian #2."
4,"My boyfriend and I went to Chicago for a little couples vacation. After a night of drinking way to much Hennessy we decided to go for ramen for lunch since it&apos;s been a while since we&apos;ve had good ramen. On the Midwest anyway.... Jinya will always be my home favorite in Burbank CA. 
Anyway! The food!! It was so mouth watering I couldn&apos;t believe it. At first I thought it was weird and wasn&apos;t sure if I even wanted to order the kimchi and fried chicken. After reading the great reviews I had to try it. The place was cozy and welcoming the lighting was dim the employees in the front were so helpful to. The parking is shit so definitely DO NOT park across the street we seen a girl get towed because sometimes they don&apos;t allow it. We parked right in front per the waiter the safest place to park. 
We sat down and our waiter seemed like he just wanted us to rush ... weird. It got weirder. We literally had about 3-4 waiters/waitresses; didn&apos;t seem like they communicated that well with each other it was kind of all over the place. They rarely checked on us we had to flag them down. We ordered the kimchi fried chicken ramen and Sumo Ramen my boyfriend loved his until he tried mine and was like I&apos;m deff ordering that next time! We also had a house salad ... not that great loved how fresh the greens were the ginger dressing just seemed a bit off. We also had the sticky Thai chicken wings which were super delicious if you order them make sure you use your towelette after your hands get super sticky! Overall I loved the food didn&apos;t care for the customer service still tipped super well because hands down the ramen was SOOO good. The music is also super annoying we went about 1Pm on a Tuesday and the music was blasting as if I was in a house party. I&apos;m 28 not a old lady LOL not  exaggerating just was pretty annoying that me and my boyfriend were struggling the entire time for a conversation because we couldn&apos;t hear each other. 
Deff a must try! Get the kimchi fried chicken ramen you won&apos;t be disappointed!!"
5,"Great experience ! Good ramen and excellent service !
We do live in &quot;the new normal&quot; life - thank you for our waiter making a superb experience ! 
Loved Food !"
4,"I wasn&apos;t sure what I was expecting from this place. I&apos;ve had Lettuce Entertain You Ramen before from Tokio Pub so I was expecting roughly the same. I was thankfully incorrect as this food rocks (yes, I still love you Tokio Pub). 

We had a reservation and were promptly seated. My mom got a Yuzu Margarita. My dad got the Aschi beer and I had an Old Fashioned. All of our drinks were awesome, but special shout-out to my dads beer. I tried it and I was the real star. 

For appetizers, we got a little bit of everything. We were not sure on the fried chicken bun, but that was a huge surprise. It was crispy and had a nice spice. We also got the pork dumplings and chicken dumplings. The chicken dumplings were good, but the pork dumplings were really great! We finished the appetizers with the spicy Szechuan wings. It was a spice that was dry and snuck up on you. Still delicious! 

For our main course, we had the special crispy bacon ramen. It&apos;s around until the end of the month, but RUN to eat it. It was outstanding. It was so tasty! It was also huge! I got it with the Chili inside which gave a nice heat to it. The ramen already had a bit of a peppery kick so the chili might not have been needed. 

We finished up with a dessert of doughnuts with a Carmel vanilla dipping sauce. Heavenly! 

The only downside of the dinner was the environment. This is NOT a place for kids or families. I know that there are a lot of places like that, but not in LEYE. The seating was a bit restrictive and the music they play has quite a bit of swearing. I was there with my parents and felt a little weird, but It would be my scene with my friends! Our server was also fantastic so that&apos;s a big plus. 

In closing! I was floored by the quality of food at this place. I&apos;ll for sure be back, but with friends, not family :)"
5,"I&apos;m a pretty hard critique of Japanese ramen and to be honest, the ramen wasn&apos;t the best I&apos;ve had but I thoroughly enjoyed my overall experience here. The outdoor seating has a partially covered hut and heated lamps overhead the raised tables. Your legs will get chilly so I suggest bringing a blanket or scarf to wrap around your legs to stay warm if dining outside in the winter. Our waiter and staff were very efficient and polite - they visited often but not an annoying amount.  

I ordered the tonkatsu ramen and my boyfriend ordered the katsu tonkatsu (limited edition). Despite the weather being cold outside, our ramen came out very hot and stayed relatively hot until we finished our bowls. I believe the chasu in the tonkatsu was smoked - which was new to me. It surprisingly worked! It didn&apos;t look like a large quantity of meat but it was VERY dense. It filled me up pretty quickly. My ramen had too many bamboo shoots and wakame. I wish there was something light like mung bean sprouts to balance the heaviness and add some texture. The fried garlic was a GREAT addition  though - compliments to the chef on that one. 

The katsu tonkatsu had katsu sauce (like a sweet Japanese worchestire) and mustard wasabi. It significantly impacts the taste of the broth. It wasn&apos;t my cup of tea but my boyfriend enjoyed it. 

Giving this a 5 star because we were treated very well and had an overall good experience. Plus the many cute river north puppies walking by and saying hello put us in an especially good mood. 

Ramen-San is part of lettuce entertain you so make sure you have the app and collect points for dining in!"
4,"Walked in on the whim for lunch on a early Sunday afternoon. Was able to get a table right away. My bf and I both ordered the express lunch for $15.95, which included a ramen, a fried rice, a small salad and pickled cucumbers. Each item was a nicely sized portion and the food hit the spot. I&apos;d definitely recommend the express lunch route if it&apos;s available.

Service overall was attentive and friendly, but one person felt slightly pushy and should maybe reconsider his wording when asking us if we&apos;d like to try some Japanese whiskey instead of the &quot;well whiskey&quot; we originally ordered. The recommendation the first time around was fine, but his second attempt sounded pretty snarky and condescending. I&apos;m going to assume that wasn&apos;t his intention, but it def didn&apos;t encourage us to order more drinks."
3,"@BJH.  Thank you for the follow up.  When I&apos;m in Chicago next I will check in with you to see if the comments I made here have been resolved and will update this review. Thank you for taking the time to address my comments.  

A nice filling meal.  Chicago is not up there yet when it comes to Japanese restos. Los Angeles reigns supreme on Japanese food options on the mainland.  Still I&apos;m glad that Ramen-San exists albeit owned by Lettuce and not a Japan entity. 

First I had the vegan broth ramen.  It was good, the broth tepid, the tofu still cold in the middle.  

On a second visit I had the express lunch option with salmon over rice and small kimchee ramen with a &quot;molten&quot; egg. The broth was good, the &quot;molten&quot; egg was perfect but I only got a half an egg.  The salmon was bathed in sugary sweet sauce that was off putting.  It didn&apos;t go well with the kimchee ramen as next to it, I felt I was eating dessert over steamed rice. 

Loved the service, the outdoor eating options and the coo coo Captain America mugs."
4,"Chicago literally has the best food! The last time I came to Chicago I went to their sister restaurant sushi San which has amazing food. I love a great Ramen!
Due to Covid and the new mandate we had to sit outside, but luckily they had heating lamps and it was a very sunny day.

The Ramen had thick pork pieces that were so tender and juicy. The broth was so delicious, I wish I could eat about 3 bowls of it... lol. 

Ramen san definitely did not disappoint and I will definitely be coming back the next time I visit Chicago"

2,"Hate to do this. Excellent packaging, good enough service, no heating outside, and mediocre ramen. 

Try another spot or make instant."
5,"Chicago was cold sooo cold so my boyfriend and I were eager to get something warm in our tummies. Due to covid the wait was longer than expected even tho we had reservations, but the service and amazing food triumphed that small negative for me. The ramen....bruh the ramen was so freaking delicious. It&apos;s def a top two on my ramen list. The Penicillin # 2 wasn&apos;t too strong in my opinion, but still tasty. Because we had to wait longer than expected they offered us some complimentary hot donuts. I thought the gesture was very kind. Lowkey want to take a trip back up there to get back in on this goodness."
2,"I try to order from local spots 1-2x/week during the pandemic to support local businesses. It&apos;s a cold evening so ramen sounded good and I haven&apos;t ordered from Ramen-San yet. 

I ordered via Uber Eats for delivery because it was a little too far for pick up. It estimated 65-85 minutes which was okay and I can understand given it&apos;s a weekend evening. 

But it took over 2 hours to get my food. I watched the tracker and it was clear that the delay was due to the restaurant, not Uber. When I got it, it was ice cold. The fried chicken was soft and appeared to have been sitting for a long time - way longer than the 20 minutes from pick up to my door. Also, there were no utensils!

But it took over 2 hours to get my food. I watched the tracker and it was clear that the delay was due to the restaurant, not Uber. When I got it, it was ice cold. The fried chicken was soft and appeared to have been sitting for a long time - way longer than the 20 minutes from pick up to my door. Also, there were no utensils! What kind of ramen place doesn&apos;t give chop sticks with an order?!

The food was okay tasting - no better than other places I&apos;ve tried in the city. At the beginning of the pandemic I gave restaurants a lot of grace because of the pivots that most needed to make. But we are a year into this and an efficient delivery process should be in place so food isn&apos;t ice cold and basic utensils are given. With all the great food places in Chicago, probably won&apos;t come back."
4,My husband insisted on trying this spot after a recommendation from friends.  They did not steer us wrong. We tried a fried chicken bowl &amp; a miso bowl with an egg.  Extra noodles are a must my friends!  The broth....wow. Such depth that elevated the toppings. Will definitely try again in the future.
4,Pretty good place. Service was spot on. Server was kind and friendly. Food was tasty and serving size was appropriate. Nothing really beats a steaming hot bowl of ramen on a freezing night. Also got the miso Brussels sprouts but found them a touch too salty but still good. Will come back to try more.
5,"We sample a little everything...drinks, wings, Brussels sprouts, ramen and salad. All delicious!"
4,"Took Ramen-San to go on a rainy night for some comfort food. Super easy to pick up and the ramen toppings were packaged separately from the broth so sogginess was not an issue. 

I ordered the Tonkatsu ramen, the Kimchi Fried Chicken ramen, and the sticky Thai chicken wings. The Tonkatsu was overall really delicious and the broth was on point. I&apos;d definitely order this a second time! The Kimchi Fried Chicken ramen broth was nice and spicy, the chicken pieces were large, but the noodles were a little crusty. I would describe the ramen dishes as mainstream, but they still keep most of the traditional elements of an authentic ramen bowl."
4,"I came here with a party of 4 during the COVID pandemic and appreciated how well organized and accommodating the staff was during these interesting times! This is one of the limited indoor/outdoor dining places outside of Chicago and our party really appreciated the time and effort this restaurant put in! 
The hot broth, hot sake, on a cold winter night in Chicago, how can you go wrong? 
To start we order the karaage chicken with ailoi and it&apos;s perfect to start without getting yourself too full. We ended up ordering ordering 2 orders because of the sides, but this was because we were blinded on the sizes of the ramen! Which is a great segway to: 
The Ramen:
You can&apos;t go wrong with the toncatshu ramen, comes with a soft-boil egg and pork belly! The rest of the group ordered the spicy ramen and apparently it was just as spicy as our waiter warned us. So if you&apos;re not into spice, please double check with your waiter! 
The broth was perfect and creamy, not too overwhelming to the point where you can&apos;t drink it by itself. The egg noodles was fresh and plentiful! If you want you can order a refill, but I barely finished my first serving. 
The pork belly was fresh and nicely fried and made a great compliant with the soft-boiled egg. 
All in all I can say, the next time I&apos;m in Chicago, I will be sure to make a ramen stop here, especially with the weather and location of the restaurant! 
Great job Ramen-San"
3,"Karraage chicken (chicken nuggets) - my Fiancé enjoyed these. They were lightly battered and lightly seasoned as well.

Raw tuna- this was delicious! The tuna and avocado were fresh &amp; completed each other. The chip it was a little too salty for me but it was still enjoyable! 

Buns 
Fried chicken buns- was not a fan of the horseradish in it. I felt like it over powered the flavor of the chicken and had too much in mine. 

Chicken wings 
Spicy Szechuan- this was dry rub and had a great sauce to go with it. I would have liked a little more flavor in these wings otherwise I probably would not get this again. 

Sticky Thai- these were wet and flavorful definitely enjoyed these more than the Szechuan 

Dumpling
Crispy Berkshire- these were crispy and had a decent amount of meat in the dumpling. 

Ramen 
Kimchi &amp; fried chicken- first time trying fried chicken ramen and was not a fan. I will definitely be sticking to my regular pork. The noddles were also harder than usual, it might have needed to be cooked for longer 

Drinks 
Yuzu margarita- this was refreshing and decent

yuzu Saki- very sweet with a strong taste of lemon and grapefruit"
5,"I had an appointment downtown and it was cold out!  I&apos;ve been meaning to try this place for quite some time.  Eating out during Covid times are quite different.  Ramen SAN take no chances.  The place was immaculate and they take your temperature at the entrance.  The social distancing tables are far enough apart and quite safe.  The staff wears masks and gloves and there&apos;s sanitizer there for you.  

As for the food, I tried the chicken and vegetable Gyoza and the Imperial Shio.  The food came out quickly and super hot.  Everything tasted so nice and looked so clean.  

My experience was very positive even during these tough times."
4,"My mouth is watering just thinking about this place. The ramen noodles had so much body, but were so light at the same time, the broth was flavorful, and the pork belly was a true star of the show. The flavor was out of this word and melts in your mouth. The ramen was priced well for both quality and quantity, however the pork buns were very kind of expensive. 1 bun for $5 is steep for something that you can eat in 2-3 bites.

The gentleman that helped with my order was kind, but there was a lady who was running orders who was really rude. My friend and I sat at a table and she got mad. There was no &quot;reserved&quot; sign, and nobody said anything about how carry out worked. She was not pleasant at all. 

If you&apos;ve got a ramen craving (or even if you&apos;re not) this place will hit the spot. It&apos;s the perfect meal for lunch or dinner and carry out orders have great instructions on how to heat and handle them to get the best experience."
4,"When we visited, there was only outside dining due to CoVid regulations, and you had to make a reservation because there was a limited number of tables. The service was great! Our waitress was very friendly and even thought to ask us about any allergies. My husband has a shellfish allergy, so she was able to steer him in the correct direction regarding the ramen he should eat. 

I chose the fried chicken kimchi ramen which was delicious. I was worried that it would be too spicy, but it wasn&apos;t it, and it was really good. If you order any of the ramen entrees, make sure you are hungry, because all of them are enough for two meals. As a group, we shared the Berkshire dumplings and the Mantou Bun with Pork Belly. Both dishes were delicious, but the bun was amazing and almost enough food for a meal.

If you are interested in cocktails, I recommend the Pencillian #2."
4,"My boyfriend and I went to Chicago for a little couples vacation. After a night of drinking way to much Hennessy we decided to go for ramen for lunch since it&apos;s been a while since we&apos;ve had good ramen. On the Midwest anyway.... Jinya will always be my home favorite in Burbank CA. 
Anyway! The food!! It was so mouth watering I couldn&apos;t believe it. At first I thought it was weird and wasn&apos;t sure if I even wanted to order the kimchi and fried chicken. After reading the great reviews I had to try it. The place was cozy and welcoming the lighting was dim the employees in the front were so helpful to. The parking is shit so definitely DO NOT park across the street we seen a girl get towed because sometimes they don&apos;t allow it. We parked right in front per the waiter the safest place to park. 
We sat down and our waiter seemed like he just wanted us to rush ... weird. It got weirder. We literally had about 3-4 waiters/waitresses; didn&apos;t seem like they communicated that well with each other it was kind of all over the place. They rarely checked on us we had to flag them down. We ordered the kimchi fried chicken ramen and Sumo Ramen my boyfriend loved his until he tried mine and was like I&apos;m deff ordering that next time! We also had a house salad ... not that great loved how fresh the greens were the ginger dressing just seemed a bit off. We also had the sticky Thai chicken wings which were super delicious if you order them make sure you use your towelette after your hands get super sticky! Overall I loved the food didn&apos;t care for the customer service still tipped super well because hands down the ramen was SOOO good. The music is also super annoying we went about 1Pm on a Tuesday and the music was blasting as if I was in a house party. I&apos;m 28 not a old lady LOL not  exaggerating just was pretty annoying that me and my boyfriend were struggling the entire time for a conversation because we couldn&apos;t hear each other. 
Deff a must try! Get the kimchi fried chicken ramen you won&apos;t be disappointed!!"
5,"Great experience ! Good ramen and excellent service !
We do live in &quot;the new normal&quot; life - thank you for our waiter making a superb experience ! 
Loved Food !"
4,"I wasn&apos;t sure what I was expecting from this place. I&apos;ve had Lettuce Entertain You Ramen before from Tokio Pub so I was expecting roughly the same. I was thankfully incorrect as this food rocks (yes, I still love you Tokio Pub). 

We had a reservation and were promptly seated. My mom got a Yuzu Margarita. My dad got the Aschi beer and I had an Old Fashioned. All of our drinks were awesome, but special shout-out to my dads beer. I tried it and I was the real star. 

For appetizers, we got a little bit of everything. We were not sure on the fried chicken bun, but that was a huge surprise. It was crispy and had a nice spice. We also got the pork dumplings and chicken dumplings. The chicken dumplings were good, but the pork dumplings were really great! We finished the appetizers with the spicy Szechuan wings. It was a spice that was dry and snuck up on you. Still delicious! 

For our main course, we had the special crispy bacon ramen. It&apos;s around until the end of the month, but RUN to eat it. It was outstanding. It was so tasty! It was also huge! I got it with the Chili inside which gave a nice heat to it. The ramen already had a bit of a peppery kick so the chili might not have been needed. 

We finished up with a dessert of doughnuts with a Carmel vanilla dipping sauce. Heavenly! 

The only downside of the dinner was the environment. This is NOT a place for kids or families. I know that there are a lot of places like that, but not in LEYE. The seating was a bit restrictive and the music they play has quite a bit of swearing. I was there with my parents and felt a little weird, but It would be my scene with my friends! Our server was also fantastic so that&apos;s a big plus. 

In closing! I was floored by the quality of food at this place. I&apos;ll for sure be back, but with friends, not family :)"
5,"I&apos;m a pretty hard critique of Japanese ramen and to be honest, the ramen wasn&apos;t the best I&apos;ve had but I thoroughly enjoyed my overall experience here. The outdoor seating has a partially covered hut and heated lamps overhead the raised tables. Your legs will get chilly so I suggest bringing a blanket or scarf to wrap around your legs to stay warm if dining outside in the winter. Our waiter and staff were very efficient and polite - they visited often but not an annoying amount.  

I ordered the tonkatsu ramen and my boyfriend ordered the katsu tonkatsu (limited edition). Despite the weather being cold outside, our ramen came out very hot and stayed relatively hot until we finished our bowls. I believe the chasu in the tonkatsu was smoked - which was new to me. It surprisingly worked! It didn&apos;t look like a large quantity of meat but it was VERY dense. It filled me up pretty quickly. My ramen had too many bamboo shoots and wakame. I wish there was something light like mung bean sprouts to balance the heaviness and add some texture. The fried garlic was a GREAT addition  though - compliments to the chef on that one. 

The katsu tonkatsu had katsu sauce (like a sweet Japanese worchestire) and mustard wasabi. It significantly impacts the taste of the broth. It wasn&apos;t my cup of tea but my boyfriend enjoyed it. 

Giving this a 5 star because we were treated very well and had an overall good experience. Plus the many cute river north puppies walking by and saying hello put us in an especially good mood. 

Ramen-San is part of lettuce entertain you so make sure you have the app and collect points for dining in!"
4,"Walked in on the whim for lunch on a early Sunday afternoon. Was able to get a table right away. My bf and I both ordered the express lunch for $15.95, which included a ramen, a fried rice, a small salad and pickled cucumbers. Each item was a nicely sized portion and the food hit the spot. I&apos;d definitely recommend the express lunch route if it&apos;s available.

Service overall was attentive and friendly, but one person felt slightly pushy and should maybe reconsider his wording when asking us if we&apos;d like to try some Japanese whiskey instead of the &quot;well whiskey&quot; we originally ordered. The recommendation the first time around was fine, but his second attempt sounded pretty snarky and condescending. I&apos;m going to assume that wasn&apos;t his intention, but it def didn&apos;t encourage us to order more drinks."
3,"@BJH.  Thank you for the follow up.  When I&apos;m in Chicago next I will check in with you to see if the comments I made here have been resolved and will update this review. Thank you for taking the time to address my comments.  

A nice filling meal.  Chicago is not up there yet when it comes to Japanese restos. Los Angeles reigns supreme on Japanese food options on the mainland.  Still I&apos;m glad that Ramen-San exists albeit owned by Lettuce and not a Japan entity. 

First I had the vegan broth ramen.  It was good, the broth tepid, the tofu still cold in the middle.  

On a second visit I had the express lunch option with salmon over rice and small kimchee ramen with a &quot;molten&quot; egg. The broth was good, the &quot;molten&quot; egg was perfect but I only got a half an egg.  The salmon was bathed in sugary sweet sauce that was off putting.  It didn&apos;t go well with the kimchee ramen as next to it, I felt I was eating dessert over steamed rice. 

Loved the service, the outdoor eating options and the coo coo Captain America mugs."
4,"Chicago literally has the best food! The last time I came to Chicago I went to their sister restaurant sushi San which has amazing food. I love a great Ramen!

Try another spot or make instant."
5,"Chicago was cold sooo cold so my boyfriend and I were eager to get something warm in our tummies. Due to covid the wait was longer than expected even tho we had reservations, but the service and amazing food triumphed that small negative for me. The ramen....bruh the ramen was so freaking delicious. It&apos;s def a top two on my ramen list. The Penicillin # 2 wasn&apos;t too strong in my opinion, but still tasty. Because we had to wait longer than expected they offered us some complimentary hot donuts. I thought the gesture was very kind. Lowkey want to take a trip back up there to get back in on this goodness."

Because we had to wait longer than expected they offered us some complimentary hot donuts. I thought the gesture was very kind. Lowkey want to take a trip back up there to get back in on this goodness."
2,"I try to order from local spots 1-2x/week during the pandemic to support local businesses. It&apos;s a cold evening so ramen sounded good and I haven&apos;t ordered from Ramen-San yet. 

I ordered via Uber Eats for delivery because it was a little too far for pick up. It estimated 65-85 minutes which was okay and I can understand given it&apos;s a weekend evening. 

But it took over 2 hours to get my food. I watched the tracker and it was clear that the delay was due to the restaurant, not Uber. When I got it, it was ice cold. The fried chicken was soft and appeared to have been sitting for a long time - way longer than the 20 minutes from pick up to my door. Also, there were no utensils! What kind of ramen place doesn&apos;t give chop sticks with an order?!

The food was okay tasting - no better than other places I&apos;ve tried in the city. At the beginning of the pandemic I gave restaurants a lot of grace because of the pivots that most needed to make. But we are a year into this and an efficient delivery process should be in place so food isn&apos;t ice cold and basic utensils are given. With all the great food places in Chicago, probably won&apos;t come back."
4,My husband insisted on trying this spot after a recommendation from friends.  They did not steer us wrong. We tried a fried chicken bowl &amp; a miso bowl with an egg.  Extra noodles are a must my friends!  The broth....wow. Such depth that elevated the toppings. Will definitely try again in the future.
4,Pretty good place. Service was spot on. Server was kind and friendly. Food was tasty and serving size was appropriate. Nothing really beats a steaming hot bowl of ramen on a freezing night. Also got the miso Brussels sprouts but found them a touch too salty but still good. Will come back to try more.
5,"We sample a little everything...drinks, wings, Brussels sprouts, ramen and salad. All delicious!"
4,"Took Ramen-San to go on a rainy night for some comfort food. Super easy to pick up and the ramen toppings were packaged separately from the broth so sogginess was not an issue. 

I ordered the Tonkatsu ramen, the Kimchi Fried Chicken ramen, and the sticky Thai chicken wings. The Tonkatsu was overall really delicious and the broth was on point. I&apos;d definitely order this a second time! The Kimchi Fried Chicken ramen broth was nice and spicy, the chicken pieces were large, but the noodles were a little crusty. I would describe the ramen dishes as mainstream, but they still keep most of the traditional elements of an authentic ramen bowl."
4,"I came here with a party of 4 during the COVID pandemic and appreciated how well organized and accommodating the staff was during these interesting times! This is one of the limited indoor/outdoor dining places outside of Chicago and our party really appreciated the time and effort this restaurant put in! 
The hot broth, hot sake, on a cold winter night in Chicago, how can you go wrong? 
To start we order the karaage chicken with ailoi and it&apos;s perfect to start without getting yourself too full. We ended up ordering ordering 2 orders because of the sides, but this was because we were blinded on the sizes of the ramen! Which is a great segway to: 
The Ramen:
You can&apos;t go wrong with the toncatshu ramen, comes with a soft-boil egg and pork belly! The rest of the group ordered the spicy ramen and apparently it was just as spicy as our waiter warned us. So if you&apos;re not into spice, please double check with your waiter! 
The broth was perfect and creamy, not too overwhelming to the point where you can&apos;t drink it by itself. The egg noodles was fresh and plentiful! If you want you can order a refill, but I barely finished my first serving. 
The pork belly was fresh and nicely fried and made a great compliant with the soft-boiled egg. 
All in all I can say, the next time I&apos;m in Chicago, I will be sure to make a ramen stop here, especially with the weather and location of the restaurant! 
Great job Ramen-San"
3,"Karraage chicken (chicken nuggets) - my Fiancé enjoyed these. They were lightly battered and lightly seasoned as well.

Raw tuna- this was delicious! The tuna and avocado were fresh &amp; completed each other. The chip it was a little too salty for me but it was still enjoyable! 

Buns 
Fried chicken buns- was not a fan of the horseradish in it. I felt like it over powered the flavor of the chicken and had too much in mine. 

Chicken wings 
Spicy Szechuan- this was dry rub and had a great sauce to go with it. I would have liked a little more flavor in these wings otherwise I probably would not get this again. 

Sticky Thai- these were wet and flavorful definitely enjoyed these more than the Szechuan 

Dumpling
Crispy Berkshire- these were crispy and had a decent amount of meat in the dumpling. 

Ramen 
Kimchi &amp; fried chicken- first time trying fried chicken ramen and was not a fan. I will definitely be sticking to my regular pork. The noddles were also harder than usual, it might have needed to be cooked for longer 

Drinks 
Yuzu margarita- this was refreshing and decent

yuzu Saki- very sweet with a strong taste of lemon and grapefruit"
5,"I had an appointment downtown and it was cold out!  I&apos;ve been meaning to try this place for quite some time.  Eating out during Covid times are quite different.  Ramen SAN take no chances.  The place was immaculate and they take your temperature at the entrance.  The social distancing tables are far enough apart and quite safe.  The staff wears masks and gloves and there&apos;s sanitizer there for you.  

As for the food, I tried the chicken and vegetable Gyoza and the Imperial Shio.  The food came out quickly and super hot.  Everything tasted so nice and looked so clean.  

My experience was very positive even during these tough times."
4,"My mouth is watering just thinking about this place. The ramen noodles had so much body, but were so light at the same time, the broth was flavorful, and the pork belly was a true star of the show. The flavor was out of this word and melts in your mouth. The ramen was priced well for both quality and quantity, however the pork buns were very kind of expensive. 1 bun for $5 is steep for something that you can eat in 2-3 bites.

The gentleman that helped with my order was kind, but there was a lady who was running orders who was really rude. My friend and I sat at a table and she got mad. There was no &quot;reserved&quot; sign, and nobody said anything about how carry out worked. She was not pleasant at all. 

If you&apos;ve got a ramen craving (or even if you&apos;re not) this place will hit the spot. It&apos;s the perfect meal for lunch or dinner and carry out orders have great instructions on how to heat and handle them to get the best experience."
4,"When we visited, there was only outside dining due to CoVid regulations, and you had to make a reservation because there was a limited number of tables. The service was great! Our waitress was very friendly and even thought to ask us about any allergies. My husband has a shellfish allergy, so she was able to steer him in the correct direction regarding the ramen he should eat. 

I chose the fried chicken kimchi ramen which was delicious. I was worried that it would be too spicy, but it wasn&apos;t it, and it was really good. If you order any of the ramen entrees, make sure you are hungry, because all of them are enough for two meals. As a group, we shared the Berkshire dumplings and the Mantou Bun with Pork Belly. Both dishes were delicious, but the bun was amazing and almost enough food for a meal.

If you are interested in cocktails, I recommend the Pencillian #2."
4,"My boyfriend and I went to Chicago for a little couples vacation. After a night of drinking way to much Hennessy we decided to go for ramen for lunch since it&apos;s been a while since we&apos;ve had good ramen. On the Midwest anyway.... Jinya will always be my home favorite in Burbank CA. 
Anyway! The food!! It was so mouth watering I couldn&apos;t believe it. At first I thought it was weird and wasn&apos;t sure if I even wanted to order the kimchi and fried chicken. After reading the great reviews I had to try it. The place was cozy and welcoming the lighting was dim the employees in the front were so helpful to. The parking is shit so definitely DO NOT park across the street we seen a girl get towed because sometimes they don&apos;t allow it. We parked right in front per the waiter the safest place to park. 
We sat down and our waiter seemed like he just wanted us to rush ... weird. It got weirder. We literally had about 3-4 waiters/waitresses; didn&apos;t seem like they communicated that well with each other it was kind of all over the place. They rarely checked on us we had to flag them down. We ordered the kimchi fried chicken ramen and Sumo Ramen my boyfriend loved his until he tried mine and was like I&apos;m deff ordering that next time! We also had a house salad ... not that great loved how fresh the greens were the ginger dressing just seemed a bit off. We also had the sticky Thai chicken wings which were super delicious if you order them make sure you use your towelette after your hands get super sticky! Overall I loved the food didn&apos;t care for the customer service still tipped super well because hands down the ramen was SOOO good. The music is also super annoying we went about 1Pm on a Tuesday and the music was blasting as if I was in a house party. I&apos;m 28 not a old lady LOL not  exaggerating just was pretty annoying that me and my boyfriend were struggling the entire time for a conversation because we couldn&apos;t hear each other. 
Deff a must try! Get the kimchi fried chicken ramen you won&apos;t be disappointed!!"
5,"Great experience ! Good ramen and excellent service !
We do live in &quot;the new normal&quot; life - thank you for our waiter making a superb experience ! 
Loved Food !"
4,"I wasn&apos;t sure what I was expecting from this place. I&apos;ve had Lettuce Entertain You Ramen before from Tokio Pub so I was expecting roughly the same. I was thankfully incorrect as this food rocks (yes, I still love you Tokio Pub). 

We had a reservation and were promptly seated. My mom got a Yuzu Margarita. My dad got the Aschi beer and I had an Old Fashioned. All of our drinks were awesome, but special shout-out to my dads beer. I tried it and I was the real star. 

For appetizers, we got a little bit of everything. We were not sure on the fried chicken bun, but that was a huge surprise. It was crispy and had a nice spice. We also got the pork dumplings and chicken dumplings. The chicken dumplings were good, but the pork dumplings were really great! We finished the appetizers with the spicy Szechuan wings. It was a spice that was dry and snuck up on you. Still delicious! 

For our main course, we had the special crispy bacon ramen. It&apos;s around until the end of the month, but RUN to eat it. It was outstanding. It was so tasty! It was also huge! I got it with the Chili inside which gave a nice heat to it. The ramen already had a bit of a peppery kick so the chili might not have been needed. 

We finished up with a dessert of doughnuts with a Carmel vanilla dipping sauce. Heavenly! 

The only downside of the dinner was the environment. This is NOT a place for kids or families. I know that there are a lot of places like that, but not in LEYE. The seating was a bit restrictive and the music they play has quite a bit of swearing. I was there with my parents and felt a little weird, but It would be my scene with my friends! Our server was also fantastic so that&apos;s a big plus. 

In closing! I was floored by the quality of food at this place. I&apos;ll for sure be back, but with friends, not family :)"
5,"I&apos;m a pretty hard critique of Japanese ramen and to be honest, the ramen wasn&apos;t the best I&apos;ve had but I thoroughly enjoyed my overall experience here. The outdoor seating has a partially covered hut and heated lamps overhead the raised tables. Your legs will get chilly so I suggest bringing a blanket or scarf to wrap around your legs to stay warm if dining outside in the winter. Our waiter and staff were very efficient and polite - they visited often but not an annoying amount.  

I ordered the tonkatsu ramen and my boyfriend ordered the katsu tonkatsu (limited edition). Despite the weather being cold outside, our ramen came out very hot and stayed relatively hot until we finished our bowls. I believe the chasu in the tonkatsu was smoked - which was new to me. It surprisingly worked! It didn&apos;t look like a large quantity of meat but it was VERY dense. It filled me up pretty quickly. My ramen had too many bamboo shoots and wakame. I wish there was something light like mung bean sprouts to balance the heaviness and add some texture. The fried garlic was a GREAT addition  though - compliments to the chef on that one. 

The katsu tonkatsu had katsu sauce (like a sweet Japanese worchestire) and mustard wasabi. It significantly impacts the taste of the broth. It wasn&apos;t my cup of tea but my boyfriend enjoyed it. 

Giving this a 5 star because we were treated very well and had an overall good experience. Plus the many cute river north puppies walking by and saying hello put us in an especially good mood. 

Ramen-San is part of lettuce entertain you so make sure you have the app and collect points for dining in!"
4,"Walked in on the whim for lunch on a early Sunday afternoon. Was able to get a table right away. My bf and I both ordered the express lunch for $15.95, which included a ramen, a fried rice, a small salad and pickled cucumbers. Each item was a nicely sized portion and the food hit the spot. I&apos;d definitely recommend the express lunch route if it&apos;s available.

Service overall was attentive and friendly, but one person felt slightly pushy and should maybe reconsider his wording when asking us if we&apos;d like to try some Japanese whiskey instead of the &quot;well whiskey&quot; we originally ordered. The recommendation the first time around was fine, but his second attempt sounded pretty snarky and condescending. I&apos;m going to assume that wasn&apos;t his intention, but it def didn&apos;t encourage us to order more drinks."
3,"@BJH.  Thank you for the follow up.  When I&apos;m in Chicago next I will check in with you to see if the comments I made here have been resolved and will update this review. Thank you for taking the time to address my comments.  

A nice filling meal.  Chicago is not up there yet when it comes to Japanese restos. Los Angeles reigns supreme on Japanese food options on the mainland.  Still I&apos;m glad that Ramen-San exists albeit owned by Lettuce and not a Japan entity. 

First I had the vegan broth ramen.  It was good, the broth tepid, the tofu still cold in the middle.  

On a second visit I had the express lunch option with salmon over rice and small kimchee ramen with a &quot;molten&quot; egg. The broth was good, the &quot;molten&quot; egg was perfect but I only got a half an egg.  The salmon was bathed in sugary sweet sauce that was off putting.  It didn&apos;t go well with the kimchee ramen as next to it, I felt I was eating dessert over steamed rice. 

Loved the service, the outdoor eating options and the coo coo Captain America mugs."
4,"Chicago literally has the best food! The last time I came to Chicago I went to their sister restaurant sushi San which has amazing food. I love a great Ramen!
Due to Covid and the new mandate we had to sit outside, but luckily they had heating lamps and it was a very sunny day.

The Ramen had thick pork pieces that were so tender and juicy. The broth was so delicious, I wish I could eat about 3 bowls of it... lol. 

Ramen san definitely did not disappoint and I will definitely be coming back the next time I visit Chicago"

Try another spot or make instant."

2,"Hate to do this. Excellent packaging, good enough service, no heating outside, and mediocre ramen. 

Try another spot or make instant."
5,"Chicago was cold sooo cold so my boyfriend and I were eager to get something warm in our tummies. Due to covid the wait was longer than expected even tho we had reservations, but the service and amazing food triumphed that small negative for me. The ramen....bruh the ramen was so freaking delicious. It&apos;s def a top two on my ramen list. The Penicillin # 2 wasn&apos;t too strong in my opinion, but still tasty. Because we had to wait longer than expected they offered us some complimentary hot donuts. I thought the gesture was very kind. Lowkey want to take a trip back up there to get back in on this goodness."
2,"I try to order from local spots 1-2x/week during the pandemic to support local businesses. It&apos;s a cold evening so ramen sounded good and I haven&apos;t ordered from Ramen-San yet. 

I ordered via Uber Eats for delivery because it was a little too far for pick up. It estimated 65-85 minutes which was okay and I can understand given it&apos;s a weekend evening. 

But it took over 2 hours to get my food. I watched the tracker and it was clear that the delay was due to the restaurant, not Uber. When I got it, it was ice cold. The fried chicken was soft and appeared to have been sitting for a long time - way longer than the 20 minutes from pick up to my door. Also, there were no utensils! What kind of ramen place doesn&apos;t give chop sticks with an order?!

The food was okay tasting - no better than other places I&apos;ve tried in the city. At the beginning of the pandemic I gave restaurants a lot of grace because of the pivots that most needed to make. But we are a year into this and an efficient delivery process should be in place so food isn&apos;t ice cold and basic utensils are given. With all the great food places in Chicago, probably won&apos;t come back."
4,My husband insisted on trying this spot after a recommendation from friends.  They did not steer us wrong. We tried a fried chicken bowl &amp; a miso bowl with an egg.  Extra noodles are a must my friends!  The broth....wow. Such depth that elevated the toppings. Will definitely try again in the future.
4,Pretty good place. Service was spot on. Server was kind and friendly. Food was tasty and serving size was appropriate. Nothing really beats a steaming hot bowl of ramen on a freezing night. Also got the miso Brussels sprouts but found them a touch too salty but still good. Will come back to try more.
5,"We sample a little everything...drinks, wings, Brussels sprouts, ramen and salad. All delicious!"
4,"Took Ramen-San to go on a rainy night for some comfort food. Super easy to pick up and the ramen toppings were packaged separately from the broth so sogginess was not an issue. 

I ordered the Tonkatsu ramen, the Kimchi Fried Chicken ramen, and the sticky Thai chicken wings. The Tonkatsu was overall really delicious and the broth was on point. I&apos;d definitely order this a second time! The Kimchi Fried Chicken ramen broth was nice and spicy, the chicken pieces were large, but the noodles were a little crusty. I would describe the ramen dishes as mainstream, but they still keep most of the traditional elements of an authentic ramen bowl."
4,"I came here with a party of 4 during the COVID pandemic and appreciated how well organized and accommodating the staff was during these interesting times! This is one of the limited indoor/outdoor dining places outside of Chicago and our party really appreciated the time and effort this restaurant put in! 
The hot broth, hot sake, on a cold winter night in Chicago, how can you go wrong? 
To start we order the karaage chicken with ailoi and it&apos;s perfect to start without getting yourself too full. We ended up ordering ordering 2 orders because of the sides, but this was because we were blinded on the sizes of the ramen! Which is a great segway to: 
The Ramen:
You can&apos;t go wrong with the toncatshu ramen, comes with a soft-boil egg and pork belly! The rest of the group ordered the spicy ramen and apparently it was just as spicy as our waiter warned us. So if you&apos;re not into spice, please double check with your waiter! 
The broth was perfect and creamy, not too overwhelming to the point where you can&apos;t drink it by itself. The egg noodles was fresh and plentiful! If you want you can order a refill, but I barely finished my first serving. 
The pork belly was fresh and nicely fried and made a great compliant with the soft-boiled egg. 
All in all I can say, the next time I&apos;m in Chicago, I will be sure to make a ramen stop here, especially with the weather and location of the restaurant! 
Great job Ramen-San"
3,"Karraage chicken (chicken nuggets) - my Fiancé enjoyed these. They were lightly battered and lightly seasoned as well.

Raw tuna- this was delicious! The tuna and avocado were fresh &amp; completed each other. The chip it was a little too salty for me but it was still enjoyable! 

Buns 
Fried chicken buns- was not a fan of the horseradish in it. I felt like it over powered the flavor of the chicken and had too much in mine. 

Chicken wings 
Spicy Szechuan- this was dry rub and had a great sauce to go with it. I would have liked a little more flavor in these wings otherwise I probably would not get this again. 

Sticky Thai- these were wet and flavorful definitely enjoyed these more than the Szechuan 

Dumpling
Crispy Berkshire- these were crispy and had a decent amount of meat in the dumpling. 

Ramen 
Kimchi &amp; fried chicken- first time trying fried chicken ramen and was not a fan. I will definitely be sticking to my regular pork. The noddles were also harder than usual, it might have needed to be cooked for longer 

Drinks 
Yuzu margarita- this was refreshing and decent

yuzu Saki- very sweet with a strong taste of lemon and grapefruit"
5,"I had an appointment downtown and it was cold out!  I&apos;ve been meaning to try this place for quite some time.  Eating out during Covid times are quite different.  Ramen SAN take no chances.  The place was immaculate and they take your temperature at the entrance.  The social distancing tables are far enough apart and quite safe.  The staff wears masks and gloves and there&apos;s sanitizer there for you.  

As for the food, I tried the chicken and vegetable Gyoza and the Imperial Shio.  The food came out quickly and super hot.  Everything tasted so nice and looked so clean.  

My experience was very positive even during these tough times."
4,"My mouth is watering just thinking about this place. The ramen noodles had so much body, but were so light at the same time, the broth was flavorful, and the pork belly was a true star of the show. The flavor was out of this word and melts in your mouth. The ramen was priced well for both quality and quantity, however the pork buns were very kind of expensive. 1 bun for $5 is steep for something that you can eat in 2-3 bites.

The gentleman that helped with my order was kind, but there was a lady who was running orders who was really rude. My friend and I sat at a table and she got mad. There was no &quot;reserved&quot; sign, and nobody said anything about how carry out worked. She was not pleasant at all. 

If you&apos;ve got a ramen craving (or even if you&apos;re not) this place will hit the spot. It&apos;s the perfect meal for lunch or dinner and carry out orders have great instructions on how to heat and handle them to get the best experience."
4,"When we visited, there was only outside dining due to CoVid regulations, and you had to make a reservation because there was a limited number of tables. The service was great! Our waitress was very friendly and even thought to ask us about any allergies. My husband has a shellfish allergy, so she was able to steer him in the correct direction regarding the ramen he should eat. 

I chose the fried chicken kimchi ramen which was delicious. I was worried that it would be too spicy, but it wasn&apos;t it, and it was really good. If you order any of the ramen entrees, make sure you are hungry, because all of them are enough for two meals. As a group, we shared the Berkshire dumplings and the Mantou Bun with Pork Belly. Both dishes were delicious, but the bun was amazing and almost enough food for a meal.

If you are interested in cocktails, I recommend the Pencillian #2."
4,"My boyfriend and I went to Chicago for a little couples vacation. After a night of drinking way to much Hennessy we decided to go for ramen for lunch since it&apos;s been a while since we&apos;ve had good ramen. On the Midwest anyway.... Jinya will always be my home favorite in Burbank CA. 
Anyway! The food!! It was so mouth watering I couldn&apos;t believe it. At first I thought it was weird and wasn&apos;t sure if I even wanted to order the kimchi and fried chicken. After reading the great reviews I had to try it. The place was cozy and welcoming the lighting was dim the employees in the front were so helpful to. The parking is shit so definitely DO NOT park across the street we seen a girl get towed because sometimes they don&apos;t allow it. We parked right in front per the waiter the safest place to park. 
We sat down and our waiter seemed like he just wanted us to rush ... weird. It got weirder. We literally had about 3-4 waiters/waitresses; didn&apos;t seem like they communicated that well with each other it was kind of all over the place. They rarely checked on us we had to flag them down. We ordered the kimchi fried chicken ramen and Sumo Ramen my boyfriend loved his until he tried mine and was like I&apos;m deff ordering that next time! We also had a house salad ... not that great loved how fresh the greens were the ginger dressing just seemed a bit off. We also had the sticky Thai chicken wings which were super delicious if you order them make sure you use your towelette after your hands get super sticky! Overall I loved the food didn&apos;t care for the customer service still tipped super well because hands down the ramen was SOOO good. The music is also super annoying we went about 1Pm on a Tuesday and the music was blasting as if I was in a house party. I&apos;m 28 not a old lady LOL not  exaggerating just was pretty annoying that me and my boyfriend were struggling the entire time for a conversation because we couldn&apos;t hear each other. 
Deff a must try! Get the kimchi fried chicken ramen you won&apos;t be disappointed!!"
5,"Great experience ! Good ramen and excellent service !
We do live in &quot;the new normal&quot; life - thank you for our waiter making a superb experience ! 
Loved Food !"
4,"I wasn&apos;t sure what I was expecting from this place. I&apos;ve had Lettuce Entertain You Ramen before from Tokio Pub so I was expecting roughly the same. I was thankfully incorrect as this food rocks (yes, I still love you Tokio Pub). 

We had a reservation and were promptly seated. My mom got a Yuzu Margarita. My dad got the Aschi beer and I had an Old Fashioned. All of our drinks were awesome, but special shout-out to my dads beer. I tried it and I was the real star. 

For appetizers, we got a little bit of everything. We were not sure on the fried chicken bun, but that was a huge surprise. It was crispy and had a nice spice. We also got the pork dumplings and chicken dumplings. The chicken dumplings were good, but the pork dumplings were really great! We finished the appetizers with the spicy Szechuan wings. It was a spice that was dry and snuck up on you. Still delicious! 

For our main course, we had the special crispy bacon ramen. It&apos;s around until the end of the month, but RUN to eat it. It was outstanding. It was so tasty! It was also huge! I got it with the Chili inside which gave a nice heat to it. The ramen already had a bit of a peppery kick so the chili might not have been needed. 

We finished up with a dessert of doughnuts with a Carmel vanilla dipping sauce. Heavenly! 

The only downside of the dinner was the environment. This is NOT a place for kids or families. I know that there are a lot of places like that, but not in LEYE. The seating was a bit restrictive and the music they play has quite a bit of swearing. I was there with my parents and felt a little weird, but It would be my scene with my friends! Our server was also fantastic so that&apos;s a big plus. 

In closing! I was floored by the quality of food at this place. I&apos;ll for sure be back, but with friends, not family :)"
5,"I&apos;m a pretty hard critique of Japanese ramen and to be honest, the ramen wasn&apos;t the best I&apos;ve had but I thoroughly enjoyed my overall experience here. The outdoor seating has a partially covered hut and heated lamps overhead the raised tables. Your legs will get chilly so I suggest bringing a blanket or scarf to wrap around your legs to stay warm if dining outside in the winter. Our waiter and staff were very efficient and polite - they visited often but not an annoying amount.  

I ordered the tonkatsu ramen and my boyfriend ordered the katsu tonkatsu (limited edition). Despite the weather being cold outside, our ramen came out very hot and stayed relatively hot until we finished our bowls. I believe the chasu in the tonkatsu was smoked - which was new to me. It surprisingly worked! It didn&apos;t look like a large quantity of meat but it was VERY dense. It filled me up pretty quickly. My ramen had too many bamboo shoots and wakame. I wish there was something light like mung bean sprouts to balance the heaviness and add some texture. The fried garlic was a GREAT addition  though - compliments to the chef on that one. 

The katsu tonkatsu had katsu sauce (like a sweet Japanese worchestire) and mustard wasabi. It significantly impacts the taste of the broth. It wasn&apos;t my cup of tea but my boyfriend enjoyed it. 

Giving this a 5 star because we were treated very well and had an overall good experience. Plus the many cute river north puppies walking by and saying hello put us in an especially good mood. 

Ramen-San is part of lettuce entertain you so make sure you have the app and collect points for dining in!"
4,"Walked in on the whim for lunch on a early Sunday afternoon. Was able to get a table right away. My bf and I both ordered the express lunch for $15.95, which included a ramen, a fried rice, a small salad and pickled cucumbers. Each item was a nicely sized portion and the food hit the spot. I&apos;d definitely recommend the express lunch route if it&apos;s available.

Service overall was attentive and friendly, but one person felt slightly pushy and should maybe reconsider his wording when asking us if we&apos;d like to try some Japanese whiskey instead of the &quot;well whiskey&quot; we originally ordered. The recommendation the first time around was fine, but his second attempt sounded pretty snarky and condescending. I&apos;m going to assume that wasn&apos;t his intention, but it def didn&apos;t encourage us to order more drinks."
3,"@BJH.  Thank you for the follow up.  When I&apos;m in Chicago next I will check in with you to see if the comments I made here have been resolved and will update this review. Thank you for taking the time to address my comments.  

A nice filling meal.  Chicago is not up there yet when it comes to Japanese restos. Los Angeles reigns supreme on Japanese food options on the mainland.  Still I&apos;m glad that Ramen-San exists albeit owned by Lettuce and not a Japan entity. 

First I had the vegan broth ramen.  It was good, the broth tepid, the tofu still cold in the middle.  

On a second visit I had the express lunch option with salmon over rice and small kimchee ramen with a &quot;molten&quot; egg. The broth was good, the &quot;molten&quot; egg was perfect but I only got a half an egg.  The salmon was bathed in sugary sweet sauce that was off putting.  It didn&apos;t go well with the kimchee ramen as next to it, I felt I was eating dessert over steamed rice. 

Loved the service, the outdoor eating options and the coo coo Captain America mugs."
4,"Chicago literally has the best food! The last time I came to Chicago I went to their sister restaurant sushi San which has amazing food. I love a great Ramen!
Due to Covid and the new mandate we had to sit outside, but luckily they had heating lamps and it was a very sunny day.

The Ramen had thick pork pieces that were so tender and juicy. The broth was so delicious, I wish I could eat about 3 bowls of it... lol. 

Ramen san definitely did not disappoint and I will definitely be coming back the next time I visit Chicago"

Due to Covid and the new mandate we had to sit outside, but luckily they had heating lamps and it was a very sunny day.

The Ramen had thick pork pieces that were so tender and juicy. The broth was so delicious, I wish I could eat about 3 bowls of it... lol. 

Ramen san definitely did not disappoint and I will definitely be coming back the next time I visit Chicago"
1,"Server was more concerned about us wearing masks than getting the order right. They completely messed up our order. Also, the seats are extremely uncomfortable wooden benches meant for little kids. Never going here again."
2,"Hate to do this. Excellent packaging, good enough service, no heating outside, and mediocre ramen. 

Try another spot or make instant."
5,"Chicago was cold sooo cold so my boyfriend and I were eager to get something warm in our tummies. Due to covid the wait was longer than expected even tho we had reservations, but the service and amazing food triumphed that small negative for me. The ramen....bruh the ramen was so freaking delicious. It&apos;s def a top two on my ramen list. The Penicillin # 2 wasn&apos;t too strong in my opinion, but still tasty. Because we had to wait longer than expected they offered us some complimentary hot donuts. I thought the gesture was very kind. Lowkey want to take a trip back up there to get back in on this goodness."
2,"I try to order from local spots 1-2x/week during the pandemic to support local businesses. It&apos;s a cold evening so ramen sounded good and I haven&apos;t ordered from Ramen-San yet. 

I ordered via Uber Eats for delivery because it was a little too far for pick up. It estimated 65-85 minutes which was okay and I can understand given it&apos;s a weekend evening. 

But it took over 2 hours to get my food. I watched the tracker and it was clear that the delay was due to the restaurant, not Uber. When I got it, it was ice cold. The fried chicken was soft and appeared to have been sitting for a long time - way longer than the 20 minutes from pick up to my door. Also, there were no utensils! What kind of ramen place doesn&apos;t give chop sticks with an order?!

The food was okay tasting - no better than other places I&apos;ve tried in the city. At the beginning of the pandemic I gave restaurants a lot of grace because of the pivots that most needed to make. But we are a year into this and an efficient delivery process should be in place so food isn&apos;t ice cold and basic utensils are given. With all the great food places in Chicago, probably won&apos;t come back."
4,My husband insisted on trying this spot after a recommendation from friends.  They did not steer us wrong. We tried a fried chicken bowl &amp; a miso bowl with an egg.  Extra noodles are a must my friends!  The broth....wow. Such depth that elevated the toppings. Will definitely try again in the future.
4,Pretty good place. Service was spot on. Server was kind and friendly. Food was tasty and serving size was appropriate. Nothing really beats a steaming hot bowl of ramen on a freezing night. Also got the miso Brussels sprouts but found them a touch too salty but still good. Will come back to try more.
5,"We sample a little everything...drinks, wings, Brussels sprouts, ramen and salad. All delicious!"
4,"Took Ramen-San to go on a rainy night for some comfort food. Super easy to pick up and the ramen toppings were packaged separately from the broth so sogginess was not an issue. 

I ordered the Tonkatsu ramen, the Kimchi Fried Chicken ramen, and the sticky Thai chicken wings. The Tonkatsu was overall really delicious and the broth was on point. I&apos;d definitely order this a second time! The Kimchi Fried Chicken ramen broth was nice and spicy, the chicken pieces were large, but the noodles were a little crusty. I would describe the ramen dishes as mainstream, but they still keep most of the traditional elements of an authentic ramen bowl."
4,"I came here with a party of 4 during the COVID pandemic and appreciated how well organized and accommodating the staff was during these interesting times! This is one of the limited indoor/outdoor dining places outside of Chicago and our party really appreciated the time and effort this restaurant put in! 
The hot broth, hot sake, on a cold winter night in Chicago, how can you go wrong? 
To start we order the karaage chicken with ailoi and it&apos;s perfect to start without getting yourself too full. We ended up ordering ordering 2 orders because of the sides, but this was because we were blinded on the sizes of the ramen! Which is a great segway to: 
The Ramen:
You can&apos;t go wrong with the toncatshu ramen, comes with a soft-boil egg and pork belly! The rest of the group ordered the spicy ramen and apparently it was just as spicy as our waiter warned us. So if you&apos;re not into spice, please double check with your waiter! 
The broth was perfect and creamy, not too overwhelming to the point where you can&apos;t drink it by itself. The egg noodles was fresh and plentiful! If you want you can order a refill, but I barely finished my first serving. 
The pork belly was fresh and nicely fried and made a great compliant with the soft-boiled egg. 
All in all I can say, the next time I&apos;m in Chicago, I will be sure to make a ramen stop here, especially with the weather and location of the restaurant! 
Great job Ramen-San"
3,"Karraage chicken (chicken nuggets) - my Fiancé enjoyed these. They were lightly battered and lightly seasoned as well.

Raw tuna- this was delicious! The tuna and avocado were fresh &amp; completed each other. The chip it was a little too salty for me but it was still enjoyable! 

Buns 
Fried chicken buns- was not a fan of the horseradish in it. I felt like it over powered the flavor of the chicken and had too much in mine. 

Chicken wings 
Spicy Szechuan- this was dry rub and had a great sauce to go with it. I would have liked a little more flavor in these wings otherwise I probably would not get this again. 

Sticky Thai- these were wet and flavorful definitely enjoyed these more than the Szechuan 

Dumpling
Crispy Berkshire- these were crispy and had a decent amount of meat in the dumpling. 

Ramen 
Kimchi &amp; fried chicken- first time trying fried chicken ramen and was not a fan. I will definitely be sticking to my regular pork. The noddles were also harder than usual, it might have needed to be cooked for longer 

Drinks 
Yuzu margarita- this was refreshing and decent

yuzu Saki- very sweet with a strong taste of lemon and grapefruit"
5,"I had an appointment downtown and it was cold out!  I&apos;ve been meaning to try this place for quite some time.  Eating out during Covid times are quite different.  Ramen SAN take no chances.  The place was immaculate and they take your temperature at the entrance.  The social distancing tables are far enough apart and quite safe.  The staff wears masks and gloves and there&apos;s sanitizer there for you.  

As for the food, I tried the chicken and vegetable Gyoza and the Imperial Shio.  The food came out quickly and super hot.  Everything tasted so nice and looked so clean.  

My experience was very positive even during these tough times."
4,"My mouth is watering just thinking about this place. The ramen noodles had so much body, but were so light at the same time, the broth was flavorful, and the pork belly was a true star of the show. The flavor was out of this word and melts in your mouth. The ramen was priced well for both quality and quantity, however the pork buns were very kind of expensive. 1 bun for $5 is steep for something that you can eat in 2-3 bites.

The gentleman that helped with my order was kind, but there was a lady who was running orders who was really rude. My friend and I sat at a table and she got mad. There was no &quot;reserved&quot; sign, and nobody said anything about how carry out worked. She was not pleasant at all. 

If you&apos;ve got a ramen craving (or even if you&apos;re not) this place will hit the spot. It&apos;s the perfect meal for lunch or dinner and carry out orders have great instructions on how to heat and handle them to get the best experience."
4,"When we visited, there was only outside dining due to CoVid regulations, and you had to make a reservation because there was a limited number of tables. The service was great! Our waitress was very friendly and even thought to ask us about any allergies. My husband has a shellfish allergy, so she was able to steer him in the correct direction regarding the ramen he should eat. 

I chose the fried chicken kimchi ramen which was delicious. I was worried that it would be too spicy, but it wasn&apos;t it, and it was really good. If you order any of the ramen entrees, make sure you are hungry, because all of them are enough for two meals. As a group, we shared the Berkshire dumplings and the Mantou Bun with Pork Belly. Both dishes were delicious, but the bun was amazing and almost enough food for a meal.

If you are interested in cocktails, I recommend the Pencillian #2."
4,"My boyfriend and I went to Chicago for a little couples vacation. After a night of drinking way to much Hennessy we decided to go for ramen for lunch since it&apos;s been a while since we&apos;ve had good ramen. On the Midwest anyway.... Jinya will always be my home favorite in Burbank CA. 
Anyway! The food!! It was so mouth watering I couldn&apos;t believe it. At first I thought it was weird and wasn&apos;t sure if I even wanted to order the kimchi and fried chicken. After reading the great reviews I had to try it. The place was cozy and welcoming the lighting was dim the employees in the front were so helpful to. The parking is shit so definitely DO NOT park across the street we seen a girl get towed because sometimes they don&apos;t allow it. We parked right in front per the waiter the safest place to park. 
We sat down and our waiter seemed like he just wanted us to rush ... weird. It got weirder. We literally had about 3-4 waiters/waitresses; didn&apos;t seem like they communicated that well with each other it was kind of all over the place. They rarely checked on us we had to flag them down. We ordered the kimchi fried chicken ramen and Sumo Ramen my boyfriend loved his until he tried mine and was like I&apos;m deff ordering that next time! We also had a house salad ... not that great loved how fresh the greens were the ginger dressing just seemed a bit off. We also had the sticky Thai chicken wings which were super delicious if you order them make sure you use your towelette after your hands get super sticky! Overall I loved the food didn&apos;t care for the customer service still tipped super well because hands down the ramen was SOOO good. The music is also super annoying we went about 1Pm on a Tuesday and the music was blasting as if I was in a house party. I&apos;m 28 not a old lady LOL not  exaggerating just was pretty annoying that me and my boyfriend were struggling the entire time for a conversation because we couldn&apos;t hear each other. 
Deff a must try! Get the kimchi fried chicken ramen you won&apos;t be disappointed!!"
5,"Great experience ! Good ramen and excellent service !
We do live in &quot;the new normal&quot; life - thank you for our waiter making a superb experience ! 
Loved Food !"
4,"I wasn&apos;t sure what I was expecting from this place. I&apos;ve had Lettuce Entertain You Ramen before from Tokio Pub so I was expecting roughly the same. I was thankfully incorrect as this food rocks (yes, I still love you Tokio Pub). 

We had a reservation and were promptly seated. My mom got a Yuzu Margarita. My dad got the Aschi beer and I had an Old Fashioned. All of our drinks were awesome, but special shout-out to my dads beer. I tried it and I was the real star. 

For appetizers, we got a little bit of everything. We were not sure on the fried chicken bun, but that was a huge surprise. It was crispy and had a nice spice. We also got the pork dumplings and chicken dumplings. The chicken dumplings were good, but the pork dumplings were really great! We finished the appetizers with the spicy Szechuan wings. It was a spice that was dry and snuck up on you. Still delicious! 

For our main course, we had the special crispy bacon ramen. It&apos;s around until the end of the month, but RUN to eat it. It was outstanding. It was so tasty! It was also huge! I got it with the Chili inside which gave a nice heat to it. The ramen already had a bit of a peppery kick so the chili might not have been needed. 

We finished up with a dessert of doughnuts with a Carmel vanilla dipping sauce. Heavenly! 

The only downside of the dinner was the environment. This is NOT a place for kids or families. I know that there are a lot of places like that, but not in LEYE. The seating was a bit restrictive and the music they play has quite a bit of swearing. I was there with my parents and felt a little weird, but It would be my scene with my friends! Our server was also fantastic so that&apos;s a big plus. 

In closing! I was floored by the quality of food at this place. I&apos;ll for sure be back, but with friends, not family :)"
5,"I&apos;m a pretty hard critique of Japanese ramen and to be honest, the ramen wasn&apos;t the best I&apos;ve had but I thoroughly enjoyed my overall experience here. The outdoor seating has a partially covered hut and heated lamps overhead the raised tables. Your legs will get chilly so I suggest bringing a blanket or scarf to wrap around your legs to stay warm if dining outside in the winter. Our waiter and staff were very efficient and polite - they visited often but not an annoying amount.  

I ordered the tonkatsu ramen and my boyfriend ordered the katsu tonkatsu (limited edition). Despite the weather being cold outside, our ramen came out very hot and stayed relatively hot until we finished our bowls. I believe the chasu in the tonkatsu was smoked - which was new to me. It surprisingly worked! It didn&apos;t look like a large quantity of meat but it was VERY dense. It filled me up pretty quickly. My ramen had too many bamboo shoots and wakame. I wish there was something light like mung bean sprouts to balance the heaviness and add some texture. The fried garlic was a GREAT addition  though - compliments to the chef on that one. 

The katsu tonkatsu had katsu sauce (like a sweet Japanese worchestire) and mustard wasabi. It significantly impacts the taste of the broth. It wasn&apos;t my cup of tea but my boyfriend enjoyed it. 

Giving this a 5 star because we were treated very well and had an overall good experience. Plus the many cute river north puppies walking by and saying hello put us in an especially good mood. 

Ramen-San is part of lettuce entertain you so make sure you have the app and collect points for dining in!"
4,"Walked in on the whim for lunch on a early Sunday afternoon. Was able to get a table right away. My bf and I both ordered the express lunch for $15.95, which included a ramen, a fried rice, a small salad and pickled cucumbers. Each item was a nicely sized portion and the food hit the spot. I&apos;d definitely recommend the express lunch route if it&apos;s available.

Service overall was attentive and friendly, but one person felt slightly pushy and should maybe reconsider his wording when asking us if we&apos;d like to try some Japanese whiskey instead of the &quot;well whiskey&quot; we originally ordered. The recommendation the first time around was fine, but his second attempt sounded pretty snarky and condescending. I&apos;m going to assume that wasn&apos;t his intention, but it def didn&apos;t encourage us to order more drinks."
3,"@BJH.  Thank you for the follow up.  When I&apos;m in Chicago next I will check in with you to see if the comments I made here have been resolved and will update this review. Thank you for taking the time to address my comments.  

A nice filling meal.  Chicago is not up there yet when it comes to Japanese restos. Los Angeles reigns supreme on Japanese food options on the mainland.  Still I&apos;m glad that Ramen-San exists albeit owned by Lettuce and not a Japan entity. 

First I had the vegan broth ramen.  It was good, the broth tepid, the tofu still cold in the middle.  

On a second visit I had the express lunch option with salmon over rice and small kimchee ramen with a &quot;molten&quot; egg. The broth was good, the &quot;molten&quot; egg was perfect but I only got a half an egg.  The salmon was bathed in sugary sweet sauce that was off putting.  It didn&apos;t go well with the kimchee ramen as next to it, I felt I was eating dessert over steamed rice. 

Loved the service, the outdoor eating options and the coo coo Captain America mugs."

The broth was good, the &quot;molten&quot; egg was perfect but I only got a half an egg.  The salmon was bathed in sugary sweet sauce that was off putting.  It didn&apos;t go well with the kimchee ramen as next to it, I felt I was eating dessert over steamed rice. 

Loved the service, the outdoor eating options and the coo coo Captain America mugs."
4,"Chicago literally has the best food! The last time I came to Chicago I went to their sister restaurant sushi San which has amazing food. I love a great Ramen!
Due to Covid and the new mandate we had to sit outside, but luckily they had heating lamps and it was a very sunny day.

The Ramen had thick pork pieces that were so tender and juicy. The broth was so delicious, I wish I could eat about 3 bowls of it... lol. 

Ramen san definitely did not disappoint and I will definitely be coming back the next time I visit Chicago"
1,"Server was more concerned about us wearing masks than getting the order right. They completely messed up our order. Also, the seats are extremely uncomfortable wooden benches meant for little kids. Never going here again."
2,"Hate to do this. Excellent packaging, good enough service, no heating outside, and mediocre ramen. 

Try another spot or make instant."
5,"Chicago was cold sooo cold so my boyfriend and I were eager to get something warm in our tummies. Due to covid the wait was longer than expected even tho we had reservations, but the service and amazing food triumphed that small negative for me. The ramen....bruh the ramen was so freaking delicious. It&apos;s def a top two on my ramen list. The Penicillin # 2 wasn&apos;t too strong in my opinion, but still tasty. Because we had to wait longer than expected they offered us some complimentary hot donuts. I thought the gesture was very kind. Lowkey want to take a trip back up there to get back in on this goodness."
2,"I try to order from local spots 1-2x/week during the pandemic to support local businesses. It&apos;s a cold evening so ramen sounded good and I haven&apos;t ordered from Ramen-San yet. 

I ordered via Uber Eats for delivery because it was a little too far for pick up. It estimated 65-85 minutes which was okay and I can understand given it&apos;s a weekend evening. 

But it took over 2 hours to get my food. I watched the tracker and it was clear that the delay was due to the restaurant, not Uber. When I got it, it was ice cold. The fried chicken was soft and appeared to have been sitting for a long time - way longer than the 20 minutes from pick up to my door. Also, there were no utensils! What kind of ramen place doesn&apos;t give chop sticks with an order?!

The food was okay tasting - no better than other places I&apos;ve tried in the city. At the beginning of the pandemic I gave restaurants a lot of grace because of the pivots that most needed to make. But we are a year into this and an efficient delivery process should be in place so food isn&apos;t ice cold and basic utensils are given. With all the great food places in Chicago, probably won&apos;t come back."
4,My husband insisted on trying this spot after a recommendation from friends.  They did not steer us wrong. We tried a fried chicken bowl &amp; a miso bowl with an egg.  Extra noodles are a must my friends!  The broth....wow. Such depth that elevated the toppings. Will definitely try again in the future.
4,Pretty good place. Service was spot on. Server was kind and friendly. Food was tasty and serving size was appropriate. Nothing really beats a steaming hot bowl of ramen on a freezing night. Also got the miso Brussels sprouts but found them a touch too salty but still good. Will come back to try more.
5,"We sample a little everything...drinks, wings, Brussels sprouts, ramen and salad. All delicious!"
4,"Took Ramen-San to go on a rainy night for some comfort food. Super easy to pick up and the ramen toppings were packaged separately from the broth so sogginess was not an issue. 

I ordered the Tonkatsu ramen, the Kimchi Fried Chicken ramen, and the sticky Thai chicken wings. The Tonkatsu was overall really delicious and the broth was on point. I&apos;d definitely order this a second time! The Kimchi Fried Chicken ramen broth was nice and spicy, the chicken pieces were large, but the noodles were a little crusty. I would describe the ramen dishes as mainstream, but they still keep most of the traditional elements of an authentic ramen bowl."
4,"I came here with a party of 4 during the COVID pandemic and appreciated how well organized and accommodating the staff was during these interesting times! This is one of the limited indoor/outdoor dining places outside of Chicago and our party really appreciated the time and effort this restaurant put in! 
The hot broth, hot sake, on a cold winter night in Chicago, how can you go wrong? 
To start we order the karaage chicken with ailoi and it&apos;s perfect to start without getting yourself too full. We ended up ordering ordering 2 orders because of the sides, but this was because we were blinded on the sizes of the ramen! Which is a great segway to: 
The Ramen:
You can&apos;t go wrong with the toncatshu ramen, comes with a soft-boil egg and pork belly! The rest of the group ordered the spicy ramen and apparently it was just as spicy as our waiter warned us. So if you&apos;re not into spice, please double check with your waiter! 
The broth was perfect and creamy, not too overwhelming to the point where you can&apos;t drink it by itself. The egg noodles was fresh and plentiful! If you want you can order a refill, but I barely finished my first serving. 
The pork belly was fresh and nicely fried and made a great compliant with the soft-boiled egg. 
All in all I can say, the next time I&apos;m in Chicago, I will be sure to make a ramen stop here, especially with the weather and location of the restaurant! 
Great job Ramen-San"
3,"Karraage chicken (chicken nuggets) - my Fiancé enjoyed these. They were lightly battered and lightly seasoned as well.

Raw tuna- this was delicious! The tuna and avocado were fresh &amp; completed each other. The chip it was a little too salty for me but it was still enjoyable! 

Buns 
Fried chicken buns- was not a fan of the horseradish in it. I felt like it over powered the flavor of the chicken and had too much in mine. 

Chicken wings 
Spicy Szechuan- this was dry rub and had a great sauce to go with it. I would have liked a little more flavor in these wings otherwise I probably would not get this again. 

Sticky Thai- these were wet and flavorful definitely enjoyed these more than the Szechuan 

Dumpling
Crispy Berkshire- these were crispy and had a decent amount of meat in the dumpling. 

Ramen 
Kimchi &amp; fried chicken- first time trying fried chicken ramen and was not a fan. I will definitely be sticking to my regular pork. The noddles were also harder than usual, it might have needed to be cooked for longer 

Drinks 
Yuzu margarita- this was refreshing and decent

yuzu Saki- very sweet with a strong taste of lemon and grapefruit"
5,"I had an appointment downtown and it was cold out!  I&apos;ve been meaning to try this place for quite some time.  Eating out during Covid times are quite different.  Ramen SAN take no chances.  The place was immaculate and they take your temperature at the entrance.  The social distancing tables are far enough apart and quite safe.  The staff wears masks and gloves and there&apos;s sanitizer there for you.  

As for the food, I tried the chicken and vegetable Gyoza and the Imperial Shio.  The food came out quickly and super hot.  Everything tasted so nice and looked so clean.  

My experience was very positive even during these tough times."
4,"My mouth is watering just thinking about this place. The ramen noodles had so much body, but were so light at the same time, the broth was flavorful, and the pork belly was a true star of the show. The flavor was out of this word and melts in your mouth. The ramen was priced well for both quality and quantity, however the pork buns were very kind of expensive. 1 bun for $5 is steep for something that you can eat in 2-3 bites.

The gentleman that helped with my order was kind, but there was a lady who was running orders who was really rude. My friend and I sat at a table and she got mad. There was no &quot;reserved&quot; sign, and nobody said anything about how carry out worked. She was not pleasant at all. 

If you&apos;ve got a ramen craving (or even if you&apos;re not) this place will hit the spot. It&apos;s the perfect meal for lunch or dinner and carry out orders have great instructions on how to heat and handle them to get the best experience."
4,"When we visited, there was only outside dining due to CoVid regulations, and you had to make a reservation because there was a limited number of tables. The service was great! Our waitress was very friendly and even thought to ask us about any allergies. My husband has a shellfish allergy, so she was able to steer him in the correct direction regarding the ramen he should eat. 

I chose the fried chicken kimchi ramen which was delicious. I was worried that it would be too spicy, but it wasn&apos;t it, and it was really good. If you order any of the ramen entrees, make sure you are hungry, because all of them are enough for two meals. As a group, we shared the Berkshire dumplings and the Mantou Bun with Pork Belly. Both dishes were delicious, but the bun was amazing and almost enough food for a meal.

If you are interested in cocktails, I recommend the Pencillian #2."
4,"My boyfriend and I went to Chicago for a little couples vacation. After a night of drinking way to much Hennessy we decided to go for ramen for lunch since it&apos;s been a while since we&apos;ve had good ramen. On the Midwest anyway.... Jinya will always be my home favorite in Burbank CA. 
Anyway! The food!! It was so mouth watering I couldn&apos;t believe it. At first I thought it was weird and wasn&apos;t sure if I even wanted to order the kimchi and fried chicken. After reading the great reviews I had to try it. The place was cozy and welcoming the lighting was dim the employees in the front were so helpful to. The parking is shit so definitely DO NOT park across the street we seen a girl get towed because sometimes they don&apos;t allow it. We parked right in front per the waiter the safest place to park. 
We sat down and our waiter seemed like he just wanted us to rush ... weird. It got weirder. We literally had about 3-4 waiters/waitresses; didn&apos;t seem like they communicated that well with each other it was kind of all over the place. They rarely checked on us we had to flag them down. We ordered the kimchi fried chicken ramen and Sumo Ramen my boyfriend loved his until he tried mine and was like I&apos;m deff ordering that next time! We also had a house salad ... not that great loved how fresh the greens were the ginger dressing just seemed a bit off. We also had the sticky Thai chicken wings which were super delicious if you order them make sure you use your towelette after your hands get super sticky! Overall I loved the food didn&apos;t care for the customer service still tipped super well because hands down the ramen was SOOO good. The music is also super annoying we went about 1Pm on a Tuesday and the music was blasting as if I was in a house party. I&apos;m 28 not a old lady LOL not  exaggerating just was pretty annoying that me and my boyfriend were struggling the entire time for a conversation because we couldn&apos;t hear each other. 
Deff a must try! Get the kimchi fried chicken ramen you won&apos;t be disappointed!!"
5,"Great experience ! Good ramen and excellent service !
We do live in &quot;the new normal&quot; life - thank you for our waiter making a superb experience ! 
Loved Food !"
4,"I wasn&apos;t sure what I was expecting from this place. I&apos;ve had Lettuce Entertain You Ramen before from Tokio Pub so I was expecting roughly the same. I was thankfully incorrect as this food rocks (yes, I still love you Tokio Pub). 

We had a reservation and were promptly seated. My mom got a Yuzu Margarita. My dad got the Aschi beer and I had an Old Fashioned. All of our drinks were awesome, but special shout-out to my dads beer. I tried it and I was the real star. 

For appetizers, we got a little bit of everything. We were not sure on the fried chicken bun, but that was a huge surprise. It was crispy and had a nice spice. We also got the pork dumplings and chicken dumplings. The chicken dumplings were good, but the pork dumplings were really great! We finished the appetizers with the spicy Szechuan wings. It was a spice that was dry and snuck up on you. Still delicious! 

For our main course, we had the special crispy bacon ramen. It&apos;s around until the end of the month, but RUN to eat it. It was outstanding. It was so tasty! It was also huge! I got it with the Chili inside which gave a nice heat to it. The ramen already had a bit of a peppery kick so the chili might not have been needed. 

We finished up with a dessert of doughnuts with a Carmel vanilla dipping sauce. Heavenly! 

The only downside of the dinner was the environment. This is NOT a place for kids or families. I know that there are a lot of places like that, but not in LEYE. The seating was a bit restrictive and the music they play has quite a bit of swearing. I was there with my parents and felt a little weird, but It would be my scene with my friends! Our server was also fantastic so that&apos;s a big plus. 

In closing! I was floored by the quality of food at this place. I&apos;ll for sure be back, but with friends, not family :)"
5,"I&apos;m a pretty hard critique of Japanese ramen and to be honest, the ramen wasn&apos;t the best I&apos;ve had but I thoroughly enjoyed my overall experience here. The outdoor seating has a partially covered hut and heated lamps overhead the raised tables. Your legs will get chilly so I suggest bringing a blanket or scarf to wrap around your legs to stay warm if dining outside in the winter. Our waiter and staff were very efficient and polite - they visited often but not an annoying amount.  

I ordered the tonkatsu ramen and my boyfriend ordered the katsu tonkatsu (limited edition). Despite the weather being cold outside, our ramen came out very hot and stayed relatively hot until we finished our bowls. I believe the chasu in the tonkatsu was smoked - which was new to me. It surprisingly worked! It didn&apos;t look like a large quantity of meat but it was VERY dense. It filled me up pretty quickly. My ramen had too many bamboo shoots and wakame. I wish there was something light like mung bean sprouts to balance the heaviness and add some texture. The fried garlic was a GREAT addition  though - compliments to the chef on that one. 

The katsu tonkatsu had katsu sauce (like a sweet Japanese worchestire) and mustard wasabi. It significantly impacts the taste of the broth. It wasn&apos;t my cup of tea but my boyfriend enjoyed it. 

Giving this a 5 star because we were treated very well and had an overall good experience. Plus the many cute river north puppies walking by and saying hello put us in an especially good mood. 

Ramen-San is part of lettuce entertain you so make sure you have the app and collect points for dining in!"
4,"Walked in on the whim for lunch on a early Sunday afternoon. Was able to get a table right away. My bf and I both ordered the express lunch for $15.95, which included a ramen, a fried rice, a small salad and pickled cucumbers. Each item was a nicely sized portion and the food hit the spot. I&apos;d definitely recommend the express lunch route if it&apos;s available.

Service overall was attentive and friendly, but one person felt slightly pushy and should maybe reconsider his wording when asking us if we&apos;d like to try some Japanese whiskey instead of the &quot;well whiskey&quot; we originally ordered. The recommendation the first time around was fine, but his second attempt sounded pretty snarky and condescending. I&apos;m going to assume that wasn&apos;t his intention, but it def didn&apos;t encourage us to order more drinks."

A nice filling meal.  Chicago is not up there yet when it comes to Japanese restos. Los Angeles reigns supreme on Japanese food options on the mainland.  Still I&apos;m glad that Ramen-San exists albeit owned by Lettuce and not a Japan entity.

A nice filling meal.  Chicago is not up there yet when it comes to Japanese restos. Los Angeles reigns supreme on Japanese food options on the mainland.  Still I&apos;m glad that Ramen-San exists albeit owned by Lettuce and not a Japan entity. 

First I had the vegan broth ramen.  It was good, the broth tepid, the tofu still cold in the middle.  

On a second visit I had the express lunch option with salmon over rice and small kimchee ramen with a &quot;molten&quot; egg. The broth was good, the &quot;molten&quot; egg was perfect but I only got a half an egg.  The salmon was bathed in sugary sweet sauce that was off putting.  It didn&apos;t go well with the kimchee ramen as next to it, I felt I was eating dessert over steamed rice. 

Loved the service, the outdoor eating options and the coo coo Captain America mugs."
4,"Chicago literally has the best food! The last time I came to Chicago I went to their sister restaurant sushi San which has amazing food. I love a great Ramen!
Due to Covid and the new mandate we had to sit outside, but luckily they had heating lamps and it was a very sunny day.

The Ramen had thick pork pieces that were so tender and juicy. The broth was so delicious, I wish I could eat about 3 bowls of it... lol. 

Ramen san definitely did not disappoint and I will definitely be coming back the next time I visit Chicago"
1,"Server was more concerned about us wearing masks than getting the order right. They completely messed up our order. Also, the seats are extremely uncomfortable wooden benches meant for little kids. Never going here again."
2,"Hate to do this. Excellent packaging, good enough service, no heating outside, and mediocre ramen. 

Try another spot or make instant."
5,"Chicago was cold sooo cold so my boyfriend and I were eager to get something warm in our tummies. Due to covid the wait was longer than expected even tho we had reservations, but the service and amazing food triumphed that small negative for me. The ramen....bruh the ramen was so freaking delicious. It&apos;s def a top two on my ramen list. The Penicillin # 2 wasn&apos;t too strong in my opinion, but still tasty. Because we had to wait longer than expected they offered us some complimentary hot donuts. I thought the gesture was very kind. Lowkey want to take a trip back up there to get back in on this goodness."
2,"I try to order from local spots 1-2x/week during the pandemic to support local businesses. It&apos;s a cold evening so ramen sounded good and I haven&apos;t ordered from Ramen-San yet. 

I ordered via Uber Eats for delivery because it was a little too far for pick up. It estimated 65-85 minutes which was okay and I can understand given it&apos;s a weekend evening. 

But it took over 2 hours to get my food. I watched the tracker and it was clear that the delay was due to the restaurant, not Uber. When I got it, it was ice cold. The fried chicken was soft and appeared to have been sitting for a long time - way longer than the 20 minutes from pick up to my door. Also, there were no utensils! What kind of ramen place doesn&apos;t give chop sticks with an order?!

The food was okay tasting - no better than other places I&apos;ve tried in the city. At the beginning of the pandemic I gave restaurants a lot of grace because of the pivots that most needed to make. But we are a year into this and an efficient delivery process should be in place so food isn&apos;t ice cold and basic utensils are given. With all the great food places in Chicago, probably won&apos;t come back."
4,My husband insisted on trying this spot after a recommendation from friends.  They did not steer us wrong. We tried a fried chicken bowl &amp; a miso bowl with an egg.  Extra noodles are a must my friends!  The broth....wow. Such depth that elevated the toppings. Will definitely try again in the future.
4,Pretty good place. Service was spot on. Server was kind and friendly. Food was tasty and serving size was appropriate. Nothing really beats a steaming hot bowl of ramen on a freezing night. Also got the miso Brussels sprouts but found them a touch too salty but still good. Will come back to try more.
5,"We sample a little everything...drinks, wings, Brussels sprouts, ramen and salad. All delicious!"
4,"Took Ramen-San to go on a rainy night for some comfort food. Super easy to pick up and the ramen toppings were packaged separately from the broth so sogginess was not an issue. 

I ordered the Tonkatsu ramen, the Kimchi Fried Chicken ramen, and the sticky Thai chicken wings. The Tonkatsu was overall really delicious and the broth was on point. I&apos;d definitely order this a second time! The Kimchi Fried Chicken ramen broth was nice and spicy, the chicken pieces were large, but the noodles were a little crusty. I would describe the ramen dishes as mainstream, but they still keep most of the traditional elements of an authentic ramen bowl."
4,"I came here with a party of 4 during the COVID pandemic and appreciated how well organized and accommodating the staff was during these interesting times! This is one of the limited indoor/outdoor dining places outside of Chicago and our party really appreciated the time and effort this restaurant put in! 
The hot broth, hot sake, on a cold winter night in Chicago, how can you go wrong? 
To start we order the karaage chicken with ailoi and it&apos;s perfect to start without getting yourself too full. We ended up ordering ordering 2 orders because of the sides, but this was because we were blinded on the sizes of the ramen! Which is a great segway to: 
The Ramen:
You can&apos;t go wrong with the toncatshu ramen, comes with a soft-boil egg and pork belly! The rest of the group ordered the spicy ramen and apparently it was just as spicy as our waiter warned us. So if you&apos;re not into spice, please double check with your waiter! 
The broth was perfect and creamy, not too overwhelming to the point where you can&apos;t drink it by itself. The egg noodles was fresh and plentiful! If you want you can order a refill, but I barely finished my first serving. 
The pork belly was fresh and nicely fried and made a great compliant with the soft-boiled egg. 
All in all I can say, the next time I&apos;m in Chicago, I will be sure to make a ramen stop here, especially with the weather and location of the restaurant! 
Great job Ramen-San"
3,"Karraage chicken (chicken nuggets) - my Fiancé enjoyed these. They were lightly battered and lightly seasoned as well.

Raw tuna- this was delicious! The tuna and avocado were fresh &amp; completed each other. The chip it was a little too salty for me but it was still enjoyable! 

Buns 
Fried chicken buns- was not a fan of the horseradish in it. I felt like it over powered the flavor of the chicken and had too much in mine. 

Chicken wings 
Spicy Szechuan- this was dry rub and had a great sauce to go with it. I would have liked a little more flavor in these wings otherwise I probably would not get this again. 

Sticky Thai- these were wet and flavorful definitely enjoyed these more than the Szechuan 

Dumpling
Crispy Berkshire- these were crispy and had a decent amount of meat in the dumpling. 

Ramen 
Kimchi &amp; fried chicken- first time trying fried chicken ramen and was not a fan. I will definitely be sticking to my regular pork. The noddles were also harder than usual, it might have needed to be cooked for longer 

Drinks 
Yuzu margarita- this was refreshing and decent

yuzu Saki- very sweet with a strong taste of lemon and grapefruit"
5,"I had an appointment downtown and it was cold out!  I&apos;ve been meaning to try this place for quite some time.  Eating out during Covid times are quite different.  Ramen SAN take no chances.  The place was immaculate and they take your temperature at the entrance.  The social distancing tables are far enough apart and quite safe.  The staff wears masks and gloves and there&apos;s sanitizer there for you.  

As for the food, I tried the chicken and vegetable Gyoza and the Imperial Shio.  The food came out quickly and super hot.  Everything tasted so nice and looked so clean.  

My experience was very positive even during these tough times."
4,"My mouth is watering just thinking about this place. The ramen noodles had so much body, but were so light at the same time, the broth was flavorful, and the pork belly was a true star of the show. The flavor was out of this word and melts in your mouth. The ramen was priced well for both quality and quantity, however the pork buns were very kind of expensive. 1 bun for $5 is steep for something that you can eat in 2-3 bites.

The gentleman that helped with my order was kind, but there was a lady who was running orders who was really rude. My friend and I sat at a table and she got mad. There was no &quot;reserved&quot; sign, and nobody said anything about how carry out worked. She was not pleasant at all. 

If you&apos;ve got a ramen craving (or even if you&apos;re not) this place will hit the spot. It&apos;s the perfect meal for lunch or dinner and carry out orders have great instructions on how to heat and handle them to get the best experience."
4,"When we visited, there was only outside dining due to CoVid regulations, and you had to make a reservation because there was a limited number of tables. The service was great! Our waitress was very friendly and even thought to ask us about any allergies. My husband has a shellfish allergy, so she was able to steer him in the correct direction regarding the ramen he should eat. 

I chose the fried chicken kimchi ramen which was delicious. I was worried that it would be too spicy, but it wasn&apos;t it, and it was really good. If you order any of the ramen entrees, make sure you are hungry, because all of them are enough for two meals. As a group, we shared the Berkshire dumplings and the Mantou Bun with Pork Belly. Both dishes were delicious, but the bun was amazing and almost enough food for a meal.

If you are interested in cocktails, I recommend the Pencillian #2."
4,"My boyfriend and I went to Chicago for a little couples vacation. After a night of drinking way to much Hennessy we decided to go for ramen for lunch since it&apos;s been a while since we&apos;ve had good ramen. On the Midwest anyway.... Jinya will always be my home favorite in Burbank CA. 
Anyway! The food!! It was so mouth watering I couldn&apos;t believe it. At first I thought it was weird and wasn&apos;t sure if I even wanted to order the kimchi and fried chicken. After reading the great reviews I had to try it. The place was cozy and welcoming the lighting was dim the employees in the front were so helpful to. The parking is shit so definitely DO NOT park across the street we seen a girl get towed because sometimes they don&apos;t allow it. We parked right in front per the waiter the safest place to park. 
We sat down and our waiter seemed like he just wanted us to rush ... weird. It got weirder. We literally had about 3-4 waiters/waitresses; didn&apos;t seem like they communicated that well with each other it was kind of all over the place. They rarely checked on us we had to flag them down. We ordered the kimchi fried chicken ramen and Sumo Ramen my boyfriend loved his until he tried mine and was like I&apos;m deff ordering that next time! We also had a house salad ... not that great loved how fresh the greens were the ginger dressing just seemed a bit off. We also had the sticky Thai chicken wings which were super delicious if you order them make sure you use your towelette after your hands get super sticky! Overall I loved the food didn&apos;t care for the customer service still tipped super well because hands down the ramen was SOOO good. The music is also super annoying we went about 1Pm on a Tuesday and the music was blasting as if I was in a house party. I&apos;m 28 not a old lady LOL not  exaggerating just was pretty annoying that me and my boyfriend were struggling the entire time for a conversation because we couldn&apos;t hear each other. 
Deff a must try! Get the kimchi fried chicken ramen you won&apos;t be disappointed!!"
5,"Great experience ! Good ramen and excellent service !
We do live in &quot;the new normal&quot; life - thank you for our waiter making a superb experience ! 
Loved Food !"
4,"I wasn&apos;t sure what I was expecting from this place. I&apos;ve had Lettuce Entertain You Ramen before from Tokio Pub so I was expecting roughly the same. I was thankfully incorrect as this food rocks (yes, I still love you Tokio Pub). 

We had a reservation and were promptly seated. My mom got a Yuzu Margarita. My dad got the Aschi beer and I had an Old Fashioned. All of our drinks were awesome, but special shout-out to my dads beer. I tried it and I was the real star. 

For appetizers, we got a little bit of everything. We were not sure on the fried chicken bun, but that was a huge surprise. It was crispy and had a nice spice. We also got the pork dumplings and chicken dumplings. The chicken dumplings were good, but the pork dumplings were really great! We finished the appetizers with the spicy Szechuan wings. It was a spice that was dry and snuck up on you. Still delicious! 

For our main course, we had the special crispy bacon ramen. It&apos;s around until the end of the month, but RUN to eat it. It was outstanding. It was so tasty! It was also huge! I got it with the Chili inside which gave a nice heat to it. The ramen already had a bit of a peppery kick so the chili might not have been needed. 

We finished up with a dessert of doughnuts with a Carmel vanilla dipping sauce. Heavenly! 

The only downside of the dinner was the environment. This is NOT a place for kids or families. I know that there are a lot of places like that, but not in LEYE. The seating was a bit restrictive and the music they play has quite a bit of swearing. I was there with my parents and felt a little weird, but It would be my scene with my friends! Our server was also fantastic so that&apos;s a big plus. 

In closing! I was floored by the quality of food at this place. I&apos;ll for sure be back, but with friends, not family :)"
5,"I&apos;m a pretty hard critique of Japanese ramen and to be honest, the ramen wasn&apos;t the best I&apos;ve had but I thoroughly enjoyed my overall experience here. The outdoor seating has a partially covered hut and heated lamps overhead the raised tables. Your legs will get chilly so I suggest bringing a blanket or scarf to wrap around your legs to stay warm if dining outside in the winter. Our waiter and staff were very efficient and polite - they visited often but not an annoying amount.  

I ordered the tonkatsu ramen and my boyfriend ordered the katsu tonkatsu (limited edition). Despite the weather being cold outside, our ramen came out very hot and stayed relatively hot until we finished our bowls. I believe the chasu in the tonkatsu was smoked - which was new to me. It surprisingly worked! It didn&apos;t look like a large quantity of meat but it was VERY dense. It filled me up pretty quickly. My ramen had too many bamboo shoots and wakame. I wish there was something light like mung bean sprouts to balance the heaviness and add some texture. The fried garlic was a GREAT addition  though - compliments to the chef on that one. 

The katsu tonkatsu had katsu sauce (like a sweet Japanese worchestire) and mustard wasabi. It significantly impacts the taste of the broth. It wasn&apos;t my cup of tea but my boyfriend enjoyed it. 

Giving this a 5 star because we were treated very well and had an overall good experience. Plus the many cute river north puppies walking by and saying hello put us in an especially good mood. 

Ramen-San is part of lettuce entertain you so make sure you have the app and collect points for dining in!"
4,"Walked in on the whim for lunch on a early Sunday afternoon. Was able to get a table right away. My bf and I both ordered the express lunch for $15.95, which included a ramen, a fried rice, a small salad and pickled cucumbers. Each item was a nicely sized portion and the food hit the spot. I&apos;d definitely recommend the express lunch route if it&apos;s available.

Service overall was attentive and friendly, but one person felt slightly pushy and should maybe reconsider his wording when asking us if we&apos;d like to try some Japanese whiskey instead of the &quot;well whiskey&quot; we originally ordered. The recommendation the first time around was fine, but his second attempt sounded pretty snarky and condescending. I&apos;m going to assume that wasn&apos;t his intention, but it def didn&apos;t encourage us to order more drinks."

Service overall was attentive and friendly, but one person felt slightly pushy and should maybe reconsider his wording when asking us if we&apos;d like to try some Japanese whiskey instead of the &quot;well whiskey&quot; we originally ordered. The recommendation the first time around was fine, but his second attempt sounded pretty snarky and condescending. I&apos;m going to assume that wasn&apos;t his intention, but it def didn&apos;t encourage us to order more drinks."
3,"@BJH.  Thank you for the follow up.  When I&apos;m in Chicago next I will check in with you to see if the comments I made here have been resolved and will update this review. Thank you for taking the time to address my comments.  

A nice filling meal.  Chicago is not up there yet when it comes to Japanese restos. Los Angeles reigns supreme on Japanese food options on the mainland.  Still I&apos;m glad that Ramen-San exists albeit owned by Lettuce and not a Japan entity. 

First I had the vegan broth ramen.  It was good, the broth tepid, the tofu still cold in the middle.  

On a second visit I had the express lunch option with salmon over rice and small kimchee ramen with a &quot;molten&quot; egg. The broth was good, the &quot;molten&quot; egg was perfect but I only got a half an egg.  The salmon was bathed in sugary sweet sauce that was off putting.  It didn&apos;t go well with the kimchee ramen as next to it, I felt I was eating dessert over steamed rice. 

Loved the service, the outdoor eating options and the coo coo Captain America mugs."
4,"Chicago literally has the best food! The last time I came to Chicago I went to their sister restaurant sushi San which has amazing food. I love a great Ramen!
Due to Covid and the new mandate we had to sit outside, but luckily they had heating lamps and it was a very sunny day.

The Ramen had thick pork pieces that were so tender and juicy. The broth was so delicious, I wish I could eat about 3 bowls of it... lol. 

Ramen san definitely did not disappoint and I will definitely be coming back the next time I visit Chicago"
1,"Server was more concerned about us wearing masks than getting the order right. They completely messed up our order. Also, the seats are extremely uncomfortable wooden benches meant for little kids. Never going here again."
2,"Hate to do this. Excellent packaging, good enough service, no heating outside, and mediocre ramen. 

Try another spot or make instant."
5,"Chicago was cold sooo cold so my boyfriend and I were eager to get something warm in our tummies. Due to covid the wait was longer than expected even tho we had reservations, but the service and amazing food triumphed that small negative for me. The ramen....bruh the ramen was so freaking delicious. It&apos;s def a top two on my ramen list. The Penicillin # 2 wasn&apos;t too strong in my opinion, but still tasty. Because we had to wait longer than expected they offered us some complimentary hot donuts. I thought the gesture was very kind. Lowkey want to take a trip back up there to get back in on this goodness."
2,"I try to order from local spots 1-2x/week during the pandemic to support local businesses. It&apos;s a cold evening so ramen sounded good and I haven&apos;t ordered from Ramen-San yet. 

I ordered via Uber Eats for delivery because it was a little too far for pick up. It estimated 65-85 minutes which was okay and I can understand given it&apos;s a weekend evening. 

But it took over 2 hours to get my food. I watched the tracker and it was clear that the delay was due to the restaurant, not Uber. When I got it, it was ice cold. The fried chicken was soft and appeared to have been sitting for a long time - way longer than the 20 minutes from pick up to my door. Also, there were no utensils! What kind of ramen place doesn&apos;t give chop sticks with an order?!

The food was okay tasting - no better than other places I&apos;ve tried in the city. At the beginning of the pandemic I gave restaurants a lot of grace because of the pivots that most needed to make. But we are a year into this and an efficient delivery process should be in place so food isn&apos;t ice cold and basic utensils are given. With all the great food places in Chicago, probably won&apos;t come back."
4,My husband insisted on trying this spot after a recommendation from friends.  They did not steer us wrong. We tried a fried chicken bowl &amp; a miso bowl with an egg.  Extra noodles are a must my friends!  The broth....wow. Such depth that elevated the toppings. Will definitely try again in the future.
4,Pretty good place. Service was spot on. Server was kind and friendly. Food was tasty and serving size was appropriate. Nothing really beats a steaming hot bowl of ramen on a freezing night. Also got the miso Brussels sprouts but found them a touch too salty but still good. Will come back to try more.
5,"We sample a little everything...drinks, wings, Brussels sprouts, ramen and salad. All delicious!"
4,"Took Ramen-San to go on a rainy night for some comfort food. Super easy to pick up and the ramen toppings were packaged separately from the broth so sogginess was not an issue. 

I ordered the Tonkatsu ramen, the Kimchi Fried Chicken ramen, and the sticky Thai chicken wings. The Tonkatsu was overall really delicious and the broth was on point. I&apos;d definitely order this a second time! The Kimchi Fried Chicken ramen broth was nice and spicy, the chicken pieces were large, but the noodles were a little crusty. I would describe the ramen dishes as mainstream, but they still keep most of the traditional elements of an authentic ramen bowl."
4,"I came here with a party of 4 during the COVID pandemic and appreciated how well organized and accommodating the staff was during these interesting times! This is one of the limited indoor/outdoor dining places outside of Chicago and our party really appreciated the time and effort this restaurant put in! 
The hot broth, hot sake, on a cold winter night in Chicago, how can you go wrong? 
To start we order the karaage chicken with ailoi and it&apos;s perfect to start without getting yourself too full. We ended up ordering ordering 2 orders because of the sides, but this was because we were blinded on the sizes of the ramen! Which is a great segway to: 
The Ramen:
You can&apos;t go wrong with the toncatshu ramen, comes with a soft-boil egg and pork belly! The rest of the group ordered the spicy ramen and apparently it was just as spicy as our waiter warned us. So if you&apos;re not into spice, please double check with your waiter! 
The broth was perfect and creamy, not too overwhelming to the point where you can&apos;t drink it by itself. The egg noodles was fresh and plentiful! If you want you can order a refill, but I barely finished my first serving. 
The pork belly was fresh and nicely fried and made a great compliant with the soft-boiled egg. 
All in all I can say, the next time I&apos;m in Chicago, I will be sure to make a ramen stop here, especially with the weather and location of the restaurant! 
Great job Ramen-San"
3,"Karraage chicken (chicken nuggets) - my Fiancé enjoyed these. They were lightly battered and lightly seasoned as well.

Raw tuna- this was delicious! The tuna and avocado were fresh &amp; completed each other. The chip it was a little too salty for me but it was still enjoyable! 

Buns 
Fried chicken buns- was not a fan of the horseradish in it. I felt like it over powered the flavor of the chicken and had too much in mine. 

Chicken wings 
Spicy Szechuan- this was dry rub and had a great sauce to go with it. I would have liked a little more flavor in these wings otherwise I probably would not get this again. 

Sticky Thai- these were wet and flavorful definitely enjoyed these more than the Szechuan 

Dumpling
Crispy Berkshire- these were crispy and had a decent amount of meat in the dumpling. 

Ramen 
Kimchi &amp; fried chicken- first time trying fried chicken ramen and was not a fan. I will definitely be sticking to my regular pork. The noddles were also harder than usual, it might have needed to be cooked for longer 

Drinks 
Yuzu margarita- this was refreshing and decent

yuzu Saki- very sweet with a strong taste of lemon and grapefruit"
5,"I had an appointment downtown and it was cold out!  I&apos;ve been meaning to try this place for quite some time.  Eating out during Covid times are quite different.  Ramen SAN take no chances.  The place was immaculate and they take your temperature at the entrance.  The social distancing tables are far enough apart and quite safe.  The staff wears masks and gloves and there&apos;s sanitizer there for you.  

As for the food, I tried the chicken and vegetable Gyoza and the Imperial Shio.  The food came out quickly and super hot.  Everything tasted so nice and looked so clean.  

My experience was very positive even during these tough times."
4,"My mouth is watering just thinking about this place. The ramen noodles had so much body, but were so light at the same time, the broth was flavorful, and the pork belly was a true star of the show. The flavor was out of this word and melts in your mouth. The ramen was priced well for both quality and quantity, however the pork buns were very kind of expensive. 1 bun for $5 is steep for something that you can eat in 2-3 bites.

The gentleman that helped with my order was kind, but there was a lady who was running orders who was really rude. My friend and I sat at a table and she got mad. There was no &quot;reserved&quot; sign, and nobody said anything about how carry out worked. She was not pleasant at all. 

If you&apos;ve got a ramen craving (or even if you&apos;re not) this place will hit the spot. It&apos;s the perfect meal for lunch or dinner and carry out orders have great instructions on how to heat and handle them to get the best experience."
4,"When we visited, there was only outside dining due to CoVid regulations, and you had to make a reservation because there was a limited number of tables. The service was great! Our waitress was very friendly and even thought to ask us about any allergies. My husband has a shellfish allergy, so she was able to steer him in the correct direction regarding the ramen he should eat. 

I chose the fried chicken kimchi ramen which was delicious. I was worried that it would be too spicy, but it wasn&apos;t it, and it was really good. If you order any of the ramen entrees, make sure you are hungry, because all of them are enough for two meals. As a group, we shared the Berkshire dumplings and the Mantou Bun with Pork Belly. Both dishes were delicious, but the bun was amazing and almost enough food for a meal.

If you are interested in cocktails, I recommend the Pencillian #2."
4,"My boyfriend and I went to Chicago for a little couples vacation. After a night of drinking way to much Hennessy we decided to go for ramen for lunch since it&apos;s been a while since we&apos;ve had good ramen. On the Midwest anyway.... Jinya will always be my home favorite in Burbank CA. 
Anyway! The food!! It was so mouth watering I couldn&apos;t believe it. At first I thought it was weird and wasn&apos;t sure if I even wanted to order the kimchi and fried chicken. After reading the great reviews I had to try it. The place was cozy and welcoming the lighting was dim the employees in the front were so helpful to. The parking is shit so definitely DO NOT park across the street we seen a girl get towed because sometimes they don&apos;t allow it. We parked right in front per the waiter the safest place to park. 
We sat down and our waiter seemed like he just wanted us to rush ... weird. It got weirder. We literally had about 3-4 waiters/waitresses; didn&apos;t seem like they communicated that well with each other it was kind of all over the place. They rarely checked on us we had to flag them down. We ordered the kimchi fried chicken ramen and Sumo Ramen my boyfriend loved his until he tried mine and was like I&apos;m deff ordering that next time! We also had a house salad ... not that great loved how fresh the greens were the ginger dressing just seemed a bit off. We also had the sticky Thai chicken wings which were super delicious if you order them make sure you use your towelette after your hands get super sticky! Overall I loved the food didn&apos;t care for the customer service still tipped super well because hands down the ramen was SOOO good. The music is also super annoying we went about 1Pm on a Tuesday and the music was blasting as if I was in a house party. I&apos;m 28 not a old lady LOL not  exaggerating just was pretty annoying that me and my boyfriend were struggling the entire time for a conversation because we couldn&apos;t hear each other. 
Deff a must try! Get the kimchi fried chicken ramen you won&apos;t be disappointed!!"
5,"Great experience ! Good ramen and excellent service !
We do live in &quot;the new normal&quot; life - thank you for our waiter making a superb experience ! 
Loved Food !"
4,"I wasn&apos;t sure what I was expecting from this place. I&apos;ve had Lettuce Entertain You Ramen before from Tokio Pub so I was expecting roughly the same. I was thankfully incorrect as this food rocks (yes, I still love you Tokio Pub). 

We had a reservation and were promptly seated. My mom got a Yuzu Margarita. My dad got the Aschi beer and I had an Old Fashioned. All of our drinks were awesome, but special shout-out to my dads beer. I tried it and I was the real star. 

For appetizers, we got a little bit of everything. We were not sure on the fried chicken bun, but that was a huge surprise. It was crispy and had a nice spice. We also got the pork dumplings and chicken dumplings. The chicken dumplings were good, but the pork dumplings were really great! We finished the appetizers with the spicy Szechuan wings. It was a spice that was dry and snuck up on you. Still delicious! 

For our main course, we had the special crispy bacon ramen. It&apos;s around until the end of the month, but RUN to eat it. It was outstanding. It was so tasty! It was also huge! I got it with the Chili inside which gave a nice heat to it. The ramen already had a bit of a peppery kick so the chili might not have been needed. 

We finished up with a dessert of doughnuts with a Carmel vanilla dipping sauce. Heavenly! 

The only downside of the dinner was the environment. This is NOT a place for kids or families. I know that there are a lot of places like that, but not in LEYE. The seating was a bit restrictive and the music they play has quite a bit of swearing. I was there with my parents and felt a little weird, but It would be my scene with my friends! Our server was also fantastic so that&apos;s a big plus. 

In closing! I was floored by the quality of food at this place. I&apos;ll for sure be back, but with friends, not family :)"
5,"I&apos;m a pretty hard critique of Japanese ramen and to be honest, the ramen wasn&apos;t the best I&apos;ve had but I thoroughly enjoyed my overall experience here. The outdoor seating has a partially covered hut and heated lamps overhead the raised tables. Your legs will get chilly so I suggest bringing a blanket or scarf to wrap around your legs to stay warm if dining outside in the winter. Our waiter and staff were very efficient and polite - they visited often but not an annoying amount.  

I ordered the tonkatsu ramen and my boyfriend ordered the katsu tonkatsu (limited edition). Despite the weather being cold outside, our ramen came out very hot and stayed relatively hot until we finished our bowls. I believe the chasu in the tonkatsu was smoked - which was new to me. It surprisingly worked! It didn&apos;t look like a large quantity of meat but it was VERY dense. It filled me up pretty quickly. My ramen had too many bamboo shoots and wakame. I wish there was something light like mung bean sprouts to balance the heaviness and add some texture. The fried garlic was a GREAT addition  though - compliments to the chef on that one. 

The katsu tonkatsu had katsu sauce (like a sweet Japanese worchestire) and mustard wasabi. It significantly impacts the taste of the broth. It wasn&apos;t my cup of tea but my boyfriend enjoyed it. 

Giving this a 5 star because we were treated very well and had an overall good experience. Plus the many cute river north puppies walking by and saying hello put us in an especially good mood. 

Ramen-San is part of lettuce entertain you so make sure you have the app and collect points for dining in!"

Ramen-San is part of lettuce entertain you so make sure you have the app and collect points for dining in!"
4,"Walked in on the whim for lunch on a early Sunday afternoon. Was able to get a table right away. My bf and I both ordered the express lunch for $15.95, which included a ramen, a fried rice, a small salad and pickled cucumbers. Each item was a nicely sized portion and the food hit the spot. I&apos;d definitely recommend the express lunch route if it&apos;s available.

Service overall was attentive and friendly, but one person felt slightly pushy and should maybe reconsider his wording when asking us if we&apos;d like to try some Japanese whiskey instead of the &quot;well whiskey&quot; we originally ordered. The recommendation the first time around was fine, but his second attempt sounded pretty snarky and condescending. I&apos;m going to assume that wasn&apos;t his intention, but it def didn&apos;t encourage us to order more drinks."
3,"@BJH.  Thank you for the follow up.  When I&apos;m in Chicago next I will check in with you to see if the comments I made here have been resolved and will update this review. Thank you for taking the time to address my comments.  

A nice filling meal.  Chicago is not up there yet when it comes to Japanese restos. Los Angeles reigns supreme on Japanese food options on the mainland.  Still I&apos;m glad that Ramen-San exists albeit owned by Lettuce and not a Japan entity. 

First I had the vegan broth ramen.  It was good, the broth tepid, the tofu still cold in the middle.  

On a second visit I had the express lunch option with salmon over rice and small kimchee ramen with a &quot;molten&quot; egg. The broth was good, the &quot;molten&quot; egg was perfect but I only got a half an egg.  The salmon was bathed in sugary sweet sauce that was off putting.  It didn&apos;t go well with the kimchee ramen as next to it, I felt I was eating dessert over steamed rice. 

Loved the service, the outdoor eating options and the coo coo Captain America mugs."
4,"Chicago literally has the best food! The last time I came to Chicago I went to their sister restaurant sushi San which has amazing food. I love a great Ramen!
Due to Covid and the new mandate we had to sit outside, but luckily they had heating lamps and it was a very sunny day.

The Ramen had thick pork pieces that were so tender and juicy. The broth was so delicious, I wish I could eat about 3 bowls of it... lol. 

Ramen san definitely did not disappoint and I will definitely be coming back the next time I visit Chicago"
1,"Server was more concerned about us wearing masks than getting the order right. They completely messed up our order. Also, the seats are extremely uncomfortable wooden benches meant for little kids. Never going here again."
2,"Hate to do this. Excellent packaging, good enough service, no heating outside, and mediocre ramen. 

Try another spot or make instant."
5,"Chicago was cold sooo cold so my boyfriend and I were eager to get something warm in our tummies. Due to covid the wait was longer than expected even tho we had reservations, but the service and amazing food triumphed that small negative for me. The ramen....bruh the ramen was so freaking delicious. It&apos;s def a top two on my ramen list. The Penicillin # 2 wasn&apos;t too strong in my opinion, but still tasty. Because we had to wait longer than expected they offered us some complimentary hot donuts. I thought the gesture was very kind. Lowkey want to take a trip back up there to get back in on this goodness."
2,"I try to order from local spots 1-2x/week during the pandemic to support local businesses. It&apos;s a cold evening so ramen sounded good and I haven&apos;t ordered from Ramen-San yet. 

I ordered via Uber Eats for delivery because it was a little too far for pick up. It estimated 65-85 minutes which was okay and I can understand given it&apos;s a weekend evening. 

But it took over 2 hours to get my food. I watched the tracker and it was clear that the delay was due to the restaurant, not Uber. When I got it, it was ice cold. The fried chicken was soft and appeared to have been sitting for a long time - way longer than the 20 minutes from pick up to my door. Also, there were no utensils! What kind of ramen place doesn&apos;t give chop sticks with an order?!

The food was okay tasting - no better than other places I&apos;ve tried in the city. At the beginning of the pandemic I gave restaurants a lot of grace because of the pivots that most needed to make. But we are a year into this and an efficient delivery process should be in place so food isn&apos;t ice cold and basic utensils are given. With all the great food places in Chicago, probably won&apos;t come back."
4,My husband insisted on trying this spot after a recommendation from friends.  They did not steer us wrong. We tried a fried chicken bowl &amp; a miso bowl with an egg.  Extra noodles are a must my friends!  The broth....wow. Such depth that elevated the toppings. Will definitely try again in the future.
4,Pretty good place. Service was spot on. Server was kind and friendly. Food was tasty and serving size was appropriate. Nothing really beats a steaming hot bowl of ramen on a freezing night. Also got the miso Brussels sprouts but found them a touch too salty but still good. Will come back to try more.
5,"We sample a little everything...drinks, wings, Brussels sprouts, ramen and salad. All delicious!"
4,"Took Ramen-San to go on a rainy night for some comfort food. Super easy to pick up and the ramen toppings were packaged separately from the broth so sogginess was not an issue. 

I ordered the Tonkatsu ramen, the Kimchi Fried Chicken ramen, and the sticky Thai chicken wings. The Tonkatsu was overall really delicious and the broth was on point. I&apos;d definitely order this a second time! The Kimchi Fried Chicken ramen broth was nice and spicy, the chicken pieces were large, but the noodles were a little crusty. I would describe the ramen dishes as mainstream, but they still keep most of the traditional elements of an authentic ramen bowl."
4,"I came here with a party of 4 during the COVID pandemic and appreciated how well organized and accommodating the staff was during these interesting times! This is one of the limited indoor/outdoor dining places outside of Chicago and our party really appreciated the time and effort this restaurant put in! 
The hot broth, hot sake, on a cold winter night in Chicago, how can you go wrong? 
To start we order the karaage chicken with ailoi and it&apos;s perfect to start without getting yourself too full. We ended up ordering ordering 2 orders because of the sides, but this was because we were blinded on the sizes of the ramen! Which is a great segway to: 
The Ramen:
You can&apos;t go wrong with the toncatshu ramen, comes with a soft-boil egg and pork belly! The rest of the group ordered the spicy ramen and apparently it was just as spicy as our waiter warned us. So if you&apos;re not into spice, please double check with your waiter! 
The broth was perfect and creamy, not too overwhelming to the point where you can&apos;t drink it by itself. The egg noodles was fresh and plentiful! If you want you can order a refill, but I barely finished my first serving. 
The pork belly was fresh and nicely fried and made a great compliant with the soft-boiled egg. 
All in all I can say, the next time I&apos;m in Chicago, I will be sure to make a ramen stop here, especially with the weather and location of the restaurant! 
Great job Ramen-San"
3,"Karraage chicken (chicken nuggets) - my Fiancé enjoyed these. They were lightly battered and lightly seasoned as well.

Raw tuna- this was delicious! The tuna and avocado were fresh &amp; completed each other. The chip it was a little too salty for me but it was still enjoyable! 

Buns 
Fried chicken buns- was not a fan of the horseradish in it. I felt like it over powered the flavor of the chicken and had too much in mine. 

Chicken wings 
Spicy Szechuan- this was dry rub and had a great sauce to go with it. I would have liked a little more flavor in these wings otherwise I probably would not get this again. 

Sticky Thai- these were wet and flavorful definitely enjoyed these more than the Szechuan 

Dumpling
Crispy Berkshire- these were crispy and had a decent amount of meat in the dumpling. 

Ramen 
Kimchi &amp; fried chicken- first time trying fried chicken ramen and was not a fan. I will definitely be sticking to my regular pork. The noddles were also harder than usual, it might have needed to be cooked for longer 

Drinks 
Yuzu margarita- this was refreshing and decent

yuzu Saki- very sweet with a strong taste of lemon and grapefruit"
5,"I had an appointment downtown and it was cold out!  I&apos;ve been meaning to try this place for quite some time.  Eating out during Covid times are quite different.  Ramen SAN take no chances.  The place was immaculate and they take your temperature at the entrance.  The social distancing tables are far enough apart and quite safe.  The staff wears masks and gloves and there&apos;s sanitizer there for you.  

As for the food, I tried the chicken and vegetable Gyoza and the Imperial Shio.  The food came out quickly and super hot.  Everything tasted so nice and looked so clean.  

My experience was very positive even during these tough times."
4,"My mouth is watering just thinking about this place. The ramen noodles had so much body, but were so light at the same time, the broth was flavorful, and the pork belly was a true star of the show. The flavor was out of this word and melts in your mouth. The ramen was priced well for both quality and quantity, however the pork buns were very kind of expensive. 1 bun for $5 is steep for something that you can eat in 2-3 bites.

The gentleman that helped with my order was kind, but there was a lady who was running orders who was really rude. My friend and I sat at a table and she got mad. There was no &quot;reserved&quot; sign, and nobody said anything about how carry out worked. She was not pleasant at all. 

If you&apos;ve got a ramen craving (or even if you&apos;re not) this place will hit the spot. It&apos;s the perfect meal for lunch or dinner and carry out orders have great instructions on how to heat and handle them to get the best experience."
4,"When we visited, there was only outside dining due to CoVid regulations, and you had to make a reservation because there was a limited number of tables. The service was great! Our waitress was very friendly and even thought to ask us about any allergies. My husband has a shellfish allergy, so she was able to steer him in the correct direction regarding the ramen he should eat. 

I chose the fried chicken kimchi ramen which was delicious. I was worried that it would be too spicy, but it wasn&apos;t it, and it was really good. If you order any of the ramen entrees, make sure you are hungry, because all of them are enough for two meals. As a group, we shared the Berkshire dumplings and the Mantou Bun with Pork Belly. Both dishes were delicious, but the bun was amazing and almost enough food for a meal.

If you are interested in cocktails, I recommend the Pencillian #2."
4,"My boyfriend and I went to Chicago for a little couples vacation. After a night of drinking way to much Hennessy we decided to go for ramen for lunch since it&apos;s been a while since we&apos;ve had good ramen. On the Midwest anyway.... Jinya will always be my home favorite in Burbank CA. 
Anyway! The food!! It was so mouth watering I couldn&apos;t believe it. At first I thought it was weird and wasn&apos;t sure if I even wanted to order the kimchi and fried chicken. After reading the great reviews I had to try it. The place was cozy and welcoming the lighting was dim the employees in the front were so helpful to. The parking is shit so definitely DO NOT park across the street we seen a girl get towed because sometimes they don&apos;t allow it. We parked right in front per the waiter the safest place to park. 
We sat down and our waiter seemed like he just wanted us to rush ... weird. It got weirder. We literally had about 3-4 waiters/waitresses; didn&apos;t seem like they communicated that well with each other it was kind of all over the place. They rarely checked on us we had to flag them down. We ordered the kimchi fried chicken ramen and Sumo Ramen my boyfriend loved his until he tried mine and was like I&apos;m deff ordering that next time! We also had a house salad ... not that great loved how fresh the greens were the ginger dressing just seemed a bit off. We also had the sticky Thai chicken wings which were super delicious if you order them make sure you use your towelette after your hands get super sticky! Overall I loved the food didn&apos;t care for the customer service still tipped super well because hands down the ramen was SOOO good. The music is also super annoying we went about 1Pm on a Tuesday and the music was blasting as if I was in a house party. I&apos;m 28 not a old lady LOL not  exaggerating just was pretty annoying that me and my boyfriend were struggling the entire time for a conversation because we couldn&apos;t hear each other. 
Deff a must try! Get the kimchi fried chicken ramen you won&apos;t be disappointed!!"
5,"Great experience ! Good ramen and excellent service !
We do live in &quot;the new normal&quot; life - thank you for our waiter making a superb experience ! 
Loved Food !"
4,"I wasn&apos;t sure what I was expecting from this place. I&apos;ve had Lettuce Entertain You Ramen before from Tokio Pub so I was expecting roughly the same. I was thankfully incorrect as this food rocks (yes, I still love you Tokio Pub). 

We had a reservation and were promptly seated. My mom got a Yuzu Margarita. My dad got the Aschi beer and I had an Old Fashioned. All of our drinks were awesome, but special shout-out to my dads beer. I tried it and I was the real star. 

For appetizers, we got a little bit of everything. We were not sure on the fried chicken bun, but that was a huge surprise. It was crispy and had a nice spice. We also got the pork dumplings and chicken dumplings. The chicken dumplings were good, but the pork dumplings were really great! We finished the appetizers with the spicy Szechuan wings. It was a spice that was dry and snuck up on you. Still delicious! 

For our main course, we had the special crispy bacon ramen. It&apos;s around until the end of the month, but RUN to eat it. It was outstanding. It was so tasty! It was also huge! I got it with the Chili inside which gave a nice heat to it. The ramen already had a bit of a peppery kick so the chili might not have been needed. 

We finished up with a dessert of doughnuts with a Carmel vanilla dipping sauce. Heavenly! 

The only downside of the dinner was the environment. This is NOT a place for kids or families. I know that there are a lot of places like that, but not in LEYE. The seating was a bit restrictive and the music they play has quite a bit of swearing. I was there with my parents and felt a little weird, but It would be my scene with my friends! Our server was also fantastic so that&apos;s a big plus. 

In closing! I was floored by the quality of food at this place. I&apos;ll for sure be back, but with friends, not family :)"
5,"I&apos;m a pretty hard critique of Japanese ramen and to be honest, the ramen wasn&apos;t the best I&apos;ve had but I thoroughly enjoyed my overall experience here. The outdoor seating has a partially covered hut and heated lamps overhead the raised tables. Your legs will get chilly so I suggest bringing a blanket or scarf to wrap around your legs to stay warm if dining outside in the winter. Our waiter and staff were very efficient and polite - they visited often but not an annoying amount.  

I ordered the tonkatsu ramen and my boyfriend ordered the katsu tonkatsu (limited edition). Despite the weather being cold outside, our ramen came out very hot and stayed relatively hot until we finished our bowls. I believe the chasu in the tonkatsu was smoked - which was new to me. It surprisingly worked! It didn&apos;t look like a large quantity of meat but it was VERY dense. It filled me up pretty quickly. My ramen had too many bamboo shoots and wakame. I wish there was something light like mung bean sprouts to balance the heaviness and add some texture. The fried garlic was a GREAT addition  though - compliments to the chef on that one. 

The katsu tonkatsu had katsu sauce (like a sweet Japanese worchestire) and mustard wasabi. It significantly impacts the taste of the broth. It wasn&apos;t my cup of tea but my boyfriend enjoyed it. 

Giving this a 5 star because we were treated very well and had an overall good experience. Plus the many cute river north puppies walking by and saying hello put us in an especially good mood.

It surprisingly worked! It didn&apos;t look like a large quantity of meat but it was VERY dense. It filled me up pretty quickly. My ramen had too many bamboo shoots and wakame. I wish there was something light like mung bean sprouts to balance the heaviness and add some texture. The fried garlic was a GREAT addition  though - compliments to the chef on that one. 

The katsu tonkatsu had katsu sauce (like a sweet Japanese worchestire) and mustard wasabi. It significantly impacts the taste of the broth. It wasn&apos;t my cup of tea but my boyfriend enjoyed it. 

Giving this a 5 star because we were treated very well and had an overall good experience. Plus the many cute river north puppies walking by and saying hello put us in an especially good mood. 

Ramen-San is part of lettuce entertain you so make sure you have the app and collect points for dining in!"
4,"Walked in on the whim for lunch on a early Sunday afternoon. Was able to get a table right away. My bf and I both ordered the express lunch for $15.95, which included a ramen, a fried rice, a small salad and pickled cucumbers. Each item was a nicely sized portion and the food hit the spot. I&apos;d definitely recommend the express lunch route if it&apos;s available.

Service overall was attentive and friendly, but one person felt slightly pushy and should maybe reconsider his wording when asking us if we&apos;d like to try some Japanese whiskey instead of the &quot;well whiskey&quot; we originally ordered. The recommendation the first time around was fine, but his second attempt sounded pretty snarky and condescending. I&apos;m going to assume that wasn&apos;t his intention, but it def didn&apos;t encourage us to order more drinks."
3,"@BJH.  Thank you for the follow up.  When I&apos;m in Chicago next I will check in with you to see if the comments I made here have been resolved and will update this review. Thank you for taking the time to address my comments.  

A nice filling meal.  Chicago is not up there yet when it comes to Japanese restos. Los Angeles reigns supreme on Japanese food options on the mainland.  Still I&apos;m glad that Ramen-San exists albeit owned by Lettuce and not a Japan entity. 

First I had the vegan broth ramen.  It was good, the broth tepid, the tofu still cold in the middle.  

On a second visit I had the express lunch option with salmon over rice and small kimchee ramen with a &quot;molten&quot; egg. The broth was good, the &quot;molten&quot; egg was perfect but I only got a half an egg.  The salmon was bathed in sugary sweet sauce that was off putting.  It didn&apos;t go well with the kimchee ramen as next to it, I felt I was eating dessert over steamed rice. 

Loved the service, the outdoor eating options and the coo coo Captain America mugs."
4,"Chicago literally has the best food! The last time I came to Chicago I went to their sister restaurant sushi San which has amazing food. I love a great Ramen!
Due to Covid and the new mandate we had to sit outside, but luckily they had heating lamps and it was a very sunny day.

The Ramen had thick pork pieces that were so tender and juicy. The broth was so delicious, I wish I could eat about 3 bowls of it... lol. 

Ramen san definitely did not disappoint and I will definitely be coming back the next time I visit Chicago"
1,"Server was more concerned about us wearing masks than getting the order right. They completely messed up our order. Also, the seats are extremely uncomfortable wooden benches meant for little kids. Never going here again."
2,"Hate to do this. Excellent packaging, good enough service, no heating outside, and mediocre ramen. 

Try another spot or make instant."
5,"Chicago was cold sooo cold so my boyfriend and I were eager to get something warm in our tummies. Due to covid the wait was longer than expected even tho we had reservations, but the service and amazing food triumphed that small negative for me. The ramen....bruh the ramen was so freaking delicious. It&apos;s def a top two on my ramen list. The Penicillin # 2 wasn&apos;t too strong in my opinion, but still tasty. Because we had to wait longer than expected they offered us some complimentary hot donuts. I thought the gesture was very kind. Lowkey want to take a trip back up there to get back in on this goodness."
2,"I try to order from local spots 1-2x/week during the pandemic to support local businesses. It&apos;s a cold evening so ramen sounded good and I haven&apos;t ordered from Ramen-San yet. 

I ordered via Uber Eats for delivery because it was a little too far for pick up. It estimated 65-85 minutes which was okay and I can understand given it&apos;s a weekend evening. 

But it took over 2 hours to get my food. I watched the tracker and it was clear that the delay was due to the restaurant, not Uber. When I got it, it was ice cold. The fried chicken was soft and appeared to have been sitting for a long time - way longer than the 20 minutes from pick up to my door. Also, there were no utensils! What kind of ramen place doesn&apos;t give chop sticks with an order?!

The food was okay tasting - no better than other places I&apos;ve tried in the city. At the beginning of the pandemic I gave restaurants a lot of grace because of the pivots that most needed to make. But we are a year into this and an efficient delivery process should be in place so food isn&apos;t ice cold and basic utensils are given. With all the great food places in Chicago, probably won&apos;t come back."
4,My husband insisted on trying this spot after a recommendation from friends.  They did not steer us wrong. We tried a fried chicken bowl &amp; a miso bowl with an egg.  Extra noodles are a must my friends!  The broth....wow. Such depth that elevated the toppings. Will definitely try again in the future.
4,Pretty good place. Service was spot on. Server was kind and friendly. Food was tasty and serving size was appropriate. Nothing really beats a steaming hot bowl of ramen on a freezing night. Also got the miso Brussels sprouts but found them a touch too salty but still good. Will come back to try more.
5,"We sample a little everything...drinks, wings, Brussels sprouts, ramen and salad. All delicious!"
4,"Took Ramen-San to go on a rainy night for some comfort food. Super easy to pick up and the ramen toppings were packaged separately from the broth so sogginess was not an issue. 

I ordered the Tonkatsu ramen, the Kimchi Fried Chicken ramen, and the sticky Thai chicken wings. The Tonkatsu was overall really delicious and the broth was on point. I&apos;d definitely order this a second time! The Kimchi Fried Chicken ramen broth was nice and spicy, the chicken pieces were large, but the noodles were a little crusty. I would describe the ramen dishes as mainstream, but they still keep most of the traditional elements of an authentic ramen bowl."
4,"I came here with a party of 4 during the COVID pandemic and appreciated how well organized and accommodating the staff was during these interesting times! This is one of the limited indoor/outdoor dining places outside of Chicago and our party really appreciated the time and effort this restaurant put in! 
The hot broth, hot sake, on a cold winter night in Chicago, how can you go wrong? 
To start we order the karaage chicken with ailoi and it&apos;s perfect to start without getting yourself too full. We ended up ordering ordering 2 orders because of the sides, but this was because we were blinded on the sizes of the ramen! Which is a great segway to: 
The Ramen:
You can&apos;t go wrong with the toncatshu ramen, comes with a soft-boil egg and pork belly! The rest of the group ordered the spicy ramen and apparently it was just as spicy as our waiter warned us. So if you&apos;re not into spice, please double check with your waiter! 
The broth was perfect and creamy, not too overwhelming to the point where you can&apos;t drink it by itself. The egg noodles was fresh and plentiful! If you want you can order a refill, but I barely finished my first serving. 
The pork belly was fresh and nicely fried and made a great compliant with the soft-boiled egg. 
All in all I can say, the next time I&apos;m in Chicago, I will be sure to make a ramen stop here, especially with the weather and location of the restaurant! 
Great job Ramen-San"
3,"Karraage chicken (chicken nuggets) - my Fiancé enjoyed these. They were lightly battered and lightly seasoned as well.

Raw tuna- this was delicious! The tuna and avocado were fresh &amp; completed each other. The chip it was a little too salty for me but it was still enjoyable! 

Buns 
Fried chicken buns- was not a fan of the horseradish in it. I felt like it over powered the flavor of the chicken and had too much in mine. 

Chicken wings 
Spicy Szechuan- this was dry rub and had a great sauce to go with it. I would have liked a little more flavor in these wings otherwise I probably would not get this again. 

Sticky Thai- these were wet and flavorful definitely enjoyed these more than the Szechuan 

Dumpling
Crispy Berkshire- these were crispy and had a decent amount of meat in the dumpling. 

Ramen 
Kimchi &amp; fried chicken- first time trying fried chicken ramen and was not a fan. I will definitely be sticking to my regular pork. The noddles were also harder than usual, it might have needed to be cooked for longer 

Drinks 
Yuzu margarita- this was refreshing and decent

yuzu Saki- very sweet with a strong taste of lemon and grapefruit"
5,"I had an appointment downtown and it was cold out!  I&apos;ve been meaning to try this place for quite some time.  Eating out during Covid times are quite different.  Ramen SAN take no chances.  The place was immaculate and they take your temperature at the entrance.  The social distancing tables are far enough apart and quite safe.  The staff wears masks and gloves and there&apos;s sanitizer there for you.  

As for the food, I tried the chicken and vegetable Gyoza and the Imperial Shio.  The food came out quickly and super hot.  Everything tasted so nice and looked so clean.  

My experience was very positive even during these tough times."
4,"My mouth is watering just thinking about this place. The ramen noodles had so much body, but were so light at the same time, the broth was flavorful, and the pork belly was a true star of the show. The flavor was out of this word and melts in your mouth. The ramen was priced well for both quality and quantity, however the pork buns were very kind of expensive. 1 bun for $5 is steep for something that you can eat in 2-3 bites.

The gentleman that helped with my order was kind, but there was a lady who was running orders who was really rude. My friend and I sat at a table and she got mad. There was no &quot;reserved&quot; sign, and nobody said anything about how carry out worked. She was not pleasant at all. 

If you&apos;ve got a ramen craving (or even if you&apos;re not) this place will hit the spot. It&apos;s the perfect meal for lunch or dinner and carry out orders have great instructions on how to heat and handle them to get the best experience."
4,"When we visited, there was only outside dining due to CoVid regulations, and you had to make a reservation because there was a limited number of tables. The service was great! Our waitress was very friendly and even thought to ask us about any allergies. My husband has a shellfish allergy, so she was able to steer him in the correct direction regarding the ramen he should eat. 

I chose the fried chicken kimchi ramen which was delicious. I was worried that it would be too spicy, but it wasn&apos;t it, and it was really good. If you order any of the ramen entrees, make sure you are hungry, because all of them are enough for two meals. As a group, we shared the Berkshire dumplings and the Mantou Bun with Pork Belly. Both dishes were delicious, but the bun was amazing and almost enough food for a meal.

If you are interested in cocktails, I recommend the Pencillian #2."
4,"My boyfriend and I went to Chicago for a little couples vacation. After a night of drinking way to much Hennessy we decided to go for ramen for lunch since it&apos;s been a while since we&apos;ve had good ramen. On the Midwest anyway.... Jinya will always be my home favorite in Burbank CA. 
Anyway! The food!! It was so mouth watering I couldn&apos;t believe it. At first I thought it was weird and wasn&apos;t sure if I even wanted to order the kimchi and fried chicken. After reading the great reviews I had to try it. The place was cozy and welcoming the lighting was dim the employees in the front were so helpful to. The parking is shit so definitely DO NOT park across the street we seen a girl get towed because sometimes they don&apos;t allow it. We parked right in front per the waiter the safest place to park. 
We sat down and our waiter seemed like he just wanted us to rush ... weird. It got weirder. We literally had about 3-4 waiters/waitresses; didn&apos;t seem like they communicated that well with each other it was kind of all over the place. They rarely checked on us we had to flag them down. We ordered the kimchi fried chicken ramen and Sumo Ramen my boyfriend loved his until he tried mine and was like I&apos;m deff ordering that next time! We also had a house salad ... not that great loved how fresh the greens were the ginger dressing just seemed a bit off. We also had the sticky Thai chicken wings which were super delicious if you order them make sure you use your towelette after your hands get super sticky! Overall I loved the food didn&apos;t care for the customer service still tipped super well because hands down the ramen was SOOO good. The music is also super annoying we went about 1Pm on a Tuesday and the music was blasting as if I was in a house party. I&apos;m 28 not a old lady LOL not  exaggerating just was pretty annoying that me and my boyfriend were struggling the entire time for a conversation because we couldn&apos;t hear each other. 
Deff a must try! Get the kimchi fried chicken ramen you won&apos;t be disappointed!!"

We do live in &quot;the new normal&quot; life - thank you for our waiter making a superb experience ! 
Loved Food !"
4,"I wasn&apos;t sure what I was expecting from this place. I&apos;ve had Lettuce Entertain You Ramen before from Tokio Pub so I was expecting roughly the same. I was thankfully incorrect as this food rocks (yes, I still love you Tokio Pub). 

We had a reservation and were promptly seated. My mom got a Yuzu Margarita. My dad got the Aschi beer and I had an Old Fashioned. All of our drinks were awesome, but special shout-out to my dads beer. I tried it and I was the real star. 

For appetizers, we got a little bit of everything. We were not sure on the fried chicken bun, but that was a huge surprise. It was crispy and had a nice spice. We also got the pork dumplings and chicken dumplings. The chicken dumplings were good, but the pork dumplings were really great! We finished the appetizers with the spicy Szechuan wings. It was a spice that was dry and snuck up on you. Still delicious! 

For our main course, we had the special crispy bacon ramen. It&apos;s around until the end of the month, but RUN to eat it. It was outstanding. It was so tasty! It was also huge! I got it with the Chili inside which gave a nice heat to it. The ramen already had a bit of a peppery kick so the chili might not have been needed. 

We finished up with a dessert of doughnuts with a Carmel vanilla dipping sauce. Heavenly! 

The only downside of the dinner was the environment. This is NOT a place for kids or families. I know that there are a lot of places like that, but not in LEYE. The seating was a bit restrictive and the music they play has quite a bit of swearing. I was there with my parents and felt a little weird, but It would be my scene with my friends! Our server was also fantastic so that&apos;s a big plus. 

In closing! I was floored by the quality of food at this place. I&apos;ll for sure be back, but with friends, not family :)"
5,"I&apos;m a pretty hard critique of Japanese ramen and to be honest, the ramen wasn&apos;t the best I&apos;ve had but I thoroughly enjoyed my overall experience here. The outdoor seating has a partially covered hut and heated lamps overhead the raised tables. Your legs will get chilly so I suggest bringing a blanket or scarf to wrap around your legs to stay warm if dining outside in the winter. Our waiter and staff were very efficient and polite - they visited often but not an annoying amount.  

I ordered the tonkatsu ramen and my boyfriend ordered the katsu tonkatsu (limited edition). Despite the weather being cold outside, our ramen came out very hot and stayed relatively hot until we finished our bowls. I believe the chasu in the tonkatsu was smoked - which was new to me.

I wish there was something light like mung bean sprouts to balance the heaviness and add some texture. The fried garlic was a GREAT addition  though - compliments to the chef on that one. 

The katsu tonkatsu had katsu sauce (like a sweet Japanese worchestire) and mustard wasabi. It significantly impacts the taste of the broth. It wasn&apos;t my cup of tea but my boyfriend enjoyed it.

Your legs will get chilly so I suggest bringing a blanket or scarf to wrap around your legs to stay warm if dining outside in the winter. Our waiter and staff were very efficient and polite - they visited often but not an annoying amount.  

I ordered the tonkatsu ramen and my boyfriend ordered the katsu tonkatsu (limited edition). Despite the weather being cold outside, our ramen came out very hot and stayed relatively hot until we finished our bowls. I believe the chasu in the tonkatsu was smoked - which was new to me. It surprisingly worked! It didn&apos;t look like a large quantity of meat but it was VERY dense. It filled me up pretty quickly. My ramen had too many bamboo shoots and wakame. I wish there was something light like mung bean sprouts to balance the heaviness and add some texture. The fried garlic was a GREAT addition  though - compliments to the chef on that one. 

The katsu tonkatsu had katsu sauce (like a sweet Japanese worchestire) and mustard wasabi. It significantly impacts the taste of the broth. It wasn&apos;t my cup of tea but my boyfriend enjoyed it. 

Giving this a 5 star because we were treated very well and had an overall good experience. Plus the many cute river north puppies walking by and saying hello put us in an especially good mood. 

Ramen-San is part of lettuce entertain you so make sure you have the app and collect points for dining in!"
4,"Walked in on the whim for lunch on a early Sunday afternoon. Was able to get a table right away. My bf and I both ordered the express lunch for $15.95, which included a ramen, a fried rice, a small salad and pickled cucumbers. Each item was a nicely sized portion and the food hit the spot. I&apos;d definitely recommend the express lunch route if it&apos;s available.

Service overall was attentive and friendly, but one person felt slightly pushy and should maybe reconsider his wording when asking us if we&apos;d like to try some Japanese whiskey instead of the &quot;well whiskey&quot; we originally ordered. The recommendation the first time around was fine, but his second attempt sounded pretty snarky and condescending. I&apos;m going to assume that wasn&apos;t his intention, but it def didn&apos;t encourage us to order more drinks."
3,"@BJH.  Thank you for the follow up.  When I&apos;m in Chicago next I will check in with you to see if the comments I made here have been resolved and will update this review. Thank you for taking the time to address my comments.  

A nice filling meal.  Chicago is not up there yet when it comes to Japanese restos. Los Angeles reigns supreme on Japanese food options on the mainland.  Still I&apos;m glad that Ramen-San exists albeit owned by Lettuce and not a Japan entity. 

First I had the vegan broth ramen.  It was good, the broth tepid, the tofu still cold in the middle.  

On a second visit I had the express lunch option with salmon over rice and small kimchee ramen with a &quot;molten&quot; egg. The broth was good, the &quot;molten&quot; egg was perfect but I only got a half an egg.  The salmon was bathed in sugary sweet sauce that was off putting.  It didn&apos;t go well with the kimchee ramen as next to it, I felt I was eating dessert over steamed rice. 

Loved the service, the outdoor eating options and the coo coo Captain America mugs."
4,"Chicago literally has the best food! The last time I came to Chicago I went to their sister restaurant sushi San which has amazing food. I love a great Ramen!
Due to Covid and the new mandate we had to sit outside, but luckily they had heating lamps and it was a very sunny day.

The Ramen had thick pork pieces that were so tender and juicy. The broth was so delicious, I wish I could eat about 3 bowls of it... lol. 

Ramen san definitely did not disappoint and I will definitely be coming back the next time I visit Chicago"
1,"Server was more concerned about us wearing masks than getting the order right. They completely messed up our order. Also, the seats are extremely uncomfortable wooden benches meant for little kids. Never going here again."
2,"Hate to do this. Excellent packaging, good enough service, no heating outside, and mediocre ramen. 

Try another spot or make instant."
5,"Chicago was cold sooo cold so my boyfriend and I were eager to get something warm in our tummies. Due to covid the wait was longer than expected even tho we had reservations, but the service and amazing food triumphed that small negative for me. The ramen....bruh the ramen was so freaking delicious. It&apos;s def a top two on my ramen list. The Penicillin # 2 wasn&apos;t too strong in my opinion, but still tasty. Because we had to wait longer than expected they offered us some complimentary hot donuts. I thought the gesture was very kind. Lowkey want to take a trip back up there to get back in on this goodness."
2,"I try to order from local spots 1-2x/week during the pandemic to support local businesses. It&apos;s a cold evening so ramen sounded good and I haven&apos;t ordered from Ramen-San yet. 

I ordered via Uber Eats for delivery because it was a little too far for pick up. It estimated 65-85 minutes which was okay and I can understand given it&apos;s a weekend evening. 

But it took over 2 hours to get my food. I watched the tracker and it was clear that the delay was due to the restaurant, not Uber. When I got it, it was ice cold. The fried chicken was soft and appeared to have been sitting for a long time - way longer than the 20 minutes from pick up to my door. Also, there were no utensils! What kind of ramen place doesn&apos;t give chop sticks with an order?!

The food was okay tasting - no better than other places I&apos;ve tried in the city. At the beginning of the pandemic I gave restaurants a lot of grace because of the pivots that most needed to make. But we are a year into this and an efficient delivery process should be in place so food isn&apos;t ice cold and basic utensils are given. With all the great food places in Chicago, probably won&apos;t come back."
4,My husband insisted on trying this spot after a recommendation from friends.  They did not steer us wrong. We tried a fried chicken bowl &amp; a miso bowl with an egg.  Extra noodles are a must my friends!  The broth....wow. Such depth that elevated the toppings. Will definitely try again in the future.
4,Pretty good place. Service was spot on. Server was kind and friendly. Food was tasty and serving size was appropriate. Nothing really beats a steaming hot bowl of ramen on a freezing night. Also got the miso Brussels sprouts but found them a touch too salty but still good. Will come back to try more.
5,"We sample a little everything...drinks, wings, Brussels sprouts, ramen and salad. All delicious!"
4,"Took Ramen-San to go on a rainy night for some comfort food. Super easy to pick up and the ramen toppings were packaged separately from the broth so sogginess was not an issue. 

I ordered the Tonkatsu ramen, the Kimchi Fried Chicken ramen, and the sticky Thai chicken wings. The Tonkatsu was overall really delicious and the broth was on point. I&apos;d definitely order this a second time! The Kimchi Fried Chicken ramen broth was nice and spicy, the chicken pieces were large, but the noodles were a little crusty. I would describe the ramen dishes as mainstream, but they still keep most of the traditional elements of an authentic ramen bowl."
4,"I came here with a party of 4 during the COVID pandemic and appreciated how well organized and accommodating the staff was during these interesting times! This is one of the limited indoor/outdoor dining places outside of Chicago and our party really appreciated the time and effort this restaurant put in! 
The hot broth, hot sake, on a cold winter night in Chicago, how can you go wrong? 
To start we order the karaage chicken with ailoi and it&apos;s perfect to start without getting yourself too full. We ended up ordering ordering 2 orders because of the sides, but this was because we were blinded on the sizes of the ramen! Which is a great segway to: 
The Ramen:
You can&apos;t go wrong with the toncatshu ramen, comes with a soft-boil egg and pork belly! The rest of the group ordered the spicy ramen and apparently it was just as spicy as our waiter warned us. So if you&apos;re not into spice, please double check with your waiter! 
The broth was perfect and creamy, not too overwhelming to the point where you can&apos;t drink it by itself. The egg noodles was fresh and plentiful! If you want you can order a refill, but I barely finished my first serving. 
The pork belly was fresh and nicely fried and made a great compliant with the soft-boiled egg. 
All in all I can say, the next time I&apos;m in Chicago, I will be sure to make a ramen stop here, especially with the weather and location of the restaurant! 
Great job Ramen-San"
3,"Karraage chicken (chicken nuggets) - my Fiancé enjoyed these. They were lightly battered and lightly seasoned as well.

Raw tuna- this was delicious! The tuna and avocado were fresh &amp; completed each other. The chip it was a little too salty for me but it was still enjoyable! 

Buns 
Fried chicken buns- was not a fan of the horseradish in it. I felt like it over powered the flavor of the chicken and had too much in mine. 

Chicken wings 
Spicy Szechuan- this was dry rub and had a great sauce to go with it. I would have liked a little more flavor in these wings otherwise I probably would not get this again. 

Sticky Thai- these were wet and flavorful definitely enjoyed these more than the Szechuan 

Dumpling
Crispy Berkshire- these were crispy and had a decent amount of meat in the dumpling. 

Ramen 
Kimchi &amp; fried chicken- first time trying fried chicken ramen and was not a fan. I will definitely be sticking to my regular pork. The noddles were also harder than usual, it might have needed to be cooked for longer 

Drinks 
Yuzu margarita- this was refreshing and decent

yuzu Saki- very sweet with a strong taste of lemon and grapefruit"
