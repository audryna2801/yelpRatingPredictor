5,"Mike &amp; Patty&apos;s has the best breakfast sandwiches in Boston! There are so many options but one of my favorites is the Breakfast Grilled Crack with bacon, cheese, and a fried egg on Iggy&apos;s Sourdough. The Fancy is also just as good, the only difference is that it has avocado and onion!!

They&apos;ve recently added a new option called the Sugar Daddy Burger which features double burger patties on a Kane&apos;s Donuts glazed donut. It is the best sweet and savory &quot;guilty pleasure&quot; type combo. It&apos;s only available on weekends so give it a try.

The store itself is very small, so make sure to order ahead for pick up."
5,"Mike &amp; Patty&apos;s! What can I say? This place is not about the aesthetic or the ambiance. It&apos;s about the super dank breakfast sandys full of cheesy buttery goodness! I honestly crave this place on the daily! 

I get The Crack and honestly haven&apos;t tried anything else because I think it would be a crime to ever miss out on something as yummy as The Crack is! 

There isn&apos;t much of an indoors so your best bet is to grab your sandys to-go and take them to the park nearby or back home!"
5,"Stopped by Mike and Patty&apos;s for a quick breakfast it was incredible. Parking is not idea considering it&apos;s in back bay but we were able to find a place after circling a few times. The shop itself is tiny and right now they&apos;re only allowing a few people in at a time to maintain social distancing guidelines. Food came out quick and they also have an online ordering option available.

Breakfast Grilled Crack $9
Four cheeses, an egg, and lots of bacon on a Iggy&apos;s sourdough. All the flavors come together to form the perfect breakfast sandwich for a cheese lover like me. It was truly the perfect breakfast sandwich in my opinion.

Fancy $9 
This sandwich was a little lighter than the grilled crack because of the veggies on it but, still very filling and stacked high with ingredients! The eggs were nice and runny and the mayo brought everything together. Just great. 

Overall I can tell why Mike and Patty&apos;s is one of the best breakfast joints in Boston. Ingredients are fresh and prices are pretty good for the city. I can&apos;t wait to come back when I&apos;m craving a good ol breakfast sandwich."
4,"Definition of a little corner spot. Delicious breakfast sandwiches - worth trying! You usually have to wait outside for your food and there&apos;s only space for one group to sit inside. Be aware that the grill and cook space is pretty much open to the entire shop- you&apos;re right in the thick of it, but I&apos;m into it! 

I did have delivery once in 2020 and it arrived pretty fast but the delivery fee was so high and the sandwiches did not meet expectations. Highly recommend IRL!"
5,"This little gem for an amazing breakfast sandwich is off the beaten path for sure.  In between the Back Bay and Chinatown, I would recommend an Uber or Lyft there.

Anywho, talk about a Fantastic, FANTASTIC!! breakfast sandwich called &quot;Fancy.&quot;  I was discouraged to go here because all the pictures all looked the same including mine, but let me tell you, there is a reason that everyone shares the same picture, is because this sandwich is SO, SO, good.  I&apos;m not sure if they use magic dust in it or what, but take my word for it and make your way over to this TINY corner place to grab yourself a heck of a breakfast sandwich!"
4,"A lot of options for breakfast sandwiches which was great because the hotel didn&apos;t offer breakfast.  Quick and easy to order off Yelp via Grub Hub.  

Maybe I&apos;m picky about my breakfast sandwiches because it&apos;s usually what I order when I head to diners/greasy spoons - plus, I cook at home - but our sandwiches were greasy.  It&apos;ll hit the spot if you are hungover like I was (ha!) but might be too much if you&apos;re prone to heartburn which my husband was.  

Got the grilled crack and the breakfast burger.  Definitely add something fresh and acidity (tomatoes, pickles, etc.) to cut the grease and all the meats/cheeses.  

High scores for convenience (online order for pick-up) and location.  Though, the sandwiches might not be everyone&apos;s cup of tea."
4,"I had heard great things about this spot. Amazingly, good breakfast sandwiches are hard to find ... even in cities. We were staying at The Fairmont Copley Plaza where the restaurant charged between $23-$28 for a simple breakfast item, like oatmeat, so we decided to venture out.

We called first to see about placing an order or if they were even open on a holiday. Nobody picked up the phone and there was no recorded message. Either they were incredibly busy, or closed. Neither being ideal as it was a 20 minute walk from The Fairmont. We went on their website and discovered an online order form. All I was craving was a breakfast burrito but sadly it showed up as &apos;out of stock&apos;. It was a few sandwiches to choose from ... maybe because it was 10:30 a.m. on a Sunday.

I got &quot;the baller&quot; which comes on a homemade English muffin and the lady got &quot;the fancy&quot;. Both were $9. When we got the bag, we remarked how small it looked for $20. We realize its a city ... but $20 for essentially 2 egg McMuffin-sized sandwiches with no sides was a bit disconcerting. When I unwrapped my hockey puck sized sandwich and it looked like a giant caterpillar stepped on between two English muffins ... I thought we made an epic mistake.

I am pleased to say that it was, in fact, one of the best tasting breakfast sandwiches I&apos;ve ever had. Salty, cheesy, gooey ... everything a breakfast sandwich shoukd be. I&apos;m not a huge eater portion-wise but I felt that I could have easily eaten 2 of these. One was just not incredibly filling ... although, as mentioned, the taste was fantastic. I don&apos;t know if it was the &apos;acorn-fed bacon&apos; or the &apos;heirloom antique cheddar&apos; or the &apos;local free range farm eggs&apos; ... the dense salty homemade English muffin also probably had something to do with it. If it was 2 for $12 or something ... I&apos;d have doubled up. But I couldn&apos;t bring myself to take down 2 of these on my own for $20 with tax. A McDonalds-sized hashbrown pattie would certainly have been a perfect accompaniment and made things a little more filling.

&quot;The fancy&quot; was a bit bigger having 2 eggs vs. 1 and mayo and guacamole. The girl also liked the taste of everything but said the multigrain bread was too thick/big which took a bit away from the rest of the ingredients. She didn&apos;t love the taste of her sandwich the way I did but admitted to being a bit more full than I was after eating it. I don&apos;t know how they are regarding substitutions but next time, she mentioned an English muffin would have tickled her taste buds more than the bread.

If you get a sandwich here ... the melty cheese will be the star of the show. It&apos;s kind of the signature piece di resistance. Everything was cooked well and nothing was burned or raw ... if you like your yolk runny on your sandwich, you aren&apos;t going to find it here. The eggs are more well done and spongy with a firm yellow center ... at least ours were.

Summary ... quality ingredients, solid taste, a bit on the small-side. If you are a big eater, double up. The line was long and a bit confusing of a mele in the shop and on the sidewalk. It was almost actually more confusing to pick up an online order as you have to fight through a crowd who don&apos;t like feeling like you are cutting the line. Add pandemic into the equation. They do Grubhub though ... which might be our next move should we order again. If you are looking for quality and taste and are willing to pay a bit more for it, you will enjoy it here. The line outside the door echoes the popularity of this spot."
5,"The Breakfast Grilled Crack Sandwich is a Wicked Revolutionary!

My hotel closed their entire breakfast section? What&apos;s a nice southern gent to do? (Southern being south Brooklyn) Go to Mike &amp; Patty&apos;s for breakfast!

I walked over, just a few blocks away to grab a B.E.C sandwich (A Bacon-Egg-Cheese) and head back to my hotel before hitting the road. Mike &amp; Patty&apos;s isn&apos;t a large establishment, its a corner store in the middle of a residential neighborhood. There are at most, three stools to sit and enjoy your Mike &amp; Patty&apos;s creation.

I&apos;m reading the menu and The Breakfast Grilled Crack Sandwich is speaking to me. Let&apos;s start with the outlandish, there are 4 cheeses on this breakfast sandwich! American, cheddar, swiss and gruyere gets the party started. Then add some quality bacon, fried egg and all of this goodness is adorned by toasted buttered bread from Iggy&apos;s bakery. 

The sandwich is insane. The guys at Mike &amp; Patty&apos;s made a homerun out of Fenway with this breakfast combination. Great job guys!

If your close to the area, consider a breakfast or lunch sandwich from Mike &amp; Patty&apos;s. It&apos;s the best Boston has to offer."
5,"Found Mike and Patty&apos;s on Yelp. Quick Google search showed it was a 7min walk from my hotel. So glad I made this decision! The sandwich (the Fancy) was delicious and served quickly. I walked over to the park sat down and enjoyed (it&apos;s just a walk up spot, no dine in). 

Will definitely recommend and return next time I&apos;m in Boston. Would like to try another sandwich as it was hard to make a decision."
4,"Amazing! Very quaint sandwich shop tucked away in a cute neighborhood. 
I ordered the fancy sandwich and it was amazing! The red onion gave a nice little crunch and extra flavor. My boyfriend ordered the breakfast crack sandwich, which I preferred over the fancy, due to the gruyere cheese that they used which made it so tasty. 

The food was definitely 5 stars but giving this 4 as there was a bit of a wait and it was a bit chaotic between the take out orders and in person crowd waiting for their orders to come out. Definitely would come back but would budget some extra time to get our order."
5,"Best breakfast sandwich in Boston! Highly recommend coming here, make sure you don&apos;t go 10 or 15 mins before close or you may end up not getting anything! Every bite melts in your mouth, definitely worth coming! Get the Fancy!!"
5,"I still think THE FANCY is the BEST breakfast sandwich. I ordered it again today and it was just as delicious as the first time I tried it (around 3.5 years ago!!)

I mean how can you not like a sandwich like this? Full of avocado and bacon, dressed in their INCREDIBLE house mayo, complimented by the cheddar cheese and red onions. Seriously I think about this sandwich a lot LOL. 

Due to COVID, they are letting you order online- where they let you choose the type of eggs you want. I don&apos;t remember having this option a while back but maybe that&apos;s just my memory. My point is that I like the options- the more the better and it&apos;ll fit your tastebuds!!"
4,Mike and Patty&apos;s offers the best breakfast sandwiches in town. It&apos;s a tiny corner shop located in Bay Village. I always bring visitors to this place and they are always satisfied. My go to is the crack or the fancy. You cannot go wrong with either of the sandwiches. I&apos;d also recommend calling in your order ahead of time. The line can get pretty long just to get in the door. This is a takeout spot that won&apos;t let you down!
3,"This place usually serves great breakfast sandwiches,  but today I was sorely disappointed.  
The eggs were overcooked (hard yokes) and the  bread was not just toasted,  but burned on one side, ( they put the burned side facing in so you couldn&apos;t see it) . 
This is my &quot;Go to&quot; place for a great B-Fast sandwich,   but they need to slow it down and do it right!"
5,This place lol the whole place must be a solid 100 square feet if that and they manage to crank out some seriously fantastic food! They&apos;re a little tough to find located in the middle of a residential neighborhood but busy as can be nonetheless. I had the breakfast torta with chorizo and it was soooo good. I also grabbed a cold brew which was a little too strong but tasty with some milk and sugar. Awesome place and worth the visit! I hope to try them again sometime for lunch!
5,"this place has hands down the best, most filling and decadent breakfast sandwiches i&apos;ve had in a while. you can literally smell the bacon from outside the shop! everything is pretty customizable even when you order only so this is amazingly convenient for picky eaters. it&apos;s super small; so it doesn&apos;t fit many people, but it&apos;s worth the line outside (they also offer pickup and it&apos;s usually ready in 15 min). came here while i was visiting boston for the weekend and will definitely come again!"
5,"Yea. 

Worth the stop 100% 

If you like bacon egg and cheeses-crack 
If you like avocado and onions -fancy. 

Orange juice has pulp. 
Coffee is pretty good. 

Highlight of my stay in Boston honestly. 

Also there&apos;s no parking, and the shop is super tiny, like 3 people can barely fit in there so you kinda order and wait outside. 

I got one crack and one fancy for my mom and I and we basically switched a half to try both. 

Delicious."
4,"I went to Mike &amp; Patty&apos;s the last weekend before I started social distancing, so my experience remains a fond memory both because of their delicious Fancy sandwich and because it was the last time I went on a food adventure :(

The Fancy sandwich I ate is Mike &amp; Patty&apos;s signature sandwich and contains two yolk porn eggs, bacon, cheddar cheese, avocado, red onions, and house mayo (it&apos;s chipotle flavored I think) on a multigrain bread.

Honestly just looking at the ingredients, you can probably tell that this is a kickass sandwich and it was. The egg was nice and yolky. The bacon wasn&apos;t too greasy. The cheese, the avocado, and the mayo all complemented each other well. I actually also particularly liked the multigrain roll. It made me feel a little less guilty about eating the savory contents of the sandwich haha. 

The only thing I felt the Fancy sandwich was lacking was something creative or new to really blow me away. Maybe a different type of mayo or cheese could have helped. 

All in all, it was a fantastic sandwich though. I can certainly see why Mike &amp; Patty&apos;s has the rep of offering Boston&apos;s best breakfast sandwiches."
5,"At first glance, Mike &amp; Patty&apos;s looks pretty underwhelming. In fact, they don&apos;t even have a dining area, save for a small bar like counter. However, don&apos;t let the looks of this place fool you; the food is phenomenal. 

I had the Carolina Caviar, which was a breakfast sandwich with egg, sausage, and pimento cheese. Initially, I expected it to not be that much different from a sausage, egg, and cheese from McDonald&apos;s. Nevertheless, I was pleasantly surprised. They lathered the English muffin with pimento cheese, giving the sandwich a burst of flavor that greatly enhanced this breakfast classic."
5,Delicious great exceptional breakfast. Thank you! Fast service!  Will not disappoint.
