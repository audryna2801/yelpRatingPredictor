5,"We were up here in July 2020, at the height of COVID, I guess?  The city had just opened up indoor dining again.  I don&apos;t know what this tiny street looked like pre-COVID but when we were there, half of the street was blocked off to allow for outdoor seating.  If it wasn&apos;t like that before, they should consider keeping it with outdoor seating in the streets.  Such a lovely, fun atmosphere of food lovers.  Up and down the street and around the corner are tons of restaurants of different kinds.  The one with the longest wait is probably Neptune and with good reason.  The food is incredible!

There were 3 of us and we each had the lobster roll.  We went there with one thing in mind, and it was lobster rolls.  There&apos;s two options, hot with butter or cold with mayo.  I went with the cold one since it was July and hot out and man o man!  It was amazing.  Worth the wait.  The sandwich was overflowing with chunks of lobster with just a hint of creaminess from the mayo.

We also had oysters and clams from the raw bar and they too were delicious.  I am a huge fan of raw clams.  I think I like them more than I like raw oysters.  Their saltiness and firm texture is the perfect bite of seafood in my opinion."
5,"Limited outdoor dining during COVID. Waited about 40 mins even on a weekday afternoon. 

Oysters - Kumamoto and Kusshi were really small oysters but my favorite!
Razor clams - this could have done without the bacon. It completely overpowered the clam flavor. 
Johnnycake - savory sweet pancake that my friend highly recommended. Unique dish! 
Lobster roll - this could have used a bit more salt and butter to bring out the flavor of the lobster more, but I still loved it. Lobster taste is at the forefront of this experience albeit a bit light 
Ciopinno - classic seafood dish that was done well. Soup had lots of seafood flavor and the fresh seafood was delicious 

Service was quick and attentive."
5,"Neptune was one of the places that gets highly recommended by everyone.., and usually I&apos;m quite skeptical of overhyped up places. Boy was I in for a rude (and very pleasant) surprise! Came here for a Tuesday lunch at 11:30am right when it opened. No line, was immediately seated at a two top outdoors. 

When in Neptune, you go big or you go home. And I went big with 4 oysters (beauseoli and Kisshi - Sorry! butchered their names), a red snapper crudo ($17), and the nantucket bluefin tuna entree ($37). Totaly bill incl. tax and tip was ~$88. Not the cheapest, but for what you&apos;re getting... its SO worth it. 

AMBIANCE:
Love the new england seafood vibe here. There were a few outdoor tables so I opted for that given the circumstances we live with Covid. But the indoors looked really quaint and there was a massive oyster bar in front. Can&apos;t complain much about here.

PROS:
Oh boy where to start? Everything was SUBLIME.

Oysters - fresh, briny, tasty, saucey, zesty. Got the Beausolil and Kisshi (2 each). Perfect balance of brine, sweetness, and plumpness. Try it. It&apos;s that good. 

Red snapper crudo - You have maybe about 6 thick slices of red snapper sandwiched between slices of apples, topped with an oily vinaigrette. Very interesting flavors indeed! Fish was tasty and delightful. Acidity cuts down towards the olive oil. Overall very pleasant. 

Nantucket bluefin - Oh my that seared tuna was some of the best I&apos;ve ever had! You can taste the fish&apos;s freshness, tastiness, and the slight dash of red peppers really gives it a kick. Love that it comes with a massive plate of lightly dressed tomato salad, sardines (?), and green bean looking vegetable (I think they&apos;re called haricot vert). I was pleasantly surprised how it pairs well with the fish. Acidity of the salad balances well with the sear on the fish. Overall I thought the tuna was going to be very oily and dense, but it turned out to be not too bad! Definitely highly recommend. 

OVERALL:
The hype is real. That&apos;s all I am going to write about this place. I will be back hungry for more!"
4,"Covid review :

I came here in August and did a to go order since there was a 2 hour line.

Alright ill get right down to business. 

The oysters? Are amazing. They&apos;re a little on the small side, but they are cleaned to perfection and tasted so good.  I had various flavors locally. They are a must get. 

Lobster roll totally changed my views on lobster rolls. Its expensive, but worth every penny...ALMOST. why the 4 star review and almost worth every penny ? I&apos;ll tell ya why.  They butter their lobster meat and roll so much that the bread/roll actually turns to moosh. They roll basically melts. This was very messy to eat as there is an abundance of fresh, hot lobster meat on top. If they can just melt a little less butter, id have to say this might be the best lobster roll I&apos;ve ever had.  The roll is overdosed with fresh lobster meat and thats it. No fillers and no extras. The lobster is the true star of the show. 

2 hour wait? Order with the staff and grab a drink down the block at the Bodega like we did and come back."
5,"We read so much about Neptune Oyster, with a long wait for a table.  That&apos;s why we waited to try this place on a Monday for lunch.  Since the area was getting rain today, we walked in and got seated straight away.  This place is tiny like most restaurants in the area so I highly suggest getting to this place early.

We had two great servers that were friendly, inviting and made you feel at home here at Neptune Oyster.  They were full of information about every dish they served and every dish we asked about.  They service alone is a 5 Star, the ambiance just screams quaint little seafood restaurant.

There were SO many great choices to make off of their menu, including the oysters, but we decided to try one of the &quot;Today&apos;s Special,&quot; and the WellFleet Clam Chowder.  We started off splitting the Wellfleet Clam Chowder and let me tell you, it had to be the best clam chowder I have ever had.  The potatoes were cooked perfectly, they were al dente and the clam ratio was spot on, along with great flavor.  Then we split the Lobster Spaghettitini and all I can say is that it was AMAZING!!  It had such great flavor with tons of lobster meat, tomatoes and it was a very light dish.  It did not sit heavy in the belly.  I highly recommend these two dishes alone if you ever visit Neptune Oyster.

This is a must return restaurant if ever back in Boston.  You can&apos;t go wrong with GREAT service and GREAT seafood!"
5,Neptune Oyster is one of my favorite places to visit in Boston. Great food with great service. It is a not a large restaurant by any means so the staff are always around to make sure you are well taken care of. We were there on Tuesday night I guess for a work outing. Haley and crew took great care of us. The food and drinks were delicious. Hospitality even better.
5,Amazing restaurant in the heart of boston. Everything from the service to the food was great. To start had oysters and sea urchin. The oysters taste fresh and some of the best Ive had. I recommend the eastcoast. I forget the specific one but i believe its at the top of the list on the paper menu choices. Sea urchin was pretty good as well my first time trying it. Then for the main course had seafood cioppino topped with lobster. This was absolutely amazing. Everything taste fresh and had the perfect balance of seasoning. Highly recommend
5,"This venue is one hundred percent worth the 70 minute table wait outside in arctic Boston weather! After reading online reviews I decided this would be my first seafood venue while staying in Boston. Sometimes you just have to set the bar high. Of course we started with an assortment of smaller, saltier oysters. The Kusshi from British Columbia was meaty, bright, and  finished with a cucumber taste I have never experienced, so we ordered additional Kusshi. Next was a Blue Fish tartare topped with caviar, served with toast points garnished in EVOO. The scallop appetizer was four large perfectly cooked scallops served atop swish chard and duck confit. What a flavor explosion with different textures from top to bottom. Mary was a lovely server and she did not rush us through the final sips of beer while we digested the amazing lunch."
5,"Absolutely loved Neptune Oyster, there is definitely a reason this is the most sought after place to visit when in Boston. The staff couldn&apos;t have been friendlier and they had the most amazing oysters and octopus dish. Would return over and over again. It&apos;s a must visit, our oysters were &quot;starred&quot; by our waitress that recommended them and were so glad she did, they were perfect!"
5,"This was our first meal in Boston because it was highly recommended by friends and wow what a great recommendation.  We were lucky to get there and found an available table without waiting time.  First, the service was spectacular and the food was the best.  We had of course the lobster roll, oysters and a delicious smoked fish dip topped with caviar.  It was all delicious, unfortunately we didn&apos;t have time to go back for a second time during our weekend getaway but definitely will be back."
5,"This place is packed all the time and the wait can be up to 2 hours. But I came in a rainy weekday during lunch time and it was fairly quiet. 

They have some tables set up outside on the street now and it&apos;s actually really cute. I enjoyed a delicious lunch!! A must try is the Neptune Johnnycake- just order it and you&apos;ll thank me later ;) everything on their menu is fresh and delicious. 

They had such fresh oysters as well. Always enjoy the vibe here because the servers are friendly and I know the food here won&apos;t disappoint!!"
5,"Glad I arrived 5 min before 11am (their opening time)!  There were maybe 10 people before me, but I was able to get a table when they opened.  While eating, I overheard the wait was about 2 hours...! :o

Got a couple of oysters and noticed my neighbor was eating Jonah crab which looked good, so added that.  I was wondering if I should get clam chowder which was endorsed by the same neighbor, so added that as well.  ;)

Everything tasted great and the service was also excellent!

Due to the current capacity limit guidelines, they have only 3 tables inside.  So if you want to sit inside, be early or ready to wait for a long time..."
5,"Stopped by on a Friday night and was able to put my name down on the waitlist for a table outside. We waited about an hour until we received a call that our table was ready. Everything we ate here was delicious. We started off with the mussels and the broth was amazing and so flavorful! I was tempted to slurp up all of the remaining broth after the bread and mussels were all gone. 

We also tried the spanish octopus and it was very tasty as well. It was perfectly grilled and I loved the almond spread that came along with it. 

My favorite dish of the night was the black ink risotto, which they only offer on Friday&apos;s. This is probably the best squid ink risotto I have ever eaten. The sauce was so flavorful and there were pieces of squid and lobster inside. I was surprised by how many pieces of lobster was actually buried inside the dish. There was no price for this dish on the menu. When I got the receipt I found out it was $37, which I thought was a good price considering how much lobster was inside.

Highly recommend coming here if you are ever in Boston!"
5,"Awesome 
I love that place.
I go there all the time"
4,"Neptune might have been the first place I bookmarked when I joined Yelp forever ago...  Im all about Lobster Rolls but have this random weird allergy to Mayo (the maltodextrin in it actually, but that&apos;s for another day) but I heard this place makes a Hot, buttered one that is to DIE FOR! 

So I have heard over the years about the logistics for this place, 5 tables, but the line starts at 4 and is usually long to get in and no reservations, so one night with the work crew we decided to check it out (easier to expense it also, why turn down a free meal - its like Monopoly money) but we had someone go get in line early and we all Uber&apos;d only waited a few mins, sat right down (unfortunately near the door - it was winter and COLD everytime the door opened) but yeah, once sat - we went in... 

Got a few rolls to split, a bunch of towers,  Lots of food, Everything was great &amp; fresh, portions are ok, Service was great.  If you are coming to dine, be prepared for the line and then realize when you are seated everyone in the line will WATCH you eat. It was small, it was awkward, we felt slightly rushed but that might be because we were there over an hour (again, eating everything on the menu) but yeah I didnt love the &quot;Will you get out Side eye we got from people&quot; but otherwise would definitely go back, in fact - now I want a Lobster Roll... Drooling!"
2,"Not sure what the rave about this place is. the lobster roll wasn&apos;t all that and way overpriced. The oysters were ok but nothing amazing to rave about.  I actually found a live snail on the shell with the mucus spread on it, so kind of grossed me out."
5,"Great place, a bit pricey but everything was good 
I&apos;ll come back next time I&apos;m in Boston"
5,"Coming from Florida we know good seafood, but have not really had much (or great) lobster. On our trip to Boston, my mom and I knew we had to try our first ever lobster rolls. 

This morning, while enjoying cannoli and lobster tails at Modern Pastry, a gentleman recommended Neptune for lobster rolls without hesitation. We showed up at 5, were sat immediately, and placed our order of the lobster caprese special and a lobster roll, cold with mayo. 

All we can say is &quot;Wow!&quot; Everything was so fresh. Portions were very generous. Yes, this is not a cheap place, but you sure do not leave hungry or feeling cheated. I see why this place has the reviews that it does."
5,"To die for!  Saturday lunch. Great staff, very friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. Oysters on the half, Neptune Pearls and Eros divine. Tried the sea urchin - yummy. Then the lobstah rolls. We had one hot and buttery, and one cold Mayo. Both delish and big portion the fries alone would be worth the stop."
5,"It took me over 4 trips to Boston to finally try Neptune&apos;s and I&apos;m so glad that I finally tried it. First, it&apos;s first come first serve and it&apos;s one of those places that are so worth the hype that there&apos;s always a wait. I recommend either coming when they first open or anticipating at least a 2-3 hour wait and incorporating that assumption into your plan. 

We got a wide range of oysters, the lobster roll, and the scallops. I never realized how much I loved Swiss chard until I tried their scallops with Swiss chard and duck confit. So amazing. 

Lastly this restaurant is very focused on safety and enforcing the rules which is definitely appreciated. Take out orders are asked to wait outside and they ask you to use hand sanitizer."
