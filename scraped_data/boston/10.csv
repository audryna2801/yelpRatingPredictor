5,"Easiest 5 star review. Has got to be my top 3 restaurants in Boston! Every dish was a 10/10. Love it and cannot wait to be back (although pricey). Walk-ins usually have a wait time of 2 hours, so put your name down and go shopping. Restaurant is super tiny. Come with a party of 4 or less! 

Recommended dishes:

5,I was glad that we were able to walk in here today without reservation (it was 11:15am Saturday). We were at first a little uneasy because of the prices on the menu but it was worth it! The table was socially distanced; the lobster roll and the saltie girl burger were simply amazing. Lobster roll looked small at first but then every bite was full of lobster claw meat. The bread filled with butter and cheese melted in my mouth. The burger was embellished with fried lobster and pork belly and was delicious. That was one fancy brunch!
5,"Ordered take out.
Lobster roll lived up to the hype. Warm butter accentuated the lobster flavor and didn&apos;t overpower it. Lobster had the perfect texture and was juicy. The toast was soft and buttered to perfection. Best I&apos;ve ever had!!

Clam chowder had fried oyster piece that was deliciously soaked in the creamy soup. Worth a try!"
5,"My fianc√© and I went here as one of our very first dinners in Boston and it did not disappoint. From the food to the cocktails to the service, everything was absolutely amazing. One of the best lobster rolls I&apos;ve ever had, definitely a MUST warm! 

Also, the clam chowder....let&apos;s just say, get. It."
4,"Great clean, safe, cool atmosphere! The food and service is exceptional!
I&apos;ve had two visits; Lobster Rolls each time , one cold, one warm/hot, both Great! Also had fried whole clams, lightly breaded, awesome if you like clams. The clam chowder is also very good!
I&apos;ll be back! Well worth it!"
3,"Wanted to try this spot for a while now. It was an hour and a half wait on a 6pm on a Saturday, which was not too long of a wait considering the restaurant&apos;s long-standing popularity. The venue was cluttered; social distancing is definitely not its forte. 
The oysters were fire, as expected; the petite seafood tower included a Jonah crab salad, with fresh cilantro mixed in, that my boyfriend and I devoured in a matter of seconds. Definitely the favorite of the night for myself. 
The seared black cod was on the special menu. The vegetables mixed in (mushrooms and bok choy) soaked up the sauce and were absolutely delicious, but the black cod itself fell short of our expectations and lacked flavor.
Cocktails were strong, if anything. I could thoroughly taste the alcohol. I also sat in front of the bar and saw my drink being made hastily and effortlessly, which is probably not what you want to see when you&apos;re paying 15-20 for a drink. But I&apos;ll give it the benefit of the doubt and say it was probably because it was a packed night. 
Overall, I think you&apos;re really just paying for a nice ambience, with nicely plated food and decent oysters. Maybe a place to go post-covid."
4,"My friend and I were looking for a last minute reservation for good seafood and I&apos;m so glad we found this place! It was very easy to book online. Note that they have moved to the building next door. We almost turned back because the door with the sign is actually closed. No worries, we called them and realized they&apos;re just next door. 

We were seated in the basement. It was pretty dim. All the staff wore masks and were very nice. The menu has a lot of delicious sounding items and it was very difficult to decide what to get. After our server&apos;s recommendation, we decided on Snow Crab Toast and Lobster Rolls. 

Snow Crab Toast: oh my, this is an elevated avocado toast. It is actually pretty tall. It has layers of avocado, cheese and crab. Drizzled with pistachio and olive oil. It was absolutely delicious. 

Lobster Roll: ok can we just appreciate the custom packaged chips? The lobster roll looks small in size, but don&apos;t be fooled, the buttery lobster is actually pretty hefty serving. The roll was so fresh and soft. Almost melt in the mouth. 

+1 for amazing service. I had plenty of water refills, and trust me that&apos;s not too common during covid. 

Taking one star off because the food is upscale and a little on the pricey side, however the basement vibes definitely did not match the upscale feels they&apos;re going for."
5,"TLDR: lovely place for a date night 

Came here for Valentine&apos;s. Everything is appropriately distanced. We ended up doing various small plates and toasts instead of getting one large entree. It was a delightful way to sample everything and get as many flavors as possible. Every dish was interesting, intricate and complex. What you&apos;d expect from a meal this expensive. Would definitely recommend it! My favorite dish was the octopus al pastor but everything was excellent."
5,"I heard so many positive reviews from friends about this place, and I was excited to try their warm lobster roll. The items I ordered were all market price, so the lobster roll that day was around $35, while the petite seafood tower was $60. The lobster roll was amazing. The bread was a buttery warm toast and the lobster meat was fresh. It is quite small in comparison to what you could get at other seafood markets, but the quality was outstanding. The petite seafood tower has (insert what it has) which were all extremely fresh but nothing out of the ordinary. I don&apos;t think I would splurge on the tower again but I would come back to order the lobster roll in a heartbeat."
4,"We wanted to grab our last lunch in Boston before we headed to the airport and Saltie Girl was on our list of restaurants to try.  We got there when they opened at 11:00 am and it was pretty quiet for a Wednesday afternoon, so we were hoping for fast service and we got it from the servers, mind you, but the cooks are the ones that took forever with my burger and totally forgot another burger at a table that was right next to ours, (I overheard the conversation).

So the wife ordered a lobster roll and I ordered the Saltie Girl cheeseburger, which was very good, very tasty.  It came with a fried piece of lobster, which I opted to put that on the side and that was also very good.  Don&apos;t get me wrong all the food was good, it was the cooks that took forever with my burger.  My wife&apos;s plate came out first, and my burger took another 10 minutes, maybe?  Who knows, but by the time it came out my wife was almost done with her lobster roll.  Oh!, I will say the clam chowder needed seasoning and the clams seemed overcooked, because they were tough."
5,"This review is from my visit in late October.  I made a reservation after reading great reviews, and glad that I did.  When checking in, I saw a lot of people being turned away as they didn&apos;t have reservations.

The server who was in charge was funny and friendly, but also really good.  I always appreciate whoever can explain their favorite dishes with details - and her description convinced me to get the main dish: Cacio Lobster E Uni (Lobster &amp; Uni/Sea Urchin Spaghetti).  

I know I am getting some uni (sea urchin), but also wanted to get fresh ones, so that&apos;s what I got for an appetizer.  ;)

The meal was great along with service.  The spaghetti portion was generous, so couldn&apos;t make it dessert, but it was worth it.  I will be back again after all the craziness is over..."
4,"You hear about the great restaurants in Boston all the time. This one is no different--clearly great. Came here during COVID. Tables were patio only and spaced out nicely. I&apos;d strongly recommend reservations. 

We got a platter of oysters, torched salmon belly, octopus el pastor, crab avocado toast, and the lobster uni pasta. We definitely enjoyed each dish however the stand out had to be the lobster uni pasta. Seriously, lobster and uni? This chef is a food god and presents a creamy pasta deliciousness for you to indulge. The crab toast was awesome, but hard to eat. You get a seriously stacked toast.. so stacked its bigger than my mouth. But it is delicious and I&apos;d probably order it again if I went back. Surprisingly, we weren&apos;t amazed by the oyster selection we had. Maybe they&apos;ll have better ones next time we visit. 

Service is outstanding."
5,"My family tried the Saltie Girl Pizza last night and were amazed by all 5 pizzas we tried (Lobster, Crab, Tomato, Clam, Ham&amp;Egg). The flavors all blended very nicely and were like nothing we had ever tasted before, even the picky eaters liked them! Such a cool environment with an excellent waitstaff. Don&apos;t knock it til you try it, we couldn&apos;t get enough!"
5,"Can&apos;t believe I haven&apos;t rated Saltie Girl before. It&apos;s amazing. Popular. Make reservations.

To start: 

We have had the steak tartare previously but this time we got the salmon belly paired with the avocado and it was delicious! Just melts in your mouth . The steak tartare was good too, just a larger portion and more filling. We did the salmon belly with a la carte oysters (6 for two people) as a nice refreshing way to start the meal. 

The cocktails are fantastic. Not too sweet, well balanced, well made. This time we had the bourbon based drink, the drink called Apple, and the drink called Orange. All were amazing. Previously we had the Cranberry which was also good, not too sweet.

Before the main course and after some oysters and salmon belly, my husband and I shared a Clam chowder which was a nice transition to our main meal:

The warm lobster roll is my go to for the main dish. We usually split the lobster roll so that we can also enjoy everything else. It is sooooo good. We haven&apos;t tried it cold yet, mainly because the warm butter version is so yummy. Especially with the Saltie Girl salt &amp; vinegar chips which are made by the restaurant.

If I had to choose one thing : lobster roll, dripping with warm butter, just do it.

Ambiance:
I will say that our last trip to Saltie Girl had that light colored up lifting feel to it. Because they took over the Met, they are in the process of changing the ambiance to be less Met and more Saltie Girl. I definitely think Met&apos;s ambiance doesn&apos;t go with the vibe of their amazing food, so we look forward to that change given how much space they have now!"
4,"If you want the full experience, I&apos;d highly recommend bringing your sugar daddy or sponsor. This place is expen$$$ive if you want to sample a bit of everything. Service was also not that great... but most of the food makes it for it.

The hot food is the way to go and it was easily my favorite dishes of the night. Highlights were the lobster cacio e pepe, lobster &amp; waffles, fried diver scallops, fried calamari, caviar dip, and clam chowder. Each of these dishes were pretty delicious in their own way.

The Royale seafood tower was alright. For raw food, Row34 and Ivory Pearl are better. The ceviche and crab claws were good but the oysters just had a bad taste to it.

Finally - the foie gras terrine was not good so definitely don&apos;t recommend that. And the torched salmon was too charred and also bland."
4,"Made reservations for a Saturday night. Absolutely do this in advance. Folks were lining up outside down the sidewalk for hours. 

It&apos;s worth it. Extensive seafood menu, most everything is market price and fresh as can be. If you told me it was caught in the bay an hour ago, I&apos;d absolutely 100% believe that. 

Outdoor seating was rough. Would have preferred indoors despite COVID as the weather turned very cold very fast. Not enough heat lamps outside to manage either. But, that&apos;s obviously not the restaurants fault! 

Dishes were all excellent. Size of the portions were to be expected if not better - although many dishes you must order a side ala carte if you so desire. Items are sent out to the table as they are ready, nothing is kept on a warming plate, so you get it truly fresh. 

Service was slow, but extremely friendly and helpful."
5,"We went to the pizza side last night and tried three types of pizza. Normally,  we don&apos;t order many toppings. This was literally the best pizza we&apos;ve ever had and will be back.  Great place.  Remember it&apos;s a separate pizza restaurant next to the regular saltie girl restaurant. Our service was great as well.  I think her name was Ella or Emma, but she was efficient and pleasant.  All around a great night out."
2,"We were excited the first time we tried Saltie Girl (pre-pandemic) and waited a long time to finally find a night when the wait was &quot;only&quot; 1.5 hours and then hung out in back bay until our table was ready. 

The atmosphere was nice but the food was just ok and prices were high and portions were small. To me the food was just ok for the most part. The clam chowder was worse in my opinion than the average pub chowder you can get in Boston (and about 5x the price). It did have some clam shells in it which was kind of cool, but it meant there was actually less soup than usual  and flavor wise I didn&apos;t find it particularly exciting. I saw this on one &quot;best chowder of Boston list&quot; but was disappointed.

We also had a beet salad that was good but just expensive for what it was, and some salmon belly and cherry stones which was also good but not something you can&apos;t get elsewhere.

The one dish we had that was pretty good was the lobster &quot;chicken and waffles&quot; which was pretty tasty. That was the only dish I would say was something you can&apos;t get elsewhere that was interesting.

We also visited during the pandemic with no wait and they set us up in a new dining location on Newbury street which had a more generic atmosphere. We ate Octopus &quot;El Pastor&quot; which was basically like plain grilled octopus with some pineapple. It would have been a nice touch if they had tortillas and maybe some fresh limes, cilantro and had used spices on the octopus or a nice salsa. We also tried the cauliflower which was good but again overpriced and small. I think I had a $12 beer as well. We ended up paying $72 and felt like we just had &quot;ok&quot; appetizers and ended up going out for ramen to fill up.

I guess the prices are fairly typical for Newbury street but we both decided it probably wasn&apos;t worth going back. There are better places in town with more creative and delicious food for less money."
4,"I&apos;ve passed this place a couple of times and have always seen it so crowded, so I was happy to be in the area today and at the perfect time to be seated. My boyfriend and I came here for lunch and arrived exactly when it opened. We were asked how many are in our party, one of our names, and a contact number. I assume this was for COVID contact tracing, but then again I am not too sure. We were seated immediately (perks to being there first) and were told to scan the QR code to get access to the menu. We ordered the clam chowder and two warm gloucester lobster rolls. The clam chowder was so flavorful and warmed me up on a cold winter day. The bacon was a good touch and to my surprise there were some fried clam pieces that were very delicious. The Gloucester Lobster Rolls were toasted to perfect and the lobster was so tender. In my opinion, it was a little bit too much butter as with every bite the bread released a pool of butter. I am not a fan of salt and vinegar chips, but it is very cool how they make their own. I took my bag back for my boyfriend to snack on later on. When we paid, we noticed an extra charge with no explanation for PPE. My boyfriend asked the waitress what the charge was for and she said it is a charge of $2 per person for sanitizing the restaurant. A little bit odd because I have never seen this, but am curious to know if this is a Boston wide thing. Overall, I totally see what the hype is about and would like to come back on my next Boston trip!"
5,"Came here for a birthday celebration date. We were welcomed at the door and brought immediately to our table. There is plenty of space between tables! We had some of their signature cocktails to start, along with the seafood tower. Neither disappointed!! We continued to order small dishes: the crab avocado bread, the calamari, and the octopus. The only thing we didn&apos;t love was the octopus (it didn&apos;t taste like fresh octopus), but the rest was delicious! We got dessert and really enjoyed it! I would definitely come back."
