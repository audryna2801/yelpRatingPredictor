5,"Megan was absolutely amazing. Worked here for 12 years and it shows, she knows how to take care of her guests. Can&apos;t wait to go back, even with this COVID stuff."
5,Went to Bricco for the first time and it was amazing. Patty R was our server and she made the night so special! The Covid precautions in place made the evening very comfortable and the food was a 10/10. Will definitely be back soon.
5,"15 out of 10 recommend!  From the moment we sat down we were greeted with warmth and hospitality from our wonderful waitress Patty.  She made incredible recommendations, was attentive, and made us more than welcome.   Aside from the hospitality, every new dish we ordered was better than the last and we were there for several hours.  This was first meal here, and it certainly won&apos;t be the last. They had hand sanitizer on the table, great spacing of tables, and we felt very safe overall. Cannot recommend enough. We will be back very soon, booking a room at the conveniently located suites above the restaurant and specifically requesting Patty as our waitress again!"
5,"My husband and I recently had dinner at Bricco. a restaurant we discovered on a previous trip and which quickly became our favorite place to dine in the city. As always, the food was amazing, and the service excellent. But what made the evening overall was the staff, in particular, our server Joel. 

Pleasant and polite, Joel was knowledgeable about the menu, answered our questions and was attentive but not &quot;helicoptering&quot; through the evening (as we had experienced the next evening in another spot). He and the others, including the manager, Paige, made us feel comfortable and welcome. The food is always wonderful, but it&apos;s the whole package, including the people and the ambience, which makes a dining experience memorable.

There is nothing better than enjoying a meal and being treated like family by someone we just met. We have already recommended it to our family and friends and just want others to know what a great place Bricco is, not only for the food but also because of the people who work so hard to make one feel special yet do it so seamlessly. Thank you Bricco and all of your wonderful staff, can&apos;t wait to see you all again."
4,"Bricco is located in the heart of the North End. It is actually a very very nice restaurant. Much larger than other north end spots. The doors have photos of celebrities dining at this restaurant. So it must be good! The tables were spaced out enough where you felt comfortable having a nice meal.

When you&apos;re seated and looking at the menu, you&apos;ll notice that this is a very upscale Italian seafood and steakhouse. There&apos;s a wide variety of starters to choose from, all roughly close to $20 dollars. We decided to go with the burrata. Very good and creamy. But the bread they provided was the hardest bread I&apos;ve ever had. Could easily break some teeth. Should&apos;ve saved the free starter bread, but we devoured that before the burrata arrived. For our entrees, we got the ricotta pillows and the briccos brodetto. The ricotta pillows were very good. But they only gave 8-10 pieces. My fiancee also thought they were a bit salty. The Brodetto was great! But I wish they served it over a bed of rice, but instead they opted for the same single slice of  burnt bread as we got with the burrata. I honestly dont think the entrees we got would be ordered again. However the service was great and the ambiance was wonderful. Great spot for a date night."
5,"We crossed referenced top five restaurants and gluten free and Bricco&apos;s was on both lists. Husband had the pappadel with wild boar. EXCELLENT. Daughter had pumpkin stuffed ravioli. WONDERFUL! Boyfriend has classic meatball &amp; spaghetti. CLASSIC! And I HAD THE GLUTEN FREE GNOCCHI!!
It&apos;s been so long and it was INCREDIBLE. we also had carparcchio for app. Not an easy dish, but they nailed it. 
I would recommend reservations if you want to eat inside."
5,"The Best in Boston...........Bricco is by far the best restaurant in Boston. It service is beyond wonderful, and the cuisine is very Italian based. I can not say enough about Bricco. The location is great for the city. Service was exceptional-it was very professional but also very personable. We enjoyed our interaction with Vuvu- who, at the end of the evening, invited our family on a tour of the Panneteria and the Pasta shopp. We love everything."
5,This place is super cute. We dined at a table but the bar seemed really nice. It&apos;s not the biggest restaurant but it&apos;s cozy and good for a date night. The waiter was really friendly. Dinner was great and dessert was yummy!
5,The food was amazing! Flavorful and authentic! The service was also impeccable. Thank you Patty for making our lunch so memorable!
5,"Thank you Yelp for helping me find this bakery just steps away from Modern Pastry. You have to go down the steps to get to the bakery. We were greeted by the most wonderful scent of bread. 

We picked up a loaf with prosciutto and cheese and it was absolutely delicious. The outside was hard and crunchy and the inside was fluffy and flavorful. It was $10 for a loaf but it was well worth it. I will be back to Bricco&apos;s for sure.

Note: I accidentally put my review for the Panetteria here but couldn&apos;t figure out how to delete this review. So this review is for the Panetteria, not the restaurant. :)"
5,"We had our dinner here and I must say it was lovely, delicious! The ambiance is amazing, we were seated in a room very private for 2 families. The food is beyond exceptional!! I was a little hesitant with pasta restaurants especially for a fine dine $$. Last I wanna do is spend money on a pasta sauce came from a can type of experience. But my my my everything that was served here was freshly made as we were told, flavor is fantastic from the appetizer to dessert I enjoyed every single flavor! Bellesima!!! We will definitely recommend and definitely gonna come back!"
5,"Fantastic atmosphere, unbelievable Italian food -- the ultimate North End experience! I was so pleased with my visit to Bricco, it rivals Carmelina&apos;s with the top spot in my heart for some of the best pasta in the city. 

The staff was super accommodating and gave great recommendations. I&apos;d been so excited to try this place, we really went all out with our order. To start off our night, we ordered a bottle of wine - definitely check out their amazing drink menu.

And now for the best part - all the delicious food! For appetizers, we ordered the insalata mista, the wellfleet mussels and the shrimp scampi. Each dish was a delight and I&apos;d order any of the three again. I&apos;m a sucker for seafood, and the mussels and shrimp really hit the spot. For my main meal, I split the Ricotta Pillows and the Braised Beef Short Ribs. Honestly, no writing on my part could do either plate justice. They were both some of the best culinary experiences I&apos;ve ever tasted. The short rib sat on a bed of creamy, cheesy polenta and melted in your mouth. And the ricotta pillows are dressed in truffle butter which makes for the perfect combination. Needless to say, there weren&apos;t any leftovers! Can&apos;t wait to return and try more of their delectable entrees!"
4,"Everything here looked so delicious... the actual title was Depasquale Ventures but they service to Mare, Bricco, Quattro, Trattoria II Panino... etc 
Anyhow, everything was amazing including the service. Only downside was the incredibly slow &quot;heater&quot; when you order a slice of pizza. Wish I could give 4 &amp; 1/2 &apos;s!"
3,"Food was yummy. Service was not the best, no knowledge of wine and felt rushed . Food was yummy but a tad over priced in my opinion."
5,"Bricco is a fantastic restaurant and has an excellent bar. 
Had dinner and cocktails at the bar with a few friends this week and we &quot;loved&quot; the bartenders and the service they gave us!
Espresso martini (amazing)
Our meals were delicious and cooked to perfection!
Great place for lunch or dinner or cocktails."
4,Decided to eat here when we realized you can&apos;t eat at the sun shop. The risotto and the gnocchi were delicious! The staff were super friendly. Nice and quiet on a Sunday afternoon. We will be back!
3,"The food was OK- I personally feel as though it&apos;s overrated.

The time limit of 1 and 1/2 hr makes it almost uncomfortable for both the guests and waiter. I don&apos;t blame them for having to put time restrictions due to COVID- but if you&apos;re planning dinner plans to catch up with friends and such, this isn&apos;t a great place for that.

The waiter was extremely friendly and tried to accommodate the best he could"
5,"Ah, the North End. Personally, I don&apos;t think you can go wrong with Italian food in this hood, but with Bricco, you can go very, very right.

I love the ambiance, very rustic and cozy, with dim lighting so that you feel like you have the place to yourself once you&apos;re seated. We were lucky enough to get a table upstairs, which added to the ambiance by keeping us away from front door foot traffic.

The food was absolutely incredible. Sorry for the low-quality photos, but I guess dim lighting has its disadvantages too. If you can see it, my friend and I started with an octopus appetizer. Lightly seasoned, charred to perfection...I still think about this dish, even a few weeks later.

I had a Bolognese dish, which was also amazing. My friend enjoyed her pumpkin ravioli, but we agreed that a meat dish is probably the way to go when you&apos;re springing for a nice Italian meal.

I had heard that portions here are smaller, and it&apos;s definitely not family-style plating. But even with these portions, my friend and I couldn&apos;t get through the entire meal. Plus you need to leave room for dessert -- go get a cannoli from any of the famous bakeries nearby!

All in all, Bricco provided a really nice night out in the North End. Like all the restaurants in this area, it ain&apos;t cheap! But if you&apos;re looking to splurge on a nice night out, Bricco&apos;s got my vote for sure."
5,Had the best time celebrating our engagement at Bricco! Food and drink were amazing as always and we loved our waitress Patty!! Chilean sea bass in the front and gnocchi in the back
4,"A fantastic find in the North End!  Wow, I was very impressed with my experience here.  I recommend making reservations a head of time!  I came for date night on a Sunday (MLK weekend) and it was packed!  We were seated upstairs, which was quieter than the downstairs seating.  The restaurant decor is rustic and has a nice, &quot;homey&quot; feel to it.
 
We started with the Burrata for our appetizer and I really enjoyed this!  It is served on a bed of lettuce and asparagus.  This is light and refreshing and a great appetizer option that won&apos;t fill you up if you are planning to go in on some pasta for your main dish.  For our main dishes, we split the Ricotta Pillows and the Short Rib. WOW!  Both dishes rocked our socks off.  The truffle/butter sauce on the ricotta pillows is excellent and has a perfect balance of flavors!!  The short rib was also excellent!  It was so tender, and fell apart with the slightest touch of a fork.  It was served on top of a creamy polenta, which paired perfectly and didn&apos;t over power the short rib.
 
The service in general was spot on! Our water glasses were always full, and we received new silverware/plating for each dish.  Our waiter was very friendly and was great with menu recommendations when we were conflicted between items.   I will be coming back!  I definitely recommend coming here if you want real, authentic, Italian food!"
