4,"Very empty due to covid-19 restaurant restrictions. Seriously, my husband and I were the only ones there without a reservation. We had 90 minutes to eat... Lol. It was weird considering this place is packed with people on three floors. The service was obviously attentive and the food was good. I had the lobster roll the cotuit oysters and the seared tuna. I hope everything goes well in 2021."
5,"I was in Boston again and decided it was time for another &quot;Lobsta&quot; Roll. The restaurant was pretty full, but I was seated quickly. Menus during COVID are provided via a QR scan to your smartphone, but I&apos;m sure you can get a paper copy if needed. The meal was great, and the service was good as well. Outside seating is available, but it was a bit too cold for me."
5,"Covid sucks but the flip side is having this restaurant all to yourself on a Sunday afternoon. We got oysters on the half shell, sushi and more. The 5 of us sat at a quiet table over looking Liberty wharf. I remember when this place was Jimmy&apos;s. Everything is so different now, including this place. The food was perfect and the service friendly and fast."
5,"Kind of surprised by the average reviews. Food is always fantastic, consistent and yummy. Staff is well trained and friendly. Stopped by on a Saturday for oysters, clam chowder and split the Crab Cake Combo. Divine crab cake, scallops and shrimp. Oysters were awesome Bluepoint and Pemaquid. 

Ok, I&apos;ll come clean, we really came for rolls and butter :-). If you ever had legal rolls you know what I mean. Pro tip:  put the butter in them as soon as they come to the table and wait a minute."
5,"Came late at night but was such a good sit down! The drinks were awesome and the fried scallops were juicy and perfect. 

I haven&apos;t been to harborside in a while but was glad I came back because I absolutely think they improved on quality and service. I will absolutely be back!"
5,"We made reservations for 8:30 here and showed up a little earlier than expected. This is obviously in the harbor area with their deck overlooking the harbor towards Logan Airport.

We were sat though being early near the deck area. I was afraid the idea was to be on the deck in the cooler seats, so seeing a table leaving on the deck I asked the waitress if we could spike the table. She asked and then returned letting us take that table. This move and execution led to her snagging a larger tip. 

Ordered sushi for an appetizer, and for my meal salmon with butternut squash, broccoli and jasmine rice. I really think they need a steak on the menu - if nothing else - for a surf n turf or something. I was craving a steak badly. 

At any rate the sushi was incredibly good, the jasmine rice and salmon were done perfectly, and the dessert was even better. Plus, the seating was appreciated and this was one of my favorite meals of the year."
5,"Came here on a Saturday afternoon for sushi and sat downstairs on the window next to the water. Had a great experience, as I was able to order my shrimp tempura roll as a gluten free dish (also came with gluten free soy sauce). We were seated quickly and service was fantastic throughout. We will definitely be returning!"
1,"Let&apos;s start by saying , I was surprised at 7pm on a Saturday the restaurant was not crowded.
With reservations we were seated by the window.  So excited with the view! We ordered our drinks and looking at the menu for dinner and apps.  Suddenly the waitress came over and told us we would have to order our dinner fully before they served us our drinks!!!!  What?  4 professional women out to celebrate our dear friends birthday. We were wrongly accused of having  Glazed eyes and one pocketbook was on the floor.   This totally put us is shock and were embarrassed too!  Obviously we left, why would we want to stay there?   The sad thing was, our evening was ruined, our birthday night was ruined and at 7:30/ 8:00 to try to get another reservation, forget it!
Our total evening was gone..... sorry Legal Seafood Harborside, you were so unprofessional and rude and miss informed!! You ruined our night!"
4,"We came here for Valentine&apos;s Day dinner, and it was surprisingly not too pricey. Reservations filled up fast though, and my boyfriend had to book the table a few weeks in advance. They made it pretty romantic for Valentine&apos;s Day, even laying rose petals on the table. They had a special Valentine&apos;s Day dessert too, which was a heart-shaped chocolate and red velvet cake. It was simple, very sweet, and nothing special. The main courses and appetizers were good though, and of course, the seafood was very fresh and high quality. I got the pasta, which had a pretty generous portion of lobster, and my boyfriend got the salmon risotto.  Both were delicious, and the waiter recommended a good wine for us too. We will definitely come back for lunch or dinner on a regular day for their seafood.

We like this location for the view, but the only thing is parking. We had to park at a parking garage across the street, and it was $20 for the night. I&apos;m not sure if they had valet parking; that would have been much easier."
4,"Legal Harborside (Floor 2) offers diners a fantastic experience at a premium cost while showcasing the best seasonal, locally sourced seafood available. 

The first and most obvious attraction of LH is the location. Situated on the main drag in Seaport, there are 3 floors that offer 3 distinct dining experiences. The first floor is the casual dining, bar menu, and sushi bar. While there are views of the water and the intricate lobby, we did not dine on this floor. The 2nd floor (fine dining) portion of the restaurant overlooks the water and offers breathtaking views of the water with a focus on the finest ingredients the chef has to offer. The 3rd floor is a combination of a special events destination as well as a rooftop bar and limited menu when the weather is nice. In the end of February this was not an appealing proposal, so we opted for the 2nd floor fine dining location. 

The menu is wonderfully diverse with a combination of raw bar, sushi, appetizers, small plates, entrees, and desserts. Each of the sections of the menu offer diverse options and can be tweaked to meet most dietary restrictions. They also offer about 2-3 specials for each of the categories which rotate and change daily. There are some wonderfully unique and eclectic dishes to choose from and can throw a wrench in your previous menu plan if you are open to new and exciting opportunities. 

One of the things that it immediately apparent is the cost of the menu. Fine dining often comes with a price and on the 2nd floor you can expect to pay $35+ per person depending on what you order and how many courses you choose to have. Paired with some of the more exotic wines from even the by the glass menu can elevate the cost pretty quickly if you are price sensitive or trying to dine on a budget. 

We opted for 2 of each type of oysters available, the octopus salad, and we each had an entree. The wife went with the swordfish steak and I opted for the lobster roll special. The colossal lobster roll lives up to its name, but also carries an equally descriptive price tag ($55). Price aside, it was one of the best rolls I&apos;ve had since moving to Boston and traveling all up and down the coast in search for the best overall roll that New England has to offer. It&apos;s paired with shoestring, truffled fries which ends up being about 2.5# of food in total which the waiter cautioned me about. 

The service staff on the 2nd floor was phenomenal. We were never without anything, were offered bread on a number of occasions, and overall felt cared for the entire time as if we were having dinner at a good friend&apos;s place (that happens to be overlooking the water in downtown Boston). 

This place is not for the faint of heart, as the sticker shock will inevitably scare some people away or cause them to demand the best meal they&apos;ve ever had which could lead to some individuals being disappointed. 

When the entire evening is taken into consideration and compared to a lot of the similarly priced dinners that we&apos;ve had LH impresses. This is accomplished by the variety of seafood options, view, and service that we experienced with the only &quot;complaint&quot; being the elevated prices for the premium ingredients offered. LH is definitely a special occasion kind of place unless you constantly dine at the upper echelon of restaurants and have the bank account to do so. At the end of the day, the only thing that keeps me from giving LH 5 stars is the value rating that I use to figure overall ratings. 

If you are not overly price sensitive or go in knowing what you will likely pay at the end of the night LH will deliver on all fronts. We were provided with an excellent dinner, superb service, and amazing view as we enjoyed our meal. My one suggestion is you just need to prepare to pay for the premium experience Legal Harborside offers, as it comes at a premium cost."
3,"Well, I took my family to eat here and the food was just ok. Nothing stood out as being really good but there were a few failures. Not going to mention the failures individually since it seems to be the same from other reviews.

The service on the other hand was good and the staff was really friendly. Everyone seemed to want to get to the upper level bar and the line was getting longer and longer by the minute. This made us want to check it out as well. We talked to the staff and they allowed us to virtually hop in line while we finished our meal. We really appreciated that!

When we finally made it upstairs I could see why the place was popular. It decor was nice and the view was great. My next visit will likely just be for the upper bar level.

Happy Hunting Yelpers!!!"
4,"Legal Harborside is a great lively place for seafood and drinks, right at the Boston Seaport. There&apos;s an outdoor patio, a third floor space with gorgeous views, My son and I weren&apos;t picky about where to sit, and got immediate seating at the counter, looking into the chef&apos;s area, and we loved it. 

We loved watching the hard-working kitchen, and the lead chef orchestrating the team. I ordered the Sam Adams exclusive beer, which accompanied my meal well, and got the Coho Salmon deconstructed Caprese on special, it was really good. My son loved the lobster roll with fries. 

Service was friendly, but I don&apos;t think our server ever returned after taking our order, others dropped the food, he never checked in on us after the restaurant got very busy, it took a long time to get his attention to get the check. Still, a great location and good meal for us while we visited Boston."
5,Went for happy hour and was great atmosphere and view. The drinks were delicious and such a great scenery
5,I love all legal&apos;s I&apos;ve ever been to but i wish there was more regional non alcoholic beer options. Food is always great and the atmosphere is perfect no matter the time. Service is always 5 stars.
5,"Loved lunch, the tuna stench wow, the seafood casserole was incredible, the view was also good.  Server was very service oriented.   We travel alot, specially overseas and this restaurant filled all the spaces.  Give it a try we enjoyed it."
4,"I&apos;m not really a lobster person, but they had a deal on 2/29 where you could get two lobsters and two sides for $29. That&apos;s a pretty DARN good deal if you ask me, so I had to go grab some. The lobsters were advertised as 1 pound each, but they were honestly probably more because I was SO full afterwards. I&apos;m no expert on lobsters, but I think it tasted pretty good. I got garlic spinach and mashed potatoes as my side. They were both pretty good sides.

The creme brulee we got for dessert was also very delicious and topped with some nice raspberries.

View and ambience were very nice, definitely a great location in Seaport. Service was good as well. Without the deal, the menu would be much too pricey for me to afford, though..."
5,"Absolutely love this place. Especially the rooftop!  Today Glori was our waitress today and she was awesome!  Very attentive and sweet!  The martinis were consistent and so tasty!  
Can&apos;t wait to come back!"
3,"Legal, at any location, is our reliable destination for the best seafood. We&apos;re regulars. But something has changed. We&apos;ve eaten here twice in the last month and both times they have not had clams or oysters. The &quot;catch of the day&quot; was frozen shrimp.
The manager told us that the oysters didn&apos;t pass Legal&apos;s inspection. But plenty of other local restaurants are serving bivalves and I haven&apos;t gotten sick. There is no published news about shellfish disease. And frozen shrimp is something I can get in a landlocked state. I go to Legal for fish."
4,"This place is ok. There was a lot of hype about this place  but I found it not so special. Not sure what was all the hype about. The food was decent and not bad. We ordered oysters, seafood platter, their soup and some appetizer that I forgot the name. Oysters were the best part of the dinner. Fresh, juicy and very tasty. Crab soup was also good. The rest of the food was ok. 
The place itself felt like it didn&apos;t have a vibe. The restaurant was full of some random people eating pasta and chicken at apparently seafood place. 
Servers were pleasant but some time we had to look and wait for them. If anything I would come here again just for oysters and maybe I&apos;ll try lunch time next time."
5,"Are you visiting Boston? Great! 

Are you craving for lobster roll? 
Perfect! 

Then I&apos;d highly recommend eating at Legal Harbourside restaurant. It&apos;s one of the high end restaurants located in the Seaport district area in Boston and have a killer view of the Harbour. 

No need to make reservation if you are not obsess with where you will be seated. It should be all about the food, environment and customer services.

They have a very packed menu with some amazing seafood selection. 

FYI, some of the items on the menu were not associated with a price rather than a term &quot;market value.&quot;

We ordered the lobster roll that came with a good portion of french fries. You&apos;d have the choice to have your lobster served cold or warm. 

I&apos;d personally like my lobster to be served hot with some delicious butter scattered all over it.

Wow! Their lobster roll was served with the freshest, chunkiest, juiciest and tastiest lobster meat I&apos;d ever had.

It was extremely filling and exceeded my expectation. Get this, it costed $30, however the prices may vary that&apos;s why they stressed market value. So worth it and must have!!!

Not to be greedy, I also ordered a glass of Susana Balbo&apos;s signature Rose. FYI, Susana was Argentina&apos;s first ecologist and wine maker.

Although I was full, I&apos;d read excellent reviews about their &quot;Boston&apos;s cream pie&quot; and I&apos;m so happy I&apos;d ordered it for dessert. It had thick fudge frosting and rich yellow cake.

Overall it was a pleasant experience with really good food."
