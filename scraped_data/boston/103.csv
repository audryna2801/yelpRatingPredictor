5,"Im not a huge burger eater and is very selective when it comes to burgers . I wanted to give tasty burger a try while in Boston since its a different name to me and the reviews were great. 

It was so cold outside and it was a line outside the door which I seen on Yelp that this is typical. I wanted patiently. They are open late but their dine in closes earlier. I went their late and I had to order at the window. Once I got to the order window the girl was polite and patient. Me and my boyfriend both ordered burgers and he also ordered a hot dog.

Me personally even though the burger wasn&apos;t so juicy I still enjoyed it and would return their for a burger. This is coming from a non burger eater. My boyfriend didn&apos;t enjoy his burger too much and complain that it was too dry for him. He rather loved the hotdog way better and he said he would return for the hotdogs. Overall I would recommend to try this place out if you in Boston area."
5,"What&apos;s in a name?  Well, this burger is indeed tasty, so if you don&apos;t like reading, you can stop here. 

This is one of those craveable, always-hits-the-spot, plenty big for a meal on it&apos;s own but maaayyybe there&apos;s also room for some fries. And onion rings. And maybe a small shake.   We have ALWAYS gotten a good burger from every location we&apos;ve been to (Fenway is our main one because of the parking lot in times of COVID, but we&apos;ve also gone to Harvard Square, and used to go to the South Boston location all the time before it closed for repairs - hoping it starts back up soon).  Consistency is important when you&apos;re talking about something you could easily make at home, and we have always had that &quot;DANG this is a good burger!&quot; moment. Every.Single.Time.  It&apos;s my favorite burger joint, hands down.

And I feel like they CARE about putting out a nice meal; they are always pleasant at the counter, the burger always seems like it has been loving crafted, the bacon thick and cooked perfectly, the lettuce and tomato are fresh and centered on the burger, the pickles evenly distributed, the sauce is plentiful but not pornographic, the bun is fluffy, the wrapping carefully done - like a present you get to unwrap and enjoy. It&apos;s not squashed and greasy and mangled-looking, like some chains I will not name.

Things to know:
Unless you ask, it&apos;s cooked medium (which means a bit of pink in the middle) which I love, but not everyone does."
5,"Whenever I&apos;m in boston, I make sure to fit in a trip to tasty burger for either dine in or take out. Their burgers are so good and juicy! They sell each burger by itself but you can always make it a combo for an extra cost. Their tater tots and fries are also fried to perfection and seasoned well. 

The times that I had visited, I felt that the customer service was good and the wait time for the food was reasonable. My go-to order is the rise &apos;n shine burger with a runny egg, bacon, hot sauce, ketchup, and mayo. The flavor never disappoints but sometimes the egg can be a bit over done."
5,"The crowned jewel of the pahk

If you&apos;re stopping by to check out the park, I can think of no better stop in the area than tasty burger to grab a bite, a beer and a couple rounds of pool. 

My personal favorites at Tasty is the Gorgonzola Burger, the Big Tasty, and the Crispy chicken sandwich. Their use of bacon on these burgers hits the spot and the bread brings the ingredients together in such a way that you want to take your time with the masterpiece in front of you. 

The fact that you can switch it up with a chicken sandwich makes things interesting for any meat eating man or woman in the mood for a burger or sandwich. The fact that they have veggie options and alternatives for folks who don&apos;t eat meat makes it a go to for all dietary types. 

The sides provided on the menu are more than enough, my favorites to split with the squad is the onion strips and the fries with a touch of barbecue sauce for dipping. 

My favorite part about this location is the option for pool where you can pay a few bucks and get a game going with some friends. The vibe at night is really something out of a movie and you really get a cool feeling knocking the cue ball around with a bunch of fire folks

One of my favorite place to kick it and they&apos;ve got the flavors to keep you coming back"
5,"Was in the city for an errand yesterday and was craving Tasty Burger and did they deliver! I forgot how amazing their burgers were when compared to the competition. I got a &quot;Big Tasty&quot; as well as a vanilla milkshake and both were absolutely perfect. I mean - the burger was GORGEOUS. Perfectly cooked and juicy, the toppings were laid out nicely and the bun was the perfect companion to the burger size. There are plenty of burger spots in/around Boston and I still believe Tasty Burger is top notch and the price paid is on point. Instead of just throwing your order together as quickly as possible, the food actually looks like some time and thought was put into it. Just writing this review is making my mouth salivate as to how good my lunch was yesterday. Thank you Tasty Burger - I can&apos;t wait to visit again."
5,"Okay, this is by far the best burger I have ever had at a fast food restaurant! It&apos;s so juicy and well seasoned and the perfect size!! If we had these in Southern California I would go at least once a week!! So amazing!!!"
3,"So I have mixed feelings about this place because I have gone here twice and the first time I went it it was really good loved it ate my whole meal. 

The second time i went here got the exact same food and the burger was very dry, only one piece of bacon, and my drink was wrong. 

I just wish it was more consistent. The online ordering is awesome but you can&apos;t get the spicy ketchup off the burger if you order online."
2,The sides I got were cold and the burger was definitely frozen and thrown on the grill. Mine was still pink in the middle. Would not recommend unless you just have low standards to begin with. Good thing about it is there&apos;s free parking I guess.
5,"Good quality burgers at a price that won&apos;t break your wallet! Also open &quot;late&quot; (in Boston standards) for those partying it up past midnight in Fenway.

Of the Tasty Burgers I&apos;ve been to in the area, this is the only one I&apos;ve encountered so far which has sit down service. The servers are very quick to take your order but the food takes a while to come out. They also have a window outside if you want a to-go order or if you want to sit on the benches outside, but this doesn&apos;t work too well when it&apos;s cold. Inside there are tables as well as bar seats, and there is a pool table in the back.

The &quot;Starvin&apos; student&quot; is a really good deal because you can get a hamburger/cheeseburger with fries and a 16oz can of beer for $10. They offer another deal of basically the same thing but with a glass of wine. The cheeseburger itself is already $6 (hamburger is $5), and they don&apos;t have any beers cheaper than $4.50, so you&apos;re basically getting a bunch of fries for free. 

They have a lot of condiments at the table, from hot sauce to two types of ketchup and mustard and their special seasoning, which actually comes in handy because their standard hamburgers and cheeseburgers don&apos;t come with sauce. However their more &quot;special&quot; burgers like their Big Tasty do come with sauce-- it&apos;s just up to you whether you want to save the extra dollar or two on a burger. The burger is cooked to medium by default. The ingredients are super fresh and great quality for the price! Their fries are thin and crispy. They&apos;re a little underseasoned but that&apos;s what the condiments on the table are for.

As it gets later the place gets busier, but I&apos;ve always had good customer service here."
2,We ordered take out today.. $17 for 2 burgers (hubba burger and cheeseburger) and a large fry.. got home and realized that we got 2 plain cheeseburgers  the person who took our order couldn&apos;t have possibly been less friendly and I was disappointed that the ketchup had high fructose corn syrup  it was an ok experience
3,"3.5/5 but rounds down to 3.  Stick with the burgers as the chicken sandwiches and hot dogs were very average tasting (would not order them again).

Big Tasty Burger: 4/5
Chicken Sandwich: 2.5/5
Hot Dog; 2.5/5"
4,"I came on a weekday evening with 3 friends for a late dinner. It was more crowded than I had expected! Luckily, we found a table pretty quickly. 

I ordered the Starving Student Special, which came with a cheeseburger, fries, and a beer (I got a Miller High Life). I was really happy with my order, since this set was only a couple cents more expensive than just getting a burger and fries alone! The cheeseburger was very well cooked and tasted delicious! I love sprinkling the tasty burger seasoning all over it - it&apos;s so addicting! I also love mixing mayonnaise and the seasoning as a fry dip! 

The service was quick and efficient.

Overall, we had a great time and I really enjoyed my meal! I&apos;ll be back next time I&apos;m in the area!"
1,"One star because their burgers were actually tasty. Otherwise zero star. ( I know I can&apos;t give them zero star. ) If they can&apos;t serve right, they should just keep it like regular fast food. Not table service. 
We were five of us sat outside table. We had to wait like 10 minutes for the table to get ready. I don&apos;t think they had enough server. Out server got so long to tale the order and didn&apos;t come back even though we needed her. Basically she got wrong order and charged us. Our server didn&apos;t even bring the food, the guy from the kitchen brought us food so talked to him her order is wrong. The guy told us she is busy so he will fix the order so just keep the wrong stuff they brought. Then he didn&apos;t fix the check. We had to wait very very long to just get the check. Like 30minutes after all five of us finished eating sitting doing nothing. Now have to ask to fix the check? Crazy!! Wasted our time so long!"
4,"We frequent this Tasty Burger often because it never disappoints. My first experience was with both my brother and cousin. Memorable experience because my cousins asks &quot;was this place named after Samuel L Jackson&apos;s character in Pulp Fiction?&quot; Reason why it was hilarious was because he had a huge Samuel L Jackson portrait in the back to confirm his affirmation. Now to the burgers, I often order the Tasty Burger or BBQ bacon. I go with medium well because I&apos;m still not brave to go any lower than that. Burger is great and for value literally one of the best burgers in the city. I Sometimes being indecisive never works out but at Tasty burger it does. For someone who never wants fries or onions rings they offer both with the half/half. This is a place that lives up to its name."
5,"Truly can&apos;t go wrong with tasty burger! It was the first fast food spot I went to after moving to Boston, and I haven&apos;t felt the need to try any other burger places since. The veggie burger is great - not your standard black bean or morningstar patty. Tastes well-fried, almost crisp on the outside and soft on the inside, and goes nicely with the basic bun-greens-tomatoes-onion combo. My go-to spot for addicting vegetarian fries too (think McDonald&apos;s but without the beef fat! I always get the large). Someday I&apos;ll have enough self restraint to only order small fries, but that day has not come."
4,"Wanted to grab a quick bite before heading to the Red Sox game. It was pretty busy inside and it looked like there were only 1 or 2 servers helping everyone.

I got the spicy jalapeño burger with a side of tater tots. The burger was very rich and greasy and the tater tots were super crispy--exactly everything I wanted in my meal before the game. As for my drink, they ran out of tasty ale so I got the Wachusett blueberry ale to wash down my meal."

Came here after going on the Fenway Park Tour. Yes we were starving.
I love this restaurant lots of sandwich options nice decor with pictures on the wall. Samuel L. Jackson from the movie Pulp Fiction, Henry Winkler The Fonz, and others decorated the walls there was a pool table too.
I got the Chicky chicky Parm parm sandwich a Chicken parmigiana sandwich with mozzarella cheese and marinara sauce and a side of onion rings.
A very enjoyable experience i would say Tasty Burger is equivalent to our The Habit Hamburger chains."
4,"The burger of the Boston Red Sox. Located right next to Fenway Park. Casual throw back style diner. Fenway is the oldest major league stadium, not sure how old this place is, but both have that authentic charm. Visited while on a business trip.

The menu is made up of diner style offering burgers, hot dogs, chicken strips, fries, onion, rings, tater tots, shakes, mini pies and more.  Food is old style and reasonably priced so don&apos;t get too excited about fancy and delicious. It&apos;s fast food after all.

Hint: You can order outside at the window or sit inside. Inside has a bar and tv screens. Each table has a basket of condiments to spice up your meal. Heard they stay open to 2:00 am so you can get your munchie fix in after the game or after a night out.

Fair is fair come check this location out and enjoy a throwback meal. Go Sox!"
5,"Wow!!! Did i get lucky! This place was right at the hotel that I was staying so it was perfect to grab a burger at night! We came here twice, once during the day time we ordered from the outside and the other time we went right after a Patriots game, they are open late so it was perfect. When we went to go eat it night it was so convenient, we had a long train ride from Foxborough to our hotel and we were able to get a beer watch some West Coast Basketball enjoy some delicious burgers and fries. Their burger are simple yet so tasteful, I could have easily ate 2 of them but since I had beer and fries I had to settle for one. In the future I will have no beer and just the burger. I have been to Boston a couple of times and this time was my first time trying it. I&apos;m definitely coming back, the atmosphere is nice, they also have a pool table inside."
3,"I stopped by here with some friends for some late night food while in Boston last weekend.  Seems like the place has a eat-in section and also a window outside to place orders to go.  We opted to get food to go.  

I got the &apos;Big Tasty&apos; burger combo.  It came out to $10.97 including tax and came with fries and a drink.  I ate it back at our hotel.  Overall, it was pretty solid.  The fries were pretty good; no complaints.  The burger was pretty hefty and the lettuce and tomato on it seemed relatively fresh.  The burger patty itself was pretty thick, which is good.  Flavor was definitely solid and satisfying.  Nothing really stood out a lot about the burger but there wasn&apos;t really anything offensive about it either. 

Overall, I&apos;d give three stars.  I think the combo I got was actually a bit overpriced at $11 for what you get.  For under $9, I think I would give 4 stars.  Cheers."
