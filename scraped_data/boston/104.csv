5,"Decided to check this place out after catching it on an episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives on the Food Network. I must say, I certainly believe this spot absolutely deserves the hype.

I went in on a weekday for take out and could not wait to eat the food. MOUTHWATERING. Mouthwatering. Not only did it smell amazing, but it tasted even better. The food is so fresh. I got the Philly Steak sandwich, with fries and onion rings. The onion rings themselves were crispy, some of the best I&apos;ve ever had. Fries are nicely seasoned that they don&apos;t really need ketchup or anything like that either.

We&apos;d also gotten a caesar salad and a side of mashed potatoes. I tried the mashed potatoes and they&apos;re delicious. The portions are a decent size for to go, but I did figure they&apos;d be bigger--especially since they boast it on their website.

The woman at the front counter who took our order was friendly and polite. She was patient and did not have any problems answering any questions. Jay the owner was also there when we arrived, and he was chatting with a few customers that were seated outside. You definitely have to plan your coming here I think unless you&apos;re only planning to get take out/pick up. Many people will arrive to eat and sit down, and currently I believe they&apos;re only open for dine-in on the weekends as of right now due to COVID.

All in all, fantastic food that&apos;s worth the price. I&apos;m definitely planning a trip back."
5,"Stuffed! Is the one word summary I have for this delightful space. They are no nonsense in their menu and all wonder in the state buds. We order a wide array of food and ultimately had to be rolled out of there. Two dishes to rave about: 1. The hash browns! Just stop what you are doing and order eggs and hash browns, the flavoring is unbelievable. 2. The homemade Hash has forced my husband into an afternoon coma as it was so good he wouldn&apos;t dare leave any morsel unattended. 

They accept credit cards, affordable, they come out with food quickly and have outdoor seating this summer"
5,"I love this place! I came here when I visited Boston with my bf. Line was long and it was outdoor dining only due to COVID. We waited about 15 min before we were sat. I ordered French toast with bacon which stated there would have been 5 pieces of French toast. Then a big ass one piece French toast was brought to me lol it was surprising to me but it didn&apos;t matter to me. French toast is French toast :) I inhaled that in about 5 min lol staff was very attentive and friendly. You can use bathroom inside but you have to wear your mask. I loved it here, I&apos;d come here again :)"
5,"First time visiting this place ! It&apos;s the best diner in the area ! We met the owner /Chef Jay and he&apos;s very nice and generous . The portions were huge and the food by far was delicious. One of my favorites , i will definitely come back soon. The staff was very friendly and very quick service too .

I also recommend to check out his book as well,very inspiring! 
Thank you and be safe"
2,"For the price $43.93 ($10+ tax/deliver fee) uberEats delivered chicken and waffles for my wife. And I received steak and eggs, with potatoes. The waffle was soggy. The chicken was over cooked. My steak tasted spoiled. I gagged the first bit. (Figured it was because I just ate the fat) the second bit I had to regurgitate into a napkin. The eggs, bland. Potatoes, I don&apos;t want to talk about it.  

There&apos;s no point in calling because someone will be offended and nothing will be done anyways. Now I&apos;m $40 broker and still hungry!"
4,"Ok, so they&apos;re not lying about portion sizes here. The portions are truly massive. Everyone working here was very friendly and the overall service was prompt and attentive. Outdoor dining was open, pleasant, and had tables for two and four with plenty of space in between tables. 

All the dishes we ordered were tasty. Between us we had pancakes, a Belgian waffle with fruit, a veggie omelet, and a premiere omelet (sliced corned beef and Swiss cheese). Above all, they&apos;ve got solid coffee too.

I can certainly see why this is a local favorite and will definitely be back in the future."
4,"Not lying about the massive portions!! (and low prices)

We came at 1pm on a Sunday afternoon, there was a line but it went by fast and we were seated in around 15 minutes for 2 people.

Got the Emergency Room and the East Springfield Omelette. The omelette was huge and packed with fillings, although the fillings were all basically separated (ie one third was tomato, the middle section was broccoli, the last was cheese spinach and mushroom). Kind of odd and would&apos;ve been nice if the the fillings were evenly distributed throughout. Still very tasty though.

Honestly I did not really enjoy the home fries, very soft and not at all crispy, and they had kind of an strange taste.

Fast friendly service though and overall satisfying breakfast food!!"
3,"My second trip to Mike&apos;s City Diner for brunch and there was just the one table for two left - perfect!  Although there were some seats available at the counter.

At $2.75, their coffee is bottomless.  We asked for milk and OJ, and were given the large as a default for $2.50.  Smalls would have been $1.95 and $1.75 respectively.  We both drank it all though, so it was fine.

We shared two dishes - a savory and a sweet:

Duck Confit Hash $13.95 2 eggs any style over duck confit hash, home fries or grits and toast.

Banana Chocolate Chip pancakes (from the board) $6.95 (for a full order of 3 pancakes; $5.95 for 2 as a side) + $2.50 (for the fruit and chips).

Portions were good.  The grits a bit too much so, however, since it wasn&apos;t particularly flavorful.  I downed my portion doused with butter and mingled with the tender flavorful hash.  My vote goes to the home fries vs grits for any next visit.  I liked the hash well enough.  We both found bits of bone in it, but I guess that just means it is real duck!  I prefer my pancakes to be topped with cooked real fruit, but their version with the banana slices and chips added to the raw pancake batter as it was cooking was fine, though it made the cakes more heavy than light and fluffy.  The three pancakes were huge though, and my DC had to struggle to finish just one.

The food was fine, but nothing particularly wowed us.  Service was fine, and the food took less than 10 min to hit the table.

Cash Only.  An ATM still sits awkwardly outside the individual bathroom.  According to the front page of their menu, Saturdays and Sundays are breakfast only.  For light eaters, they offer a selection of breakfast sandwiches (meat and egg) for under  $5; 50 cent charge for the addition of cheese.  They also have some hefty sounding breakfast burritos for under $9, plus $2 for home fries (no idea if they&apos;re tucked in also, or out on the side)."
5,"Given Guy Fieri&apos;s high recommendation of this place and us having similar foodie palates, we couldn&apos;t not try Mike&apos;s while in Boston!

It was a Sunday morning and by the grace of the traffic gods, we were able to park relatively close and stroll on in. The line was out the door and Guy Fieri&apos;s picture greeted us as we walked in. The line moved quickly and we were seated and served promptly. We showed up ready to eat so we rolled up our sleeves and tried their corned beef hash, eggs benedict, and home fries. All were delicious! Our coffee mugs were never empty and the service was outstanding. Our server was so tickled at how amazed we were watching everyone&apos;s plates come across the dining room that she sent us home with a souvenir Mike&apos;s Diner coffee mug! 

Definitely a hot spot for breakfast! Go hungry, leave fat and happy with maybe a little lagniappe! 

P.S. Ask for onions and peppers in your home fries and throw some hot sauce on that. Delicious!"
5,"This small place was featured on food network&apos;s Diners, Drive ins and Dives. Work brought me to Boston, so I figured I&apos;d check it out. The place is tiny with an old diner feel. Staff is friendly and the place is clean. I ordered the Chicken and Waffles as well as a side of home made Corned Beef Hash....it was absolutely delicious! The chicken was seasoned well, crispy and juicy, the Belgian Waffle crispy and fluffy. Now the hash mmMMM.... I wish I ordered two! Lol, portions are large so there&apos;s plenty of left overs. This tiny place didn&apos;t disappoint. Aside from hot coffee the drinks are in the cooler. Pepsi products, Nantucket Nectars etc. Definitely will go back before I leave the area!"
5,"This review is based solely on the food &amp; service. Since we were only picking up our orders to go. The breakfast is so on point and delicious. This place was literally what we ate for 3 mornings, we were too worried to try anything else. Forgot to take pics even though I meant to. Whoops. We had the chicken and waffles, French toast, and egg platter with pork sausage. All of it was great. The kitchen  does their thing! From what I saw, the dining area is quite small &amp; seems like they get busy. Not too much social distancing but they do have some barriers. If you&apos;re looking for a simple and delicious breakfast you can&apos;t go wrong with this spot. Enjoy!"
4,"Love this spot for its huge portions (it&apos;s what they are so rightly known for!), unbelievably nice staff, and consistency of everything. Never a complaint. Their breakfast sandwiches are always big, especially the huge split and grilled sausage sammies (the hot sausage is a house fav, I love the sweet linguicia one too though)

Their corn beef hash is house made and HUGE. Come hungry please. That breakfast comes with meat galore, and hefty sides. Also very reasonably priced. Nothing over priced because you get so much. The breakfast sandwiches are actually cheaper than they should be because they&apos;re damn good and big. Most of the menu is priced under what most restaurants would charge, and most places don&apos;t come close to these portions. 

Come to mikes already!"
5,"Mike&apos;s City Diner is running like a well-greased machine, despite the challenges of operating during this Post Covid 19 period. 

There are preesntly, three dining options: (1) Eat-in, sit outside at sidewalk tables; nice ambiance, comfortable, very efficient waitstaff, (2) Call-in, order, and pick up for take-out; a flawless experience, and you are met with a smile by the Wait Staff, and (3) stop by (you haven&apos;t called your order in), and place your order for pick-up at the counter.

Tomatoe and cheddar omlette, grits, and dry wheat toast, were top notch. High quality ingredients, cooked to perfection. Served by someone who welcomes your business, with open arms, and who is happy to be of service to you."
4,"Great Place to stop by for Brunch! I came by around 8 AM on a Sunday and there was plenty of seating, but it did get packed by 9 AM. It&apos;s a small place so I recommend coming early. 

I had the french toast and it was delicious. Depending on how hungry you are, you can get 3 or 5 slices. My friend had the emergency room which was classic eggs, meat, potatoes and toast, fairly standard for brunch. For Boston, everything was really reasonable priced, but keep in mind that its Cash only!"
3,"The place is nice. On weekend, many people are dining in. It is a type of authentic American breakfast. I like my omelet. Their steaks are tender and chewy. I can finish one plate by myself, but I see many girls can not finish by themselves. If anyone is worry about wasting food, they can order one or two and share it with each other."
5,"This spot is AMAZING!!! The chicken and waffles are so delicious, my wife loves their omelets and waffles, the pancakes are huge like the rest of the other portions. Nothing bad to say about this place besides having to wait when it&apos;s busy but it&apos;s worth the wait. I come here quite often."
5,"CASH ONLY. I love love love this place. Always will be my favorite brunch restaurant. 

GET THE SOUTHERNER OMELETTE! Absolutely delicious and worth every cash ($10.47, i think) and wait time. It gets busy during brunch time so expect some wait time."
5,"When you pop out of Logan International after a painful redeye, it&apos;s 7am, your ride isn&apos;t coming till 9 and you&apos;re starving, Mike&apos;s hits the spot. It&apos;s not super cheap but you know you can trust the food and service when the place is packed with Boston&apos;s finest. The plates are huge and you&apos;ll eat enough to cover you till dinner."
5,"We went on a Sunday at noon and they only serve breakfast (which we were okay with!). Got the corn beef hash eggs benedict that was amazing. Also came with a side of some of the best home fries I&apos;ve ever had. My wife got a Belgium waffle that was also tasty!  Everything on the menu is made from scratch, so I think no matter the choice, it&apos;s going to be good! 

Pro tips - bring cash, they don&apos;t take CC&apos;s! Go later in the day on the weekends, since they only service breakfast, they have a line around the building in the morning."
5,First time in Boston and we wanted some good diner food. Just googled Mikes and decided to try it. The food was very yummy and cooked just the way we wanted it. Quick service and would highly recommend
