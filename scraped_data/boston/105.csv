5,"Why I&apos;ll go back:  An elegant atmosphere with food that never disappoints.
You HAVE to order:  the chicken breast (the most flavorful chicken entree I have ever ordered at a restaurant and the first thing that comes to mind when I think of Deuxave)
Tony&apos;s Tip: table 61 is a cozy table for two tucked away in one corner of the restaurant, and while only one diner has a full view of the restaurant, the seats are oversized wingback armchairs that add a little flair to the dining experience (FYI, temporarily removed during COVID)

Despite a decade of success in the Back Bay, Deuxave remains surprisingly under the radar in Boston&apos;s dining scene. It&apos;s arguably a top 10 restaurant in terms of across the board excellence, with a spectacularly elegant dining room, consistently outstanding dishes across a varied menu, an excellent wine list, and attentive, professional service.

We did the seasonal tasting menu a couple of weeks ago. This turns over at least once a quarter, and we were so impressed with the experience that we&apos;re thinking we should really go back every few months to see what new offerings Chris Coombs has cooked up. From the creatively garnished crab appetizer to the truffle-topped cod basting in a delicate, flavorful broth to the airy gnocchi and classically presented filet on a bed of whipped mashed potatoes, the cliche that we enjoyed every bite was never more true.

So stalk your next special occasion (birthday, promotion, the end of COVID?!!) and celebrate it at Deuxave. We&apos;re already in stalking mode ;)"
5,"My boyfriend and I came here last night to celebrate our three months anniversary. We made a reservation ahead of time and one of the staff members called the day of to make sure we were coming. Parking might be a little difficult on normal days because the restaurant is right on the corner on Comm Ave and Mass Ave, but luckily a car left the spot that was right in front when we arrived. Coming into the restaurant we are greeted with every staff member who made eye contact was us, they took a few minutes to sanitize the table before walking us over, and even wished us Happy Anniversary. Everyone was extremely nice! The tables were set far apart (maybe not six feet but far enough I suppose). The menus were printed on paper, probably so they can discard afterwards. 

They only offered distilled water in a bottle ($7) or sparkling, we opted for distilled. We ordered a glass of Chardonnay and Playa Picante for drinks. The cocktail has cayenne in it where you can definitely taste the hint of spice, it was interesting. Items from the menu that we ordered include crispy duck confit and foie gras as appetizers; Long Island duck breast and seared tenderloin for entrees, and chocolate mousse for dessert. The crispy duck confit was very crispy, a little salty but the sour taste from the sauces balanced it well. The foie gras is a must! I absolutely loved how they paired it with banana bread. The entrees did not disappoint! The tenderloin was SO tender, we asked for medium rare - we got exactly medium rare. I really liked the sweet potato puree and roasted potato. The duck breast tasted so creamy and tender, I definitely recommend it! The dessert was a bit small for being $18 but we really wanted something so that they restaurant can write Happy Anniversary on it. 

Overall, I would recommend this restaurant and I would definitely come back. It is pricey but you get the quality you&apos;re paying for, it&apos;s worth it for a special evening out. Everybody was so wonderful, our server was very friendly, even the hosts were helping out with clearing our plate after each course."
5,Best dining experience since COVID pandemic. I am impressed with the flavor innovations. This place is more than just atmosphere/vibe. You cannot go wrong with any appetizer and dessert option ( the main courses were also superb but we just tried chicken and duck breast so I cannot speak for all). I even fell in love with chicken breast for the first time in my life!
3,"A rather underwhelming birthday dining experience. The duck breast was very chewy, the steak, tho asked for medium rare, was cooked to medium. The steak knife was unacceptable, too. I was hoping they would shave the white truffle at the table, perhaps that was my misunderstanding. The french onion soup was excellent. Foie gras was mediocre, nothing exceptional. When asked for the dining occasion, I specifically mentioned it was a birthday celebration for both guests, but the restaurant didn&apos;t do anything about it (then why ask?)

That&apos;s all."
5,"Wowowowow this was one heck of a dining experience! We celebrated my boyfriend&apos;s birthday dinner and chose to do the tasting menu with the wine pairing and it was the best decision we could have made. Every single bite was delectable and the wine just made it that much better. I legit ate EVERYTHING off of every single plate we were served because it was just too tasty to let fly! The service was impeccable: friendly, informed, timely, yet respectful of our space and privacy when needed. We never wanted it to end! I&apos;m already looking forward to the next meal we choose to indulge in here. 10/10!"
5,"My boyfriend and I came here for our anniversary and it did not disappoint!! Yes it&apos;s on the expensive side and you literally have to pay for every little thing (water and bread) but I truly thought everything was well worth the money: from the service to the food to the atmosphere. 

First of all they gave us glasses of complimentary wine which was so kind of them and such a great way to start off our dinner. Later they also gave us a small complimentary tasting of something the chef made, but unfortunately I can&apos;t remember exactly what it was. All I remember was that it was very good! The bread was so fluffy and had the best texture, and the butter was honestly to die for...whatever it was! Even though you do have to pay for it, I&apos;d say the bread is worth it. Get the bread. 

For our appetizers we ordered the beef tartare and wagyu carpaccio as well as the trio of scallop crudo. They both were super tasty, unique, and flavorful but between the two, the tartare and wagyu carpaccio was my favorite!! For our entrees we got the ahi tuna and prime beef tenderloin. I cannot say enough good things about these dishes. Highly recommend both! If I had to choose a favorite between these two, I&apos;d probably go with the beef tenderloin. It was just cooked perfectly and the potatoes and the rest of the sides on the dish were such a good touch that complimented the beef so perfectly. 

Honestly everything about our experience here was so wonderful and it&apos;s a perfect place to go if you&apos;re celebrating something special. Check it out for your next special night out, you won&apos;t be disappointed!!"
5,"Divine. Our group split the foie gras (do it), focaccia (huge!), and steak tartare, with a bottle of wine and round of cocktails. Everyone seemed wowed by their individual entrees (cod, lobster gnocchi, chicken, and duck). Sad for me, they were sold out of the duck confit and scallops. My husband said it was the best chicken he has ever tasted. Which is a relief because who orders chicken when there is literally anything else on the menu??

Tried to hold out for their outdoor patio but snow in October pushed us indoors. Initially seated in a semi-enclosed space with ample room, but by the time we left restaurant had filled out (still totally compliant with COVID reductions). Waitstaff and host masked and respectful of space, disposable menus (including the 36 page paper menu so try to use that QR code if you can)! Service was excellent though I felt sad that I missed some of the wine pours for not drinking as fast as the boys. Cry. Came to about $110 pp including tax/tip. Wore a dress and thought the vibe leaned towards business casual, more upscale than most Boston restaurants."
5,"The best French restaurant in Boston.

I love their preparation of Foie Gras and I&apos;m proud to say I&apos;ve dined there with my heart on my sleeve. It&apos;s divine"
5,I made a reservation for me and my girlfriends anniversary dinner and I can honestly say I was blown away. The restaurant was absolutely beautiful on the inside and the ambiance/music was perfect. We decided to have the 5 course tasting meal and it was the best decision I have ever made. I can&apos;t begin to describe how good everything was for each course. The Cod was our favorite one but we would rate all the courses 10/10 for sure. I couldn&apos;t have asked for better service and I would definitely go there again
2,"The food was delicious, and well cooked. Though for a birthday dinner (mentioned in our reservation, which staff acknowledged upon arrival), we were seated right next to a table - which were not socially distanced (per the 6 feet state requirement). Also waited on someone to take our second drink orders for about 10 minutes, while our empty glasses sat in the middle of our table. Overall, good food, but disappointing, won&apos;t be returning."
5,Easily the best meal I have ever had in my life. I took my boyfriend here for his birthday and the service was excellent. the food is very unique and extremely delicious. it looks as good as it tastes. I dream about the butternut squash ravioli
3,"Had my birthday dinner here with my family. It was a pleasant day. Got to sit outside and have a quit city dinner. The staff was friendly a little confused with some things on the menu, but it was no big deal. Most of the food was just okay. I loved the cheese plate and wine that I had paired with it. 

My main course was just okay. Got the lamb and it was a Greek style. Wasn&apos;t the biggest fan. It tasted like any other Greek dish I could&apos;ve gotten for less than $20. The plate was bright and colorful atleast, but the watermelon salad that went with the lamb was not good. I&apos;m really confused why someone would pair watermelon with ground lamb. The pepper sauce mixed with the lamb just tasted like taco meat sauce with watermelon. The tuna tartar was really good, but again they put watermelon in that for some reason. Went better with the tuna than the lamb

The scallop dish tasted just okay too. It was good, but nothing about it really amazed me. The only thing I thought was really good was the tortellini that my sister got. It had a lot of flavor and was good fresh pasta. I really regret not ordering the duck. I don&apos;t know maybe I&apos;ll come back and try that another time. 

Either way the experience wasn&apos;t really that memorable for a birthday dinner in a good way. I&apos;m still wondering to this day who pairs watermelon with ground lamb!"
5,"Phenomenal meal, as always.  Deuxave is my favorite fine dining restaurant in Boston.  3-course prix fixe ($38), including Crispy Pave Duck Confit, Pan Seared Arctic Char, and Pineapple Cheesecake.  Drink: Bubble Bath ($13). Delicious, imaginative, executed gorgeously. 

BEST: Pan Seared Arctic Char.  Perfectly seared, fatty fish (still dreaming about it tbh).  Crisp on the outside, soft and juicy on the inside.  The green onion puree and meyer lemon puree provided shots of intense flavor.  The fish was topped with bright celery sprigs and was laid on creamy celery root puree, diced butterball potatoes, and crispy pancetta.  Just so many vibrant flavors and textures, individualistic yet cohesive.  

In the Crispy Pave Duck Confit, the duck and beets paired well as complementing, grounded flavors.  Beets provided juiciness, and the rhubarb puree added a cutting tartness.  I wish the pave was crispier, but otherwise, this was an excellent course.  

Dessert was creative with a Goat Cheese Cheesecake Mousse and unique Avocado Sorbet.  While perhaps not something I would crave, it was a delight (and mindf**k) to eat.  So fun!  They also gave some ty gifts with the check, including Blood Orange Pate de Fruit (?), Banana Macaron, and Chocolate (with Hazelnut I believe?).  Anywho, loved the macaron.  

My drink was &quot;Bubble Bath&quot;, a lavender infused gin with lemon.  Beautiful presentation with strewn lavender flowers, however they became something to skirt around or ingest with vigor (bitter if they got stuck in your mouth).  Overall a great drink!

Loved my meal, so happy to be back.  A radiating five stars!

[ Context: a buyout event was canceled last minute, so Deuxave offered a 3-course prix fixe for $38.  My friend sent me their announcement (made over Instagram, we&apos;re all clearly obsessed w this place) and I immediately booked myself a solo spot for that evening. ]"
4,"Came here to celebrate my wife&apos;s birthday with our little one who is 20mths old. Nice outdoor setup with good social distancing. Since the restaurant is on a busy street corner, there is a lot of traffic but considering that, they did a good job with the set up. 
Food overall was very good. The execution on all the dishes were pretty on-point. We both preferred the appetizers over the entrees. The appetizers were more creative, interesting and tastier. 
The veal loin entree was executed well, tender but not sure if the sauce went particularly well with it. It was with fois gras but the fois gras was a tiny morsel and you could have totally missed it. The herbed Spaetzle on the bottom was tasty
The fries au canard was excellent 
The ahi tuna again executed well though not a particular fan of the lentils on top
Overall a lovely dinner on a lovely late summer evening"
4,"Had a really nice night here - exceeded my expectations.  

Started off with the &apos;Take a Hike&apos; (old fashioned with maple - too sweet) and &apos;Bubble Bath&apos; (gin/lemon/bubbles - delicious).  Had an awesome Burgundy with the meal - wine list is deep though markup seemed particularly steep.  

Appetizers - Hudson valley foie gras + duck confit - both were fabulous, highlights of the meal for us.  

Entree - Roasted mushroom ravioli - decent, Rack of Lamb - solid, nicely done.  

Cheese course had many delicious options to choose from, came with a myriad of fun accoutrements.  

Closed out the night with the chocolate tart which fell short - still cold and hard to cut into, a bit lacking in flavor and the grape sorbet didn&apos;t quite work."
5,"Fun fact - my wedding anniversary is on my birthday!  That said, I get to chose a very special restaurant on this very special day *insert giant smile here*  In the past, Hubby and I have done the steakhouse thing and this year I wanted to go out of our comfort zone (hubbs isn&apos;t that much of a french food lover) and try something new.  This place was highly recommended and I am so glad we came.  .

Service was wonderful, dinner was every better.  We had an assortment of amuse bouche and then hubby and I shared the duo of tartare and carpaccio (YUM) and 9 hour french onion soup (YUM YUM YUM).  Honestly you cannot go wrong with anything you have here.  Our apps were followed by entrees that were as beautiful as they were tasty (bolongese and rib eye) and for me the maitake mushrooms stole the show.  The beef was tender and so flavorful but the maitake.. my goodness just a flavor bomb in my mouth.  You bet I am still dreaming of them now!

I highly recommend a reservation even on a Tuesday night like when we went.  The ambiance is romantic and they have a wonderful selection of wine and spirits.  A beautiful restaurant that I cannot wait to find an excuse to come back to!"
5,"My family and I loveee French food. I wouldn&apos;t say this is an authentic French restaurant, but I&apos;d definitely come if you&apos;d like French and American food/drink options. Loved the modern-chic atmosphere of the restaurant. They had valet out front, which was especially helpful when it was a rainy day. 

The drinks were pretty strong, but gooood. There were a number of drink options from wine to cocktails. The the bartender was also able to create something upon request. 

Our server was so friendly and sweet. She was very accommodating and made sure we didn&apos;t have any allergies prior to taking our order. For apps we got: 9hr French Onion Soup, Duck Liver pate, Late Harvest Salad, and the Foie Gras. All were delicious!! I would say the onion soup was quite flavorful and packed with flavor. My parents weren&apos;t a huge fan, mainly because they felt the soup was too rich to sip on and would rather dip. I still enjoyed it though! 

For entrees we got the seared ahi tuna sterloin, cast-iron seared ribeye and the spiced long island duck breast. Presentation was lovely and food was excellent! As for dessert, the creme brulee and the warm cider donut really hit the spot. Definitely wrapped up our fall evening vibes.

Overall, portions were great and there was a nice variety within the menu. I think this restaurant would be great for a romantic date, or even a get together with friends/family. I&apos;ll definitely be returning!"
5,"Really excellent meal, outside on the patio in February!!! Beef tenderloin was incredible. Duck was delicious. Highly recommend! We stayed warm and left happy."
4,"Solid date night. Really cool atmosphere and bar area. My wife and I went for our anniversary dinner and really enjoyed the experience. 

We started with Night Moves and the duck confit. Both were awesome and well presented. I would get both again. She then got the tagliatelle and I got the duck. Again, very impressed by both. Everything has great taste. The duck was very tender and crispy on the outside. 

Pricey spot but worth it for a nice occasion."
5,My family and I went here for my birthday on Sunday. Everything about the meal was superb. To name a few highlights: 1. Our table was surrounded by three heat lamps which radiated a lot of heat making it the perfect temperature for our meal.
