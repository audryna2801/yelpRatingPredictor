5,"Was craving lobster ravioli (ravioli con aragosta) and this did not disappoint!! There are so many Italian restaurants options in this area I had a hard time deciding, but I was very happy with this choice. 

This place had outdoor seating just off the Main Street and a few tables inside with the windows open. It seemed pretty authentic. The lobster ravioli looks like you don&apos;t get a ton of food but trust me, these are big raviolis! Add in the bread and oil and I was stuffed. I used the bread to finish up the rest of the crab meat sauce.

A glass of resiling wine complimented the meal well. I would come here again and highly recommend."
5,"My dad picked up some takeout on his way home from an appointment, which was an exciting treat! Our group ordered gnocchi pomodoro (red sauce is dairy-free!), ossobuco milanese, chicken parmigiana (even better reheated the next day!), lasagna, mushroom ravioli (my favorite), zucchini flowers, and some excellent Italian bread! (visited 12/28/20)"
5,"This is literally the best italian I&apos;ve ever had. I visited Boston last thanksgiving and this meal was one of the best parts of my trip. The ravioli porcini was my favorite, and the cacio e pepe was a close second. Even the pesto tasted fresh and authentic. The restaurant was run by Italians and served truly authentic pasta! I would love to go here again.

5,"Hats off to this restaurant, it is still my favorite Italian restaurant in the north end after trying a handful of others. The lasagna, lobster ravioli, and carbonara are 5/5 all day. The lasagna is served in a delicious orange tomatoey cream that&apos;s actually addicting, and it&apos;s my new favorite dish in the north end. Even the complimentary bread they serve is outstanding... and I&apos;m still eager to try the porcini ravioli :) 

Service was great and our food came out very quickly. Would recommend this to anyone willing to spend around the $20 mark for some really tasty, traditional Italian pasta dishes."
3,"I have mixed feelings. I went with friends when I was fresh out of college on a double date. They looked at us and asked us to read the menu before (inferring we couldnt afford it) then said &quot;we don&apos;t serve pizza&quot;. We ate there anyways out of spite (and yes it was expensive). 

I went back a few years later with parents and was treated very nicely. I even had a dish that tasted incredible (one of the best ive had in the north end). 

Restaurants need to wear their game faces at all times."
5,"Words cannot describe how amazing their lobster ravioli is. Orgasmic!
They also make amazing lasagna. 

Must try before you die."
5,Such a good spot! Lots of seating but definitely recommend making a reservation as pretty much all of the available seats filled up halfway through our meal.
5,"This is an amazing pasta spot in the North End that you can&apos;t miss!

I&apos;ve had my fair share of pasta spots in that area, but this one has to be one of my favs. The pasta dishes are a great price for the portion and quality that you get. You don&apos;t leave hungry, you leave stuffed if anything and may possibly want to take some to go because of the leftovers.

I got the classic SPAGHETTI CARBONARA and the PACCHERI AI FRUTTI DI MARE. The carbonara is one of my favorite pasta dishes, so I was really happy that they offer this dish here, and even better that it was delicious and not dry as some places can be. The chunks of pancetta was incredible and not lacking. I couldn&apos;t stop eating it!! The paccheri pasta is fun to eat with since the sauce and some small seafood bits get into the indivisible pasta pieces. For a seafood dish, this one was so reasonably priced!! 

I love the way they present their dishes too with their pans!! This place is definitely IG approved. I would definitely recommend this place to someone outside of Boston!"
5,"One of the best italian restaurants I&apos;ve been. The taste and the food is just authentic italian cusine. 
Something so simple as a lasagna just tastes perfect like made in Italy."
5,"This restaurant makes for the perfect date night or to grab dinner with a couple friends. You will need to make a reservation. I went with a party of 4 and we all loved our dishes and drinks. I highly recommend the espresso martini, they were pretty strong and after 3 we were really digging into our food. The ravioli comes with about 4-5 pieces which may look small but it was a lot of food. I loved the ravioli con Aragosta, it was creamy and rich. My friends only had good things to say about the ravioli porcini. I couldn&apos;t finish it all and had leftovers in the end. I also loved the fried calamari. I wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the charcuterie board, the cheese was good but that was about it. Overall, I highly recommend this restaurant. However, parking/driving in this area is almost impossible so plan accordingly."
5,"This place was super cozy and romantic. There are 2 areas to dine in, one is a bit louder by the entrance and you can hear the kitchen. The other is in a covered sort of patio section which is where we chose. Servers were attentive, the food was great!"
4,Absolutely delicious. Rather small venue like everything in the north end but the food is soo yummy and authentic Italian. One of the best in the north end
5,"11/10 the service was great, they sat us for our res right away and the service was great until we handed in our checks. The food was immaculate. The espresso martini was $$ but so good. They seemed to be good about cleaning the tables, etc after every party and the staff all wore masks. 
Would recommend if your in the North end for lunch or dinner. 
*If you&apos;re driving in, try using the Cooper&apos;s parking lot (cheapest parking in the area) and just walk a block to the restaurant, otherwise you won&apos;t find any street parking."
5,"We stumbled upon this place after our initial place we had in mind had a 1+ hour wait. What a pleasant surprise this turned out to be! We went around prime lunch time on a Saturday and were worried that the wait will also be long but they managed to take us in after about 15 minutes. 

We ordered the Ravioli porcini and Ravioli con Aragosta (lobster sauce with crab) and both were rich and flavorful. Both ravioli dishes came with five big raviolis and inside the pan that it was cooked. You can tell it was handmade and each dish had thoughtful work put into it. They stuff enough lobster/crab meat in the con aragosta and truffle in the porcini that you won&apos;t feel ripped off. 

Service wasn&apos;t particularly great and we never really got checked up on but since we were hungry we did finish our meal pretty fast. We were also in the downstairs area which didn&apos;t seem to have many servers helping out. But still, I think the food makes this place worthy of 5 stars."
4,"Slowly making my way through all of the restaurants in North End...

Starters: The bread tasted pretty freshly made.

Paccheri al Ragu: A super rich meat-filled ragu. The rigatoni is big and doughy, soaking in the flavor of the ragu nicely. 

Ziti alla Amatriciana: Tasted pretty average, not as impressed with this one. North End pastas have all been home runs for me, so maybe it&apos;s just harder to compete, but this pasta didn&apos;t taste special at all to me. It was good by all means, but not worth $22... you can get much better for this price.

As for service, there were a lot of waiters talking amongst themselves in the corner and not really paying attention to when we needed something."
5,"I have been wanting to go to an Italian spot in North End for ages whenever I visit Boston.

I made sure to make reservations this time around. This spot was BUSY on a Saturday night. We came a bit early and waited at the bar.

This spot had the best ravioli I&apos;ve had in my life. We got the truffle and lobster ravioli. The chicken parm also was amazing. Just the right amount of crunch and flavour. The service was excellent.

I am definitely coming back here. Highly recommend this Italian gem."
3,"Food: 3
Service: 4
Ambience: 4

Let me start by saying that we had a rather long day in Boston because it unexpectedly started to rain and we left the hotel without an umbrella...we chose a restaurant, had the Uber drop us off there and they said they were closed (it was 8:30pm), we then walked down the street to another place and they said it was an hour wait...we then went across the street to this place. Luckily, they were able to accommodate us (and our stroller despite how tight the restaurant was), but by the end of the night I wish we went somewhere else...

Zucchini Flowers 
Ravioli Porcini 
cacio e pepe 

The zucchini flowers was super bland...no flavor whatsoever. It called for some prosciutto in the ricotta and I didn&apos;t taste anything.

The ravioli was delicious. A tad bit salty, but really good.

The cacio e pepe...on the other hand. Goodness, it was awful. First of all, it is spelled wrong on the menu, so we should have known this wouldn&apos;t be traditional and it would be a hot mess. It came out and they used fettuccine...why? I don&apos;t think that kind of pasta is traditionally used, but there was absolutely no flavor. We ended up using the sauce from the ravioli and mixed it in to the fettuccine. 

I definitely wouldn&apos;t recommend this place."
4,"This is a solid find in the North End, however a bit over hyped.  Came here on a Friday night with my family who was visiting from out of town!  We were disappointed that our waiter poured us bottled water that costed money without us asking.  However, this didn&apos;t completely take away from the overall experience. 
 
We started with the Zucchini Flowers and Mom&apos;s Meatballs and Ricotta for appetizers.  Both were very good, but didn&apos;t rock our socks off.  For our main dishes, we ordered the Paccheri al Ragu, Ravioli Porcini, and the Cacio o Pepe.  The Ravioli Porcini was the hit of the night, but only order this if you are a mushroom lover.  The sauce on top was thick and seasoned amazingly.  The Cacio o Pepe was very good, however I wish they used a thinner noodle.
 
They had a good wine selection, reasonably priced. We are Italian and were a tough crowd to please! Definitely one of the better options in the North End....but if you come here, watch out for getting charged for water."
1,"This place must have gone way down hill. When you&apos;re charging $20+ a plate, the pasta should be at least decent. Cacio e Pepe was not good. Penne amatriciana tasted like cheap box pasta and the sauce was just gross. Our server also opened a bottle of still water for $8 (she didn&apos;t ask us... we wanted tap) and then argued &amp; got nasty with me when I asked her to take it off the bill. We watched her do the same thing to the table next to us &amp; she also argued with them when they asked to take it off their bill. 
Also.. there&apos;s no soap in the women&apos;s bathroom during a pandemic."
4,"We were visiting Boston for one day and it was a cold cold day and we were tired from all the walk we did on Newbury street. My friend had recommended to try italian fare on the North End and after calling several reataurants and finding out they were booked, we got lucky with Trattoria ii. I mean italian restaurants in the north end seem a dime a dozen so we were hoping this one wouldnt disappoint and IT DIDNT. We had the sweetest server who seemed pretty shy but very polite at the same time. We were served with some water and house bread (the EVO on the table to go with the bread was very fragrant and yummy), which was devoured. 
My friend ordered a glass of red and penne arabiatta whereas I went with the Ravioli stuffed with crab cooked in a reduction of a creamy tomato sauce and lobster. Oh my!! Such a lovely dish, i definetly took my time to savor my meal and took some leftovers to go. I also love that they serve the ravioli in a pan, such a cute rustic move! We ended our meal with an espresso martini and a pistachio martini, both of which were delectable!"
