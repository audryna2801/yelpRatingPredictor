5,"TLDR: that hole in the wall restaurant you want and crave 

I wish I lived closer to East Boston because I&apos;d be here all the time. Has Lengua meat options for all their tacos and burritos and other plates. I haven&apos;t had anything besides tacos and burritos here but they&apos;re delicious and more than worth the price. Place is take out only so call ahead as food will take 15 minutes at least depending on what you get."
5,"I never thought I&apos;d say this, but come here for the rice and beans!! And while you&apos;re here, walk out with the tacos too. The rice and (pureed?) beans were the best that I&apos;ve ever had and no other place can make me eat so much rice and beans. Don&apos;t get me wrong - the tacos are one of the better tacos I&apos;ve ever had as well, but the rice and beans just blew me away. 

East Boston has a LOT of taquerias and Mexican food which made it overwhelming to figure out where to start. Some places were not worth the hype whereas others didn&apos;t always have the same quality of food each time. But Taqueria Jalisco is a MUST TRY, whether you live in Eastie or not. My boyfriend and I have probably ordered takeout here 1-2x per week ever since we tried it. We practically tried every type of taco there is to offer here, including the birria tacos which were mentioned in a lot of reviews. I think birria tacos are basically fried tacos stuffed with beef but I prefer the classic authentic tacos with meat, cilantro, onions and sides of salsa verde (also SO good btw). Get the taco combination, pick your three meats and it comes with rice &amp; beans! Adobada is my favorite taco meat from here, but my boyfriend loves the beef tongue and carnitas as well for the marbling.

Service is so friendly every single time and takeout usually takes 10-15 mins from placing the order to ready for pickup.

P.S. There&apos;s a public library and a greenway with lawn chairs, picnic tables and benches just a few minutes away for a place to inhale the takeout before it gets cold!"
5,"Wow wow wow !! I can see why people rave about this amazing little place. First note is that they are not offering indoor dining during the pandemic, all the options are take out. We went in and ordered and they said about 30 minutes. It took just around that time. We started with the chips and guac. The guac was so fresh and delicious and the chips tasted homemade. I do wish the chips had a little more salt to them but that&apos;s just me. I then had a steak quesadilla. The cheese and steak combo was out of this world, especially dipped in some of the guac or sour cream. Then we also had tacos. The fish taco was so yummy! I wish they had some kind of sauce to go on it but I made do with some of the salsa they give you. I also had the chicken and the steak taco! I was soooo full after all of this yummy food. Overall it was delicious and only $40 for a ton of food for two people!"
4,"I wanted to give this place 3.5 but doesn&apos;t have half point so I round up due to service.  

Service: person taking the order was friendly and welcoming.  We ordered take out and we were asked for our number so the restaurant can call us when food is ready to avoid us running back and forth to check.  It&apos;s a small take out so I didn&apos;t expect ANY customer service so that was definitely .

Food: we ordered Birria Taco ($14 for 3), lengua taco combo and menudo soup.  I was looking forward to the Birria taco. The taco shell was crunchy, meat portion and flavor was good.  Overall, I think it was okay and not something I would go back for.  Lengua could use a little more salt and flavor.  It was really blend.  Menudo soup was so so.  Soup was blend but huge and loaded with tripe.  The tripe was well cleaned and tender.  Our order came with lots of condiments: pickle onions, chopped red onions, cilantros, salsa roja and salsa verde.  The soup came with corn tortillas.  Revised: forgot there was a bag of seasoning.  Figure out that it is for the soup.  It definitely changed the flavor of the soup. Make it more flavorful.

Overall: it&apos;s was good but I will come back if I&apos;m around the area."
4,"I was super excited to try this after I heard so many people raving about this place. The moment I walked in to pick up my order no one was in sight. I was later greeted by an older woman who was lovely, but in the kitchen there was a couple with NO mask on making out with each other with their gloves on.. I was easily disgusted after witnessing this. But I gave them a chance and kept telling myself that maybe it was the older lady who made my order rather than the couple since the lady walked out from the kitchen as soon as she heard me walk in.. 

We ordered 4 birria tacos ($14 each order- 3 tacos per order) which were only served on the weekends apparently. We also ordered a large pozole ($14) and the taco combo with chicken, grilled steak, and grilled fish ($13.50). We ordered around noon and got there within 35 minutes and our order was already ready. 

The birria tacos were delicious. Each order came with 3 tacos, onions, pickled onions, hot sauce, cilantro, slice of lime, and the birria sauce. We were all really shocked at how much sauce they gave per order. Loved the fact that each of these condiments were packaged separately. The pozole had lots of chunks of pork and hominy. It was good with lime, but the seasoning and the sodium was a tad bit low but still good. The taco combo with chicken, grilled steak, and grilled fish was super basic. It did not have too much flavor as we were expecting. Although it was nice that it came with rice and beans, we won&apos;t be ordering this taco combo again. 

Besides the kitchen scene when I went to pick up the food, Taqueria Jalisco is great. We mainly came here for the birria tacos and they were definitely well worth the 35 minute drive to East Boston and back. 

This place is pretty small with no indoor dining at the moment due to COVID. There is street parking but really limited. On the plus side, they accept cards!! They don&apos;t exactly have a set menu anywhere but on Facebook. Thanks for a delicious meal, we will be back soon."
4,"I haven&apos;t been able to find a good Mexican restaurant on the east coast until I tried Taqueria Jalisco. This reminds me of the family-owned Mexican place I&apos;d frequent back home in California.

My boyfriend ordered a steak burrito and I ordered the enchilada plate. The portions are generous for the pricing and everything was packaged extremely neatly for take-out! Plus, the lady on the phone taking our order was super friendly. I only wish they had more vegetarian options, like a veggie enchilada. But, the roja enchiladas were so good anyway!

We are adding this to our list of favorite restaurants and are lucky that it&apos;s so close to home!"
2,"Ugh I am so disappointed to write this. I went in to get birria tacos which are such a trend right now. I order over the phone and walked in to find that the people in the kitchen, cooking the food, were not wearing masks. What a disappointment. The cashier had his mask on and that was it. Also no social distancing enforced in the tiny area. I wanted this to be a positive review so very badly as we need to support our small businesses now more than ever. I also found 2 tacos with no substantial price at $15 to be quite expensive. Didn&apos;t eat them for aforementioned reasons, gave them to a coworker who was willing to take the risk and he said they were just find and kind of plain tasting. So sad as my sister loves this place and recommended it feverishly."
4,"People - 10/10
Food - 7/10
Drinks - na
Decor - 7/10
Restrooms - (didn&apos;t use)

I heard good things about this restaurant and I wanted to try it out for myself. So my friend and I went and she ordered the burrito and I ordered the chicken torta. I&apos;ve had chicken towards another places and I thought this was good but not the best. now this was just my opinion it was a delicious sandwich at the end of the day. A little small for the price in my opinion but it&apos;s nice to support local businesses. I would love to return and try something new"
4,I live in Quincy so they lose a star since it&apos;s a far drive and even when I order early to pick up I&apos;m still waiting another 20-30 minutes to get the order. Flavorful and spicy. The Best in Boston so far.
5,"Can I just say.. this place is the ONLY place I go for Birria tacos!! Tried it for the first time a couple of weeks ago and I fell in love! The meat was juicy and tasteful along with the crunchy tortilla and melted cheese, just amazing! They separate all the sides which I love cause I just put it in as I go. The consume was so flavorful! For sure my top favorite when it comes to tacos!"
5,"Found this spot on TikTok after looking for Birria tacos. Superseded my expectation for sure and the price is great for the amount of food you get. A bit of a line so I recommend ordering over the phone, but otherwise amazing!"
5,"It&apos;s not often you find a place that has AMAZING food &amp; INCREDIBLE customer service... this place has both, for sure! I came here a few weeks ago to try the birria tacos and before even eating them (to-go), the customer service literally had me smiling. I went there on a busy weekend and the gentlemen who was handling takeout was so incredibly friendly and kind. I always feel like a nuisance because that&apos;s how I&apos;m generally treated when staff is busy and overwhelmed - everyone is in a rush, and it becomes just a business. Not the case here. 

I wanted birria tacos tonight and live 25 minutes away and I certainly could&apos;ve gone to a location closer to me but this place just left such a positive impression the first time. The same guy was there, with such a warm &amp; friendly demeanor (and so are the women I spoke with each time when I placed my orders on 2 occasions) and the birria tacos are FIRE. I&apos;ll be back and I HIGHLY recommend them. Can&apos;t wait to try all the other food too!"
5,"My god, who was I before this Taqueria? 

We ordered the Birria Tacos. They were 13.99 per meal and they give three tacos, broth, onions, cilantro, hot sauce, and one last pink vegetable. We of course put all the extra ingredient in the broth and began dipping the tacos 

The tacos were so good, that none of us talked for 20 minutes. It was so savory and crunchy and had a hint of zest. Please , for the love of god, if you&apos;re going to get Birria tacos, go here !"
4,"I walked in on a saturday around 7pm and ordered carry out, the wait was 10 minutes, i was pretty impressed.  i ordered the fillet of fish, large menudo soup, and a horchata.

the filet fish was not breaded and i believe deep fried.  it was perfectly cooked, mild in flavors, and very tasty.  the rice that accompanied it was also mildly flavored and really good.  
the menudo was flavorful, slightly spicy, and it&apos;s definitely a warm comfort soup.  there were generous pieces of tripe in the soup.  
the horchata was tasty, the cinnamon hits you upfront followed by its sweetness.  it wasn&apos;t overtly sweet which is what i prefer.

there&apos;s so much more i like to try on their menu that i&apos;ll be coming back.  
the place is tiny, five wooden booths.  the parking is hard on this block as it shares its space with multiple businesses nearby."
3,"My boyfriend and I tried their birria tacos, shrimp burrito and carne con Chile en verde. The tacos were good having a nice bite to them but lacked a stronger flavor/aroma that would have helped significantly. I wasn&apos;t too crazy for the burrito as I thought it contained too much lettuce and not enough rice, especially since it didn&apos;t hold its shape that well. My boyfriend liked it though. I did enjoy my plate as the beef was very flavorful with enough sauce included. The refried beans and rice perfectly complimented the meat. I used the lettuce, tomatoes and tortillas on the side to make some refreshing tacos. I plan to come back and try more of their dishes to get a better idea as to what they offer."
5,"DINNER REVIEW

Taco bout a great find!

I came to Taqueria Jalisco on the recommendation of a friend who lives in Eastie and boy am I glad I did. I just got back from a week-long trip to Mexico and I have to say...these tacos were better than any tacos I had in Mexico.

They were full of juicy, flavorful meat (I had one chicken, one steak, and one marinated pork) and topped with cilantro and onion. The steak was my favorite but they were all good. Then you have the option of one of their three multi-colored salsa (green, brown, yellow) with varying degrees of spiciness to add to your tacos (none were too spicy for me but those who don&apos;t like spice should stick to the green). The rice and beans that came with it were also great.

I also had a pork tamale which was a good tamale but I think the tacos were still my favorite.

The place is tiny so you may have to wait a bit for a table (we waited 5 minutes only) and the service is great (the servers are so nice!). You can easily get FULL for under $20 which is great too.

I will definitely be back."
5,I heard great things about this restaurant so I drove from Quincy to go check it out and I was not disappointed. I got the Brirria taco box for the first time I am it was so delicious. I would suggest that everyone try the tacos or anything else on the menu because if the tacos were any indication you will not regret it.
5,"I have no words... I am always a full mess rolling out of there because I can&apos;t stop eating. (So i limit myself on how often I can go...)

Coming from the mid west my only complaint has been lack of good real tacos or good actual Mexican food! For me this place is as close as it can get in Boston! You got tongue tacos, you got tripa tacos, you got hígado, you got a whole fried tilapia, you got menudo(!!!!!) and just so good ! You can&apos;t go wrong ordering anything here! Love it- my place to go whenI&apos;m sad and need a pick me up."
5,"Carne asada plate: SMACKS
Chicken tacos: FIRE
Refried beans: REVOLUTIONARY
Basically every other taco: UNFORGETTABLE

This place slaps change my mind."
5,Los tacos birria son los máximo! And the carnitas tacos were to perfection. Delicious! Looking forward to the dozen pork tamales in red sauce that we stocked up on for the week!
