5,Wow wow wow wow wow !!! Really good mix of flavors! My boyfriend and I went with 3 small plates and one big plate... it was more than enough food! So many bright colors and fantastic sauces. We could have done without the mussels but the sauce and bread really proved them to be a good choice. The lobster ravioli is a MUST. Everything was so delicious and our waitress was wonderful. The outdoor seating expansion does wonders and it&apos;s so nice on a good night! They just got heat lamps today-- great purchase!
5,"I absolutely love Piattini. One of my go to places in Back Bay for Italian food. Great outdoor seating on Newbury street. Literally everything here is sooooo delicious.  I highly recommend any dish that has pesto in it, you cannot go wrong! 

Our favorite waiter is Maximo!! He is kind, helpful, hilarious and extremely personable. If you get him as your server, it will be a treat! This was our second time having him as a server and he gave us a tiramisu on the house.  10/10! 

:)"
4,"Piattini was one of my favorite finds this past year! I&apos;ve enjoyed it twice, once as takeout and once dining in at their outdoor patio. For my first order, I had the spinach gnocchi and the tiramisu. When I arrived to pick up my order, everyone was very sweet and they retrieved my tiramisu directly from the fridge so it was still cool when I got home. The pesto cream sauce in the spinach gnocchi is so delicious-rich and tasty without being too heavy or greasy. The tiramisu was perfect, a huge portion (but I still somehow managed to eat it all before getting a picture), light and flavorful but not too sweet! I loved my first experience so I decided to go back a second time and brought a friend to dine in at their patio. The tables had proper spacing safe COVID practices, and there were no physical menus, just a code to scan with your phone to pull it up! This time I got the lobster ravioli since it was mentioned really positively in a lot of the reviews. I was actually  underwhelmed by the this dish. The flavor was just okay and they were sort of lukewarm. However, the service was great and there are many other dishes I look forward to trying, so I certainly will be back!"
5,"I love this restaurant!!! My boyfriend and I walked into this hole in the wall Italian spot immediately taken by the ambiance. The cozy, low lit interior with candles sprinkled throughout made for such a romantic vibe.  

When we sat down, we were greeted by the kindest, most accommodating waiter who set the mood by joking around with us and helping us pick out our meal for the night. The food was absolutely amazing, from the complementary bread... fluffy and light, the cheese plate, the burrata ravioli and shrimp scampi... alive with richness and flavor, and the chocolate cake dessert. Had the most fun night here, and the dishes we chose were so masterfully created."
2,"The service was great but unfortunately, the gluten-free options were disappointing.

After walking around Newbury street, my boyfriend and I decided to try out Piattini after seeing they had gluten-free options for both pizza and pasta. If you&apos;re gluten-free, you know how hard it can be to find good GF Italian options! Sadly, the pizza and pasta we ordered were not great. 

The gluten-free Margarita pizza was clearly a frozen cauliflower crust, but the problem wasn&apos;t the crust, it was that the toppings kept sliding off the pizza. Every time I picked up a slice, the sauce and cheese would simply slide off the crust making it really hard to not only pick up but also enjoy the pizza. 

The gluten-free pasta Bolognese was also disappointing as the gluten-free pasta was overcooked and very chewy. The sauce was also underseasoned. 

Maybe their regular pizza and pasta is better, but when it comes to gluten-free options maybe opt for a different place."
2,"Meh. Piattini came highly recommended by several guidebooks as well as Yelp, but I was highly underwhelmed when my friend and I had a quick lunch here after wandering the area. The Newbury Street tax is really something. 

Don&apos;t get me wrong, it wasn&apos;t bad by any stretch of the imagination. We were seated promptly on the patio - sunny, warm fall day - and distancing safety precautions were all taken. Our server was friendly, and the food came out promptly. However, I found the food to be just okay and the price wasn&apos;t worth it. 

I had the shrimps scampi, which was fine - rather light on the shrimp and the flavor, especially for the $16 price tag (y&apos;all know pasta costs like $.30 per serving, right?) but it did the job. I also ordered a glass of prosecco, which was pretty middle-bottom-shelf stuff. It was also fine. The whole experience, with tax and tip, ran me $35 for a plate of okay pasta and a glass of cheap bubbly. 

Maybe I ordered the wrong thing, or should have come for dinner, or should have expected it from a Newbury Street spot.  Still, as someone who values, um, value when dining out, Piattini just wasn&apos;t worth it. Grab a sandwich somewhere and save your pennies for a real Italian meal in the North End instead."
5,"I seldom dine on newbury because I worry I&apos;m paying extra for the restaurant&apos;s rent. Went to piattini with three friends and changed my mind. The server, Murthy, was really nice and patient and constantly came over to refill water.  We ordered the two pasta in the picture. The flavor with the sauce was so good- we both liked it a lot. The brunch portion was actually perfect. Will go again."
4,"Really yummy dishes! All were very tasty but pretty overpriced in my opinion for ~ $25 vegetarian entrees. I&apos;d understand the higher price if they have meet. The gnocchi is an appetizer actually and cheaper but for a similar price, so would recommend."
4,"Still open on Newburyport for lunch and dinner. We sat outside with a propane heater and had great service and food. Glad they&apos;re still going and still kickin the mezzalune affumicate, their original signature dish with perfectly done fried eggplant, melted cheese sandwiches between with truffled tomato cream sauce. Yum."
5,"Three days later, I am still dreaming of Piattini and their black truffle ravioli! Possibly the best pasta I have had in years. My husband and I found this spot on Yelp and it is a must go to in Boston. Our server was great and disclosed to us that it was his first day - luckily we could not tell! Great spot."
5,"Spinach gnocchi is of the best I&apos;ve had in Boston and I live in the North End. Wonderful pesto sauce and perfectly cooked gnocchi. 

Highlight might have been dessert though. Beautiful presentation and even better tastes. Tried both the Flourless Chocolate Cake and the Hazelnut Gelato Torta...could not say or spell it for the life of me BUT unbelievable. Together the two were extremely filling but worth it. 

Think I preferred the Flourless Cake just a bit more. Warm, rich chocolate cake with a creamy vanilla bean gelato topping that melts into the cake. So GOOD. Will be thinking about this one for a while (:"
4,Great place. Warm accommodating staff. Owner is gracious and very friendly. The pizza is excellent and the buratta is top notch. Visit this place today for great indirect dining
5,"Service was quick, food was OUT OF THIS WORLD. We absolutely loved it- would definitely recommend."
5,"Had the best solo lunch here! 

Was traveling in Boston on business and just needed to have some alone time. It was around 2 or 3pm when I decided to stop at Piattini due to a recommendation to try the gnocchi from a vegetarian friend. I took a seat outside and was serviced very amicably and efficiently.

I ordered a cafe latte and the spinach gnocchi as per my friends recommendation. The temperature at the time was very comfortable and the comforting food added to the overall feeling of relaxation and contentment. A little bird even came to sit on my table and tried to steal an entire slice of complimentary bread! Though the bread was much too heavy for it.

That gnocchi was great. And so was the service. Will definitely be back in the warmer months to enjoy people and bird watching in their outdoor seating section."
5,"Excellent service, best tiramisu in the world, Super friendly staff! The manager is the best! Definitely coming back here for more"
4,"This is a great Italian place right in downtown Boston, specifically Back Bay area. I personally really enjoyed my experience there. The space has a nice ambiance. They can offer more intimate, personal dining experience for dates or for large parties alike. The waitresses were polite and efficient. They greeted you, asked nicely if we had any reservation, brought out the food promptly for everyone in your dining party..and take care of my requests you have.

The food is also just as good. Even for lunch, we found the portion size to be good..and with great prices, too (pasta dishes for lunch go for $11-15..not bad at all!). Everyone in our dining party enjoyed the meal. I had their lobster ravioli ($13) and thought the portion was just right. It was on a light lunch side...but definitely kept me satisfied through remaining of the day. Their other pasta dishes like angel hair or spaghetti seemed to be more filling though..so if you are hungry..you may want to go for that..or pick a pasta dish and another appetizer or two...and you will be satisfied.

I definitely want to stop by Piattini again in the future. But I will also want to make sure I RSVP ahead of going there for sure. Their space isn&apos;t too big..so if you want a nice Italian place in Back Bay...save on a potential headache and make a reservation ahead of time!"
5,"What a pleasant surprise! Came here with my husband and parents for a dinner on there visit to
Boston. Had never been prior but I will now recommend this hidden gem to all! First of all it is enormous, the waiter was incredibly attentive and quick with drinks, food was delicious  and the wine recommendations were on point. If you are looking to try a different spot in the back bay, Do it here!!!"
5,"This is my first time in Boston. I had asked the concierge where he recommended that was close by and he gave me a list of three restaurants but said that Piattini was his ultimate favorite! And I love Italian, so decided to give it a try! 

When I arrived there, it was quite crowded, so I knew it must be good. Luckily, for a Saturday night, the wait for a table of 2 was only 15 minutes! (I was expecting to have to wait longer!) 

Looking over the menu, I spotted a wine flight section and decided to try that out! I got the fruttoso rosso flight and they were all delicious!! 

For my main, I ordered the kale pesto pasta. It came with roasted red peppers and grape tomatoes. I was a bit unsure of how I would like kale pesto, but I&apos;m so glad I tried it because I LOVED it!! Would 100% order again! 

I had looked over the dessert menu and everything sounded so good, but I was too full and had to pass. 

Our waiter was amazing as well. He provided his recommendations and was very attentive to anything that we might have needed!

If you&apos;re new to Boston, or a lifer, I highly recommend trying this place out!"
4,"Very busy restaurant--came on a Friday night with reservations for 6:30, and didnt get seated until 6:50. Bread was very good and love how they had vegan and gluten free options for my two friends! I go the burrata ravioli--delicious and my friends all said it smelled so good. The cream sauce did get to be a lot and it was a heavy dish, but it was so good and I mopped up sauce and pesto with my bread too. My friends got the rigatoni, the vegan ravioli, and the bolognese--all literally licked their plates clean. Servers kept refilling waters and came promptly with cheese, pepper flakes, and whatever we had asked for!"
5,"Great Service and Nice Food.
The pizza and both pasta are great.
Thanks for the service in this situation."
