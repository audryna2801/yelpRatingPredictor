5,"This restaurant is a great, modern Italian restaurant with upscale millennial vibes. The layout of this restaurant before COVID included sleek, unique communal dining tables and a cute bar. They also currently have outdoor seating too. During COVID, their dining changed and includes those plexi glass screens between all the tables so you&apos;re definitely won&apos;t have feel like someone is sitting next to you which is great.

The food here is definitely amazing. My favorite is definitely the tagliatelle bolognese...pretty much the best bolognese I&apos;ve ever had. I&apos;m usually not a big fan of bolognese but they do it right here. Also the rabbit pasta is good but personally not my cup of tea. The sides are great too and I&apos;d recommend the asparagus. Before I turned 21 there were some nonalcoholic drinks I tried, which included this special cider with a dried apple crisp inside which was great. Now, I&apos;ve tasted the martini and a G&amp;T which were pretty good too. This place is a bit pricier but the ambiance definitely reflects that and the quality of the food does too.

Honestly, you can&apos;t go wrong with this place. It&apos;s definitely a more intimate dining experience here, would definitely recommend this place for a nice date."
5,"All the great reviews brought me here, I can honestly say it&apos;s one of the best Italian restaurants I&apos;ve experienced in Boston.

I&apos;m frequently working in Boston.  After work I had plans to get intimate with a plate of Sportello Strozzapreti rabbit pasta. At the last minute someone asked if they could tag onto my reservation? Normally, I&apos;m a happy guy but the last thing I want is to hear is: Dude, did you really order pasta with rabbit? It&apos;s a rustic Italian dish and I&apos;m in no mood to explain the entree. 

We show up with my modified reservation and we&apos;re taken thru a crazy maze to our table. This is the way of COVID so the path of least resistance it is. We&apos;re seated in a rather large space, some of the tables have been removed for distancing. I was going to order a glass of wine but I decided with a cocktail, The Bee&apos;s Knees. Made with my favorite gin, Bar Hill and stirred with honey and lemon. This was a fantastic drink to get the dining party started.

My buddy orders the lasagna, a safe choice I thought and I simply say Strozzapreti please. I&apos;m asked, what&apos;s that? I answer, in Italian it means to hug a priest. I&apos;m not sure if this southern gentleman would understand the strangled priest connotation...

Our pastas come out quickly. The lasagna is served in a round bowl. He mentioned he&apos;s never had a round lasagna before. I&apos;m thinking, if you cut it into a triangle it&apos;s still lasagna?? My dish comes to me. The first thing I notice it&apos;s not in a buttery, creamy sauce. In NYC, the trend is to make Italian dishes with more cream, more French if you will. Chef Barbara Lynch understands this silly trend and created a more proper rustic Italian dish. The rabbit is more pronounced and the fresh pasta is cooked perfectly. This is a well executed, chef&apos;d up Italian entree.

We finished up and I ask for an espresso. Our waitress tell me the cannoli is better that something you&apos;d wait on line for at the north end. Betta?? Ok, I&apos;ll have a pistachio cannoli please. Southern guy? I never had one so please bring both. A Boston cannoli is different from NYC (Ease up sparky, I never said better) from what I&apos;m used to. The cannoli cream to me is smoother, it has a more velvet texture on my palate. Chef Barbara Lynch, I think you knocked Italian desserts out of the park! What was offered was a nicely sized cannoli. The southern guy? He licked the lasagna plate clean and now he&apos;s two fisting the cannoli? I&apos;m sure he gives two thumbs up as well.

It was a pleasure to dine at Sportello during my stay in Boston."
5,"This meal was so great I almost pasta-way! Perfect restaurant for a Friday night date. I would describe the scene as a modern upscale casual joint. Gin martini and Bees Knees were great cocktails - small glasses but they pack a big punch of flavor! The pasta is to die for and I do not think you can go wrong. Unfortunately, my date did not let me try the braised rabbit dish (big bugs bunny fan). 

Here is a secret, but promise not to tell anyone.. go downstairs to Drink and put your name on the reservation list about 30 minutes before your meal concludes. Drink is a chic bar dishing out custom cocktails. 

CP Pro Tip: make Sportello and Drink a priority ASAP

CHEERS!"
4,"We came here for truffle week, but our favorite turned out to be one of the appetizers. I highly recommend the tomato tart; the flavors and texture blended very well. We also got the burratini to start, which was not as good. The pear was very overpowering and was almost all I could taste. 

Our mains were the white truffle cacio e pepe with their recommended wine pairing (a 2017 Loreto, which was as very strong for me). The pasta didn&apos;t really stand out to me either. It was good, but it tastes very similar to how other Italian restaurants in Boston prepare this dish. It just didn&apos;t really stand out to me (not better or worse) than when I had this dish last white truffle season elsewhere. I think I would try other restaurants in the area before coming back. The food is delicious, but nothing stands out to me enough to be coming here all the time."
5,"Intimate | Bright | Half-Chicken

INTIMATE: The Resturant is small. It has about 15 tables ranging from 2-4 people with a &quot;bar seating&quot; set up. There is no music in the Resturant so it&apos;s the ideal spot to have conversation. While the restaurant is small, it isn&apos;t noisy. 

BRIGHT: The entire restaurant has white table tops and the walls are painted white which really elevated the overall happy vibe people exude while they are in the Resturant. From Watching HGTV, I know the extra space perceived in a white kitchen as well as how much more calm and soothing a white kitchen is. 

HALF-CHICKEN: I had the half chicken which was really well done. It had a light crisp exterior and a very juicy interior. It came with fingerling potatoes and greens. Overall the dish was very filling and I would get it again. At the same time, if you aren&apos;t &quot;that hungry&quot; look at another plate unless you want lunch for the next day. 

Pro tip: definitely make a reservation between 6-8:30pm. This is a popular spot. 

Pro tip: grab a drink downstairs at their sister bar &quot;drink&quot; to either start or end your night."
5,"Very good Italian spot in Seaport. A little small inside, however, the U shaped bar is great if it&apos;s a party of two or less. It&apos;s an interesting vibe inside, feels pretty casual as the interior is plain white everywhere, however the professionalism of the staff and smartly dressed diners suggest otherwise. I would call it smart casual.

The pasta here is the main event. My friend and I tried a variety of dishes, and each one was good because of the pasta quality. Don&apos;t get me wrong - the bolognese, rabbit, &amp; lobster were all fantastic - but the pasta really shines through. Great texture to match whatever it is you&apos;re eating &amp; has great flavor. That&apos;s really all I can say in words to describe it. Price is up there given how small the portions are, but if you&apos;re looking on Yelp for a place in Seaport I&apos;m sure you can handle it."
3,"We made reservation here last Friday to celebrate my friend&apos;s birthday. The restaurant was a bit more &apos;casual&apos; then I expected. When we first walked in the restaurant, it was really warm inside. It was about 90 degrees outside. For some reason the AC did not work very well in the restaurant! The service was also very slow, not sure if it&apos;s typically like this or just bad luck. Also, they really need to change their bar chairs!! It is seriously so uncomfortable!!! It&apos;s a very social restaurant, but sitting on those chairs for more than 30mins is terrible!

However, the food was VERY DELICIOUS! Especially, the pastas. We ended up each getting the pre-fix meal."
4,"In early December, I dinned with friends and former coworkers at Sportello in Boston. I had eaten here multiple times previously when I worked just down the street, but now that I had been out of the city for a year, I thought a visit to an old friend was worth it.  And as a result, a Yelp! Review.  

The staff is always accommodating and knowledgeable about the menu.  From recommending wine to offering opinions on their favorite dishes, it is refreshing to hear the staff take a stance vs. feeling like they have never tried anything on the menu before.  

For pasta which is made in house every day, you can&apos;t go wrong.  The gnocchi were thoroughly enjoyed with infused lobster and the tagliatelle with bolognese meat sauce was probably the best tasting at our table.  The squash risotto was tender with hints of brown butter and parmigiana.  Meanwhile the pork chop was also juicy and cooked to perfection.  

We didn&apos;t save room for desserts, but we were certainly tempted by the cannoli and coconut cake offerings.  

I missed you old friend, and am already looking forward to my next visit.  I recommend Sportello when you are in the Financial or Seaport districts of Boston."
3,"My boyfriend and I had received many recommendations for this restaurant so we finally got around to trying it. We had a reservation at 8:30pm and were sat at the swanky bar. The atmosphere was very chic but a quiet and a little stuffy for my taste. The menu is a bit confusing, it includes a &quot;let us cook for you&quot; section and a la carte but it&apos;s not clear what this means. We figured our waitress would explain this to us but instead after having to flag down a different waitress to order drinks and then once our original waitress approached us again she pressured us to order right away and seemed annoyed when we kind of fumbled around the menu. We ended up ordering the Tagliatelle, duck and side of Broccolini. Each was very good but in truth way too expensive for what it was. It was fun to try because it&apos;s been considered a hot spot for about a year but I won&apos;t be returning."
5,"Great customer service and fab food!
I ordered online, and picked up at Sportello. One of the items I ordered had been discontinued, but Mike and Katie went above and beyond in resolving the issue. And the bolognese and the fresh made tagliatelle were delicious and a hit with my husband and my four and nine year old boys alike. Thank you for being there, and keep up the great work! :)"
5,"Best pasta I&apos;ve had to date! 

I got the potato gnocchi and it was heavenly. The gnocchi just melts perfectly into your mouth. It was an exquisite blend of flavors with truffle infusion, mushrooms, peas, and lobster. Highly recommend! 

The food came out incredibly quick and I was surprised to be able to be seated immediately despite my entire party not showing up yet. 

Got the melon and vanilla ice cream with espresso poured over it for dessert. I would skip just because it was two scoops with ice cream with an espresso shot layered over it for $10, cost benefit analysis does not add up."
4,"I&apos;ve been wanting to try Sportello for a long time (I&apos;ve tried and liked almost all of the Barbara Lynch restaurants in Boston). I finally went on a Friday night a couple of weeks ago with a party of 4 people and was able to try a good variety of dishes in one visit!

The restaurant has primary counter seats, but since we made a reservation in advance, we were seated at a table by the window.

I really liked both of the appetizers we ordered - roasted cauliflower with pine nuts (light and refreshing) and spicy tomato soup (fresh and flavorful). 

We tried 4 different pastas - my favorite was definitely the Strozzapreti with rabbit. The freshly made pasta had a very nice chew to it and the sauce was savory and creamy. 

I also really liked the Lobster Gnnochi, but was not overly impressed by the Tagliatelle Bolognese and Clam Bigoli (still good, but not special).

I was positively surprised by the side veggies we ordered - the carrots were mini purple carrots that were slightly charred and caramelized; the broccolinis were topped with a very flavorful spicy garlic sauce. 

Overall good experience, I do think the prices are pretty high for pastas ($25-$30), hence taking 1 star off!"
5,"One of my culinary treats every time I have the luxury of visiting Boston. For me this is elevated comfort food Italian Style.

The combination of salad, soup, pasta and dessert is so well executed that the lunch experience is therapeutic. Of course a splash of red along the way does help.

The vibe here is relaxing yet very professional and I have never been disappointed, either lunch or dinner the experience is the same, great."
5,"Made from scratch, made to order divine pasta dishes. While the menu is limited as is the seating, both factors contributed to the very special experience. I love the diner environment and of course seeing the magic at work in the open kitchen. A true foodie&apos;s dream. I tried a prosecco on the menu that was the best I&apos;ve ever had. Took a picture of the label and tried to buy it in a wine store but it&apos;s only available at restaurants."
5,"On a Saturday night this place was packed. My date and I came in around 7 and was sat right away at the counter. It was a cozy experience since we got to sit next to each other. 

We got the tagliatelle bolognese since it&apos;s their signature and the strozzapreti rabbjt pasta. As a starter we got the blistered shishitos, which were tasty and fun to eat since shishitos are either really spicy or really bland. 

The pastas had a nice bite and the sauces were both divine. Hearty and flavorful! 

The highlight was getting drinks at DRINK after, we gave our names to the hostess and after dinner we were led down a secret back entrance of Sportello leading directly to DRINK where two places were set for us. 

Great service, food and drinks here :)"
5,"I&apos;m so happy to have finally found a good Italian place in Boston. It&apos;s in a really cool area so I&apos;d recommend walking their to eat and then strolling along the waterfront afterwards. 

They slice all the meats to order, the bread is obviously homemade and constitutes a meal all by itself, the pasta is also homemade, they serve actual ginger ale (I could get in a soapbox for this but I&apos;ll refrain in the interest of keeping this review short), the cannolis are creamy but not too sweet, and I would literally drink the olive oil straight. 

The staff are friendly, the place is clean, they accept reservations and are open most of the day. 

I recommend the following:
-Their braised rabbit pasta (which is fantastic but will make you thirsty)
-the tagliatelle 
-the fresh meat
-the spicy tomato soup (which really isn&apos;t too spicy)"
5,It&apos;s a spacious place with friendly staffs. Walk up stairs and you will come aCross the host who will seat you. I like how they haVe coat hanging right at the entrance. The service was fast and great. We were  just rreally hungry and just grabbed dinner. The food was good. Thank you and will definitely come again.
4,"Perfect place for date night! The ambiance was well lit but also romantic &amp; the staff was very attentive. I also love the way the restaurant is set up with counters surrounding the kitchen. Also, there&apos;s a bar downstairs that&apos;s amazing! You can tell them you want to head down after the meal ahead of time &amp; they&apos;ll save a spot for you so you won&apos;t have to wait! Lovely food &amp; will definitely try to come back if &amp; when I visit Boston! *Make a reservation!

Baby Artichoke with Calabrian Chili, Lemon, and Olive Oil
Okay, I love artichokes. So this was such a great side for me even though it was super small. But the chili &amp; lemon gave it the perfect amount of spice &amp; acidity. 

Crostini with Beef Eye Round, Pickled Red Onion, Roasted Red Grapes, and Celery
Very crisp! The pickled onions &amp; grapes paired well with the beef eye round, but also so small :(

Heirloom Tomato Salad with Burrata, Pistachio Pesto, and Arugula
Wanted some greens &amp; can never say no to burrata, especially this one!  It was whipped so beautifully &amp; was lovely with all the veggies &amp; sauces. 

Grilled Pork Belly Wrapped with Blanched Scallions with Pistachio Purree and Marinated Plums
Saw this on the menu &amp; was like, must get. It was a bit oily, but the pork belly was grilled so incredibly &amp; the purree was sooo good. 

Potato Gnocchi with Lobster, Mushroom Ragu, and Peas
I tend to not like gnocchi because it&apos;s pretty thick/dense &amp; sometimes I feel like the flavors are lost. But this dish...this sauce...was fire. Couldn&apos;t get enough of it &amp; definitely would&apos;ve licked my plate if that wasn&apos;t so barbaric. 

Strozzapreti with Braised Rabbit, Picholine Olives, and Rosemary
This dish was pretty good, but I would much prefer the gnocchi just cause that dish had such powerful flavors. For this plate, I still liked the sauce, but I don&apos;t think it was enough~ but the rabbit was delicious! 

Frozen Flavors - Vanilla Gelato, Cherry Sorbetti, Blood Orange Sherbet
So simple, yet so perfect to clean the palette &amp; end the meal!"
3,Not great for vegetarians. Bland and few options. My friends who had meat seemed satisfied with their meal.
3,"With a 6PM reservation on a lively Friday, we were promptly seated to our table by the window.  

The decor is decidedly minimalist, but tasteful.  The open dining room quickly became noisy as the night went on.  The tables are placed rather tightly next to each other.

We started out with five appetizers.  I thought the fava bean purée was heavenly.  The crostini was delicious and there was enough to share amongst three hungry adults.

For main entrees, I chose the Strozzapreti, because how often can I get rabbit meat?  The sauce was very flavorful, presumably from cooking the rabbit meat which was tender and tasty.  The pasta was hearty and chewy which seemed to offer a conflicting texture from the rest of the dish.  This texture is the exact opposite of the lobster Gnocchi dish where the gnocchi seemed quite overcooked.  In fact, the gnocchi was mushy and lacked the firmness I&apos;ve come to appreciate in gnocchi.  

The third person in our party ordered the sirloin which was beautifully cooked medium-rare and came with wonderfully toasted artichokes.  It is by far the most scrumptious way to prepare artichokes that I have ever tasted.  

Given this is an Italian restaurant by the renowned Barbara Lynch, the stark contrast in texture of the two pasta dishes threw me off.  I wondered if the extreme firmness of the Strozzapreti vs. the softness of the gnocchi was intentional, but it surprised me in a not so pleasant way."
