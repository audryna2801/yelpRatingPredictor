5,"I&apos;m a little late writing this review - sorry Salty Pig! We visited before the pandemic started and OH BUDDY it was great. Love this place. Cozy and casual vibe with top notch food. The charcuterie boards were high quality and the servers were excellent in helping us make some very yummy selections. Definitely busy around the bar area but that was okay! We had a drink while we waited for our seats! Service was fast and friendly. Thank you for a wonderful evening, Salty Pig. We will be back for sure!!"
5,"Love,love their pizza!  Even during the pandemic they served the best pizza. I hope they open soon as I do miss their ambience."
5,"Didn&apos;t expect it but, The Salty Pig was truly excellent. It&apos;s kinda the perfect location. The crew was really friendly and service is awesome. These guys have a miraculous menu as well. I enjoyed everything at The Salty Pig."
5,"Came here for an early dinner on a weekend night. We made a reservation in case, but the restaurant was around half full and we were seated immediately. I brought my date here because I&apos;d been here several years ago and remembered how good the boards were. The last time I was here they had bone marrow but the waiter told us that they had unfortunately taken it off the menu. We decided on pork sausage, lamb pate, and chicken liver terrine for our meats, with camambrie, four fat cheese, and goat gouda for our cheeses, as well as shallot jam. 

Both of us really enjoyed the board and the atmosphere was good - our favorites were the lamb pate, chicken liver, and camambrie. The pork sausage was listed as being spiced with ginger and nutmeg but wasn&apos;t as interesting or unique as we had hoped - it tasted fine but felt just okay and was unexciting compared to the other meats. The sweet shallot jam and pickles pair really well with the salty meats and cheeses, and the waiter promptly brought us more bread upon request once we&apos;d run out. 

Between the two of us we were able to finish around half the board - we didn&apos;t have the biggest appetites before dinner - and the waiter boxed up our leftovers in a pizza box. It feels odd to not finish a charcuterie board, but everything was so rich and savory that we filled up! He even put the shallot jam and mustard in condiment containers so they didn&apos;t mix with everything else. Overall the service was prompt and friendly - he politely pointed out the cheese upon request when we were confused about the camambrie and four fat fowl. 

In the future I&apos;ll definitely be back again! This is a great way to taste local meats and cheese and both feel fancy and get a little messy with your hands."
4,"We came in late Friday night @ around 11:30 and got a pizza before the kitchen closed. 

Our server was awesome, he was patient and offered an excellent suggestion. 

We went with the Alice Bocca.  Homemade pork sausage, broccoli rabe, montasio cheese with a cauliflower cream sauce. It was very tasty. 

Our waiter recommended it since we had a tomato allergy in our group. 

We were worried about the cauliflower cream sauce, because we&apos;re not really &quot;those people&quot; but you couldn&apos;t taste straight cauliflower at all and it was very flavorful. The homemade sausage was very good as well. 

We want to come back in again sometime, to order off the full menu. Because of how late we got there, we only got to order off the late night menu so some items weren&apos;t available. 

Their charcuterie looked awesome but we really just wanted a quick bite before heading back to the hotel and this hit the spot. The pizzas are closer to personal sized in my opinion. We split one but I could have easily finished one on my own if I were really hungry."
5,"If you want to to dine here at dinner time, I highly encourage everyone to take advantage of their reservations! Removes the long wait time and guarantees a meal worth coming back for! 

I love their build your own board option! I had two different experiences here with this though. One time they gave us a small stack of prosciutto. The second time, they gave us a lot. Not sure why, but I love the options! 

The must try here is the Salty Pig pizza with x1 egg. Something about a sunny side up egg with salty meats, bitter arugula, and finished off with a sweet dressing that makes this pizza worth it."
4,"We chose this restaurant because it was a quick walk from our hotel. 

We went on a Friday night and it was packed. Luckily it was just me and my hubby, so we were seated quickly. 

This is definitely the place to be if you&apos;re into charcuterie...which I&apos;m a BIG fan. But, I was feeling like pasta. Hubby got, meatballs, sausage and Margherita pizza. 

All was good. My spaghetti had jalapeños and was in a curry sauce which was different, but in a good way. 

Service was quick and friendly."
5,"The Salty Pig rocked it!

I stopped by for dinner early and was able to snag a high top close to the bar.

Before I drove to the spot, I called the restaurant and asked about parking validation. Not a problem I&apos;m told, we got you covered! Well boom goes the dynamite, I&apos;m there. 

Reading on Yelp I&apos;m seeing stone-grilled pizzas and hand made pastas on the menu? The pictures look krazy! (Always trust reviews with pictures, otherwise it&apos;s a stalker or competitor trashing the place) It might be a lot of food for lil ol me, let me see how it plays out.

My waitress comes over and we start a playful banter. I order a drink and the Salty Pig pizza. I see the open kitchen in front of me, everyone is working hard and cranking out meals. 

The pizza comes to me, wowza! Fresh Italian meats, err pig parts, this is a quality pizza. I can&apos;t finish it all so I had it boxed up. 

My waitress comes back, finished?? Nah, lemme me have a cocktail and the homemade spaghetti with Maine Lobster, Jalapeño, Nori, Yellow Tomatoes and topped with Thai Basil?? This dish was insane! Holy Moley. Soo good. If I lived here, I&apos;d be here once a week. 

Now I pull out my parking pass. The manager validates the ticket, I tip well and I&apos;m on my way. I give the ticket to the attendant and he says $10. What? Look on the other side, it&apos;s validated. He says no, $10 bucks cash. Now I&apos;m pissed, I&apos;m not giving you cash! He says, I&apos;m calling the cops. I beg him to call the cops. I call the restaurant and speak to the manager. I tell her garage won&apos;t validate?? She said, sorry sir. We validate $12 dollars. They&apos;re asking for $10?? She was all flustered but came to the garage and paid the man. 

Now that is some damn good customer service! 
10 yelp stars because the manager is a rock star."
4,"Walked to the Salty Pig since it was close by to where I was staying, it&apos;s a cute place got a table without any reservations.  Atmosphere was fun, great music and lights were dimmed. Great place for a date night. 

Drinks: I had ordered the Ginger cider beer, it was good. Def would order it again. 

Entree: Ordered the Leoncavallo pizza-
Italian Sausage, Grilled Fennel, Red Onion, Cherry Peppers, Caciocavallo Cheese.  Cooked in a brick oven- it was delicious. 

House made Pasta: Ordered the Cappelletti di Zucca (small plate)  -Butternut Squash Filled Ravioli, Almonds, Brown Butter, Sage. It was fulfilling-not your average ravioli. 

Place is great, but the menu doesn&apos;t have variety. If you&apos;re looking to eat brick oven pizza I would recommend this place :)"
4,"Stopped by for dinner with a friend on Thursday and was able get a seat right away (6pm) without a reservation. 

Ordered a charcuterie board with prosciutto, game bird pate, Four Fat Fowl St. Stephen, and manchego  and it was fantastic. Will definitely go back for the Four Fat Fowl St. Stephen for sure. 

We also ordered the Margherita Pizza which was disappointing. Just wasn&apos;t that special. 

Will be back for the charcuterie board!!"
5,"Highly recommend this place when in back bay. 
Their meat and cheese plates are incredible. Last time I got chicken liver, duck pashtet, chorizo with cream cheese and onion jam. Everything tasted incredible. Plate came with hot bread. Pickles and mustard. Their pizza is a must try too. This time I got all meat pizza with different parts of pig and some greens on top. I with my stomach was bigger, so I can eat more things here. 
The service is welcoming and attentive. We didn&apos;t have to wait for our seats and a server almost immediately got our drink order. 
The atmosphere was nice too. It has some rusty industrial looking vibe inside. It&apos;s not quite but not too loud too. Perfect for a date night or after work beer and meat."
4,"The place was great, had a great environment. The menu is a bit complicated. We ordered pizza and ravioli. Just an FYI ravioli cheese had a very rich taste."
5,"Delicious. I sat at the bar for dinner and ordered sunchokes as an appetizer which were really good. I&apos;d never had sun chokes before but they were plentiful, cooked really well (soft, but firm, and so flavorful). The salty pig pizza was a party in my mouth. Amazing sweet and salty bits of something like four different cuts of meat, topped with sharp baby arugula for a nice contrast. The service at the bar was really great as well. Will be back to try other pies!"
5,"They definitely live up to their namesake-- I had the Salty Pig pizza, and it was absolutely my ideal kind of pizza. It was filled to the brim with a generous variety of meaty toppings, and when paired with arugula... Well, let&apos;s just say this pizza was crafted for me. There was a literal perfect amount of the Pale Ale Caramel on top that gave the pizza a hint of sweetness without being overpowering. 

I really wish it was more than just me dining here, since if I were with a second person it would have been perfect to share a charcuterie board plus the pizza I had. I barely made it through the pizza by myself, and honestly forced myself to finish it because I couldn&apos;t stand to waste it and have no way of taking and storing leftovers in my hotel room.

My server, Carlos, was also ridiculously attentive for me just being a single diner all by my lonesome. I swear he knew my water glass was empty before I did, and he was always around to refill it (despite it being unnecessary and unexpected, it was greatly appreciated).

When they drop off your check they drop it off in a tiny notebook filled with past visitors&apos; signatures and notes and drawings. I&apos;ve never seen that before, and it was a nice touch and ending to the meal."
5,"Good god, y&apos;all. The Salty Pig got me shook to my core. I am forever changed by this place. All places should aspire to this level of sheer quality, presentation, and delectability. 

We split a plate and a pizza and it was plenty (and then some) for two people. Their cocktails are interesting and fun and not too expensive. The Minute to Win It was one fizzy and sparkly ride.

First off: the plate. We ordered prosciutto, chicken liver terrine, the La Tur cheese, and the smoked shallot marmalade. If you had to choose one thing from this list that I 100% would die for and think you&apos;d be remiss not to order, it would be the marmalade. It&apos;s sweet, smoky, a little sticky, and a perfect spread for the buttery buttery bread that comes with it. The cheese was fantastically soft and creamy and the prosciutto was PERFECTION. I&apos;ve often had prosciutto that is way too salty and this was not the case at all. The chicken liver terrine was exceedingly soft and sweet. 

We also ordered the leoncavallo pizza. The spicy Italian sausage definitely has a kick to it for sure and it has a nice blend of sauce and ingredients to keep your taste buds stimulated. 

The service was friendly and helpful (I always appreciate a place that asks about food allergies upfront even if it&apos;s not a big deal for the customer! Very considerate) and the space is nice and airy. All in all, definitely a spot to revisit again and again."
4,"DINNER REVIEW

I&apos;ve walked past the Salty Pig hundreds of times on the way to/from my gym and had good things but never found a reason to stop in. I&apos;m not much of a pizza person and I don&apos;t crave charcuterie boards and those two things constitute the majority of the menu. However, with my pizza-loving father in town and limited time, we wanted something close and the Salty Pig fit the bill.

We went early enough on a Thursday (6:30 PM) to grab a table outside. Contrary to most people who come here, we did not get a charcuterie board so if you want to learn more about that, read another review. I did like how you could customize it any way you want in terms of meats, cheeses, nuts, spreads etc. I would definitely come back another time for that.

SERVICE: I often don&apos;t comment on service but the service here was very attentive.

FOOD: We started with the chopped salad with an amazing honey-lemon vinaigrette and then we ordered the Leoncavallo which had spicy Italian sausage and grilled fennel with big pieces of parmesan. The salad was good, not great (nothing to write home about) but my pizza fan of a dad rated the pizza well and I would agree. The crust was crispy and the toppings were fresh.

I will definitely be back to the Salty Pig for a charcuterie board and more pizza!"
5,"Such a great experience at The Salty Pig. From the moment you walk in, you are greeted by the visual of food being prepped. To the left of the door they were making pizza dough, and deeper in that area is the full kitchen as well as a station where they make the cheese/charcuterie boards, all open and visible from the restaurant. Further in to the right of the door is more prep work being done, such as chopping tomatoes. This open kitchen really adds a lot to the ambiance! 
We came about 30 minutes early for our reservation, and found two seats at the bar. We ended up talking with the bartender and ordered a bottle of wine, and eventually decided to stay at the bar and forego our reserved table. 
One of their specialties is the build your own charcuterie/cheese plate, which we of course did. We opted for the Four Fat Fowl, a triple cream cheese, and the Mad River Blue cheese. Both were so delicious, served with toasted bread, mustard, and and pickles. You can add other add-ons as well such as jam or almonds, but the mustard and pickles were so delicious we didn&apos;t need anything else. 
Next, we had the fried Brussels sprouts, served in a squash sauce with hazelnuts and feta. We personally could have done without the hazelnuts, but the dish was delicious nonetheless. 
Finally, we ordered the salty pig pizza. While it sounds good on the menu, we were swayed when the couple next to us received this pizza and it looked so incredible. It is topped with &quot;salty pig parts&quot; (prosciutto, pepperoni, and sausage), mustard, pale ale caramel, and arugula. We were unsure about the caramel when we read the description, but it was subtle and added a very pleasant sweet note that was a delicious complement to all of the meat. 
I will definitely return to the salty pig, likely for a cheese plate and a pizza as both were really fantastic."
5,"I love this place, but be prepared it&apos;s basically always packed, so be ready to wait (or make a reservation).

The charcuterie board is amazing. I love their pickles and mustard. You can never go wrong here.

Pizza is great. I found the Salty Pig pizza to be a little too salty for my taste, but I can&apos;t be that surprised seeing that it&apos;s called salty pig. 

Definitely go here in the fall/winter months when they bring out the bone marrow with escargot. THIS is why I first fell in love with this place. If you are trying to impress someone, this appetizer is great because you get to try bone marrow and escargot at the same time and it tastes great."
4,Really good meats! The oxtail pasta was very tasty but the portions were small. This is definitely a place for  charcuterie boards.
5,"On the first night of our anniversary weekend in Boston, a Friday, my wife and I decided to try out The Salty Pig.  It was close to where we were staying in Back Bay, and it had really good reviews.  We&apos;re both pizza fans, so it sounded great to us.  When we arrived, the place was packed, but we were told that the wait for an outside table would be 20 to 30 minute.  We grabbed a drink at the bar and waited.  They had a very nice assortment of wines, so I ordered a glass of Albariño, me of my favorites from Spain.

When we got to our table, the server was with us in no time.  In fact, the service the entire night was quick and efficient.  We ordered duck pate, which came wrapped in bacon and with bread and mustard to accompany.  It was delicious.  Then we had a leoncavallo pizza.  It was just the right size for the two of us.  Despite the initial shock of its spiciness, it was, in fact, a very good pizza.  We didn&apos;t order dessert or salad because we were stuffed after eating the pizza.

The atmosphere at the restaurant is casual and relaxing, and the outside seating was great for an evening in the upper 60s.  And, as I pointed out before, the service was excellent.  I would recommend this place wholeheartedly"
