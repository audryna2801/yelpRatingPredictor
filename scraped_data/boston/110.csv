5,"Didn&apos;t expect it but, The Gallows was truly incredible. The ambience is lovely. The people working there are always so pleasant. Every thing that I have already tried has been rather tasty. A nice place to go and chill with friends."
5,"This is such an ecclectic space - there&apos;s ravens and an edger allan poe poem on the wall, hand lights over the bar, and a huge ouijie board on the wall. The music is very nostalgic for the millenials too! It was a great experience. The service is excellent and the brunch was great too!

The fried chicken with the chicken and pancakes was sooo good - the pancakes were kind of dry ane not amazing but still good. The flavored butter on top really tied everything together. The poutine with the egg was interesting  and the fries were yum but I wish it was real cheese curds like I&apos;m used to in Canada. I had never tried a scotch egg before so that was cool - wish there was more pork as it was good. Can&apos;t wait to come back for dinner!"
5,"The Gallows has the best burger I&apos;ve had in Boston so far. And this is coming from someone who loves her burgs! I came in last night with friends for dinner. We didn&apos;t get cocktails so I can&apos;t speak to  those, but we did get fried pickles as an appetizer. The pickles were a nice start. I think they could have used a little something more in the seasoning but the homemade ranch was great! They use fresh herbs in what seems mostly sour cream. Very fresh tasting! 

For my meal I got the pub burger and upgraded my fries to poutine. When ordering our waitress did not ask how we would like the burgers cooked, but to my delight it came out perfect! Still a little pink in the middle and not dry at all. If you like your meat well done, you should specify, but also rethink your life choices. The bacon pub cheese that comes on top was so delicious too. The poutine made me a very happy girl as well. I finished my entire plate! Now if you are looking for traditional poutine this isn&apos;t it. Instead of those squeaky cheese curds, they use soft fluffy ones, the stuff that you can make cheese out of. Someone called it feta in their review.. it absolutely ain&apos;t feta. I personally do not like those little squeakers, but I would understand being disappointed if you do. 

Excellent food, really fun, spooky, but still classy decor!"
4,"Craving burgers so came back for food at the bar. Entertaining bartender and crowd with great music playing. The BK lounge was delicious (a juicy burger with special sauce, thin crisp raw onion, iceberg lettuce was SO GOOD). Truffle parm fries taste as good as they smell. The queso fundido was a little more oily than creamy, probably from the chorizo, but flavorful and a good portion. We love this funky bar / restaurant"
4,"This spot is way less morbid than its name would suggest. It&apos;s well-lit, friendly, and warm... though there is a gigantic Ouija board and an armless and legless bust as decoration.

We came for Saturday brunch, during which we enjoyed the half serving of simple poutine, French toast, and chicken and pancakes. The poutine overall was great, though the &quot;cheese curds&quot; were definitely not curd-like. The flavors were delicious though so I&apos;m not too fazed. I did not partake in the French toast though it looked exquisite. The chicken and pancakes were great - I thought the chicken could have been a bit more seasoned underneath, but the pepper butter was INCREDIBLE and the pancakes were so goddamn soft. 

The waitstaff were so friendly, too! Definitely a winner for brunch."
4,"The good:  Service was great, BK burger and fires were delicious, the atmosphere is laid back and decent craft beer selection. 

The bad:  burger was $15. That&apos;s a bit steep."
4,"The Gallows is the perfect place for a hangover brunch as most of the food here is fried, fatty and absolutely delicious! I came here with a group of 3 at noon on a holiday and the place was about 3/4 full. The place itself has a rustic bar/kitchen type of feel and the service was great. 

In terms of food, we started by splitting the sunrise poutine which was super yummy! I ordered the breakfast tacos, which were pretty good as well but not as good as the poutine. I also tried blackbird breakfast sandwich, which was delicious but also very heavy. The portion sizes here are massive and all our entrees came with a TON of potatoes - we barely scratched the surface! The prices are very good for how much food you get.

Overall, I recommend the Gallows for brunch! The food is delicious and filling and the portions are generous so definitely come hungry!"
3,"I would give five stars for the interior and decorations. I loved all of it, especially the giant ouija board on the wall. Not sure how keen I was to have Mike Tyson&apos;s mug shot staring down at me as I used the restroom but I liked the idea. I got a very other worldly, haunted vibe from the building. I bet there&apos;s a lot of history there.

Our waitress was very nice too. Explained the menu and always came to check on us even though it seemed like she was serving all of the tables.

The drink menu is unique. They were out of the passion fruit beer that my dining companion wanted but he was pretty pleased with the Farm Ale that replaced it. I tried a cocktail called Elder Wand and featured elder flower liquor but really didn&apos;t like it. Tasted like medicine.

For food, I went with the Our Way Burger. Cooked nicely and I enjoyed the toppings, especially the pickles. I didn&apos;t like the cheese fries. In fact, we didn&apos;t like his side of poutine fries either (more on that in a minute). The cheese was overcooked and just a hard blob in the middle of the fries which also tasted way overcooked and not fresh at all. We first ordered the Scottish Egg and really liked that. Very unique item. Small for the price though but very tasty! My partner got the Falafel Burger. No complaints on the burger, very nice. The poutine as a side, however, shouldn&apos;t be called poutine. The key to poutine is to use cheese curds. This had feta chunks. Yes, feta. That&apos;s not poutine. The gravy was also wrong and not the traditional brown gravy that should go with poutine but a very thick, creamy gravy that had virtually no taste. I&apos;d go with a 4 if rating the burgers but both fries were no good. Overcooked in both dishes and the poutine was 100% wrong. This restaurant comes up a lot when you search for poutine in the Boston area and I would hate someone to go expecting traditional poutine and get what we were served with feta (again, wth?) and the wrong gravy.

I&apos;d go back as I really loved the building and the burger was good but I&apos;d stay away from ordering fries in any form with my meal."
3,"I really wanted to like this place, but it fell a little short for me. Nothing was bad enough for me to say don&apos;t go here, but we had some issues that prevent me from recommending it. 

We popped in around 1 on a Saturday and were told there was a 30-45 minute wait but got added to the mobile text waitlist. I got the text that said we were third in line so we window shopped nearby for a bit. 30 minutes later we popped back in to see what the wait was and they said &quot;oh the hostess here before was new and didn&apos;t actually add you to the system.&quot; ...mmkay so how do I have a text? Either way, they apologized for losing our reservation and sat us immediately at a communal table. (3 of us at a table for 8 that may or may not add more guests during our meal)

The ambiance is great although the music was a bit too loud so everyone was shouting and it was the volume level of a crowded bar. The waitress was kind and took our order quickly. After what seemed like a while she came back and said that somehow the kitchen line had lost our ticket so we had to place our order again. First they lose the reservation, then the order? We were hoping they&apos;d lose our check too but nope. They did offer my husband a complimentary second beer, but he only wanted the one. Nothing was comped on the bill. 

Anyway - his hash was tasty but a very small amount of hash. Moms burger was good and came with a boatload of French fries. Attached is a photo of my blackbird breakfast sandwich. I&apos;m an idiot and didn&apos;t realize it came with buffalo sauce which isn&apos;t my favorite, but that mistake is on me of course. The potatoes were generously seasoned and delicious. 

Not our best experience but could&apos;ve been a fluke day. I like to give the benefit of the doubt. I&apos;d probably give it another shot if I&apos;m back in the area for lunch or dinner instead of brunch."
4,"Good spot for a drink. Didn&apos;t eat here. Just came for a drink with the hubby. 

Love the view of the cathedral our the window. We sat at the window looking outside. It was good for people watching as well. 

I got a dirty martini that was a little too dirty. But still ok. The bartender suggested a good hazy IPA for my husband and it was so good! Wish I remembered the name. 

Bartenders were nice and quick too!"
4,"I dig the decor - an Ouija board on one wall, headless and limbless mannequin on another, and hands tied to long strings of varying length hang above the bar. Came here for brunch with some friends. I highly recommend the Cuke Perry Bloody Mary - uses cucumber gin and has the right amount of spices and tomato juice. I had the Boomtown Burger and my other friends ordered the Chicken and Pancakes and scotch egg. It was the perfect brunch burger -a layer of fried egg, ham, arugula, cheese, and a hashbrown made for some hefty eating, but I loved it! It wasn&apos;t too greasy, meat was cooked tenderly, and I still managed to have some of each layer in each bite, which is hard to do with all those ingredients. Fries were more average than I was expecting - I don&apos;t even think they were seasoned. My friend really liked his chicken and pancakes. It was a huge portion of fried chicken and pancakes! I&apos;ve never had scotch eggs, but my other friend who got it is a fan, and said theirs was really good. 

Overall, The Gallows is more of a hearty place for brunch, not somewhere to &quot;eat light.&quot; If you&apos;re up for it, though, definitely worth a stop."
2,"Okay place and friendly staff, but food was not good. 4 of us ordered various dishes and none of us liked our food. Would not recommend this place."
4,"Came here for a pre-movie dinner with some girlfriends and it was good. It&apos;s a fun place, they decorated the wall like a giant ouija board. 
We tried the fried babybels and they were so good, I could have eaten the whole plate. 
I had a burger with truffle fries and that was good as well. They give a generous portion of fries!
I was impressed with the cocktail menu and enjoyed both my drinks. 
I will say that we visited in the middle of a terrible heat wave, and it was a bit warm inside."
4,"Such a fun place for brunch... the decor is very on brand (the wall behind the mannequin has the entire text of The Raven) and the cocktails have cute names. We got poutine, breakfast tacos, and the breakfast sandwich... all tasty. The hash browns were yummy also. I wouldn&apos;t say this is a must do, but if you&apos;re in the neighborhood and are in the mood for ambiance and snacks, drop in!"
4,Very cool place for some  comfort food. I absolutely love the decor. I sat underneath a mural  Ouiji board.  I had the burger and subsituted the regular fries with  Poutine fries which is a great idea considering the regular order is  ridonkulous!!! I love the ambiance and it seems to put a  good bar scene. Great for the Southend area.
4,Just stopped in for a drink. Several people at the bar were eating and it all looked pretty good.
4,This is a comment to their brunch.  The menu didn&apos;t look impressive but food was great. Especially recommend the French roast! Mimosas were great addition to our brunch. Don&apos;t recommend the boozy iced coffee with vodka ( didn&apos;t feel like a drink). I enjoyed the place much more during brunch than at night. Will be back!
4,"Fun atmosphere, great american food and cocktails- this spot is a spooky vibed bar/restaurant for those of us who love the Halloween theme year round. Only a 4/5 for a lack of variety in food selection, everything we had was great though!"
5,"Ambiance and enviroment was great. 

Staff was very efficient, fast, and friendly. 

Food was great. Especially brunch. 

Drinks were also good. You dont want, you NEED to get the &apos; boozey ice coffee &apos;


This place FUCKS for sure !"
4,"Great experience here! Our server was super friendly and helpful, bringing us samples of their beer to try. She was very patient with us while we were placing our orders and checked up on us frequently during our meal. 

The food was great as well, we ordered the buffalo cauliflower to share and I got the falafel burger with pizza fries. Everything was fantastic except I found the french fries to be a little on the soggy side. 

Cool ambiance as well, its a little dimly lit with fake candles. I would recommend checking this place out."
