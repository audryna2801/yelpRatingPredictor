4,"Covid review:

I came here in August. 

Cash only !

I love the decor so much.  The coffee and cannolli are basic. Sorry ill say it. The cannoli cream is home made but I can get better down the block. The coffee was okay.  We had some grappa, which was so nice !  Good service too. Overall its a cute spot to sit down and relax for a minute, take in all the cute decor and history."
4,"An old school coffee shop in Boston&apos;s North End.

Narrow inside with a few tables, along with outdoor seating. All old school coffee machines, some of which they still use! Service is fast and there is always a barista on hand to take your order. All drinks can be made iced, which is a selling point in my book. No extra charge for soy or almond milk, which is another selling point.

Definitely more of a grab and go type place with excellent coffee and even better prices. Two iced lattes with soy for $4!"
5,Thank you for excellent service . Delicious drinks and pastry . Our server was a pretty blonde .i didn&apos;t catch her name but she was wonderful with my teen daughters thank you .  Very covid responsible cafe .
5,"A tried and true classic in the North End.  
No matter where you end up for dinner or lunch be sure to cap it off with dessert, coffee, or a cocktail here.
Very classic caffé decor and feel.  The wait staff are always great and attentive. 
Great beverage options and the baristas are always filling you up with whatever you need!"
5,"Went to Caffe Vittoria to try their famous limoncello cake slice and it was a hit! This beautiful Italian cafe takes you out of Boston and immediately transports you to Italy. Everything in the caffe makes you feel as if you are somewhere in Europe. The decor and old  coffee machine scattered around the cafe are entertaining to look at. This place is also HUGE I thought it was small, but if you walk to the end of the hall there is a loop that takes you to a different room with more tables and old decor. I would say this is an experience type of coffee place. 

The limoncello cake was a fluffy decadence. It was moist  and the mascarpone icing blends well with this moist cake. I loved the experience!"
4,"Hot chocolate was just what I needed today with all the snow flurries! My roommate and I love exploring new places in Boston and after coming to this cafe, we will definitely be returning. What&apos;s really cool is that it&apos;s Boston&apos;s first Italian cafe! The decor inside fits the vibe perfectly.

My roommate and I both tried the &apos;Sleigh Ride&apos; which is hot chocolate with Godiva chocolate and Baileys. It was delicious! The one down side to this cafe is that it is cash only and we didn&apos;t know this before we left the apartment. I never carry cash on me, but luckily my roommate had just enough for the drinks. If we had known, we would have brought more cash and tried some of the pastries!"
5,Best latte I&apos;ve had! Went there after a night out and was a great way to end the night. Staff was friendly and lemonchello cake was excellent. Will be back this weekend! I just wish I didn&apos;t have to walk 25 minutes to get it! I need one closer to me
5,"The cannolis here are truly unmatched, along with all the drinks. A very cute old-fashioned vibe in here, and a truly wonderful staff! The jukebox is also a great addition to the overall vibe of the restaurant:)"
3,"The espresso martini was good. Tiramisu was only ok nothing more( although we heard amazing reviews on it).
The hazelnut ice cream was good but the pistachio was really not good, it didn&apos;t have the flavor of pistachio. This place takes only cash. There are seats inside and outside. I would give this place 3/5 also for social distancing."
5,"Cafe Vittoria is a consummate Italian cafe with decorations spanning decades. The staff are very helpful and friendly, and the food is absolutely amazing!"
5,"What a cute little place. My boyfriend took me into the North End for an Italian tour for my birthday. Growing up near Little Italy in NYC, I have high expectations for cute little coffee shops and bakeries that are reminiscent of places I went with my family growing up. Caffe Vittoria is a cute and quaint coffee shop that makes a mean cappuccino. This is a great spot to bring a book or catch up with a friend while sipping on some good coffee or even grabbing a sweet treat. Don&apos;t expect insane customer service, with waiters checking on you every two seconds - but that&apos;s part of its charm. Everyone is perfectly nice, and they mind their own business and let you relax. Heads up, it&apos;s cash only!"
3,"I definitely enjoy caffe Vittoria for the ambiance and location. I prefer other local spots drinks and desserts more, however sometimes you just want a cute spot to sit after dinner and have an espresso and treat. When that feeling hits me, this is my go to spot. The service is fine - unremarkable. The prices are a little high for what you get, but that&apos;s probably due to the high rent on the location. Overall, it&apos;s definitely worth a stop - I&apos;ll leave it up to you if you work it in to your normal rotation."
5,"Must come!! Delicious hot chocolate. Cappuccino, Canolis, and chocolate martini. Every time I come to Boston I have to pass by here. Love the antique look of the place and the service is great too."
4,"Coffee in America has been morphed into a fast food experience where you wait in a line and receive a paper cup bearing your misspelled name. Coffee was meant to be drank in leisure over conversation while digesting an exquisite meal. The coffee should be meticulously crafted with quality ingredients and served in a cup that&apos;s not destined for a recycling bin the moment after you&apos;ve taken your final sip. It should be enjoyed in an environment that is both lively and without a trace of precipitancy. The right time is any time that one is still so lucky as to have, and a wonderful place to spend it is at Caffé Vittoria with spectacular coffee and companionship."
5,I absolutely love this place. It&apos;s no frills and cash only. Servers are friendly and quick. The coffee is always fresh as excellent.
5,Love this place service is great and staff is always helpful and hilarious!!!! Highly recommend!
4,"Classic Italian cafe with coffee and pastries. Cappuccino and iced coffee were excellent. Pastries were decent, not spectacular."
5,"Super nice place!! Great quality coffee! And awesome desserts!! We ordered 3 different ones because we couldn&apos;t choose just one :) tiramisu is amazing! And that was my first time trying lobster tail (for that reason I can&apos;t compare it to anything) buuuut highly recommended!!
Oh, and it&apos;s cash only place, so don&apos;t forget to bring your dollar bills :)"
3,"Stopped by here after dinner with a friend and had an interesting experience. Ordered a latte and tiramisu.

Tiramisu was very good and the latte was great as well. Not too pricey but note that this place is cash only!

The inside has a louder than coffee shop chatter but lots of seating and really like how they set this place up.

My only caveat here is that the
moment we entered the cafe and while sitting inside the staff were a quite aggressive. Perhaps it was because it was the end of the night and they were ready to close, I don&apos;t know but that was not exactly the cafe experience I expected."
3,"Following the advise of a travelguide i found vittoria for coffee.

Overall, was not impressed. 

- Espresso was average (i had better ones in boston and definitely in italy).
- canneloni, which was a bit too sweet. 

Realise it is popular, and quant due to the collection of espresso machines.... But i prefer good coffee over ambiance. Overall, ok if you need a shot of caffeine"
