5,"The &quot;BOOTLEG SPECIAL&quot; - 1 1/4 lb Lobster, 1/2 lb each shrimp, crawfish, mussels, clams, corn on the cob, potatoes, andouille sausage (serves 2-3)
 $89
Garlic Noodles + shrimp -  $9 + $6
Street Corn -  $10
B.S. Wings -  $12


So I&apos;ve literally been dying to try this place!! I love Louisiana so I had to stop by because of the theme. The urban d√©cor was adorable! The &quot;bootleg special&quot; was such a huge portion that filled me up immediately. You also have the option to build your own boil. Everything was so tasty &amp; flavorful!! I also had their garlic noodles &amp; street corn, which are perfect for appetizers. The garlic noodles are legit amazing. I love garlic, so I definitely understand why it&apos;s a signature dish. This dish is packed with garlic &amp; lots of butter. I just wish the portion size was bigger, but I enjoyed it regardless.

The street corn is delicious, but more spice would&apos;ve really given that kick! The wings are crispy &amp; tasty! They&apos;re covered with this type of Korean sauce, so if you&apos;re into that you should try them.

From the outside, you would never guess the appearance of the interior. I always appreciate the vintage wall art. They have different types of music playing in the background, while there are projectors showing video clips or sports games. It&apos;s just an all around nice vibe. Can&apos;t wait to come back for brunch!

It was my friend&apos;s birthday and due to covid we decided to treat ourselves with takeout. We were feeling seafood and came across Bootleg Special and the photos and menu items looked tempting. We were not sure of how much food we were going to receive so went all out and got the bootleg special with garlic noodles and garlic fries and then also got the traditional beignets for dessert. We will realize later that this is a feast for many and not two but hey, no regrets!

OMG - if you like seafood and garlic then you&apos;re in for a treat! The bootleg special has a mix of all types of seafood and you can pick the sauce and sides it&apos;s made in. I picked Cajun sauce and went with potatoes and noodles. The garlic was overwhelming but since we both a fans, we did not mind. The restaurant added some gloves that we were thankful for because we definitely needed those. 

The noodles and garlic fries are a must try! Again, we did not bother with utensils and dug in. The food came with what seemed like garlic bread. Given the amount of food, I&apos;ll probably skip out on any sides. 

The beignets were freshly fried and were soft and smelled amazing. Unfortunately we did not have space to indulge in them, so we had them for breakfast the next day. Still a scrumptious experience. It is a little on the pricey side, but you&apos;re getting a whole lotta seafood. 

Lots of leftover, lots of fun and overall a very &quot;hands on experience&quot;. Would definitely order again from the regular menu."
5,"This place is the boujee version of your conventional seafood boil. I&apos;m from Maryland and practically lived off of seafood boils so I was so excited to try out Bootleg. They have a very simple selection where you can order a massive selection of seafood if you&apos;re trying to splurge: the bootleg special for 99$ or the Big Bowl of Crabs for 129$. If this is too much food, you can opt for the &quot;Two-somes&quot; which are pre-selected combinations of 1) lobsters &amp; mussels 2) shrimp &amp; clams 3) snow crab &amp; shrimp. These come with potatoes and corn and you can add in sausages, garlic noodles, rice, etc. for additional $$. You can also opt to make your own selection if you want a specific kind of seafood! 

The inside of bootleg is amazing - it feels very gothic and renaissance and extremely fancy. I didn&apos;t expect this at a seafood boil and really added to the aesthetics of the whole place. 

We ordered the &quot;two-some&quot; shrimp and snow crab (55$) and added in sausage and a side of truffle fries and this was perfect for two people. The boil came with two massive slices of bread which was perfect to dunk into the seafood boil sauce. They gave us bibs, gloves, and hand towelettes for the table so we weren&apos;t dunking our hands in the sauce. We asked for the signature &quot;bootleg&quot; sauce and it was delicious but a bit too spicy for my taste! I would suggest ordering a nice crisp beer to balance out the spiciness. Huge PLUS in having a really great draft beer selection and their cocktails look so nice! 

The sauce and food was so fresh, the flavors and food selection are very unique - kind of like an asian fusion with cajun food. The pricing is a bit on the higher side of things but a great treat yourself kind of place. 

I really want to try the place for their brunch and their infamous souffles! I can&apos;t wait to come back! 

In terms of dining during COVID, there were partitions separating each table, you are asked to scan the QR code sign upon entering, and there is hand sanitizer as you walk in. The employees were proper PPE and everything is separated out so you feel like you&apos;re in your own space. I felt super safe dining here!"
4,"I visited this restaurant during a short trip to Boston from New York City, which has more than a few good restaurants. 

It was almost easy to walk past this restaurant, as the entrance is fairly unassuming. Upon arrival, I was immediately greeted by a wonderful aroma. What exactly was I smelling? I don&apos;t know, but, I do know it smelled intense and delicious. 

After being seated, my group and I scanned the menu and settled on the lobster and crab mac and cheese, cajun fried rice, and garlic fries as appetizers to share, family-style. As an entree, we ordered the bootleg special to be shared. To drink, I ordered a &quot;You can&apos;t sip with us&quot; a tropical, rum based cocktail. 

The Food/Drinks

We began with the lobster and crab mac and cheese. This was a delicious start to our gastronomical journey. The pasta was perfectly al dente and draped in a silky cheese sauce. The mac and cheese was topped with what I believe is bread crumbs and scallions which together added delicious flavor to the dish. As great as the mac and cheese was, I wish the seafood was chunkier. The crab and lobster was certainly there but not as in your face as I would have liked. Nonetheless, you knew the seafood was there and the dish tasted great. 8/10

Next, we were served the cajun fried rice. Full disclosure, I&apos;m a fried rice fanatic so I was probably looking forward to this dish more than anything else. Simply put, this was a slam-dunk. The rice was perfectly cooked, each grain standing on it&apos;s own. The flavor was an interesting mix of saltiness from the sausage and crawfish and earthiness from what I imagine was was ginger. Speaking of ginger, the ginger taste was very strong but I think that&apos;s what made the rice so special. My group liked it so much we ordered it twice, and somehow it tasted even better. TL;DR just order this. 10/10

Soon after we finished the fried rice our boil and garlic fries were delivered at around the same time. Like rice, I love fries and I love garlic, so they didn&apos;t have to do too much with this to make me happy. The fries were crispy and firm. Texture-wise, it reminded me of a really good, fresh McDonald fry which I would argue is one of the grandest honors you can bestow upon a fry. The garlic taste was as strong as I would have hoped and the salt level was just right. The serving of fries, as with the previously mentioned items was plenty for two people. 10/10

After we worked our way through the fries we set our overwhelmed palates onto the boil. The boil was beautifully plated, however, when I think of boils, I think of the items being in a plastic bag, swimming in seasonings. Thus, seeing the seafood plated was unexpected, though nonetheless visually appealing. Unfortunately, this may have been the most underwhelming item we ordered. For one, the boil did not come with corn, potatoes or sausage as listed. By the time we noticed it, we felt awkward asking about the missing items and, to be honest, we were pretty full from the previous dishes. What we did get was the lobster, shrimp, crawfish, mussels, and clams. All of the seafood tasted great and was well seasoned. The crawfish left a bit to be desired but overall, the dish was delicious but I have to shave off points for not really getting what we ordered. The boil was served with sliced and toasted white bread the bread was fine, not bad but nothing really to write home about. Overall the boil was 7/10.

Lastly, somehow, confusingly, we got dessert. To top off our very indulgent meal, we ordered the beignets. It&apos;s hard for me to judge these as I never had beignets before, however, i have always enjoyed what I imagine to be it&apos;s closest analogue, the mighty zeppole. With that comparison in mind, the beignets came up short, only slightly, in terms of mouth feel and sweetness. Still, I enjoyed these and think they are worth a try. Of note, my fellow diners who have enjoyed beignets at Cafe du Monde seemed to really enjoy the beignets which I&apos;d bet his high praise. 8/10

Before I forget, my drink, &quot;You can&apos;t sip with us&quot; was honestly not memorable, though I think that speaks less to the drink and more to how good the food was. I remember the drink being balanced, not too sweet, not too boozy. For what it was, it tasted fine but again, it didn&apos;t really leave an impression on on me as I was probably waiting for my second serving of fried rice. 6/10

Overall, this restaurant really impressed. From the great food to the really good playlist, I was not disappointed. I certainly plan to visit this restaurant again to explore more of their menu. I would never expect my favorite restaurant in Boston to be a cajun restaurant, but it doesn&apos;t have to make sense when the food is good."
5,"My dad and uncle picked this up on Christmas Eve so that we could get it for Christmas dinner. BEST DECISION EVER. There were five of us eating we got &quot;The &apos;Bootleg Special&apos;&quot; and the &quot;Mama Sue&apos;s &apos;Big Bowl of Crabs&quot; and it came with bread. 
We followed the instructions and put the food into the bag provided and boiled it and while that was cooking we heated both sauces up in pots. One was a garlic butter sauce that came with mama sues and the other one was there bootleg special sauce.  We mixed a little bit of both sauces in both when we mixed it with the seafood. 
We put the bread in the oven on broil. Used some of that extra butter sauce that came with the broil and put it on top. 

We also cooked extra potatoes on the sides but the ones provided were the perfect amount. 
 We will definitely will be returning again. It was worth the price and it was fun broiling it ourselves too. 
(I included the after photos so you can see how much we all ate)"
4,Delish!!! We had the garlic noodles with shrimp as an appetizer and it was to die for! I am impressed! Out waitress was very nice and the guests were friendly!
4,The atmosphere is a cool New Orleans vibe that is welcoming. The outside decor is deceiving and once you walk in you realize it. The southern style food is what makes up the menu so for those who don&apos;t like the Cajun kick make sure you read the menu for anything spicy. We enjoyed a make your own boil and a few apps from a very attentive waitress named Brittany. She was very nice and gave us some great pointers for some of our friends who have not had crawfish before. The garlic noodles were amazing and the night out did not disappoint. The food prices were typical Boston prices which can easily been seen on their menu online. We had a great time and will certainly be back.
4,"This place is truly special just as the name suggests. This hidden gem, is a corner restaurant filled with amazing seafood broil. My friends and I walked in, this place is spacious with a young, chill atmosphere with graffiti paintings on the wall. Surprised that it wasn&apos;t as packed as it was. Tables spaced out approximate for covid. Service was fantastic, service wasn&apos;t too overbearing but wasn&apos;t ghostly, just the right amount of attention. I was a huge fan of their oysters, price was reasonable and oysters were extremely fresh!"
5,"This spot has New Orleans Bar feel and amazing menu!! Definitely a paradise for seafood lovers!! We loved everything we tried, from drinks to the fries and lobster and clam hollandaise! Every bit of the food was amazing!! I will definitely recommend this place!"
4,"Really good first impression when I walked in. The vibe was really romantic and I felt like I was in a completely different state. Which is a good thing. The music, the lights, the decorations. The food was pretty good too, I got a seafood boil and it was really delicious."
4,"Made a reservation ahead of time, I&apos;ve been craving cajun styled seafood. We got the snow crab legs with shrimp and noodles, it also comes with corn on the cob and potatoes. We got the bootleg sauce which has a lot of garlic and is a cajun styled sauce with a hit of spicy. The sauce was really delicious and I would have tried the even spicier option if I wasn&apos;t sharing my dish. It was first time eating snow crab legs with no tools, but I was able to cut the legs nonetheless. The seafood was great and ambience was nice too- seemed like a New Orleans joint. Our waitress was great and service+food was great overall, there are many cajun styled dishes on the menu that I would be interested in trying out later too."
5,"This spot is amazing. Really good vibe. And they give you a lot of food. I ordered the crab avocado sandwich and it is huuuuuge. There is salad on the side too.
Btw, their bathroom has such great sound system my friend was literally dancing in their for 10 min lol"
5,The food was amazing! The ambiance was so different and cool! The clown shoe beer was delicious
4,"It&apos;s been three weeks and I&apos;m still thinkin&apos; &apos;bout that dirty dirty rice. 

We flew into Boston on a Saturday evening and, jetlagged, didn&apos;t even try to get reservations anywhere. It was a takeout in the hotel room kind of night. Luckily, Bootleg Special was just a few blocks away, and as we walked over, the joint was hoppin&apos;. I wasn&apos;t worried, but I was still heartened by how busy the place was - and how great the food on everyone&apos;s plates looked!

We ordered the dirty rice, the steak tips, and the cucumber salad. Everything was phenomenal, but the dirty rice was really out of this world. Super flavorful with just the right blend of spices, I had half a mind to march right back there and ask for the recipe. The steak tips were tender and perfectly cooked, and the cucumber salad was tangy, vinegar-y and refreshing, a perfect chaser for the mild heat of the rice. I would have loved to try some of the seafood, but that&apos;s not really something you mess with in a hotel room. 

Boston is so lucky to have this joint in town. If Bootleg Special was in my neighborhood... I&apos;d be in trouble."
5,"If you&apos;re craving a cajun boil and or good seafood, this (in my opinion) is the place to go!
I got a make your own boil with 2 pounds of shrimp, potato, corn, and sausage
With our order came bread that you could keep ordering
And with all those carbs, the meal can only be delicious
I would personally skip on the corn as I felt it didn&apos;t add much to the boil but everything else was delicious and supplemented the entire experience

Our waiter was very kind and attentive as well
I look forward to coming back again!"
4,"Was really excited to try this place as I heard good reviews and overall it was pretty good. With COVID, they have a very strict 90 min rule and make sure to let you know that as you walk in the door. My friend arrived a few minutes before we did and informed us that the hostess was a little rude to her when she arrived without the rest of the party. The tables are pretty spaced out which is nice and makes for more comfortable dining. The decor inside is unique and makes you feel like you are in New Orleans eating half inside/half outside. The waitress was extremely unfriendly which is why it went down a star. Almost felt as if she didn&apos;t want to be there and we were ruining her day. No one wanted to ask her questions regarding the menu because she seemed so irritated to be at the restaurant. Regardless, we opted for the gumbo poutine as an appetizer. It was pretty tasty - not like normal poutine- but instead had a Cajun twist. It was a good option as a shareable! We also ordered the souffl√© pancake (strawberry creme fraiche) and Nana&apos;s shrimp and grits. Surprisingly, they had the shrimp and grits come out before the appetizer and the pancakes which was really awkward. Yes, it does note on the menu that the pancakes may take extra prep time, however typically all entres are brought to the table before the appetizer and around the same time as the other meals. It essentially left us all eating at different times and again we didn&apos;t say anything. Even the pancakes came out around different times which was also awkward. We watched other tables receive their meals at the same time though but they also had a different server. The pancakes were pretty big and came with strawberry cr√©me sprinkling on top with a row of strawberries and whipped cream on the side. The pancakes were fluffy and tasted cakey. They were good but more so like a dessert which I didn&apos;t mind! Nana&apos;s shrimp and grits were really tasty! I was surprised that they were so small compared to the pancakes and the appetizer. It seemed more so of an appetizer than the appetizer! However, it was still cheesy and tasty! Lastly, we decided to get an order of the specialty beignets - specifically the chocolate hazelnut. They were doughy and warm and very tasty! They were also pretty big! All in all the food was good, service not so great. Would love to come back for a broil but hoping the service will be better."
5,"Love Bootleg Special! Such a fun atmosphere even with covid. Drinks are amazing. The staff go
Above and beyond. The food is always great! Can&apos;t wait to go back!"
4,"Came here on a Thursday, which happens to be $1 oyster night. From the outside, you would never guess that this is a restaurant. The atmosphere inside resembles a dimly lit New Orleans French quarter. There were 2 projectors playing old school 80s/90s music. We ordered the ribs on coke, garlic noodles, the two-some with jumbo snow crab legs and shrimp with the signature bootleg sauce, and of course $1 oysters. We didn&apos;t have to wait long for our food. The food came out one right after the other. The ribs on coke was a little bit disappointing. It came out warm and was on the dry side. We wished it could have been hotter and drizzled with sauce. The garlic noodles were great - very flavorful, rich, savory, and soft. Better than the standard garlic noodles at other Cajun seafood boils. We were very impressed with the seafood size for the two some boil. The snow crab legs and shrimps were HUGE! Very meaty and sweet much to our delight. We just wish that we could have tasted more of the signature bootleg sauce. The sauce was more at the bottom of the plate, rather than on the seafood itself. Loved the drinks! We had the Raspberry Beret and You Can&apos;t Sip With Us drinks. Both were mixed very well. We ended our night with the Bananas Foster Beignet with vanilla ice cream. Delicious! Service was excellent. The waiters/waitresses are very on top of making sure we were taken care of and had enough water. Needless to say, the food was overall good. We would go back to try other menu items and the different beignets. Our bellies were very full that night!"
2,"This is an updated Yelp review. 

I&apos;ve gotten take out from Bootleg special plenty of times and never had any issues. Today my boyfriend and I decided to go to bootleg special because our original option was packed. 

My boyfriend ordered the bootleg Benedict and I ordered the souffl√© strawberry pancakes. 

My boyfriend liked his food he did not have any complaints 

For me, I received my pancakes and was instantly disappointed. The presentation of the food was not pretty and I never received syrup. I could&apos;ve simply went somewhere and received a better experience. I will no longer return to bootleg for breakfast"
5,This food was the BEST seafood me and my boyfriend have ever had!!! The King Crab legs although pricey ($75 for two legs) were AMAZING!! They don&apos;t put it in a bag which I was worried if the flavor would lack and boy oh boy was I worried for nothing!! The seafood was PACKED with flavor. We also loved how they actually cut the crab legs open for you before bringing them out so you just have to peel off the shells. I didn&apos;t need to use any tools. The street corn was also sooo delicious and so were the garlic noodles. So fresh and yummy! We are going back for Valentines Day because we loved it so much!!
