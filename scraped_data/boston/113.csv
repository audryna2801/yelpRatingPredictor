5,"I haven&apos;t been to this area in 3 years, but the food is still amazing!

Their lunch deal is unbeatable: you get a full shawarma wrap, french fries, and a drink for only $10. And the wrap is just amazing. I recommend the beef, because it&apos;s tender and seasoned well with herbs, tahini sauce, olive oil, and pickles.

Ask for a side of falafels (freshly fried) and baba ganoush for dipping. It&apos;s simply delightful.

Unfortunately, COVID hit hard and their hours are much tighter. But they still serve up delicious food, and they are family-run by the nicest people ever."
5,"One of the best middle eastern food I&apos;ve ever tried and I live in Miami where we have so many of these restaurants, I was shook by their customer service and how fresh everything was. We ordered a wrap (not picture here) and a few other stuff, the food came out super quick, it was incredibly delicious as well as affordable. So glad to decided to try it out because we&apos;re definitely coming back to it"
5,Amazing Lebanese menu with delicious fast food options. I had the taouk and it was cooked to perfection. Great spot
4,"Ordered chicken shwarma platter (comes with rice, thin pita &amp; 2 sides -- i picked baba ghannouj, &amp; hummus harra), with an additional piece of falafel. Unfortunately, they did not have baklava (so i got some elsewhere. please ignore the baklava in the pic)

I will agree with the reviewers who mentioned the disappointing amount of chicken because at first I was also upset but I think its because the container is so large, in comparison, it doesnt look plentiful but it was definitely enough to get me through lunch.

Only ordered 1 falafel but they gave me 2! Falafel was really well fried &amp; perfectly golden brown with a soft fluffy inside, and had a pleasantl garlic-y taste. No dry crumbly falafels here!

The baba ganoush has a smooth but smokey taste and really complemented the falafel. The hummus harra was kind of disappointing, I was expecting something very spicy and flavorful but it seemed more of a colored hummus with a bit of extra spice. Still a great creamy thick hummus but wasnt as flavorful as what I expected.

Everything was done super well &amp; the person who helped me was very helpful &amp; friendly but not sure if I would make my way there the next time Im in Boston. But definitely worth a try if youre in the area, or craving shwarma."
3,"GREAT authentic shawarma! Halal. 
I loved the fact that by default the shawarma sandwich comes with fries and pickles- none of the lettuce and other unnecessary fillings! I found the chicken a little on the dry side so I asked for more sauce (hot sauce and tahini) and they gave me a good helping. Next time I&apos;ll just ask them to add it to my shawarma instead.
Overall it&apos;s a great tasting shawarma at a good price! My only complain: I wish the shawarma had more filling. Quite a bit of the end of my shawarma were empty with no filling so I left that.
Will have to try their falafel next time I&apos;m in."
3,"Tasted very good but the amount of meat for the beef plate I ordered was so little! It was very tiny pieces covering the rice, looked fine at first but once you dig in your realize how little meat there is. ESP for $12. 

the salads I ordered as sides were delicious and so was the beef, the only problem was I was eating rice and bread with my salad for the most part."
1,"Estimated delivery was 40min- took 2 hours. When it arrived they forgot the baklava, Kibbe balls, and gave me rice instead of salad. Pretty disappointed. Not much meat in here at"
3,"We got the lamb and beef shawarma platter.  The meats are pretty dry and you only get a petty small portion of it.  The baba ganoush was excellent!   It was well smoked and seasoned topped with a quality olive oil.  Hummus was also one of the best that I&apos;ve had.  The texture was smooth but not too processed, and the acidity level is just right.  In the future I&apos;m probably only getting the sides"
2,"Not sure where the 4 star rating is coming from. The chicken shawarma is dry. Could definitely use sauce to it. Wont be back. Also, felt a bit nauseous after the meal, which was disappointing."
5,"I drove to Boston for the day and couldn&apos;t wait to grab some lunch. I found this place using Yelp (of course) and it was delicious. It was perfectly located around the commons so a quick walk for parking garages. 
I really like the presentation of the food, the bamboo plate adds a nice touch. The wrap exceeded my expectation. I loved the freshness of the humus and the fries were a surprise.
I really enjoyed lunching here and I&apos;d be happy to stop in again."
4,"Loved this little place on Broomfield. Tucked away from the hustle and bustle of Boston Common but well with walking distance it was just what I needed for a quick lunch. 

I had the veggie platter  which came with 6 falafel and my choice of two sides. I had Baba Ghanoush and Tabouleh. The platter came with a side of Tahini. 

The service was so friendly and informative!  I forgot to get a drink and they threw in a water for free. Awesome. 

The falafel was cooked perfectly. Some places over cook theirs but not here. The pita was huge and was perfect with my Baba Ghanoush. I sat along the windows and watched the people go by as I enjoyed my lunch. 

Really great place for lunch. Reasonable priced and very good food. Lots of veggie options too!"
2,"I was craving falafel, so I looked on the aps on my phone to see where I could order ahead and saw this place with good reviews. If you have falafel in your name, you should have good falafel, right Not the case here. Well, the falafel itself might have been fine, but it was hard to get past the crumpled bread, dripping sauce and jumbled vegetables. I picked up the wrap, but the insides looked like someone had played soccer with it."
1,"From the reviews I was really hoping to find a great Mediterranean food spot. But this place was complete let down, from the service to the food there was nothing worth your time or money.  The establishment was out dated and dusty which shows in the food presentation and lack of care. I hate to give a low review on a small family owned spot, but hopefully they can turn it around. It looked liked it was once a &quot;go-to&quot; spot."
5,"I was told to check out this place for dinner by my Uber driver and I am soooo glad I came. The restaurant is super easy to locate (I am a tourist in Boston), there is no overwhelming odor of food so you don&apos;t leave smelling, and the food is made fresh. 

I got the beef shawarma combo platter. AMAZING, DELICIOUS, SAVORY and the perfect takeout dinner meal. I am definitely going to visit again while I&apos;m on this trip for more falafel. Also the woman at the cash register was soooo kind, warm, and helpful - I felt like a guest at their home."
4,"Stumbled upon this restaurant when we were in the neighborhood for some appointments. It is a good size , simple yet clean restaurant that had a mix of people taking food to go as well as dining in. The wraps are pretty good size and I was full with just 1/2 wrap and ate the other half for dinner. We ordered a bunch of food: 
-Falafel wrap: amazing falafel, soft on the inside and crispy on the outside, perfectly balanced with the tahini and pickled radishes they put inside complimented by the freshness of the mint (pro tip: add hummus and hot sauce to your wrap, it will take the deliciousness to another level)
-Chicken and Beef Shawarma Combo wrap: my husband had this and said this was delicious, the meat was crispy from outside and still succulent from inside.
-Side of hummus: delicioussss and a good quantity for $4.50
-Side of Batata Harra: this dish let us down big time specially when everything else we tried was great. It lacked flavor, was under seasoned and totally not worth $6. 
-Baba Ghannouj: I wish I could rate it, but they were out of it. Little weird that a restaurant can be out of such an important dish on the menu. 2 customers who came after me also asked for it.
So all in all, a great meal and a restaurant I would not hesitate to eat at again."
5,"It was the  middle of the afternoon and I was headed to the airport, goin&apos; home. I was pretty sure dinner was not going to be served on the plane and had sat, hungry through enough flights that I wasn&apos;t interested in repeating that scenario.
They appeared to be in the middle of a mid day cleaning so the everything was a but jumbled up. But they were able to get me in and out quickly and my wrap made my flight home far, far more pleasant.
Would I go to sit down and enjoy a meal? Maybe not. But it was perfect for what I needed."
3,"Had chicken wrap and Shawarma wrap,
Both on the small side, but nicely prepared and tasty.
Needed to ask for extra sauces.
Shop needs a serious thorough clean and renovation though, ambience is poor."
4,"Shawarma for me, shawarma for you, shawarma for your mama!

This hole in the wall is located right near Downtown Crossing. It offers some of the best and authentic Lebanese food that I have ever tried. Walking in you&apos;ll see scattered tables and a counter in the back where you order. We ordered the beef platter which came with rice and two sides. I picked falafel (2 pieces) and hummus. My friend got the Tabbouli and falafel. We waited for a bit for our food but it was well worth it because you can tell it was freshly made to order. 

The beef was very well seasoned and given in a good portion. The falafel was also top notch. Hummus though, could&apos;ve used a little bit more flavor. They give you a wrap on the side, but if you don&apos;t eat it fast enough then it&apos;ll get cold and harden up. In the end, you definitely get your money&apos;s worth of food here. We definitely struggled finishing. I plan on coming back here to try their other meats such as the lamb!"
4,"I got the falafel rollup combo for lunch and I regret nothing. The rollup was chock full of falafel and super savory with mint and hummus. I didn&apos;t want to waste it and finished the falafel and left half the wrap on the plate. The fries were delicious, crunchy McD&apos;s style fries. 

I got takeout and it was quick but they are very confused about the online ordering that they&apos;re using so I would just go to the restaurant and order there."
3,"*** 11/2017 visit ***

Came back for dinner after work and a few parties had beat me there, yet there was no wait at the register.  Their beef was recommended last visit, but I don&apos;t really eat spicy, so I ordered the Kafta Roll Up $7.85 and added a meat sambousik $1.87 as I had noticed a sheet posted advertising this new item of theirs.

Both were served to me in a plastic basket with a smile.

The sambousik was a pastry filled with the ground meat.  Tasty, but rather small.  They also had other variation - cheese - which is filled with feta mozzarella.

The roll up - marinated house ground beef, hummus, cucumber, pickles, tomatoes, french fries, pita bread - reminded me of my mom&apos;s homemade hamburger patties.  It made for a satisfying meal, though for me their chicken shawarma roll up still leads the pack thus far, with the cauliflower roll up a terrific veggie alternative.

I still have to give the grilled halloumi roll up a try someday.

4 stars

*** 9/2018 visit ***

Been a while since my last visit, so it was time to revisit the Chicken Shawarma Roll-Up, now $7.90.

The menu board was different, now organized into Chicken, Meat, Dairy, Vegetarian, Sides for Platters, Salads &amp; Sides, Desserts, Drinks, and Lunch Specials.  Prices are a touch higher - ie. Chicken Shawarma Roll-Up $7.90, Cauliflower Roll-Up $6.80, Kafta Roll-Up $8.35, Baklava $1.70, Halloumi Roll-Up $7.60.

The lady and the gentleman who was usually there on previous visits were both MIA.  In their stead was a bearded dark haired fellow.

My roll-up was loosely wrapped with a higher ratio of lettuce to meat/fries, the garlic paste not very evident, and I was not slightly uncomfortably full as I had been on past visits.

This experience is definitely 2 star &quot;I&apos;ve experienced better&quot; at Shawarma Falafel, so I&apos;ll round my rating down to 3 stars."
