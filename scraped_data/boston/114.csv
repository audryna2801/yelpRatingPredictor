5,"Saw Body World exhibit in the past year. AMAZING. Loved the museum. Though on the expensive side, I thought it was worth it. Very good building, exhibits, etc. the location isn&apos;t the best, but whatever. It&apos;s close to Boston!!

Very good experience!!"
4,"A visit to a museum is a search for beauty, truth, and meaning in our lives. Go to museums as often as you can. With that said, the Boston Museum of Science is a beautiful and well done museum. Moreover, I enjoyed my trip to the Boston Museum of Science very much. Some of my favorite parts of the museum were the butterfly garden, thrill ride, and the extraordinary exhibits. On top of this, the best exhibits were the Hall of Human Life, the dinosaur exhibits, and the live animal care center.

In the same degree, I suggest going to the Boston Museum of Science at least once in your life. It&apos;s fun for adults and children. I can spend hours in the museum without even realizing it. However, it is a bit expensive. A ticket is $29, but it is worth it for all the exhibits that the museum provides. To culminate, the Boston Museum of Science is an excellent museum for people of all ages."
5,"For all ages!

There were plenty of incredible interactive exhibits to play with and definitely kept the attention of some ADHD adolescents for the better part of a Sunday afternoon.  Dock with a space station!  Stick pollen up a giant nose!  There was even a spot for a close-up hands on examination of animal organs such as an actual sheep&apos;s heart.  Grab a wristband ID to keep note of any individual metrics from your visit on what you eat and how you walk.

The museum was spacious clean and a pretty cool automated stamper allows for re-entry in case you need to step out. 

It&apos;s definitely pricey for sure but a definite must visit if you are in the Boston area and have five or six hours to fill."
5,"Omg the views inside this place when the sun is setting over The Charles river. So breath takingly dreamy. This scene reminded me of an &quot;awe&quot; moment. So blissful. The museum itself is awesome, so many things to stimulate the mind. They have 4? Exhibits . The body exhort was my favorite. They had the sensory adaptation experiment they were doing. 

The parking lot is open till 12am. I did park here and got a Uber to TD garden for the Celtics game . Was awesome too.

This is a late review. I had the flu the day I went. I remember the beautiful sunset though."
4,"I am not sure what it is about the Musuem of Science, but even at the age of 40, I still feel like a kid exploring the exhibits and enjoying the interactive ones that just blow your mind despite knowing exactly what to expect. I had time to kill before taking The  T, to  Fenway Park, so my  Dad and I decided to spend a few hours at the museum.  It is worth the price of admission just to explore the exhibits that do not require you to purchase additional tickets."
5,"Visiting town and decided to come to the Museum. Initially I felt kind of silly being a solo adult here, when I saw a lot of families with small kids, but decided to give it a try anyway. 

Some exhibits did feel more geared towards the kiddos but there were enough exhibits that would be interesting to adults as well! 

I very much enjoyed the human body exhibit and I appreciated the overall interactiveness of the whole museum. Also overlooks a beautiful view of the city."
4,"This place is so fun to explore numerous STEM concepts! Located at the edge of Cambridge, it is driving or train accessible. I recently went here with my kids on a cold winter day and here are some tips:
1. Buy your tickets ahead of time, especially for the 4d movies to avoid waiting in lines with kids
2. Have a central meeting point for older kids OR keep a close eye on younger kids. There is a plethora of things to do and if your kids are anything like mine, excitement is high and they tend to just jump stations
3. Be prepared to pay for parking ($17) if you do decide to park
4. The museum likes to charge for special exhibits, at the time, they charged extra for the butterfly garden 

Overall, an amazing place to expose kids and adults to science. It is very very crowded but there is so much to do that everyone can get a turn!"
5,"I&apos;ve been coming to the Museum of Science since I was in grade school!  Field Trips, family trips, vacations, I went to college and medical school in the area and would stop by here.  Heck, I even did my surgical residency and fellowship nearby and would stop by here to decompress.
It&apos;s always been a fun, educational place to with something for person of any age to learn.  Over the years it&apos;s changed slightly but that&apos;s not a bad thing, I quite enjoy it.  I&apos;m very preferential to the bio-sciences and anything related to healthcare and they&apos;ve made it fun and easy to break some topics down for children or the lay person to understand.  
The museum is very interactive and hands on, lots of team member walking about answering questions or doing a demonstration.  I like to catch a show or attend something at the planetarium which I did at my latest visit.
I&apos;m think on my next visit perhaps this summer I&apos;ll take my nephews because they&apos;re at the age where they&apos;re starting to become very inquisitive and this is a place that&apos;s perfect for the.
If I may suggest, buy your tickets online.  They&apos;ll give you a QR code and you can avoid the line for tickets."
4,"Boston museum of science is a cultural staple. The museum sits on the water and has beautiful views for events as well. I attended a wedding there and returned the next day to check out a few exhibits. 

The museum definitely caters to kids and a few exhibits feel old. They also upcharge for special exhibits like the bodies which I checked out. On its own it was about $30 and it was smaller than others I&apos;ve seen. That being said many exhibits are interactive and it seems to invest in rotating different exhibits. 

The venue is a unique spot for events. There&apos;s a reception room with great views of the city! Also can&apos;t miss dancing by dinosaurs. We had great catering as well so good options."
5,"Being a physician I am a HUGE of STEM and anything that has to do with STEM.  This was my first time ever coming here to the Museum which I now regret that I haven&apos;t come in the past since moving to the United States.  
The museum is large and amazing!  Broken down into several sections there&apos;s something here for everybody to enjoy and learn.  There are a so many exhibits and shows, you could easily spend the entire day here. Many of the exhibits are interactive, which caters not only to children, but also adults.  
I loved the Planetarium and the show that was put on.  There&apos;s a small food court that serves Starbucks.  It&apos;s definitely worth another trip and I plan on coming back again in the near future."
5,"My first exposure to the museum was when my 6th grade science teacher took us to see IMAX Everest, which is the most widely viewed IMAX film. Seeing this film when I was in 6th in the OMNI theatre literally changed my life. Seeing those mountaineers elated when they reached the summit instilled enthusiasm in me to one day climb the great mountain.

Another place that I like is the planetarium. The film &apos;Distant Worlds&apos; had been there forever, I highly recommend watching it. It described how scientists find exo planets (planets that are not in our solar system). Very compelling and educational...

Today&apos;s visit I went to the Green and Blue Wing something I&apos;ve never done and I&apos;m a Boston native. They have a complete triceratops fossil from Montana called &apos;Cliff&apos;, the largest light bulb in the world, and an exciting electricity show.

Oh, and this place is heaven for kids. Very hands on, and tons of things to play with and climb on."
5,"I have always been a fan of the Boston museum of science. However, this is my first visit with my own children after growing up coming with family and on school field trips. I even took students in the past when I was teaching.

   The new renovations are clean, crisp and well done. I can&apos;t tell you when the renovations were done, but this is a newer and fresher version than I remember. 

   We took in some of the 4D movies. Really cool experience. Not gonna lie, even I was on the edge of my seat at times. If you are sensory sensitive, I would caution you to be ready to be uncomfortable at times. 

   Planetary experience is also really cool as well. Of course the dinosaurs were a big hit with the kids, but some of the exhibits were a bit old for my 4 and 5 year old.

   Parking was simple and driving in Boston is always a special experience. We came first thing Saturday morning and had no trouble with travel or parking. Great trip if a resident or traveling in the area with family and/or friends. Enjoy!!"
5,"Very cool! There were two sides: life science and modern technology. You could spend several days here if you really engage in the exhibits. That what I loved so much, this museum really gave each person an opportunity to engage and play and learn. 

We built a body, balanced weights, smelled Forrest smells, watched lightning, and more. 

Wear REALLY good walking shoes and plan at least a 4 hour trip. Make sure you plan on some of the demonstrations such as the lightning show. 

I was sad to find out the planetarium was closed the day we went. I assume it&apos;s only open on weekends? But not entirely sure. 

Super neat museum worth the money and the time."
5,"Came here for the laser Pink Floyd show one night. It was the coolest &quot;concert&quot; I&apos;ve been too. It was $10 a person for a 45 minute show in their planetarium. Apparently they do similar shows every month. I&apos;d would definitely become a regular. 
The tech was amazing and the chairs are comfy. We had no issues getting in and out of the museum. The staff was super friendly and polite. The audience was intimate so it felt like our own personal show. 
And the show- absolutely incredible! If they ever do it again- go! This is one of the greatest ideas."
4,"The Museum of Science is a fun place to take the family for a visit. Your paid admission lets you into three levels of exhibit halls.  For a reduced fee, you can add on to your exhibit hall ticket the Omni, planetarium, butterfly garden, or 4D theater.

The butterfly garden, located in the blue wing, can only be added if you have an exhibit hall admission.  Entry is allowed every 15 minutes beginning at 10am with the last entry at 4:30pm.

They have live presentations throughout the day.  Check the schedule for times and locations.  I highly recommend watching the lightning show.  You will not be disappointed."
5,"Absolutely the nicest science museum I have ever been to. I guess when you&apos;re nestled amongst America&apos;s finest schools you don&apos;t play around. 

We were in Boston for only a night during an extremely hot couple of days. I was looking for something indoors to do with my kids (ages 8, 10 and 13). I narrowed it down to this museum and the Children&apos;s Museum. I felt this museum was much more appropriate for their ages and I definitely feel this was the better choice for us. 

The museum is right next door to Harvard and MIT. They have their own parking garage and very easy access to 93. It is spread across three floors (and one tiny little exhibit in a room on the 4th floor). The museum doesn&apos;t look so large on the map provided but once you start exploring it is very easy to spend a full day here. 

Unlike every other science museum I&apos;ve been to, the exhibits here all work! They are clean and well maintained. If an exhibit did not work they seemed to be very proactive about fixing it. They also have detailed information about what you&apos;re looking at and what to do. There were also employees (or maybe volunteers?) throughout helping with questions and exhibits. 

We stopped in for the electricity show and the bird show which were both excellent. Every employee we encountered here was professional, knowledgeable and more than willing to answer questions and share their knowledge. 

We also stopped for a quick bite to eat in their cafeteria. It wasn&apos;t grossly overpriced like some places. Food was decent for a quick bite. The cafeteria has beautiful views overlooking the river. 

I definitely recommend this for school aged kids. If you&apos;re kids are younger they will have plenty of buttons to push but I&apos;d stick to the Children&apos;s Museum. As an adult I actually enjoyed this museum too. Normally when I think of science museums I wouldn&apos;t want to go without kids but I think this museum is great for adults without kids as well (obviously expect a lot of kids though)."
5,"I love this museum so much that I&apos;ve almost considered getting a membership here even though I don&apos;t even live near Boston!

Boston&apos;s Museum of Science is fantastic for both children and adults alike. A few years ago I came to see their &quot;Science behind Pixar&quot; exhibit, and it&apos;s still probably one of my favorite and most memorable exhibits to date. Most recently I&apos;ve returned to see the &quot;Space: An Out-of-Gravity Experience&quot; exhibit and it was also excellent - the museum provides a good mix of reading content, short videos, artifacts, and interactive pieces to teach about the perils of space, advancements in space research, and sneak peeks into life as an astronaut. There wasn&apos;t a second that I was bored!

Besides the temporary exhibits and the permanent museum collection, there are also different lectures and events scheduled throughout the day to attend. For an additional fee, you can also watch featured IMAX films or Planetarium shows, both which I think are worth the price.

All-in-all this is a fun museum to spend a few hours. I&apos;d love to visit again next time I&apos;m in Boston."
4,"My grown daughter and I had a fantastic time at the Museum of Science. Lots of stuff to see and do, much of it extremely interactive.

The human body exhibit was fun. I particularly enjoyed seeing much of my own statistics - foot arch type, cooling percentage, food choices - compared to other visitors.

The space exhibit was probably the most fun. The recreation of the space station where you stand on a stationary platform while the station &quot;revolves&quot; around you was amazing. I&apos;m amazed at how it really did feel like I was rotating too. I had to hold onto the railing!

Tops was the Lightning Show. The presenter had a great spiel and the different types of electricity from the various generators was interesting. The room was well packed and it seemed that everyone inside enjoyed it immensely. We kind of lucked out, arriving about 20 minutes before the &quot;show&quot; started which let us get some great seats in the front row. Yep, it&apos;s loud but not *that* loud. Fun stuff.

Definitely worth a good few hours at the Museum of Science!"
4,"I always loved coming here as a child and while I don&apos;t get quite a giddy coming here, it is still an enjoyable experience. The museum does a lot with the space it has.

I don&apos;t really care as much for the newer exhibits and still relish the nostalgia with the older ones, such as the math exhibit, natural habitat exhibit, dinosaurs, model ships, and lightning show. Needless to say, kids love this museum and they can expend some good energy here. You could be here all day if you wanted to be thorough but you can get a substantial amount covered in a couple of hours. 

If you gotta come weekends, plan accordingly. Parking at the museum isn&apos;t too expensive but T&apos;ing it can be a better option. Admission is pretty pricey, but there are various discounts (online, library, other memberships, etc.) you can find, especially if you live in the area."
5,"What can I say about the MoS that has not already been said? The place is just great and for a wide range of ages from babies on up. Growing up in the area, I have fond memories of the museum but I am back in Boston with my children so we went in the middle of the week. Therefore, it was quiet and we used the Go City Boston pass. Would I go even if I didn&apos;t have the pass - absolutely.

The biggest plus for me was that one of my children was playing and left two of his brand new toys in the museum. When we got back to our place, I noticed they were no longer in the bag. I called the museum and nothing. Chalked it up to gone. He remembered he put them in this desk in one of the exhibits. I rang back and to my delightful surprise, the man with whom I was speaking found at least one of them. LEGEND!!!! That is true customer service.

On a side note, is the food expensive - yes, ridiculously so but that&apos;s the same with most place with a captive audience. If you can, leave and return that day. Otherwise - what do you expect?"
