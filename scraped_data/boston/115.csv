5,"I was very happy with my overall experience at Menton. It was a great fine dining experience that didn&apos;t leave me feeling taken advantage of. We had multiple servers, all were professional yet personable and very knowledgeable about what they were serving and the extensive list of wines they offered. I was happy that our main server took the time to help me pick out a bottle of wine I would enjoy from first sip to last drop. As for the food, we chose to do the Chef&apos;s Whim tasting menu because we love to experience an array of food. Each dish was a new blend of tastes and textures that I would not be able to compare to anywhere else I&apos;ve been. Not only did the food taste amazing, but it was served beautifully. Our favorite dish was the pheasant with sweet potato, but that&apos;s not to say each of the other dishes weren&apos;t delicious in their own way. At the end of the meal our server brought us a small bag of goodies. Although we&apos;re sure we weren&apos;t the only ones to receive them, it was a nice touch that made us feel appreciated. As for COVID related arrangements, all of the servers wore masks the entire time and we were sat a good 20 ft from the other groups there. Some were sat a little closer, but no one was less than the required distance. 

Overall a great experience, that I will be sure to enjoy again."
5,"WOW, just WOW! By far one of the best spots in Boston. We did the chef&apos;s whim &amp; thoroughly enjoyed every dish brought out to us. Our waiter John was incredible &amp; made the night so memorable with his kindness and understanding of the foods that needed explaining (i.e. sweetbreads). A friend that was with us doesn&apos;t eat red meat and they accommodated her perfectly, making each fish dish amazing - she raved about them all especially the ones we didn&apos;t get to try! Made me want to become a pescatarian....anyways....all the food was amazing &amp; the service was great. The ambiance was just what we needed to relax and enjoy the night completely with it&apos;s modern art and open windows to see the bustling Seaport streets (didn&apos;t even look like COVID was a thing). 10/10 recommend this spot!"
5,"I was visiting Boston and was very happy this restaurant has adapted to Covid regulations . The service is extraordinary , well organized and knowledgeable. Restaurant is located in a nice area of the city , easy access . Decor is simple but elegant . I had the chef&apos;s tasting menu for the evening and it was a nice collection of different ingredients and flavors in each dish . Price is very affordable for the quality of the food"
2,"We decided to dine here to celebrate my friend&apos;s birthday. The service was terrible and very disappointing. For a fine dining restaurant I expected them to be more friendly and attentive. I understand that some restaurant may be understaff due to the pandemic, so we completely understood if drinks took longer than usual and etc. However, having a bad attitude, not explaining the menu, asking if we have any questions with the menu, not providing details on their tasting menu-- there&apos;s no excuse for that. Instead, they just asked what do you guys want to order and we had to ask them about their tasting menu. I&apos;ve dined at Ostra (another high end restaurant in Boston) prior to here and their service was beyond exceptional. 

We opt for the Chef Tasting (5 course) meal. We were enjoying bread and butter when the first dish came out. We were surprised that they didn&apos;t even bother removing our bread/butter plates to make room for our first dish. Instead, we had to do it ourselves. There was not enough room on the table for all these plates. And throughout our entire night, they checked in on us ONCE to see how we were doing and if the food was good. We spent about 3 1/2 hours dining here. 

Overall, food was delicious but service was terrible."
4,"Stopped by for Restaurant Week (March 2020) and was pleasantly surprised. We were seated right away, surrounded by beautiful decor. 

The chef gave us a complimentary appetizer which was unexpected. I&apos;m not entirely sure what it was, but something salmon roe-based? 

I got the Cavatelli as the entree. It was a bit salty in my opinion, but still tasty and filling. The dessert was also very, very filling! I love a good chocolate espresso mousse and Menton didn&apos;t disappoint. The arrangement was beautiful too. 

Overall, I was a bit bummed about the main course, but my boyfriend seemed to enjoy his slow-roasted pork a good amount."
4,"Wanted to take my mom out to a high end fine dining restaurant for her birthday, I came across Menton partially because they have not foie gras which is my mom&apos;s favorite. Even though it ended up being expensive, we had a great time and seeing my mom happy means a lot. 

The most stand out experience is the service provided. As soon as I made reservation they contacted asking if it was a special occasion. When we got to the restaurant, they coat checked us right away and didn&apos;t even hand us a ticket (they just remembered us). When we sat down, the waiter was patient and made good wine and food suggestions. In between courses, we also had Italian onion bread and French baguette to keep us busy. Water is constantly filled as well. They even fold your napkins when you go to the bathroom. At the end when the dessert arrived, they added candles and wrote &quot;Happy birthday&quot; in chocolate. Very very thoughtful, we felt like royalty being served. I was very appreciative.

The food itself is pretty good too. We ordered uni caviar pasta, wagyu gnocchi and grilled scallops as main course. Foie gras and king crab for appetizers and sorbet for dessert. I guess the only minor complain is the amount of oil added. Seems excessive and a little greasy. 

I would definitely recommend this place for a special occasion."
4,"We had a great experience, the food was good and the presentation was nice! Menton has a
wonderful ambiance and the restaurant is definitely a great spot for a special occasion or fancy night out :)"
4,"Imagine Ratatouille dining experience, super posh and uptight. We came for an impromptu date night for drinks and bites. We made reservations earlier that day and arrived that evening. We were kindly greeted and seated near the window, there isn&apos;t really a view here. All you see is some buildings and cars driving by. 

We were immediately serviced with water and 3 books that consisted of their various menus: wine menu, food menu, and drink menu. We ordered and started with drinks. And this is where the rating of our experience changed. Actual star rating for my experience: 3.75. Because they offered everyone else bread but not us. 

The food was a different experience. Interesting... like the food would have a twist or a peculiar arrangement of flavors. For instance, fog and goat cheese or the flavoring selected with the meats... all interesting, to say the least. 

I wouldn&apos;t come here if I was starving and wanted some bangin good food. I would just come here for either a date or business meeting. 

Also, it was super dark so I didn&apos;t take pics and create a fiasco with the flash."
1,"Normal food. It&apos;s the first time in my life that I find I can cook better food than a $$$$ restaurant.
Could you tell me why &quot; POUSSIN (baby pumpkin, wild mushroom, foie gras)&quot; in your truffle week menu tastes like grilled fish? Are you sure that you give me correct food?
( It is foie gras in your website, but it is foie jus in the menu you give me .So what is foie jus? A fish?)
$295 +tax+tips is nearly $350.This is the worst $350 dinner in my whole life. 
By the way, I never see $$$$ restaurant is so empty. I start eating at 5 pm and end at 6:30pm. There are only two table people on Sunday night. Even during covid-19, other good $$$$ restaurants are still very busy. I think your customers have already known your food quality."
5,Really well curated chef&apos;s table. A lot of interesting small bites during our 11 course meal. Great atmosphere.
5,"Brendan and Becca: 
Had a celebratory dinner here and it was a great celebration. Atmosphere is posh, service is attentive, meal was delicious. 

Meal was started with a delicious bread service with a buttery roll served with warmed, salted butter. Truly delicious. And then we moved onto the appetizers. 

We had a set of cocktails with our dinner: 
French 75 - an excellently prepared classic
Champs Elysees - refreshing and plentiful
Manhattan - excellent, but standard
Adonis - inventive, but not necessarily our cup of tea

Wagyu Tartare - delicious tartate, dressed with a deft hand, really let the incredible meat shine through - it was served with a side of toast, which honestly was a bit of a distraction from the delicious meat. 

Grilled Octopus - a small, but incredible portion of octopus served with a salad of radicchio. One of the better octopus dishes we&apos;ve had. The only issue is that it left me wanting for more

Between the appetizers and the dinner was an INCREDIBLE bread service where we both got to choose 2 rolls from a selection of four. We both tried the pretzel roll and the onion roll, leaving the black olive and the mini french baguette behind. The bread we had was great and I would gladly try the other two on our next trip. 

For dinner: 
Striploin - a delightful portion of excellently cooked steak served with deep, complex mushrooms. Absolutely delicious. 

Striped Bass - a perfectly seared filet of bass served on a bed of succulent lobster sauced with a lobster nage which I can best describe as a combination of lobster bisque and clarified butter. Along side of the fish was a compliment of boiled potatoes, which made for an excellent vehicle for absorbing the delicious lobster nage. 

For dessert (which we usually don&apos;t do) we had goat cheese cheesecake that was served with concord grape sorbet, a sprinkling of graham cracker crumb topping, and a speculoos spread. A delightful dessert for people who don&apos;t usually venture into sweets. The concord grabe sorbet was truly incredible, so smooth and packed a powerful punch. 

All in all, a great experience. Would strongly recommend it to anyone who was looking for a nice upscale dinner with an excellent set of options from appetizer to dessert."
5,"Im so glad this place is open for indoor dining. I had plans to go to another place, but they only offer outdoor dining and its raining! So, we decided to come here. I dont know where to start. Every single item we got was amazing. I was worried to be honest, as alot of the items I didnt know what it was. Glad we took the dive and tried a little of everything. We both got different stuff, so we could try most of the menu. The service is over the top. One of the best services I had in a while and I been to all the places you can think of. Quality was a step above from the rest, and that includes seaport places. Menton might be my new go to place. Def will be back again. Take a look at the photos, if you dont believe."
4,"I dined here a few weeks ago with my girlfriend for our 2 year anniversary and left with mixed feelings. When we walked into the restaurant, we instantly fell in love with the way they designed the interior. It had a blend of classic + modern and the lighting was dimmed just enough to make it intimate. At the beginning, the restaurant was actually quite empty but after an hour, the place filled up because of Dine Out Boston. The server was very thorough in explaining the menu and in the end we opted to share everything.  

Seared Fois Gras 4/5: Lovely sear on the outside with a red wine sauce that offered sweetness to the plate. Highly recommend this to anyone who is a fan of fois gras

Mascarpone cappelleti: 3/5: The pasta was cooked al dente but both my girlfriend and I found the sauce a little too oily. For $30, I found it to be just average. 

Seared Scallops 4/5: These scallops were huge and had a beautiful sear on the outside. However, the scallops were sitting on top of some carrots that I found to be out of place in this plate. The flavor profiles just didn&apos;t mix well and in the end, we didn&apos;t really bother finishing the carrots. 

Prime Ribeye 3/5: So anyone reading this should take this with a grain of salt because I love my steaks with a sear on the outside. This was not the case at Menton as it appears that the kitchen perhaps only sous vide the steak? I&apos;m not too sure the exact method they employed but while it was cooked to a perfect medium rare on the inside, the outside didn&apos;t really offer any additional dimension to the flavor profile. Also, I was expecting a little more fat considering that this is supposed to be a prime grade steak, but it tasted more lean to me. 

Gianduja Ganache 5/5 + Creme Fraiche Gateau 4.5/5 : Crazy to say but I felt as if the desserts were the star of the night. The gianduja ganache had so many textures and flavors that complemented each other very well. We were super amazed and happy that we got to try this. The creme fraiche gateau was also delicious and offered a nice palate cleanser with the fresh pears. 

Throughout the night, the staff also brought out a variety of bread and complementary appetizer samples + desserts. Overall, I love the service and interior here but perhaps had too high expectations for the food."
5,"This review is written with concern specifically to their restaurant week menu but this certainly did not detract from the experience that my friend and I had. I ordered the summer melon, cod, and milk chocolate pudding. In addition to these items from the Restaurant Week menu, I also ordered the wagyu carpaccio to split along with the G&amp;T from the regular menu for good measures. Service from the bartender and waiter was exemplary and fairly quick considering that we were seated at bar seats. The G&amp;T was strongly sour (grapefruit and raspberry will do that) but also very refreshing. The summer melon (cantaloupe/honeydew) was accompanied and well complemented by the prosciutto and cheese that came with the dish. The wagyu carpaccio was melt in your mouth good with hazelnut and truffle to add to the unique dish. The cod was crispy on the outside (cutting it open was worthy of an ASMR) and soft/tender on the inside. The milk chocolate pudding was accompanied by Sicilian pistachio, plum, and anise to make a satisfying dessert to close the meal. The presentation of everything you get here is evocative of art. Portions are smaller, but the quality more than makes up for the smaller quantity of food. Menton definitely lives up to the standards of a Barbara Lynch establishment.

2,"We planned a trip to Boston to celebrate Christmas and made a reservation here with some friends before attending the ballet. One of the things we like doing when traveling to a new city is to find some of the top rated restaurants, and that&apos;s how we found Menton.

The location is easy to find right off a main thoroughfare, and the restaurant is smaller than I was expecting. We were one of the 3 or 4 tables occupied that evening which I anticipated meant that we would have top notch service and a detail-oriented dining experience.

We started with a bottle of DOC wine, and opted for the tasting menu to see all of what Menton had to offer. I felt acutely that the wine expert snubbed us because of our seemingly lower cost wine choice, but we did it because our dining companions had visited Cinque Terre and it was meaningful, not because of its price.

The amuse bouche was a spoon of tuna tartare, which was fresh but moderately bland. Bread was served and was very good, and included an array of options. Following that was a scallop dish which was awkward to me in mouthfeel with the soft scallop and tart-while-soft citrus fruit and crunchy but still soft pistachios. A cod dish was next, topped with cuttlefish and alongside potatoes, but it lacked any acidity or pop of flavor.

Overwhelmingly the table&apos;s favorite dishes were the Jerusalem artichoke dish and the pasta with foie sauce, both of which were very solid and I venture to say I could have easily ordered an entire meal&apos;s worth of either. It was obvious from other&apos;s reviews that Menton is known for their foie course, and it did not disappoint either, with well paired cookies, and a sweet, airy texture. This was a first time for two of our companions to have foie and I think it was a positive first impression of what can be an otherwise polarizing dish.

The meat courses included a very under-cooked duck and a likewise very meaty steak topped with truffle shavings, which despite the truffle, were both largely unremarkable. Dessert was refreshing and light, with lemon and coconut notes, and a bright, tangy mouthfeel.

Service was decent, but I noticed they lagged on refilling sparkling water and wine glasses for how few customers were in the restaurant. The bathrooms were very clean, and I was impressed with their top tier bathroom amenities from Le Labo, which is one of my favorite apothecaries. For the 4 of us, one bottle of wine and some sparkling water, it ran us close to $900, which I think is not representative of the food ingenuity or overall dining experience. Would not likely return."
4,"Why not the perfect 5 stars? The service was spectacular and friendly. The ambiance wasn&apos;t as classy and upscale as I was anticipating (unfinished wood tables screamed out rustic). Also, i was surprised that they played Notorious Big  &quot;Big Poppa&quot; in the background. 

The food was phenomenal. The home made bread was to die for. It was perfectly seasoned and warm and pillow soft. The seared foie gras was delectable. The muscat grapes gave it the acidity it needed to help complement and cut the heaviness of the foie. The burgundy escargot was delicious as well. I was surprised that they provided the escargot without the shells. Some of the fun of eating escargot is taking it out of the shell yourself.

The sopressini pasta was split in half for us and it was a perfectly booked pasta. It reminded me of a very thin tortellini. I could have eaten a full plate of this by myself.

For entrees, we had the lamb loin and seared scallops. Both were cooked and season to perfection.

The Creme Fraiche Grateau dessert was delicious. We were so full, but we were able to finish this. The restaurant added a nice touch by writing &quot;happy birthday&quot; on the plate for my girlfriend and had a lit candle. 

The negative star..is just for the slowness of the timing of the food. Some of the time between each course was a bit lengthy; but it wasn&apos;t as bad for us as it was for other patrons who ordered &quot;the Chef&apos;s Whim&quot;. People who were seated before us were still there eating after we came and went eating our 4 course meal.

My girlfriend and I will definitely be back though."
4,"4 and a half stars for me. 

Waygu tartare was delightful with a playful dust of mustard. Seated foie gras was almost too decadent but paired nicely with blueberries. Had the duck, was a bit cold when served but delicious. Didn&apos;t get any any petit fours with check which mad me sad :/.

Probably will go to sportello and b&amp;g first before circling back. 

Normally I would have done the chefs whim but have many tastings menus booked for a Japan vacation."
5,"Best meal of my trip.

Service and food were beyond reproach. I thoroughly enjoyed the different take on the escargot which I didn&apos;t expect. Instead of the usual garlic and butter, I received this beautifully plated dish that was light, flavorful and generous w/ the escargot. The varying textures from the peas and mushrooms was pleasing. My pasta was delish w/ the green sauce and sprouts. My fave was the crudo they served as my 2nd amuse bouche. Fish was the perfect temperature and expertly paired w/ a tart ponzu-esque sauce that was exquisitely refreshing.

Everyone was incredibly nice, friendly and inviting. I left instructions during my booking online regarding allergies. I appreciated how they confirmed that w/ me at the beginning of the meal and took care to avoid such ingredients. Incredibly thoughtful!

Great experience!"
5,"In her memoir, Barbara Lynch recalls witnessing Whitey Bulger stab a teenager for loudly dribbling a basketball outside his house one evening, and then subsequently wrapping the kid in a blanket and driving him to the hospital. Just a normal evening in South Boston in the early 80s.

Lynch&apos;s ascent from growing up in gang-infested public housing projects to being just the second woman to win the James Beard &quot;Outstanding Chef&quot; award to owning the only non-NYC restaurant in the northeast U.S. on the &quot;Relais &amp; Châteaux&quot; list is an extraordinary story, and I could write just about that - but this review needs to be about Menton, another interesting topic for me as someone who has enjoyed many meals there since its opening in 2010.

In my recent review of Lynch&apos;s first restaurant, &quot;Park No. 9,&quot; I mentioned that it was not showy, not &quot;tweezer food,&quot; not OCD, not truly &quot;fancy.&quot; Menton is the opposite of that: an exercise in self-indulgent culinary artistry and of bleeding-edge cooking techniques, all delivered in a veneer wood-paneled environment featuring stylized diamond pagoda-like ceiling lanterns with the appropriately scrupulous service demanded by a venue of this level of stately grandeur. You don&apos;t earn &apos;5 Stars&apos; from Forbes and &apos;5 Diamonds&apos; from AAA without some razzle-dazzle. Differences aside, Park No. 9 and Menton are both excellent restaurants and my preference for one or the other is purely dependent on mood.

Menton&apos;s name comes from the coastal town in southeastern France that borders Italy, reflecting Lynch&apos;s general M.O. of fusing French and Italian cuisines. The food at Menton is not just great, it is practically perfect. My latest visit in April came just after Chef Lynch returned to Menton&apos;s kitchen for the first time since it opened to implement a new menu and, aside from a tear I noticed in the upholstery of my seat, was perhaps the most flawless of my visits over the many years I&apos;ve dined here. My waiter for that evening, Danny, was an excellent server and ensured that I got not just a meal, but an experience.

I ordered the 9-course Chef&apos;s Whim tasting ($165) as I usually do when I&apos;m here. My favorite dish off of the new spring menu was the &quot;Chickering Farms Goat,&quot; a sausage-wrapped goat loin from with a fava bean purée and a punchy pepperonata. The grassy and earthy flavors of the goat paired perfectly with the recommended wine pairing, the &quot;Malpaís&quot; from Frontón de Oro, a charcoal-y blend of three Canary Island grapes: Preto, Tintilla, and Listán Negro. The lean goat was more taut than tender, proving that meat doesn&apos;t need to &quot;melt&quot; in one&apos;s mouth to be extraordinary.

Another favorite dish off of the tasting menu was the &quot;Poached Shellfish,&quot; a combination of local shrimp, peekytoe crab, and speck covered with a gloriously rich &quot;mussel crème&quot; sauce - Grade A plate-licking stuff - and accompanied by a complimentary small pour of dry sherry. Other highlights included the &quot;Island Creek Oysters&quot; - a trio of 3 plump oysters harvested in nearby Duxbury in a chilled mango-cucumber &apos;broth&apos; that interplays with the natural sweetness and meatiness of these particular oysters - and the &quot;Spaghetti,&quot; a typically astounding Lynchian pasta course with smoked duck confit and a sweet tomato sauce that has been reduced and caramelized to the point of it almost being a glaze rather than a sauce.

Menton is reportedly experiencing some financial woes, like many other Boston restaurants facing exorbitant rent hikes, and has started to offer lunch as part of its plan to achieve profitability. While there must be extraordinary pressures to &quot;downscale&quot; the menu, cut corners, or make the restaurant more accessible during dinner hours, I have seen no evidence of that from this recent visit. Hopefully Menton can stay true to itself while becoming profitable, as I look forward to continuing to visit this restaurant for many years to come.

Food/Décor/Service: 4.8/4.6/4.8"
5,"Loved everything about this place - the ambiance, food, and service. Definitely quite a splurge, but worth it for special occasions!

I went on a Tuesday evening for a Restaurant Week dinner. We checked our coats and bags, were seated immediately, and someone came over to explain the menu and take our drink orders. I ordered the Serre De La Madone cocktail which was amazing - light, refreshing, strong, and not overly sweet.

They gave us a bit of raw tuna as a palate cleanser to start - wasn&apos;t a huge fan and thought it was a bit of a strange choice, but my friends enjoyed it. 

Before our appetizers arrived, they gave out some warm rolls which were great. We tried a bunch of varieties - one was a classic butter roll (amazing), and others included olive bread and a caramelized onion roll (my favorite!). 

For appetizers, we tried both the hamachi crudo and the mushroom galette. I LOVED the galette - it was essentially puff pastry topped with beautifully sauteed mushrooms and a soft egg. The combination of flavors was impeccable and it was quite large for an appetizer. My friend realy enjoyed the hamachi crudo though it was a much lighter dish than the galette.

We ordered the foie gras as an interim course - it was seared rather than a pate and my friends enjoyed it (I am not a fan of foie gras in general).

For mains, we tried the Saffron Strozzapreti and Branzino. I can speak in detail about the Saffron Strozzapreti. The pasta tasted fresh and had a perfect firmness. The lamb was well cooked and not tough as some lamb dishes can be. The whole dish had a strong but not overpowering flavor and was topped with large shavings of cheese which were a nice complement to the lamb. Solid portion size as well. Though I only had one bite of the Branzino, my friend absolutely loved it and the lentils and sauce that came with it were a great accompaniment. 

The dessert was definitely my favorite part. A rich chocolate cake accompanied by dollops of fresh cream, citrus fruits, and caramel-y ice cream. I was only intending to eat a bite and ended up eating the whole thing!

Following dessert, they brought out additional complimentary bite sized sweet treats (!!) including macarons.

Overall, awesome experience, fantastic food, large portion sizes, and excellent service. Won&apos;t dine here on a regular basis due to the price point, but amazing choice for a special occasion."
