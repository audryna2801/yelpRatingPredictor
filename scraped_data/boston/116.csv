5,"This is one of my frequent go-tos now that gaslight is closed.

Can&apos;t replace gaslight but this place has reliable quality food everytime is go/order! 

Their steak frites are sooo good, medium rare- even when I order it to enjoy at home. Love the arugula on the side that it comes with! I&apos;m also surprised that it still tastes good the next time after I microwave it. 

Brunch here is just the perfect weekend vibe you&apos;re looking for! They have a good amount of outdoor seating in front of the restaurant and on the side as well. You can enjoy a mimosa with their special French toast that&apos;s crunch in the outside and soft on the inside! I would say if you&apos;re and Mac and cheese lover, their their truffle Mac and cheese as a side order during brunch! 

The have so many options for brunch too. Everything from various types of eggs Benedict&apos;s to omelets to even burgers. 

If you happen to be in south end, I would say this would be the perfect place to try for a nice dinner or weekend brunch. Make reservations just to be safe so you don&apos;t have to wait!"
4,"4.5 stars for an incredible pandemic dining experience. Booking outdoor seating on OpenTable was seamless and easy. Even though we booked ahead we still had to wait a bit, but I expected a few wrinkles given the circumstances. Tables are adequately spaced, hand sanitizer is brought to the table when we sat down, and QR code is on the table to view the menu online.

Steak frites- absolutely incredible. The meat is tender and simply delicious with rich butter and truffle flavors. Healthy serving size, beautifully crisp french fries, and acidic greens to break up the heaviness

Gnocchi- great texture, but a few too many flavors going on. Goes great together, but can be a little off if you get the wrong combo on your fork

Highly recommend if you&apos;re looking for a safe, tasty option for a pandemic dinner out."
5,This is my 2020 restaurant choice. I absolutely love this restaurant and their food. Came here for my birthday dinner and immediately my friends fell in love with it as well. The service was great! The drinks were even better and the food is worth every penny. I came across this restaurant on one of my long walks during the peak of the pandemic back in April and decided to support them then. They also came out with a crème brûlée for my birthday since I&apos;m gluten free. If you&apos;re still unsure on whither to come here or not here is the sign you&apos;re looking for! The steak frites are my go too!
4,"Stopped in for brunch and had a good experience.

Service: nothing to complain about. We were seated quickly and order came out faster than expected. 

Food: The eggs Benedict was good, though I wouldn&apos;t say it particularly stood out in comparison to others I&apos;ve had. The French toast was really good and did stand out as different. It had a crunchy outside and tasted like a hybrid of French toast and a beignet. The syrup didn&apos;t really compliment the taste unfortunately and think powdered sugar would have been a much better compliment. (I didn&apos;t ask for any, so not sure if it&apos;s available or not) the bacon while tasty was quite greasy.

Cost:
A little higher than I&apos;d prefer. Three entrees for two people was almost perfect portion wise but the cost for each was a few dollars higher than I&apos;d like. 

Overall:
I enjoyed it as a brunch experience. The food was good though a touch more expensive than I&apos;d like. I&apos;d definitely consider coming here again for more special occasions but it wouldn&apos;t be my first choice for a more regular weekend brunch.

Recommendation for the restaurant: I&apos;d love to see the French toast paired with fried chicken, for a French take on a chicken and waffles dish."
3,"Quaint cute french style place to eat

Food: went for brunch. Had a decent breakfast selection mostly. I ordered the french onion soup, croque madame, and duck hash+eggs. Duck hash and eggs has a spicy sauce that was very good. The croque madame was mustard strong which I enjoyed. The french onion soup had a slight bitterness so it was not my favorite. For drinks, I had the lavender+elderflower spritz and the rise and shine. Both drinks were amazing and well balanced. The only dessert available for brunch is creme brulee which is surprising since having a sweet pastry is common in french culture. I would have preferred more sweet options. Overall, I would definitely come back!

Ambiance: cute french style decor. Looks upscale. The waiters/host were well dressed and werent sloppy 

Service: decent. Could be more attentive but overall good service. 

Parking: good luck. Because it is in the city, most are resident only parking with a few meters. Plan 30mins ahead to look for parking. 

Note: reservations are recommended and can only be held 15mins past reservation time."
5,"What an amazing gem! The bread served at the beginning already started this great meal. It was so good we asked for even more. 

The appetizer was escargots. Caution, it&apos;s very hot. More bread actually came with this dish, and we used every piece of bread to dip in the sauce and accompany the escargots. The saltier escargot with the bread and it&apos;s crunch was a magical combination. 

Next was the gnocchi. Portion size was a bit small, but nonetheless enough. It was not as &quot;al dente&quot; as you&apos;d normally get it, and was much softer. However, I did thoroughly enjoy the flavor. 

Lastly, the burger with the aioli was the best finish. If I could go back, I&apos;d order the exact same dishes!"
4,"The french toast and the eggs were really good, I just wish the french toast came with fruit. I didn&apos;t really like the lyonnaise potatoes. 

Overall, we had a good breakfast. Fabio ( I think his name was , not 100% sure ) but he was great. Very attentive and friendly. Thanks!"
4,"Lovely French restaurant with great wine selection. Our waitress was fun and helpful on choices . The beet salad was amazing and everything we ordered was good. The only reason we didn&apos;t give 5 stars was due to the extra salty potatoes, escargot and my Med rare fillet came out Med at best . We would like to return but I hope we pick a night the chef isn&apos;t so heavy handed with salt ( if I&apos;m saying something is salty , it&apos;s really salty as I salt most foods lol ) ."
4,"Nice bread. I was disappointed with the servicing size of the mussels but they were tasty. They certainly don&apos;t skimp on the butter. Got the Steak Frites. Again, small serving size but eh fries were outstanding and the steak was well cooked. Service was great with Fabio. It was very good but not great. I might try another restaurant when in the area but If you&apos;re in the mood for classic French, you can&apos;t go wrong."
3,"Aquitaine is a cute little spot in the South End specializing in French cuisine. We had reservations for a group of 6 on a Friday night and were seated immediately which was great. The staff was so helpful in answering all our questions since most of us don&apos;t eat French food regularly and the menu, although descriptive, didn&apos;t provide much insight as to what each dish was.

We started with the frog legs, escargot and mussels appetizers. The mussels were by far my favorite and served in such a cute little pot - perfect for our group. The other 2 apps were good, but nothing special. I ordered the butternut squash casserole for my entrée and again it was good, but nothing spectacular enough to order again. We also tried the bread pudding dessert which was perfectly crispy, chocolately and came with a scoop of vanilla ice cream which balanced out the meal. I&apos;d have to say the drink I had was the best part of the night. I can&apos;t remember the exact name, but it had rosemary and gin. I ordered 2 over the course of the night and both tasted phenomenal - would definitely come back for another.

Overall Aquitaine was a fun experience, but the food just isn&apos;t my thing. Everything was tasty, but if I do come back in the future it&apos;ll probably be to hang out at the bar and try some fun cocktails."
4,"Solid brunch. My wife and I sat at the bar and it was a really nice experience. I got the western omelette and my wife got the Benedict with bacon on the side. I also got t he Rise and Shine and it was really flavorful. 

The bartender was great and we got out of there without breaking the bank on a Sunday for a place i thought was pretty pricey even for the area. Will go back."
5,"My boyfriend took me to Aquitaine on Sunday night as a pre birthday dinner. It was amazing.

There are pros and cons to a Sunday night. Perhaps because it was at the tail end of a weekend, a fair amount of things were unavailable from the menu. That being said, Aquitaine was very relaxed because it was Sunday. So getting to be in a candle lit booth without the background noise of crowds chitter chattery was very nice. 

I was going to be adventurous and try something new but the entree I wanted was unavailable. So I went back to my  creature comforts and got steak-frites. Nothing is as fancy and yet as comfort food as steak and fries. The steak was in a truffle vinaigrette which was delicious. The meat itself was tender and cooked perfectly medium. The fries were crispy and went well with the leftover truffle vinaigrette. My boyfriend had the salmon which he loved. He isn&apos;t a huge fish person, but he said the skin was perfectly crispy (and from the bites I stole, I agree) 

For an appetizers, we had the truffle canard paté. It was wonderfully paired with miso crackers. I recommend it. 

One of the things that blew me away about Aquitaine was the service. I really don&apos;t like being bombarded with constant &quot;How&apos;s the food?&quot; while I&apos;m eating and enjoying the company of someone. At Aquitaine, the waiter was able to gauge when there was a lull  or when we were done. He did a great job of seamlessly removing plates, coming without interrupting, and being available when we did need him.

Over all, it was an awesome way to enter into my 24th year."
5,"I&apos;m a sucker for French restaurants and this one was no different to me. It has a really inviting but peaceful ambiance, an extensive wine selection, attentive and nice waitstaff, and a delicate touch to the foods they serve. I recently returned for Boston&apos;s Restaurant Week and it was just as good. 

My favorites from their menu are the Lemon Sole Meuniere and Bittersweet Chocolate Mousse. I also really enjoy their Cabernet Franc by the glass."
5,"This is the place to go for Steak Frite!
Good quality, clean and safe environment with most norms applied to prevent covid-19 (physical distance, employees with mask, online menus and sanitizers for customers)"
5,"Hands down the best restaurant in the South End!!! Truly soooo delicious, the interior is gorgeous and will make you feel like you&apos;re in Paris. The food is amazing, service always flawless, and an amazing wine selection."
5,"Aquitaine is a small beautiful French restaurant in the South End. A couple of my girlfriends and I visited during Boston Restaurant Week, so our three-course meal was only $33 dollars. It felt like we were in Sex And The City. The music and the atmosphere were both modern &amp; chic. I ordered the duck confit ravioli as an appetizer, the coq au vine rouge, without pancetta or bacon, as an entree, and the raspberry cheesecake for dessert. A lip-smacking experience to say the least. This heavenly meal was lovingly prepared. The succulent chicken retained a lot of its flavor and tenderness. Everything was unbelievably delicious! Our hostess and waitress were both incredibly friendly! It&apos;s worth the experience!"
4,"RESTAURANT WEEK LUNCH REVIEW

Please take this review with a grain of salt as my food could only be ordered during restaurant week rather than from the normal menu.

For $20, you could order 2 courses (of appetizer, entree, and dessert) which we thought was reasonable for a nicer French bistro.

AMBIANCE: As I walked along the side of the restaurant, the smell of French onion soup warmly greeted me. I kid you not, outside the restaurant. The inside reminds me a lot of Bar Lyon, another small French bistro in Boston, but a little bit fancier with red booths and more old wood paneling.

What we ordered:
Appetizers
Duck Confit Ravioli
Soft Poached Truffled Egg

Entrees
Short Rib Bourguinon
Coq au vin Rouge

Everything we ordered was good (the Coq au vin was my favorite) but the portions were definitely smaller because of the restaurant week menu (but that&apos;s to be expected). I would definitely come back to try some things on the normal menu."
3,"We waited one hour just to be seated, even though we had reservations. The host told us to wait at the bar, but did not tell us how long we would have to wait for. 30 min passed... then an hour passed. The host also never came to update us about the wait either, they really did not give a crap. The only times we got updates from them was if we went up to the host to ask for an update. 
The bar was extremely crowded as there were others waiting, so I really did not enjoy cramming myself into the small bar for an hour. 
This place is well established, it did not just open, surely they can do a better job managing reservations. 
The bartenders however, noticed that we had been at the bar forever. One of them even personally walked around the restaurant to check out the situation as well as check on our table. As an apology, we were told our next 2 rounds of drinks would be free.
Well, that was not true when we saw the bill. Only one round of drinks was free. The waitress decided to make our dessert free instead, which was nice, but the dessert cost way less than a round of drinks. I would not have gotten a 2nd round of drinks, had I known I would have to pay for it. 
At least the food was excellent. We were very hungry after waiting for an hour. The restaurant had also run out of several dishes by the time we sat down. I ate almost all the free bread because I was starving, and because, I love bread. We started off with the cheese plate. In my experience, most waiters would bring the plate and tell you what kind of cheese was on the plate. Here, the waiter simply put the plate on our table and walked away, leaving us to guess what kind of cheese we were eating. I had the duck for my main course, the duck was excellent and cooked to perfection. We had creme brulee for dessert, this was delicious too. 
It is such a pity that Aquataine has good food, yet can&apos;t get the other stuff right. What is the use of making reservations if you are going to wait an hour anyways? The host is just going to tell you to wait at the bar and expect you to wait forever with no updates... and you could wait an hour like me."
4,"They have brunch till 3pm on Saturdays for $12! I&apos;ve come here a few times for dinner and it&apos;s a bit pricey for a casual night. I was looking at the regular menu online and noticed the brunch menu!

I stopped by last weekend and we were seated immediately. Service was great and the food was awesome! It&apos;s a perfect brunch for a great price.

Both of us had the omelette de l&apos;ouest. Delicious and cooked perfectly. It had ham and peppers/onions - I don&apos;t really remember but it was good! We got juice, a mini cinnamon bun, and the food came with potatoes/toast.

I haven&apos;t seen a better brunch deal besides their sister restaurant (gaslight). Great spot to bring a date or friends!"
4,Chic little spot with really good food. The pan seared gnocchi with sweet corn was so so so delicious. My boyfriend got the Salmon which was also tasty as well. My only gripe is I wish the portion sizes were just a bit larger for the price. We also ordered the heirloom tomato &amp; burrata app for $14 and it was literally a few slices of tomato on a plate with a dollop of burrata...
