5,"What is not to like about a place that serves up traditional Italian food to go in the heart of downtown Boston?  What would I not recommend here, the sandwiches are fantastic as well as the pasta dishes.  If you are looking for something really substantial, order a slice of pizza, which is not really a slice but more a whole quarter of a pie.  I have not had one bad meal here!  The only call out is the line that can get rather long during the lunch rush, but that&apos;s to be expected for great food.  A huge recommend for here.

Also note that the seating is rather limited here so you are much better off taking your food to go."
5,"A very popular Italian place for lunch!

Everybody I know speaks very highly of this place, and rightfully so. They have a pretty extensive menu and even have different daily specials. I got the breaded chicken breast Thursday lunch special and my friend got a meatball panini. Both were very delicious. 

This place operates very efficiently, be prepared to know what you&apos;re going to order before stepping in! They get the food to you very quickly, I got my chicken breast within a minute of paying! 

Would definitely come back"
5,"Casa Razdora is right out of a movie. It&apos;s 100% what you&apos;d dream a small Italian restaurant would be. This lunch stop did not disappoint. When you immediately walk in the door you get &quot;next!&quot; shouted your way to get your order, but don&apos;t get frazzled. You can take your time to look if you need it! And, if you can&apos;t read the board on the wall there&apos;s individual copies of the full menu laying on the counter ledge where they take your order. I will say it gets pretty tight in there as you order &amp; wait because of their popularity. 
The lunch portion of the pasta dishes were just right, and it&apos;s so easy to grab to-go. And surprisingly you really don&apos;t have a long wait at all! I got the pumpkin ravioli + burro e salvia sauce (butter &amp; sage). The pasta was fresh and cooked perfectly. The sauce was also very good, but very buttery as it didn&apos;t seemed to be cooked long enough to be browned butter like intended. Even though I wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the sauce, the whole dish was great. Go! You won&apos;t be disappointed!"
4,"This is a review for the new location near South Station and the head of Federal Street.

Ordered a Fino.  They forgot the Gorgonzola.  
This is the second sandwich they got wrong they intwo days.

Get your act together.  I&apos;ll try you out again in a year, if you&apos;re still open.

Feh.

10/24/19 - Ok, going to try them again.  A couple valued opinions say I most likely just had bad luck.  
Someone told me to try the steak carpa

12/02/19 - Getting better.  Fast service.  Still forgot something from the sandwich, but at least they didn&apos;t forget the 

12/30/19 - ok, I&apos;m now a convert.  Get anything with the dry cured steak.  It&apos;s marvelous.  Had the chicken Parmesan special today.  That was simple and delicious.

02/07/2020 - Just triedd the meatball sandwich.  Simply put, it is the best meatball sandwich I&apos;ve had in my three years working in the city.  Damn, it is great."
5,"Amazing, tasty and authentic!!! Fresh made daily you can taste. The staff speaking Italian was music to my ears and made the experience even that much better!! I felt like was in Italy for a bit and made me excited to go!! We each had 3 different dishes and ALL of them were perfection!! The Seafood Ravioli thoooo...... They&apos;re a small family business in the financial district so they mainly cater to the people who work in the area during the lunch rush hour. Open from 11am - 4pm, Monday - Friday and I&apos;m all for it! If you ever go to Boston I highly recommend it!"
4,"Quick order Italian at Casa Razdora. If you don&apos;t want to go to the North End and want your pasta, this is the spot. I ordered online and headed over to pick it up. It was the middle of the lunch rush and rather than &quot;cut the line&quot; even though I was only picking up, I waited anyway. There really isn&apos;t enough room to split &quot;ordering&quot; from &quot;paying&quot; here so keep that in mind.

My pasta was hot and fresh and ready. I brought it back to the apartment and dug in. Nice fresh marinara sauce with penne noodles. Very hot, very fresh. The meatballs were quite good, tough a little small. Flavorful and delicious.

I&apos;ll order from Razdora again, for sure."
2,"People on here seem to rave about this place, but I&apos;ve tried it now three times, with three items, and my experiences have been between &quot;meh&quot; and today&apos;s &quot;I&apos;m not even going to eat this.&quot;  So maybe it depends on what you order, or who&apos;s in the kitchen that day?  I don&apos;t know.

Today I ordered linguini with pesto sauce and chicken. I had thought with the rave reviews that I&apos;d be getting legit pesto, like I might make at home.  Not even close. It&apos;s just olive oil with some dark flakes of what was definitely not fresh basil.  It&apos;s pretty distasteful and I&apos;m not going to waste the calories finishing it, it&apos;s going into the trash can. A shame, because I&apos;m famished!

Guess I&apos;m done with this place, since there are 9,000 options in the Financial District area. It&apos;s a shame, since this place has that nice authentic feel.  But I&apos;m realizing that &quot;authentic&quot; doesn&apos;t necessarily equate to well made or enjoyable to eat.  Oh well."
5,"I&apos;ve been here only once, and that was enough to give them 5 stars for their pasta. When I went, I ordered before and it was ready on time. When I picked up, it was a cute little hole in the wall and the people working there were speaking Italian; it felt so authentic. 

I got the linguini with Campagnola sauce (they have SO many options for sauces and pasta). And it was so light and full of flavor. It was the perfect portion and for only $8.50. Oh and you get bread with it, which was a great little addition. 

HIGHLY recommend! Great price, great variety and great taste."
5,"Very nice surprise.  We ordered a chicken panini and seafood ravioli in pesto sauce.  It was absolutely glorious.

Zesty and creamy pesto sauce and chewy pasta with a great seafood filling.

The service is friendly and familiar.

Can&apos;t recommend highly enough."
5,"Absolutely delicious, and way too close to my office :) Go on Wednesdays for the eggplant parm special - one of the best I&apos;ve ever had!

Oh, and I&apos;d recommend looking at the menu online before visiting. The ordering process is fast and furious, they&apos;ll call far back in the line before you&apos;re ready!"
4,Close at 3:30 now. Food okay but expected more Italian flavor from the marinara sauce as it seemed it came from a can.
5,My go to lunch spot every couple weeks. I&apos;ve tried the Italian and turkey tip. Both were good but I liked the Turkey tip better. The veggies are super fresh and you can see them prepare the sandwiches behind the counter. I usually order via phone and pick up since it gets crowded during lunch. Portions are huge and I usually save the other half for the next day. Although I&apos;ve learned the Italian doesn&apos;t sit well and taste good the next day so better to eat it in one setting. The fresh ingredients are what makes this place great.
4,"Having some business in the area a couple of days, I came here based on the Yelp reviews, not Guy Fieri. Not a hater or anything, but I don&apos;t watch as much Triple-D as I used to. 

I went for the shrimp scampi special my first trip and was provided a decent portion of good quality pasta. There was sufficient reasonably-cooked shrimp to be satisfied. 

The diavola pizza is very good and definitely worth getting. I love sopressata, and it&apos;s a good alternative to pepperoni. The size of the slice you get amounted to two slices itself. My slice came piping hot and fresh. Good mozzarella cheese appeared in abundance. It was one of the better pizza slices I&apos;ve had around town.

Prices are quite good here and the restaurant is clean, but don&apos;t expect warm and fuzzy when encountering staff. They&apos;re not rude or anything but you have to be decisive and prompt with your order."
5,"The food is amazing - had a spinach pesto ravioli for lunch. Admittedly, a bit on the heavier side, but downright delicious"
4,This is the best food and my favorite place in Boston for lunch hands down. Would be 5 stars except the baguettes are shrinking in size every time I go. Today I got a sandwich made with bread sticks. Cmon guys
3,"I generally LOVE this place. Their gnocchi is some of best I&apos;ve ever had. HOWEVER, I have to bring this to someone&apos;s attention. I ordered a slice of cheese pizza the other day and it was soooo greasy. I didn&apos;t even go during the lunch rush so there&apos;s really no excuse. Disappointed!"
4,"I&apos;m not my of a pizza person but I fell in love with the pizza from here and now I&apos;m addicted. The crust is so thin and crunchy and the ingredients are fresh and great quality. The slices are absolutely worth it for $4 (see pics) 

Only downside is that the place itself is so small and packed, especially during the lunch rush. But definitely a great place to grab lunch!"
5,"Definitely some of the best Italian food I have ever had!  

First - pay attention to their hours!  They are only open 11am-4pm Mon-Fri and closed on the weekends.  

My husband and I stopped in here for lunch one afternoon while we were in town visiting.  Also beware that it&apos;s a small place - like super small.  There is constantly a short line to order your food and then there are like 2 tables and and a small bar for seating.  It is really more of grab your lunch and go kind of spot.  We were lucky enough to catch a couple getting up from the bar so I snagged the seats.  I told my husband what I wanted based off of the menu on the wall.  He waited in line and then tells the guy taking orders he needs an order of veal Parmesan .. and the dude says in his most Italian voice ever, &quot;we don&apos;t have veal today what else do you want instead?&quot;  My husband didn&apos;t know what else I wanted so he got out of line to come talk to me. 

Second time around he got to counter after I had given him my choice and back up choice.  He was able to successfully order the stuffed eggplant.  We also wanted the margherita pizza and the guy says in his most Italian authentic voice, &quot;you get cheese.&quot;  My husband acknowledged and paid the person at the cashier.  Now could the customer service had been better - yes, but I feel like I got a real authentic experience if that makes sense.  The process could have been way smoother and organized better, but it was what it was.  I knew there had to be a reason why there was constantly a line at this place because so far it wasn&apos;t the customer service bringing the people from what I could tell. 

Our food was ready pretty quickly and we squeezed into our seats at the bar.  It looked AMAZING.  I took a bite of the stuff eggplant and closed my eyes for a minute.  It was so savory and delicious.  I  also tasted the dish my husband got, which was the fettuccine campongola and it was just a great!  The cheese pizza as simple as it was, was some of the best I have ever had too!  The food was literally as good as it gets and made up for the little stuff.

We almost came here a second time during out visit because it was that good, but we ran out of time.  If you are in the area head to the financial district and try this little hole in the wall Italian spot.  If you can get past the BS you will be amazed at what is being served!"
4,"This place is amazing and I almost don&apos;t want to write this review bc I want to keep this place a secret, even though I am not the first and will not be the last person to enjoy their pasta. Came here on a rainy, depressing day and loved their lobster ravioli. Was it a bit much for just a lunch break meal? Probably-- but I think about it constantly."
4,"Although I only came here once for pizza, I already got a vibe that this place was definitely perfect for when you want some real authentic Italian food! For just $3.50, you get a slice as big as 1/4 of a pizza which is an amazing deal if you ask me. I could barely finish the pizza. I wanted to keep eating it though because it was just that good. But I think it was the crust that ultimately won me over. I am a sucker for great pizza crusts and they definitely nailed it. 

The shop is quite small and get super crowded during peak hours but you get your food pretty quickly so that&apos;s good. Luckily I was able to find seats by the window so I didn&apos;t have to go elsewhere to eat it. 

The menu has some great items like authentic lasagna and other kinds of original Italian food. Just looking at the prepared foods on the counters made me drool and wished I opted for those instead of pizza, BUT I knew I had to try the pizza first! The pizza did not disappoint :) can&apos;t wait to come here again because it is definitely a lot better than trooping to the north end for sit-down Italian restaurants."
