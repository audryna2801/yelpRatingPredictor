5,"With covid their capacity has shrunk even more than their previously small location provided them. They were able to get a few tables set up outside but with the cold weather I don&apos;t know how much longer they will be able to use those. Despite all this, I was seated relatively quickly, maybe in 10 minutes and the line I saw went by decently quick as well. 

The food came out very quick as well. This is only if my go to ramen places because it is so delicious. The broth isn&apos;t too salty and you get a very good proportion of noodles to toppings to broth. I got the Kara ramen I believe. I wish it was a little spicer but it was still overall great. This is one of my go to ramen spots for sure."
5,"Wow, normally this place is packed and can never get a seat but we just happened to walk by and it was open. They were very safe about Covid-19 practices by making  us use hand sanitizers before we walked in. There were temporary walls between each seating area. 

The food is cheap for the city - got a combo with a small Shoyu ramen, with chasu shohan (fried rice and pork belly). I love that there was options for small bowl; most places have oversized overpriced bowls. The flavor was perfectly salty and the egg was perfectly cooked! Great service!"
5,Fire!!!!! Always get pick due to covid-19 but prior I would always stop in for lunch! Hidden jem!!! Best ramen in the city!! No doubts
2,"I have been an avid visitor of this location, eating lunch here at least once-twice a week in the summer until November, but I stopped going because of the terrible service..
The host and the other staff are so rude to customers!! My partner and I are both international and our first language is not English, therefore, sometimes it&apos;s hard to understand English from hearing. My partner was asking a host for a seat outside because inside they are really shoddy on following the regulations. The host said something and my partner couldn&apos;t hear it properly because of the language barrier, the host had an audacity to roll his eyes, point to the table and slap the glasses of water on a shaky table after.
I am not coming back, ever."
3,"I got the Vegetarian ramen and it jus didn&apos;t have any depth of flavor. You may ask why get a vegetarian ramen at a ramen shop? I ask why have it on the menu if it&apos;s going to lack any flavor? Thankfully I had asked for chili oil and that added some flavor to it. 

The noodles were also mediocre. Nothing special. 

My packet of nongshim shin ramen black has more flavor in it for 1/6 of the price"
1,"Christmas letdown

It was a rainy Christmas Day this year. It was 2:25pm and had been raining all day on the 25th. It was hard deciding what to eat with most restaurants closing for Christmas Day. Luckily I find Santouka back bay open. Without hesitation, I called at 2:30pm to make sure I wasn&apos;t dreaming. 

&quot;Hey are you guys really open today?&quot; 

The host curtly answers, &quot;yes.&quot;

&quot;I know there is usually a line out the door. Is that the case today? What&apos;s the volume like?&quot;

The host answers, &quot;no, when are you coming? And for how many?&quot; 

&quot;I roughly estimate 15 minutes for two?&quot;

The host answers, &quot;should be fine&quot; 

&quot;Perfect. We will be there soon. Thanks&quot; 

As soon as I hang up, my girlfriend and I grab our umbrellas and immediately start walking over at 2:30pm. She mentions that she saw a closing time of 3pm online today, so we acknowledge it and briskly start walking to the restaurant. Because of the rain, wind and puddles, it was a long 15 minutes, and we ended up at the front of the restaurant at 2:52pm. 22 minutes. 

The host sees us struggling to open the door against the wind and just watches us. As soon as we open the door, he quietly points towards the sign saying they are closed at 3pm today. Cool. So we&apos;re just in time! 

NOPE. Last call was 2:45pm and we won&apos;t be seated. I tried appealing to him that it&apos;s Christmas Day, we walked in the rain for over 15 minutes to get here, there&apos;s a table clearly empty for us, no one else is outside except us so its not a big deal to make a one time exception. Nope. He did not give a damn. He could&apos;ve told us, if we called at 2:30pm saying we&apos;ll be there by 2:45pm, that they are taking last call at 2:45. 

It is what it is. He probably wants to get off work on Christmas Day as early as possible. It was disappointing that he wouldn&apos;t mention last call or closing up shop when it was THAT close to the deadline. 

To my dear readers who may think this review comes off harsh, please think back on any time that you asked for operating hours of a restaurant over the phone: was it not customary for the host to tell you the last call for kitchen/bar should it differ from a published closing time? If I called the restaurant at 2:30 with an eta of 15 mins, should that not have warranted some kind of disclosure from the host&apos;s part? The behavior of that host was frustrating and, frankly, negligent.

I am leaving a one star review not because of this one incident but after numerous instances where the same host has manifested zero hospitality. I honestly love the food so I keep going back but the host leaves too much to be desired for a higher review."
4,"Very solid and reliable ramen in Boston. The location has very limited seating. If you have 4 or more, I&apos;d suggest going early or go to their sister location in Cambridge. The back bay location had only 3 tables who sat 2 each and a bar top which sat about 6 max.

Service was good. Food was excellent. I&apos;d recommend getting the combo deals. Starts at $15 and you get a bowl of ramen, a side dish, and an egg! This time I got the spicy miso, which is a good mild spice, with chashu gohan side, and the egg. I only got the chashu gohan because you get extra bits of chashu that I can eat with my ramen. My fiancee got the regular ramen with 2 eggs! By the time we finished, a line outside the restaurant was forming. Overall very delicious ramen at an even more delicious price!"
2,"Santouka Back Bay attracts massive lines and widespread adulation for their flavorful ramen bowls, but they definitely have less to offer for plant-based visitors. Their vegetarian ramen was bland, salty, and oily, leaving much to be desired. I hoped for more tofu, vegetables, and real flavor, but the experience really disappointed. Overall, Santouka wins points for their small-shop ambiance, great location, and passion for the perfection of a precise craft, but Red White (nearby on Newbury) will provide a much tastier experience for vegetarian ramen enthusiasts."
3,"Ambiance: very small location with limited seating. Very clean space for covid regulations. Clean bathroom. 

Service: quick friendly service

Food: food is ok. This place didnt make my favorite list but the ramen isnt bad. Has spicy options, vegetarian option. The pork belly was good. 

Parking: meter parking. Back bay is typically hard to find parking so it is expected."
4,"My first ramen ever! It was a little salty, but I assume ramen is supposed to be. The pork was good but had a lot of fat for my liking. Our server was really kind. They take Covid very seriously!"
4,Waited an hour in rain and snow due to 4 person at a time capacity because of COVID. Pretty good soup ramen and soup base. But i like their butter corns. Ordered two of those along with the spicy miso with extra spicy
4,"I came here a handful of times pre-COVID and always left satisfied, although there was ALWAYS a line outside and it took a while to be seated. That just speaks to the popularity of this place and how good the food is. Also the interior is small so they can only seat so many people at a time.

I hadn&apos;t eaten here in a while, and I had a craving for it. They are open for take-out and delivery right now, so I decided to order my usual karamiso ramen. I ordered for pick-up on Grubhub at around 7pm and my food was ready 5 minutes later! No more long wait times, yay!!!

The to-go packaging is very well thought out. The noodles, meat, etc are all separated from the broth so it doesn&apos;t get soggy during transport, and the container is inside a plastic bag in case of spills. The container is big enough to use as a bowl; just add the ingredients into the broth and mix together to loosen up the noodles!

Pre-COVID, I would get the $15 combo, which allowed me to add corn and butter + ajitama to my karamiso ramen. I didn&apos;t see the option to make it a combo when ordering online so I guess they&apos;re not offering it currently. I had some corn and butter at home so I just made my own, but ajitama is a little more complicated to make. You can add it to your order but I wasn&apos;t willing to spend extra money on it.

Another thing I noticed was that the menu items got a little pricier. I&apos;m not sure if this happened before COVID or during, but my ramen (not the $15 combo, just ramen alone!) cost $14.75 pre-tax. Before, a karamiso ramen alone was $11.75 pre-tax. I&apos;m assuming the price increase is to account for the lack of tips since there&apos;s no dine-in allowed.

I wish the karamiso ramen came with more meat... like even 1 more slice would have been so much better. It only comes with 2 slices so my meat:noodle ratio is always off. But other than that, the flavor is so strong and so good. Even as a to-go order when it&apos;s not fresh out of the kitchen, it hits the spot. The karamiso broth isn&apos;t overly spicy in my opinion but has a nice kick to it. The noodles are chewy and delicious. The meat basically melts in your mouth.

Overall, I highly recommend this place, ESPECIALLY right now when the food is ready in less than 10 minutes. I&apos;m sure once they&apos;re fully open for dine-in this will no longer happen, so take advantage of it while you can."
4,"Woke up this morning craving for something savory to eat for lunch. Me and my girlfriend both suggested ramen. Decided to give Santouka a shot and it was not disappointing ! At first we were worried about street parking. Being from Boston my whole life, Newbury Street is super busy on Sundays even if it&apos;s during Covid times. We got so lucky and found FRONT PARKING. We were so excited. Anyways!

Me and my girlfriend both got the KARAMISO Combo. For $15? You can not go wrong! We got it extra spicy and I&apos;m glad we did. We love that  kick and it was just perfect. The broth was savory and adding corn in the bowl made it 10x better. 

I want to add that they&apos;re great with handling covid. We thought there would be a long wait but we got the last table. For the safety of others already dining inside, they ask you questions with the doors half way open with covid questions and etc. everything is wiped down and cleaned after every customers . 

Overall it was a great experience and I&apos;m glad everything worked out for us! Definitely recommend going and we will probably come back again soon!"
4,"Very small eatery, good food and service. I will order online via their original website and pick up next time to avoid queuing up"
4,"First off, undoubtedly, this place serves a delicious Ramen.  Worth the wait? I think so.  However, please BE CONSIDERATE people!! Most often than not, there are 25 people standing in line, in the cold for the meager 7-8 seats available. As such, don&apos;t be an ***hole and lounge as if you owned the place.  Let&apos;s be clear, Santouka is a place to go in, eat and LEAVE.  This is not a place to sit and LOUNGE.  Go to a coffee shop  take your first date elsewhere.  OR risk pounds of heavy bad karma go your way....if you think the people outside don&apos;t notice if you are lounging for too long, they do.  Know what to order (the Original?), get in, order, eat and leave."
5,"My go-to place for ramen! Perfect for a cold winter day. I was seated at the bar and they had plastic dividers for COVID (reminded me a bit of eating ramen in single booths in Japan). The $15 combo is a steal -- I love their chashu gohan, and ajitama is a must. I got the karamiso ramen this time and it was only mildly spicy, which was perfect for me. The service was nice as well, and overall it was a great experience!"
4,"The main location is in Harvard square and always has a crazy wait so we decided to try the Back-Bay location. The place is super small and on a rainy Tuesday evening, we waited for 10 mins or so. The menu is pretty simply and we got the combo dinner which is where you pick a ramen, size, a side and Ajitama ( Ramen egg). The menu has only pork options for meat lovers. I ended up getting the vegetarian Ramen and it was delicious. The broth was super rich and the hot sesame oil was the perfect touch. They do have social distancing guidelines in place and had screens between each table."
5,"RAMEN SOLO

I feel like a ramen Jedi because I used the force in my favor. This place is packed. I walked by on a Friday night and there were 40 people in line. I checked out the menu and I knew I had to eat here. It was now Saturday night and again there were 40 people in line at 6:30pm. It didn&apos;t help that it was January and it was a high of 68, in fact it probably made the line even longer. 

The best part of traveling for work is dining solo and sometimes it has its advantages. While I was in the back of the line the server was looking for just one person and I was the lucky solo that literally got to skip the line. Honestly I was only in line for about 5 minutes. This was my lucky day to Ramen. 

The menu is not very friendly on line and it&apos;s inconsistent because there locations can have different items. They have a great $15 deal where you pick 3 items. I decided to go for it. I wanted to go spicy and decided to order the spicy miso ramen, Cha-Shu Gohan which is Pork and Rice and Aji Tama which is a soft boiled egg marinated in soy-based sauce. The egg was cooked perfectly. The broth for the ramen was crazy good. The menu says the broth takes 18 hours to make from beef bones. The Cha-Shu Gohan was really good. I added spicy broth to it and took it back to my hotel for breakfast. I&apos;m a lucky man. 

The restaurant is tiny. It literally has 18 seats located at 2 tables and 1 bar that faces the kitchen. I was seated at a table of complete strangers. I honestly felt like I was traveling around the world by sharing a community table. Those people finished and I was introduced to a whole new group that joined me. Yes a party of 5 joined me at my table. As I enjoyed my ramen I listened to the girl next to me talk about her upcoming wedding. She shared the planing, the church, the dress and much more. I wanted to jump in but kept focusing on my ramen. The cutest part was when I went to leave she told me to have a nice night. That was really sweet considering we ate dinner together but never had a conversation with each other. I felt a little bad but it&apos;s best I kept quite because they would have never got me to stop talking. 

It is worth the wait. They really serve fast and keep the line moving. My waiter was really nice. I&apos;ve read review that the servers are mean. I have to disagree with this. Hey have a job to do and that is to move people in and out. There was a group of four that had paid their bill and were still hanging out. The waiter politely asked them to leave. He did it in a nice manner but I&apos;m sure someone in the group will write a bad review because the lu felt rushed. I could see that my waiter hates having to do this but it&apos;s the only way he can get diners in. My advice is to know what you want, eat your food, pay your bill and get out. It&apos;s your duty to help your fellow ramen lover waiting in line. I was lucky enough to have to force in my side and I hope you have the same luck that I did when you dine"
4,"This is one of my neighborhood favorites. Their ramen is flavorful, creamy and filling but not in a heavy-I-regret-binging way. 

I&apos;m kind of obsessed with their combo dishes as it&apos;s a fast way to try multiple dishes to fill your tummy and tastebuds. For ramen I like their 
Toroniku goma miso dish which is a perfect combo of savory sesame and miso in creamy tonkotsu broth, topped with menma, kikurage mushrooms, toroniku slices and baby arugula leaves.
As for a non ramen dish I especially enjoy my favorite shiyake ikura gohan which is a rice bowl topped with grilled salmon and fresh salmon roe.  

This is certainly a place worth visiting (repeatedly!)"
5,"I came right on time when there wasn&apos;t a long line outside (and it wasn&apos;t that cold out). We were told it would be around 15 minutes, but we only waited about 10 minutes. There are about 16 seats total - you&apos;d definitely be sitting next to a stranger. I&apos;m not a fan of ramen, but my boyfriend is so I like Santouka (the one in Cambridge) because I would order the salmon over rice with appetizers while he orders ramen. But they didn&apos;t have appetizers here so I gave ramen a try anyways. 

I ordered the Goma Miso Ramen and it ended up being really good! I don&apos;t go for ramen because it&apos;s too heavy for me, but this small bowl of ramen was just perfect. The broth wasn&apos;t too thick but flavorful and the noodles weren&apos;t chalky. My boyfriend ordered the Tokusen Toroniku Ramen and he said he liked it more than the Santouka in Cambridge. My meal also came with butter and corn which tasted like butter and corn so don&apos;t be expecting something amazing. What I really love is how perfect the egg is! It was the perfect soft boiled egg, just drizzle a little soy sauce on top and it was great! 

Overall, a great meal! Definitely quick though if you start feeling bad for the line forming outside the door. I would definitely stop by again if I&apos;m in the area/there isn&apos;t a long line outside."
