5,"Managed to squeeze in at the absolute last minute - can&apos;t believe that we got so lucky! I originally had reservations at the Daily Catch, but messed up the time and missed our reservation. Multiple calls to the restaurant went unanswered, and we were left adrift on a Saturday night. Scrolling through restaurants, I saw that Mamma Maria was taking names for their waitlist, so I signed on. Since we were staying a short walk away, I decided that we should walk over to see if there was a chance of us getting a spot or if we should try our luck for takeout elsewhere. 

The place was absolutely hopping on an October Saturday - even at 8pm their outdoor tables were full. After checking in with the host, we were told that a table wasn&apos;t available, but there were two seats at the bar - would we like those? Would we ever! Full menu, no wait, and the best bartender I&apos;ve had the good fortune to come across in a while. 

They are taking distancing precautions seriously. Masks are required, contact tracing observed, and plexiglass partitions are installed at the bar, both across the bar itself and across the seats, segmenting the sections. We were sat at the end in our own little plastic box; it felt a little odd, but whatever it takes to stay safe!

The service was absolutely phenomenal. I love sitting at the bar, especially when traveling - getting to chat with a local bartender is one of the best ways to get to know a place. Achilles, the bartender on duty, is friendly, personable, and knows his sh*t. We asked him to recommend us a bottle of wine for our meal as well as a third course, and he did not lead us astray. We felt very welcomed and comfortable. 

The food was fantastic. We started off with the carpaccio with generous shavings of delicate black truffle, the flavors mingling perfectly without overpowering one another. Our second course was the rabbit sugo pasta, creamy and rich; we sipped on a nice Italian red throughout. After we finished our dishes, I declared that I could go for a few more bites, and Achilles recommended the osso bucco. We complied, and I have no regrets, although things get a bit fuzzy at that point (I blame the wine). We opted to skip dessert, instead choosing to split a glass of champagne as a palate cleanser. 

The cost of the meal - three plates, a bottle of wine, and a glass of champagne - was incredibly reasonable. Among the Italian restaurants in the North End, many of which are excellent, Mamma Maria is an absolute standout. I can&apos;t recommend it highly enough. Sit at the bar, especially if Achilles is on duty - he&apos;ll take good care of you."
5,"I can&apos;t say enough about this place. This is defiantly a higher end restaurant and perfect for a special occasion. Both the food and the service was phenomenal. We were late to making a reservation, and we all know with COVID it&apos;s a must these days. They found a way to rearrange their seating and fit us in. The atmosphere was beautiful. We went in October and they had a romantic fall aesthetic, and our seats had a beautiful view of Boston. 

As the dinner went on, the food just kept getting better and better. We started with the baked oysters (a MUST! They may have been my favorite), and the lamb pumpkin gnocchi and both really set the tone for the meal. Delicious. For our main course, we had the &quot;pasta con sugo&quot; - similar to a bolognese, but like.... better if that&apos;s possible. It was all the rave, can&apos;t say enough about it. As someone who comes from Italian heritage and prides themselves in Italian cooking and cuisine, this is one of the best experiences in Italian dining I have ever had. Every time I am in Boston, I will make it a point to come here. 

There menu is seasonal, and changes almost every day so be sure to try one of their specials! It won&apos;t disappoint."
5,"This is a great spot in the north end with excellent food! Very covid friendly compared to some of the spots on Hanover, tables are spaced out enough where you feel safe &amp; space heaters by every table. Service was exceptional, and server very accommodating and helpful. The menu changes every night, but they were willing to make us with cacio e Pepe, which we had seen on the online menu, but wasn&apos;t on the actual menu when we arrived. The atmosphere is adorable, perfect for a family dinner, a date, a friends gathering, people coming to visit the area (really anything). There atmosphere is top notch, so cute, and a great view from every angle. Feel like you are in Italy! Would highly recommend for all ages!"
5,"Finding an Italian restaurant in the Boston&apos;s North End isn&apos;t the hard part but finding the &quot;right&quot; one might be.  There are so many worthy ones but we are foodies and don&apos;t want to end up at a tourist attraction for our only meal in the neighborhood.  Upon many hours of research we ended up at Mamma Maria&apos;s.  We are also pickier about Italian cuisine than most because we find this cuisine to be the most overdone and pedestrian at many places.  That being said our meal here was over the top.  Every single aspect was exquisite down to even our wine selection.  

We started with the carpaccio with local arugula, shaved black truffles, capers and parmesan.  The freshness of all the ingredients just leapt off the plate.  We followed that with the rabbit pasta and the ossobuco.  The rabbit was cooked Tuscan-style with the freshest homemade pappardelle perfectly cooked al dente.  The crispy pancetta added to the richness of the sauce and the rosemary was ever present.  

The ossobuco is the house specialty from what I hear and you would be hard pressed to find any better.  It was mouthwateringly tender over a bed of risotto.  My wife found the risotto to be a little to al dente for her liking but I liked the consistency with such tender veal.  I literally could have crawled in to that plate and spent the night.  And it didn&apos;t even need to buy me a drink!!!!

Next time we venture to Boston and the North End we won&apos;t feel the need to try any place other than Mamma Maria!

ps - my apologies for such bad pictures.  We must have been drunk with culinary delight!"
4,"Great Italian restaurant in Boston. Last year I learned how Boston is known for great Italian food. Who knew?? We were starving and made a last min reservation here. Friendly service and nice atmosphere. We ordered calamari  and octopus( amazing), stuffed oysters( amazing ), burata ( ok), lobster ravioli( amazing), corn ravioli ( outstanding), ragu( great), and seafood stew( yum). 
Overall it&apos;s highly recommended. I would come again."
3,"Great ambience and service, especially during COVID-19. I think Mamma Maria has the best outdoor dining setup in the north end! 

I think I just prefer homey, huge portioned Italian meals in the north end. I did like the inventive menu here, with locally sourced ingredients. Nothing really blew me out of the water though, especially as I don&apos;t eat pasta too much anymore and thought my first bites of rabbit pasta were going to be heavenly!"
3,"I was really excited to try out this restaurant, however I can&apos;t say I had the best experience here.  I came on a Thursday night to meet up with friends who were from out town.  Upon arrival to the restaurant, there was a long line to talk to the hostess, and it seemed like the restaurant had completely over booked itself. We had reservations and the hostess quickly told us our table would not be ready for at least twenty minutes.   We chose to sit inside instead which was fine, but not what we had reserved.

For starters we had the calamari.  It was good and flavorful, but a small serving size.  For my main dish I had the summer ravioli.  The sauce on top was light and flavorful.  However the ravioli had corn on the inside, which I didn&apos;t love.  Other people in our party ordered the rabbet pasta and ragu which they also enjoyed. 

I was slightly disappointed that their menu did not reflect the menu they had online...there were dishes I was looking forward to that I wasn&apos;t able to order (specifically the burrata pasta).  Overall, this wasn&apos;t the best experience I have had in the North End.  The menu was overpriced and limited, and the food wasn&apos;t out of this world.  I&apos;m not mad I tried it out, but don&apos;t feel the need to come back for a while."
5,"Wow!!!! First of all, let me start with the service. Our waiter Ovi, was so kind and nice! Great to chat it up with him and he was refilling our wine glasses.  

Second, the food!!! We had the warm tomato and burrata which was delicious. Nice start to our incredible dinner. I believe their menu changes so we had the squash ravioli and the pasta con sugo. So good. Excellent flavor, homemade, truly GREAT pasta. I wish I had taken a picture of my food because it was also beautifully plated. Last but not least, ordered the tiramisu ! So good. 

Ambience was perfect, they have outdoor seating and everyone was wearing masks and just a beautiful night in Boston. Highly recommend and will definitely be back."
5,"Absolutely fantastic. Safe covid precautions. Wonderful views and intimate homey and yet upscale ambience. Impeccable and attentive service. Large menu with great vegetarian options (more than what&apos;s listed on the website), and true care and love - they gave us a complimentary dessert with a candle and we just mentioned it in passing. Normally I always have to make a special request for a candle. Osso bucco was great as was the mushroom papardelle and burrata. One of the best meals we&apos;ve had in the north end."
5,I loved this pace! Great food and service. My mother was visiting North End the first time and she enjoyed her time in this restaurant a lot. It was a good call.
5,"I had dinner here on a hot Monday night in July, during the pandemic.  The (temporary) outdoor dining situation they have set up is really something special.  They have tables setup in North Square park.  Plenty of space between all the tables allowing for an ambiance that is very rare to find.  

The service was fantastic. Side note: The restaurant was not busy during our visit, this aided is allowing us to feel like royalty.  Knowledgable wait staff and perfect timing for checking in.  

The food was wonderful.  All created in house and to perfection, in my opinion.  We did not leave a drop of food on our plates."
5,Excellent outdoor set up for the pandemic. The service is spectacular and the food quality is top. Mamma Maria is far better than all the tourist trap restaurants on Hanover street. I will be back soon
4,"Mamma Maria is a superb, and I strongly recommend it. Excellent mood, and service is quick. Mamma Maria has an excellent Meatballs, give it a try I believe you would really love it, I certainly love it. The servers are very helpful and polite. Mamma Maria... Can&apos;t ask for more."
5,"First time visit for an anniversary dinner and the meal was amazing, atmosphere was romantic, and service was outstanding. Will be coming back here for more date nights!"
4,"Very good, if slightly pricey experience, this evening at Mamma Maria which is located in Boston&apos;s North End but slightly off the regular beaten track of Hanover Street.

I booked on Open Table and we were immediately seated when we arrived on time. A nice two-top table upstairs (I think this is a converted home) not far from the bar.

Great service starting with a hearty bread that looked delicious and I skipped as it&apos;s not on my eating regime. Burrata as appetizer was a smaller portion but looking delicious and tasting better.

Mamma Maria does not have a &quot;specials&quot; list because everything on the menu is prepared from that day&apos;s purchases. So I decided on the &quot;Bistecca alla Fiorentina&quot; which was a good sized steak (I opted for not the bone-in), grilled to medium rare and served with eggplant, sea beans and spring vegetables. When it arrived, it was cooked exactly right and I dug in to a delicious large cut of meat that needed nothing additional. Flavorful and firm. Yum.

No dessert for me, but I did bring my dining companion over to Mike&apos;s for a canoli.

5,"Wow! What a gem this place is.  The location is perfect.  Cobblestones on the road will guide you to this old house turned to restaurant.  There are 4-5 rooms which hosts a small number of people, making it feel very cozy.   The food was super delicious and the wine spectacular.   They have an immense list of Italian wines.  

I went there to celebrate a birthday and the staff (Rafael) was able to accommodate a surprise dessert with candle and everything.   

There is valet parking ($27) which is perfect to avoid the hassle of finding parking in the North End."
5,"Amazing dinner with impeccable service.  Was blown away when we were sat down in a private room overlooking North Sq. Great bottle of Red that was immediately decanted. Our time was limited that evening , but will make another trip real soon. 

A big shout out to Jennifer who opened my eyes to a hidden gem!"
5,Not going to be the cheapest place in the North End. I live on Hanover Street and as a local it is the best high end restaurant in the neighborhood for special nights. They provide a small dessert with your celebration highlighted. Most recently I had the octopus to start and the pasta con sugo. Also tried the halibut which was excellent. There are very few low end wine options. Nice outdoor patio with heaters in the heart of the North End in a quaint little square across from the Paul Revere house.
4,"Lovely, cute, cozy (even crowded) North End Italian restaurant.  Definitely recommended for folks touring in Boston and want to experience the North End Italian scene.  Book early as it fills up fast.  We had a great waiter.  The food varied from amazing (an off-menu pasta with truffles that we noticed our neighbors eating) to very good (the carpaccio) to could have been better (the veal milanese was really brown or crunchy and the meat was kind fatty -- never I ate it and it was good; just not what I&apos;d hoped for.)  My advice:  go here, and ask the waiter what to order as it seems a bit more variable than most."
3,"I had very high hopes for Mamma Maria. While the decor, vibe, and staff were all very enjoyable the food fell short. One highlight was the complimentary pesto, olives and bread. We consulted the waitress about the wine and she suggested a wonderful red to pair with our pasta and spicy osso buco. Make note the menu does change daily, so maybe we went on a night when nothing really drew my excitement. 

We started with the salami plate. It came with a variety of salami and some parmesan flakes. I ordered this pasta with North Carolina shrimp and sweet corn. The pasta had very to little taste. I topped with with fresh pepper and cheese, but it really needed more salt. The osso bucco was okay. The meat was incredibly tender but the dish was also missing something. The crispy vegetable chips were a fun addition, and the risotto was cooked correctly."
