5,"Row 34 made the best of the lockdown, and offered the most amazing lobster roll dinner kits, which made for a magical night! The pickup was super organized and the kit itself contained everything: directions, lobster, roll, even celery salt and butter! It also came with delish cookies, cole slaw, and chips. 

Putting together the lobster roll was a cool experience and made for a way more fresh dinner than if it had been assembled and delivered, not to mention how amazing it tasted! The lobster salad was really fresh and the potato roll was very fragrant, especially after toasting with butter. What a wonderful idea!"
5,"Stopped by for a late lunch on Saturday, because we noticed the outdoor seating was covered and lined with heat lamps on the perimeter. The weather was 46 degrees and overcast, so with the right jacket and shoes you&apos;ll be able to dine comfortably outside.

It&apos;s very clear Row 34 is doing everything they can to comply with COVID safety measures - dining tables are spaced comfortably apart, and staff are wiping down every surface (chairs/tables) between seatings.

If Row 34 is struggling right now, the meal service doesn&apos;t show it. The food is equally as fresh and thoughtful as it was pre-COVID. Row 34 does an incredible job serving high quality food.... it was also nice to hear other tables around us commenting on how much they enjoyed their meal.

We very much look forward to dining here again!"
5,"I&apos;m excited to report that despite not being able to dine there because of COVID-19, I was able to order via Caviar the Fish and Chips and it was delivered hot and so so delicious. The portion was so big I had to cut the fish in half to fit on my plate. They give you all the sauces you could possibly want, and the meal itself is worth every penny. I just needed a bigger stomach. Wearing this food made our week and I&apos;m excited to order again soon."
5,"Loved this spot! Oysters were incredible. I&apos;ve gradually been getting into oysters and these were the cleanest best tasting oysters (minus Mookie blues, I wasn&apos;t a fan). Pimiento shrimp was also delicious. My one critique was the fish was a bit bland in the fish and chips, but lemon and salt really made it better.

Would come back if I ever found myself in Boston again."
4,"COVID-19 restrictions: indoor dining limited to 90 mins and masks must be worn at all times except when actively eating/drinking.

Row 34 always offers such a great atmosphere.

My favorites:
1. New England clam chowder  - portioned to be a single serving with just the right amount of cracked pepper, diced potatoes and clam chunks. The perfect soup to have on a cold Boston day.
2. Tuna crudo - my favorite, a fresh buttery cut bedding by a savory sauce and garnished with lime and avocado
3.  Pasta and calms - yummy, feels like it&apos;s missing cracked pepper, but that&apos;s just my preference. That&apos;s just my personal modifier.
4. A must order - fresh oysters
    *Island Creek - the quintessential East Coast oyster experience. My personal favorite. An upfront butter and brine flavor with a mix of salt.
    *Aunt Dotty - light and sweet brine that fades into a minerally finish. I&apos;ve been told these are a close relative to Island Creek.
The others -
    Cold bottom - light refreshing
    Row 34 - meaty
    Moon shoal - brine
    Puffers - small"
3,"We had high hopes for Row 34, but warm buttered lobster roll we ordered just fell flat.  It had NO seasoning whatsoever, it needed salt or something and is definitely NOT worth $29.  The fresh potato chips that came with it were cooked perfectly.  We asked our server who was cool, between the fish &amp; chips or the lobster roll, and she said definitely the lobster roll, hmmmm.

Anywho, the cocktail drink choice, was not really there or impressive.  Basically, what you see is what you get on the menu, they can&apos;t make any custom drinks.

Overall, this place is alright, and that is all it will get from me.  Maybe they have other food items that are good, but what we ordered, wasn&apos;t.  The 3rd star was for the good service we had, the first two was for the lobster roll and drinks."
3,"I&apos;ve been meaning to post this review for a while...

We came here on a Thursday night and it was pretty dang busy!! So, we thought we&apos;d give it a try. Everything was average to say the least. 

I was so excited when I pulled up their yelp and saw lobster rolls. YUM!! I knew I couldn&apos;t leave Boston without having one. Here&apos;s everything we ordered:

CLAM CHOWDER: I love some good clam chowder. Like I&apos;ll order it almost anytime I see it. This was a bit disappointing to me - mostly because I barely had any clam! I think I had maybe a piece or two in the entire bowl. Super disappointing. [Rating: 2/10]

CORNBREAD: who doesn&apos;t love some skillet cornbread?! And it comes out with a mountain of their maple butter. We. Were. Excited...... until we realized the cornbread was room temp at best. Still good texture, but it was also a little sweet for my liking (even without the butter). I&apos;m sure it&apos;s better when it&apos;s hot, or warm at the very least.  [Rating: 5/10] 

CALAMARI: I&apos;m not a huge fan of fried food not being crispy. While there were some crispy pieces, some of the calamari was also pretty soggy. Overall the flavor was still decent. [Rating: 6/10]

BUTTERED LOBSTER ROLL: I was SO excited to try this, and honestly it was just okay. Nothing really impressed me about it for $32!! They do give you a pretty decent amount of lobster, which is nice. But it wasn&apos;t anything I&apos;d have to come back for. I also wish I had the option to change the kettle chips to French fries. I&apos;m not a huge kettle chips person. [Rating: 6/10]

Overall it wasn&apos;t a terrible place, but there are a lot of other restaurants in Boston!"
3,"A friend recommended coming here instead of Island Hog and I left the night feeling meh about the decision. We made a reservation and showed up a bit early but ended up being seated 30 minutes before our scheduled time so the service was very on point. 

The restaurant specializes on fried fish plates, fresh fish entrees, and oysters so I ordered the fish to get a taste of what they&apos;re known for. Surprisingly, the burger that my friend ordered was much better than my fish. 

Unfortunately, a lot of our plates were also extra salty so we actually sent back a couple of them. I never am one to send back but my friend really couldn&apos;t handle the salt so felt compelled to ask for a replacement. The server was very accommodating and even gave us some snacks to nibble on as my friend waited for her replacement but it was hard to get rid of the lingering salty feeling. 

It was still a fun experience and I&apos;d come back but I&apos;d probably get the burger next time..."
5,"This is 100% my favorite stop in Boston! Possibly my favorite on the east coast?! 

The food is always fresh and well seasoned without being overly rich. I could honestly just come and order 5 tuna crudos (black garlic aioli is worthy of a poetry tribute) but the talented staff always helps me put together a meal that&apos;s far better than that! 

My most recent visit we had Gabe as our server and he helped us decide on a bunch of share plates instead of getting entrees (in my opinion this is THE MOVE at the restaurant too many good raw bar options and apps!) We went with the tuna crudo, salmon poke, brussels sprouts, fried calamari, scallop ceviche and some oysters topped w caviar because...why not add the caviar! 

As always the tuna was a total stand out and the scallop ceviche was a surprise second, plantain chips...I never knew I was such a fan! The pieces of apple in the ceviche are super refreshing and crisp, I ended up dipping calamari in the left over ceviche juice because it was too good to let it go!! My friend loved the brussels sprouts and was still raving about them the next morning. 

The calamari was seasoned well but compared to everything else, it was just....fine. That togarashi aioli tho, so good, there&apos;s someone on staff that knows their way around an aioli for sure. 

Gabe helped my friend pick a wine that she loved and helped me get my hands on my favorite beer, Orval, even though the computer said they were out of it. Truly saved the dayyy. 

We had the apple crisp for dessert and it was just ok, I&apos;d probably skip it next time in favor of one more beer from their extensive list. 

You do need a reservation pretty much any night of the week to be sat in a timely fashion. We came in a little early hoping to slide into an open table and the hostess (I think her name was savannah) was super helpful with getting us on the waitlist and letting us know she would give us a text while we got a drink around the corner. 

Super helpful. Super delicious. Have yet to have an even slightly disappointing experience after 6 or so times dining here."
4,"It&apos;s a fancy place. We were offered to check our coats in or bring them with us to our table. We ordered the crab cake, calamari, mackerel pastrami, tuna crudo, clam chowder, lobster roll, and the cornbread. The portion sizes were surprisingly very big so I would but recommend ordering as much as we did unless you have a larger party or if you can eat all of it. 

The crab cake comes with an aioli that is delicious. It also comes with guac and a small salad that is very tart. The aioli really added flavor to the crab cake. The calamari is soft and a little spicy because it&apos;s fried with jalapenos. Some of the breading of the calamari would fall off. The mackerel pastrami came with creme fresh. It cut through the saltiness of the mackerel, but I did not really like the dish. The clam chowder had fresh herbs in it that added extra flavor to the chowder. It was good. The lobster roll was greasy. The roll itself was too thick and too much bread so I ended up just eating the lobster which was fine. The chips were good. The tuna crudo was nothing special. The cornbread with maple butter was good. They make butter enhanced the cinnamon and sweetness of the cornbread."
2,"Been coming here for some years now. I always recommended folks to try the lobster rolls. 

There was a time, long ago, they were delicious.

A couple sitting next to us asked about them and I couldn&apos;t lie to them. 

Something has has changed!

Im not going to suggest anyone pay $34 on a sad roll. You&apos;ll be mad at me. I had to be honest to them. They ordered it anyways because my husband insisted. I got outta there before they could blame their underwhelming meal on me. Tried to told y&apos;all.

The buttered roll is horrible. Besides the large amount of lobster they &quot; used to&quot; stuff the roll in- the roll was a crisp, light, buttery bread. It&apos;s been half the size of the usual roll to now a bad tasting, bulky, dry roll. 

It was a shock to my taste buds taking that first bite. Unbelievable.

I wasn&apos;t going to complain because the last time I went and they &quot; ran out of rolls&quot; the manager gave me her card and ensured our next meal would be back to normal.

The lies!

A whole year later and it&apos;s not true.

Went home sad and hungry. 

They still have a delicious selection of beer, great ambiance and good music. Tried the Madonna last night and it was fruity and very tasty.

Still a sad day because I only come for the warm buttered lobster rolls."
5,"DINNER REVIEW

After living in Boston for over a year, I had heard so many good things about the seafood over at Row 34 and I finally made it out. This place is typical Seaport. High-ceilings, loud, lively ambiance, good-looking people wanting to see and be seen. That&apos;s not to detract from the food but just expect this type of experience when you come here. Don&apos;t expect to get seated right away either, this place gets busy. We had to wait 20 minutes even with a reservation.

FOOD: I&apos;ve said it before and I&apos;ll say it again. I love the small menu that this place has. It&apos;s both diverse and shows that they focus on a few good things. We ordered a lot so I will break it down into what we would order again and what we wouldn&apos;t.

What I would get again (you can tell it was a good meal by the majority of items being in this category):

Tuna Crudo - Do yourself a favor and just get this. It&apos;s one of the best things I&apos;ve eaten in a long time. The fish melts in your mouth and whatever it sits on top of is delicious.

Crispy Brussels Sprouts - some of the best-fried brussels sprouts I&apos;ve ever had. I feel like these are &quot;in&quot; right now and Row 34 does them so well.

Crab Cake - my friend who is a self-proclaimed crab cake connaisseur said this is one of the best ones he&apos;s ever had.

Croquettes - I typically don&apos;t like croquettes but these Salt-Pollock croquettes were delicious, just the right balance of fish and everything else.

Lobster Rolls - ok these probably are not worth $34 for the amount of lobster you get on them but they are still good. The buttered and toasted rolls they come on are delicious and the lobster is obviously fresh. We got both the brown butter version and the classic version and I was surprised that I liked the cold, classic version better. I just like that it comes with more elements than the warm butter version.

What I would skip:

- Onion Rings - Nothing special, I wish they were a bit crispier

- The desserts - we got both the apple crisp which was honestly underwhelming (apples were on the harder side) and the chocolate chip cookies were warm but they weren&apos;t special either. Save dessert for elsewhere.

Overall, a great experience and when friends are in town and wanting to have some fresh seafood in a lively environment, I&apos;ll take them to Row 34."
5,"This was our pit stop for lunch on our road trip to Portland, Maine last weekend, and it turned out to be my favorite dining experience of the trip. 

First impressions, the staff were so handsome/pretty they look like they could belong in a Broadway ensemble, but without the New York attitude. The delivered a California-easiness with a Boston prep aesthetic.

It has been a decade since I have been in New England outside of New York, and I was surprised by how good the oysters were - the freshness was incredibly obvious. I liked their house oyster best and Eider Cove best. Their house oyster was sweet and plump like a Kumamoto, and though I don&apos;t typically like briny oysters, Eider Cove had an added complexity in taste that I adored. 

Everything on the menu used Asian/Latin spices and/or ingredients, and that transformed usually straightforward seafood dishes into something quite special. I liked the scallop ceviche the most - the addition of incredibly crisp pickled apples and jicama brightened up the dish considerably, and I just kept munching on the apples soaked in citrus. The brussels sprouts were also quite delicious - the crisp permeated its many layers and the pairing with a spicy aioli was something different. 

1. Oysters (Row 34, Island Creek, Fat Dog, Eider Cove, Cadillac Mountain, East Cape)
2. New England Clam Chowder (house saltine, bacon)
3. Shrimp Bisque (crème fraîche, croutons)
4. Tuna Tartare (sesame, cucumber, lime)
5. Salmon Poke (brown rice, gochugaru chili, scallion)
6. Scallop Ceviche (jicama, apple, Fresno)
7. Steamed Mussels (coconut milk, saffron, fennel)
8. Crispy Calamari (jalapeno)
9. Crispy Brussels Sprouts (red pepper aioli)"
3,"I have been here twice for dinner on a weekend, and both times, the food took more than 30min to come. The first time, the food came out 45min after ordering, and the appetizers, entrees, and dessert for everyone at the table came all at once. The manager came to apologize while we were waiting and also helped bring out the food when it was ready. It wasn&apos;t particularly busy that night, so we thought they just made a mistake for our table only or forgot to put in our order. The tables around us that were seated after us all got their food before us too. 

The second time we were here, we also ordered oysters and a pâté and cheese board for appetizers, and those came out promptly. However, everyone&apos;s entrees also came out 30min after. We were very much finished with our appetizers by then, and the tables around us that came around the same time/later than us all got their food already too. We&apos;re not sure why there was such a wait for us specifically this time as well, but we were quite disappointed with the service. 

The food was good though and would have gotten 4 stars. Everything was fresh, and the seasoning/preparation all paired nicely with the seafood. We definitely recommend ordering from their list of fresh oysters, the pâté board, scallops, and &quot;daily whole fish&quot;. We ordered the caviar roll too, and their caviar supplier was doing some sort of promotion. One of their reps (?) came after we paid the bill and gave us some limited edition caviar pins that were kind of cute. You can collect all 6 if you buy caviar at their restaurant and stores."
2,"All of the food we ordered was pretty mediocre. I didn&apos;t pay for the meal, but I think if I paid for it I would be sorely disappointed. The service is fine, but I waited quite a while to get my water refilled. We ended up sitting inside, which isn&apos;t nearly as nice as sitting on the patio on a warm summer night. At least you can make reservations here!

We ordered the calamari, lobster roll, fish and chips, tacos, tuna avocado crudo, Mexican corn, and onion rings. My lobster roll was the most disappointing - so much mayo, and the bread was not buttered correctly; the bread was actually very dry and I could not finish it. The calamari was a little disappointing too, since the breading came off too easily and it was pretty salty. Finally; while the tuna dish was good, they really didn&apos;t need to slightly cook/char it. It would&apos;ve been delicious on its own, as I am a huge proponent of letting fresh seafood &quot;sing&quot; for itself."
5,"Amazing staff, amazing food and awesome beer selection. I make it a point to visit Row 34 every time I&apos;m in town. Oysters are always phenomenal, and their lobster roll is to die for. SUPPORT LOCAL BUSINESSES"
4,"This restaurant in the Seaport area of Boston is a bustling joint that touts their seafood. 
That being said, I got the Bacon Cheddar Burger with fried oysters. This was not your average burger. The burger was a perfect temp and juicy. The combo of togarashi aioli, caramelized onions, and fried  oysters created an umami flavor bomb. The bun hung on for dear life but mostly held together. And it came with nice crisp matchstick fries.
My wife got the Crispy Fish Tacos. They were indeed crispy. Simple but executed well.
The service was great and the food came out timely."
5,"SO GOOD. Row 34 is one of my favorite restaurants in Boston. Their seafood dishes can&apos;t be compared to most places, it&apos;s just that good. 

The tuna tartare is so fresh but delicious. Everything we got from the raw bar was great. But the tuna crudo was particularly excellent. It seems so simple but is packed with flavor. 

Another star of the night was the cornbread. Served in its own cast iron skillet, huge hunk of maple butter on top, it&apos;s absolutely delicious. One of the best cornbreads I&apos;ve ever had. 

The staff was all super helpful as well. So knowledgeable and excited about their wine selections. They were happy to chat about making the right selection with us."
4,"Glad I had the chance to come here after seeing exceptional reviews for this place. I even tried making a reservation 28 days out or however long one needed to, and couldn&apos;t get one. 

All in all, a great dining experience. The calamari was good, slightly salty. I got the bacon cheddar cheeseburger and it was delicious. The French fries and pickles alongside to boot were awesome. My girlfriend got the fish tacos and she raved about them. I think by far though you have to try to elote. Unfortunately I don&apos;t have a picture but this was by far my favorite things on the menu."
4,"Nice spot for a lobster roll in a classy but not fancy atmosphere. 

I got the buttered lobster roll and it was loaded with fresh lobster. The butter came on the side which I appreciated so it didn&apos;t get soggy by the time I was on the last bites. The chips were also pretty tasty and seemed to be made fresh in house.

Solid spot and would return next time in the area!"
