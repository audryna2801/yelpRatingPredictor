4,I&apos;m glad they are able to operate with Covid. Our seats were right by the wide windows that look out to the water. I got a Caesar salad and sushi pretty basic but still good. My date had a shrimp and rice set up that looked good as well. Everyone&apos;s table was pretty spaced out which made me feel a lot better about social distancing and eating inside.
4,I&apos;m going to be honest and tell you now I don&apos;t like clam chowder and fish or anything like that at all. But I&apos;m in Boston and I had to give it the old college try. It was too fishy for me but my buddy ate both mine and his and loved it. The service was prompt and our waiter was fantastic. I loved the location near the waterfront it was really pretty with lots of outdoor seating to enjoy the beautiful summer weather! For those looking to enjoy good authentic tasty Boston seafood this is your place. I&apos;ll be in the corner with my chicken sandwich
5,"Legal Seafood is such a Bostonian classic!  We went last weekend and sat on the patio up on the third floor-- so great!  We loved being outside, right on the water; and our waitress could not have been nicer!

Between seared scallops, friend calamari, good beer and wine, the &quot;classic platter&quot; of crab cakes, shrimp and scallops...  Really, you just can&apos;t go wrong!  We were sad to hear that they are being sold (another covid casualty!), but we hope that the new management keeps this Boston classic as good as it has always been!

ps- The shrimpy mary is also awesome if you like a good Bloody!  ;)

pps- One of the funnier moments of the evening was my husband discovering that his seat cushion was a little wet... hence the photos of the laughter."
5,"Under new ownership and armed with a new menu, The Legal Seafood at the Wharf will not disappoint.  I ordered the Seared Maine Scallops with bacon jam along with sweet potato purée and ancho chilies.   This entree is found on the Legal Seafood Test kitchen menu.   These by far are the best scallops I&apos;ve ever had and highly recommend.  But as good as the scallops are, our waiter Rick was even better!   Personable, knowledgeable, attentive and a wealth of knowledge regarding the menu and seafood as well.   

With great food and waiters like Rick, you can&apos;t go wrong."
1,"I&apos;ve been going to the various Legal Seafoods since the late 80&apos;s when I had hair... It&apos;s always been solid; on some occasions, just shy of excellent. 

Fast forward to today. My hair is gone and Legal Seafood was meh. I&apos;m not sure if it&apos;s because changes in the kitchen staff due to Covid or what, but seriously &quot;meh.&quot;

We haven&apos;t been in person in a restaurant since this whole Covid thing hit, so this was going to be a special birthday treat. Now the location, probably one of the best places in town to get outdoor deck seating with a great view of the harbour. After that.., well..

For an appetizer, we ordered fried calamari. It was so super greasy. I&apos;m not sure if they had their oil hot enough or it was sitting around for a long time. The chowder? It was consistent; as good as always. But then again, the chowder isn&apos;t made on sight and comes from a central kitchen somewhere (else).

On to the entrees...
The &quot;Buffalo Shrimp Mac&apos;n&apos;Cheese&quot; was decent enough. I think it was nice to get once; not sure I&apos;d get it again. The BLT sushi wrap (with tuna) was ok. Having eaten a fair bit of sushi in my day, I&apos;d say it was average.

The fish&apos;n&apos;chips? Disappointed. For starters the fish tasted kind of old and lacked flavour. Using some lemon helped. The fries? Yikes! The were so old and dried out, my son commented that he couldn&apos;t find any potato in them. They were sitting around for &quot;long&quot; time. 

Normally, I would have said something about the meal, but I didn&apos;t want to make a big deal because it was a special event and first time out in many months. 

Definitely won&apos;t be going back here. There are a lot better places in town to get good seafood, even if they don&apos;t share the same awesome view."
5,"My first experience at a Legal sea foods did not disappoint! We had the best time, amidst the freezing temperatures we enjoyed one of the best clam chowders I&apos;ve ever had! And the muscles were so delicious, the brine was Inhaled with the delicious bread they gave us with the meal. And that beer!!! I am a huge fan of IPAs and this one from MA did NOT disappoint!"
5,"Great seafood restaurant, fresh food, nice view, friendly staff, the location is excellent. My fiancé and I had a great time. Highly recommended!"
3,"Waitstaff was friendly.. sanitation of tables and work stations were good.  
Food.. seafood platter most was over done except for the fish. The fish was wicked slimey and the batter was under cooked...Ceasar salad was good but they make their own dressing so not the same for some people..my granddaughter got tenders and the apple they put on her plate look disgusting bruised and broken, which also brought a fruit fly to our table
Key lime pie was okay...chocolate bon bons were yummy..."
4,"Came here for their love of butter lobster rolls, they were pricey, but filled with big chunks of lobster meat. 

They have lots of beer and wine options and we took advantage of those options, it felt like a good day for some beers and barely legal seafood. 

Our one friend wasn&apos;t a fan of lobster or oysters so he opted for his mother country&apos;s staple food, fish and chips, or as we refer to them lovingly as fries. 

The lobster rolls were rich in butter and lovely with each bite. Could have eaten a second one but one was enough. My friend enjoyed his fish and chips. Can you really mess up fish and chips? We also had some starter dishes and they were also good too."
5,"Came here to try the lobster roll and boy was it the best in Boston. My wife and I tried 5 different places from casual to fine dining and Legal Sea Foods topped our list for hot buttery lobster rolls.

The red sangria was sweet and good and the Sam Adams Lager was nice and cold. The crab cake was moist and tasty as well as the citrusy flavored salad. My only wish would be that the fries were more crisp when plated with the lobster roll, but that was minor compared to the star lobster roll. 

Definitely worth a taste... Of the wicked good lahbsta"
3,"I used to come here as a college student, but back then I could only afford it on special occasions because it broke my bank.

Now that I&apos;m older and can afford it I can&apos;t say it has the same special appeal it used to have.  The clam chowder is still one of the best in town. If you like the commercial variety that is starchy and uses sea clams.  Good &quot;clammy-flavor&quot;.  But Down East in Maine it&apos;s more sour-milk based, and they use little necks or small steamers.

For old time&apos;s sake I ordered the Baked Scrod.  It&apos;s kind of like going into an Italian place and ordering spaghetti and meatballs.  If you can&apos;t get the basics done right, then I&apos;m not coming back.  So the Baked Scrod just didn&apos;t seem fresh.  I believe the white fish of the day was cod.  Just mediocre, and the breading could have been more buttery and crunchy.  Sorry Legal Sea Foods, your stock went way down in my book.  I&apos;d only come back for another bowl of the chowdah."
2,"Simply not worth it. I&apos;m slowly learning to trust my gut. I had high expectations because of the price &amp; listing on trip advisor. A lot of people seemed to have good experiences at this restaurant, so I ignored my gut feeling (overpriced, unseasoned, small portion sizes) and decided to eat here anyway. 

I ate 2 scallops and some green beans before I took this photo. I stoped to take a photo after realizing my order was basic, just passing as edible.... hence 2 stars for trying. I ate my meal but in all honesty the presentation was lacking, the flavor was non existent, and the food wasn&apos;t even hot. The best part of the meal was the french fries. I should have just ordered french fries. I would have been happy with just the french fries &amp; that&apos;s sad. I wouldn&apos;t want anyone else to have the same experience as me. So if you read this review, and still decide to eat here (don&apos;t eat here) I recommend ordering the french fries - they did one thing right.

I shard my experience with my waitress, and she agreed  the food is not seasoned well.... also blamed it on COVID ... I don&apos;t see how the two are related but okay... 

I ordered the Grilled scallops and that&apos;s exactly what I got. No garlic butter, side of lemon, or lemon drizzle... just plain grilled scallops with salt. The green beans had a similar problem. They were likely tossed in lightly salted butter and nothing else. So if you like bland food, maybe this would be a 5 star experience for you, but it wasn&apos;t for me. 

After leaving the restaurant I made my way to Quincy Market. Upon arrival, I realized I made a mistake and we should have gone to the market before eating dinner. The market had better options, and faster service. Ended up ordering a lobster roll and clam chowder at a nice spot inside the market. I genuinely enjoyed it. I&apos;ll be back in the morning to take pictures and write a review."
4,"Stopped by for dinner after the aquarium and had a wonderful dinner before heading up north. I got 6 oysters and a lobster roll for lunch. The lobster roll said market price which is quite a nerve wracking thing to see on the menu. Ended up being $30 or so for the roll. The lobster was cooked in butter and served on a warm roll. It was definitely delicious but not the best lobster roll I&apos;ve had, especially at that price. The oysters were delicious and served with a nice array of sauces. 

We also got the crab dip to split and it was served with some weird rice chip, which was odd but the dip was very good. Definitely enjoyed everything but certainly could have been better."
3,"Food: 3
Service: 4.5
Ambience: 4

I recently visited Boston with my husband and daughter (for the first time) and all we wanted was to find a good seafood place. We decided to try this place since it was across from our hotel and was also near the aquarium where we also went to. We tried the following:

Lobster Bisque 
New England Clam Chowder
Lobster Roll (warm)
Buffalo Popcorn Shrimp

Both the bisque and clam chowder were good and it is definitely worth getting. My husband and I ended up trying New England clam chowder at three different places during our stay in Boston and this place had the best of the three (the other two places were State Street Provisions, which is next door, and Union Oyster House).

I was unfortunately not a fan of the lobster roll. We are used to Cousins Maine Lobster and it didn&apos;t compare. We were really shocked and a little disappointed. 

The buffalo popcorn shrimp wasn&apos;t awful, but they should have just incorporated the buffalo sauce on the shrimp somehow and garnished it with the bleu cheese. Instead the shrimp is served in a popcorn box/container that you see at the old school movie theater and then a small cup of buffalo sauce (tasted like the sauce from buffalo wings). The best part of this dish was the shrimp. 

We went around lunch time and it was naturally getting pretty busy. We were seated almost immediately though. We had our travel stroller with us (Summer Infant 3D lite) and we were able to bring it to the table with us. If you sit near the window, there will be an area for your stroller. Otherwise, many families parked their strollers at the front of the restaurant.

The service was really great. Despite how busy it got, the service never lacked. 

Overall, it wasn&apos;t a bad place to stop by if you are looking for a place to eat quickly, but if you have other places you want to eat in Boston, go to those first."
5,We ordered a Tuna appetizer crab roll and salmon teriyaki burger. Also a spicy habonera margarita. The food was delish. The service was excellent. Even during COVID they delivered. I had never been to this location but will make it my go to for crab or lobster rolls. The only think I would not order again was the salmon burger. Everything else was awesome!
4,"Legals has been one of my favorite places since I was a kid living in Boston. My favorites from them are still my favorites to this day and those are: clam chowder, caesar salad, the warm bread rolls they bring you, and anything with Lobster aka Lobster Roll, Stuffed Lobster, Lobster etc. There is a lot of other great things on the menu, however since I don&apos;t live in Boston anymore I have to stick with my classics/go tos. The service is also always great and the place is especially clean as well. This will continue to be one of my forever stops while in Boston."
4,"Yes it is touristy but locals really do eat here and go here on special occasions. This is a fine location near the aquarium but I do think the quality varies with the locations and this one is just ok. My very favorite Legal is in the seaport district but that&apos;s a review for another day.

I do love both the classic and light clam chowder and the lobster roll, (wish they&apos;d do a better job on the fries - kinda tasteless) while sitting at the bar with an iced tea for lunch after shopping. Not bad at all."
4,I really liked this dinning experience overlooking the water. Great food and good service. It&apos;s windy outside and I keep loosing my napkin but you just can&apos;t frustrate me with this tasty lobster and amazing view. I prefer Legal to Salty Girl any day.
4,"When our neighbor heard we were going to Boston, the first thing he told us was that we had to go to Legal Seafoods and try their Baked Stuffed Lobster. Since we know that his family flies on his wife&apos;s Delta perks to literally get this dish when they are craving it, we knew it had to be at least somewhat decent. 

Located right off of Boston Harbor, their main hub is right in the middle of all fo the touristy stuff in Boston including the Boston Aquarium, Harbor Tours, and downtown. We decided to go for lunch right before we went on a whale watching tour. The was a large crowd dining but we were seated fairly quickly by the kitchen (more on that later).

We basically knew what we had to order, the Baked Stuffed Lobster but we also decided to try their New England Clam Chowder and Hot Crab Dip. The chowder and dip came first. Pretty decent chowder, I know that this is served during presidential banquets so I was not surprised that it was good. The crab dip was tasty and came with uniquely thin, almost styrofoamy crisps. I liked the crisps, it was an interesting mix up from just the tortilla chip or pita chip that is often served with dips. 

Now onto the Stuffed Baked Lobster, it did not disappoint. The first bite was buttery, lobster deliciousness. I think there had to be at least three sticks of butter stuffed in that lobster. Basically, imagine a lobster stuffed with shrimp and scallops and combined with a buttery, cracker stuffing. Then melt hot butter over the whole thing. Yep, that is the Stuffed Baked Lobster."
5,Amazing lunch service. Covid procautions were great. Service was friendly. Came there after a whale watching tour was amazing service was friendly and fast.
