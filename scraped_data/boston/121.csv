5,"Hard to beat the large sub for $10.50. Massive sandwich that you should probably eat over two meals, but no ones judging if you don&apos;t.  Quick service so even with the lunch rush (or what used to be a lunch rush pre-COVID), the wait for me has never more than 5 minutes.  Overall, a solid go-to lunch spot. 

Chicken pesto: 4.5/5
Meatball parm: 4.5/5
Steak Bellino (Philly cheesesteak): 5/5"
5,"Al&apos;s is definitely the go to place for steak subs..  most places you get more bread than meat,  but not here.  All of their subs are pretty good and it&apos;s inexpensive. Btw, nothing beats their fresh baked bread!"
4,"Oh how I missed Al&apos;s. I am definitely sharing my age when I remember the price of a small sub was $5. Although the prices have gone up, they still bake their bread fresh in store. FYI a &quot;small&quot; sub is in all intensive purposes a large. Theeir large can be a 2 mealer/shareable. I am a hot sub guy so I can&apos;t opine on the cold subs but wifey got the Italian (minus cheese) so you can hear her thoughts below. 

Ordering process - order ahead if you are ordering more than one sandwich, the lines get crazy during the lunch rush. There are 2 lines (hot or cold) if you are ordering hot and cold, order in cold and tell them you want as a hot sub. This place is chaotic during the lunch rush, so don&apos;t be shy. Their south station location is larger and more organized. The cold sub line is very straightforward and organized but hot subs is a hot mess (pun intended). Ask people if they are all set as you make your way to the counter, most people are waiting for their food, but there is no good waiting area so they just get in your way.

The food - the meatball is great, i like to add hot sauce on it sometimes to mix it up and give it a nice kick. If you just order a regular meatball, you can be in and out like mcdonalds. The steak and cheese is solid, I always add mushrooms. The steak pizziola is ok, but avoid the chicken parm. Although the chicken is made with fresh chicken tender meat, the bread crumb crust lacks flavor and gets soggy. I guess i like the cheap frozen/unhealthy chicken parm. You can also order a bag lunch (soda and chips) or soup lunch. For the soup lunch I like to get the Italian wedding. I think in my past life, I was Italian because I love Italian wedding soups. Meatballs, pasta, and spinach in a soup? Who knew they make an excellent combo.. Maybe I just likes soups with some sort of noodle. *shrug*. During covid, they haven&apos;t had it. Hopefully when things get back to normal it comes back.

Onto wifeys italian review - I was very disappointed with my sub. So many people rave about Al&apos;s and while I know they are known for their hot subs i figured I would give their Italian a try. I got mine without cheese because I can&apos;t have dairy. I am used to italians that are loaded with various cuts of meat and have a good balance of flavor between the bread, meat cuts, and milds however the store does it. I felt like my sub had too many pickles and not enough meat to balance out the flavor. The bread however was excellent as it was soft and chewy with a bit of crunch. I will not be repurchasing the Italian but am still open to try their other subs!

Overall a solid 4.0, wouldve been a 4.5 but the Italian took it down a notch."
5,"Wow what an amazing sandwich shop.....quick service, amazing sandwiches hot and cold. Know what you want so you don&apos;t get yelled out. Pay attention to the signs cold to the right hot to the left....pay in the middle! Trust me order a small they have amazing bag lunches and some forget the Wedding Soup! It was a warm 20 today the soup was perfect and the hot steak sandwich! Go by 11:30 if not it&apos;s crazy packed for the lunch rush!"
3,Ordered from the shipping container at the IDB... why is my sub so empty that I can see all the way down to the bottom?
4,"Meatball sub for lunch, I went with the large figuring that I could save some of it for dinner later. Well, that didn&apos;t happen. It was just too delicious and I stuffed myself.

The restaurant gets busy at lunch time. There&apos;s some organization here to divide people in half with &quot;hot&quot; and &quot;cold&quot; subs on separate sides, but I don&apos;t know how well that works. I was spotted by the young lady behind the counter and called over where I placed my order and paid. A few minutes later, my number was called and I was on my way.

Back at the desk, I unwrapped a large sub. Ten decently sized meatballs with the right amount of sauce and plenty of melted cheese on a (almost too) soft roll. Delicious.

I don&apos;t know that there&apos;s really much room in here to eat. Take it to go."
2,So I ordered Sicilian steak and cheese it says up on the menu that is well seasoned steak the steak and cheese does not have no sort of seasoning on it at all It is pretty plain only thing I can taste is the mayo can I ask a put on it it&apos;s plain as af AF! But it is a pretty big sub I had a lot of meat on it that&apos;s about it it&apos;s not that Great at all I definitely had better steak and cheese then this
5,"I usually post pictures with my reviews, but I always seem to dive into my Al&apos;s sandwiches too quickly and then I&apos;m like - oops! Oh well, let me tell you that they are really good! I work in the area, so I&apos;ve been to Al&apos;s a few times. They can get really busy, but they&apos;re quick. As others have mentioned, there is are 2 lines - one for hot sandwiches and one for cold. 

I&apos;ve gotten their chicken parm, italian and state street cafe special (prosciutto, mozzarella, tomato, basil, olive oil and vinegar). So far, everything has been delicious. The italian is probably my favorite so far - I get it with &quot;everything&quot;. Next time, I might have them add chicken cutlet to the state street cafe special to give it a bit more oomp. As it is - a small ($8) is already too much, but that would really be 2 full meals with some chicken. Yummo!

Everyone is quick and friendly. No complaints about this small, Boston sandwich shop!"
4,"This place came highly recommended by my Boston coworkers. I was scanning the photos on yelp and had to see a 16&quot; sub with my own eyes. 

It&apos;s true - a large sub here is 16&quot;. I felt like I was rocking a baby carrying this sub back to my office. I ordered a meatball sub and came early to avoid the line that my coworkers warned me about. They were super fast and the woman behind the register was so sweet. 

The meatballs were tasty if a little overly salty. The sauce on the sub was simple and outstanding and they put the perfect amount of cheese on the sub - enough to make it cheesy but not overpowering to make you feel sick. The only improvement I would make to the sub would be to toast the bread a bit before loading it up. 

I was only able to eat half and will eat the rest for lunch today. At $10 for 16&quot; of sub you really can&apos;t go wrong. I want to come back to try their chicken and eggplant parm sub. Thanks, Al&apos;s!"
5,"What a great find: super good sandwiches: hot or cold. We split a lunch special: sandwich, chips and 20 oz. drink. Had turkey, swiss, mayo and &quot;hots&quot;; they were delicious.
Very small amount of seating but are a few stools against wall. We came after the lunch rush, so we enjoyed the atmosphere of this very small but delicious sandwich shop."
5,"Visited Boston for there days and ate here twice. So delicious. Amazing homemade bread. They are generous with their toppings, especially their basil. I seriously sooooo amazing. The chicken salad and state street specials are to die for. So fresh and light but filling. I cannot wait to go back to Boston to get one of there sandwiches again."
5,"Cute little family owned sandwich shop! I was helped by Al himself, and the caf√© has a nice family feel to it, with all the staff joking around and the customers greeting the owner by first name. I love places like this.

Both sandwiches I ordered were enjoyable and hearty, only the steak bellino could&apos;ve been a bit more flavorful. The large option is huge and is a great deal (I put my hand next to it to show how large it is). I could easily buy one of these and eat it for lunch and dinner. Their baked bread is also delicious.

Great spot for a quick lunch stop, I 100% recommend."
5,"Blew my head off. The large sandwich is good for 2, it is huge at a really fair price, and amazingly delicious."
2,"Massive craze at Al&apos;s during lunch time. There are two lines: left is for hot subs and right is cold subs, and the sort of middle is to pay.

I ordered a small steak &amp; cheese with provolone (flat $7) and I suggest you get it with peppers and onions. The steak wasn&apos;t anything to write home about, no flavor, and there wasn&apos;t any stringy cheese. The bread was soft but the kind that&apos;s gummy. I didn&apos;t think the small was as large as some people say because thesub itself was thinner than my arm. 

They need a better paying system because you can technically walk out the door without paying for your food. Food of the goodwill! There are plenty of counter seats by the window since everyone grabs and goes. You&apos;ll notice that 90% of the customers are buttoned up business men."
5,"Best meatball sub in Boston!!! The large is massive and can easily be lunch and dinner. The &quot;bag lunch&quot; deal is the best in town, small sub+chips+drink=$9.50! Super fast service. Brought a friend from out of the city there and he was BLOWN AWAY at how fast they ran the place"
4,"I&apos;m on a roll ... a sandwich roll that is. I made my way downtown to try Al&apos;s State Street Cafe on a snowy Friday afternoon. The place was packed but the line moved quickly. The workers crank out subs like a firing squad. I placed my order for a small meatball Parmesan sub and before I could even finish paying, my sub was in my hands. 

When they say &quot;small&quot; sub what they really mean is large. I&apos;d hate to see what their other size subs actually look like because I barely finished half of a small meatball Parmesan. The sub itself was delicious - the meatballs were juicy and fresh with great flavors and spices. The provolone cheese melted on top held the whole sandwich together. And they had just the right amount of marinara sauce - not too much so the bread wasn&apos;t soggy and drowning in sauce. 

Like I said, these sandwiches are assembled FAST. The workers are Boston-friendly, meaning smile, order, and then move outta the way. There are about 10 stools to sit at along a counter against the way. Nothing fancy to see here - just good subs served fast."
3,Can&apos;t go wrong with this place. Used to come here often when I used to work in the area. Definitely will get you full and ruin the rest of your afternoon by putting you into a ridiculous food coma but so worth it. I&apos;ve tried most from the menu and you really can&apos;t go wrong with any here....prosciutto is one of their hot items.
5,"Location: downtown crossing

Service: the ladies behind the counter are always friendly.

Tip: go before noon or around 1 if you don&apos;t like crowds.

Subs- I&apos;ve gotten 3 sandwiches here so far- steak Bellini (onions and green peppers), Sicilian steak (mushrooms), and and Italian (cold cut sub).

The hot subs are definitely the way to go. You get a good portion of steak for 7 or 9 bucks (regular or large). 1 fills up a regular person.


I&apos;m not a fan of the cold cuts, you don&apos;t get a lot for the price.

All subs come with free toppings of lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, and hot peppers. Hot peppers are a must.


The bread is good when it&apos;s hot, but if you let it sit it starts to get gummy. 


Def the best place to get food from around downtown crossing

Best bang for your buck!"
5,"It doesn&apos;t get better!! Order the Italian and absolutely enjoy! Fresh, crisp veggies and the meat cuts are amazing. Service is great and friendly, So clean you could eat off the floor. This is the first place I have ordered from since March and I could hardly wait. I was craving a sandwich from this magical place!"
5,"Great place for sandwich&apos;s staff was great 
Wife had a turkey sandwich and I had meatball
I got the large should have gotten th small  it
Was so big and good"
