4,"****MEAT AND VEGETARIAN REVIEW****

*Cauliflower tacos - Best I&apos;ve ever had from anywhere. Perfect seasoning on the cauliflower and toppings to balance. Not bland at all. Small portion though (3 tacos) so a bit expensive for quantity, but would get it again.

*Steak sofrito - Very enjoyable quesadilla: the tortilla had a good crispiness and the inside&apos;s flavor was strong (good flavor balance). I question if the quesadilla may have been deep fried or cooked in a lot of oil as it bothered my stomach a bit afterward. All in all, I still enjoyed the meal.

*Queso dip - Beautiful, cheesy, and melty BUT the cold queso that came with the chips and salsa was also very good - had a nice smoked chipotle flavor. Would probably be pretty satisfied with just that and not order the queso if going again.

*Cornbread - Not usually a cornbread fan, but the butter was a nice addition. A bit dense for my taste though.

*Venue - Very cute with the lighting, but bring a blanket if you plan on outdoor seating. There wasn&apos;t a heater for the outdoor area like a other Newbury Street restaurants."
5,"Lolita is hot, it&apos;s sexy, and it&apos;s down with the times. Everything about this restaurant screams Pinterest dream board if you want a cute, instagramable spot. Ever since I moved to Boston, all I&apos;ve been hearing about is Lolita for tacos and it didn&apos;t disappoint. 

However, as aesthetically pleasing as it is, the food is phenomenal, full of flavor, texture, and the innovative flavor combinations will leave you wanting more. Their drinks are strong and aesthetically pleasing (it&apos;s all about that boomerang am I right ladies?!). 

I made a reservation a few days before for outdoor patio seating (during Covid times) and they won&apos;t seat you until your whole party arrives so try to have everyone come on time. I saw they had a dining in time limit of 90 minutes online but they weren&apos;t super strict about this when we were there. The seats were spread out, spacious and we had a great view of the city! 

Food wise, we ordered the trio guacamole sampler (los tres guacamole) to share, the shrimp tacos, and  grilled steak tacos. The chips that came with the guacamole were SO GOOD - crispy, crunchy, light, yet filling. The guac itself was so unique, slices of pork belly, lobster, etc and so boujee, I&apos;m all for it. The tacos themselves were a good size, pretty expensive for tacos (~$15-16 for two tacos) but back bay is expensive in general so no harm. They really pack in the meat and protein which I love and the garnishing was on point to make for a perfect boujee taco. 

Lolita&apos;s is such a hot spot and I can easily see myself grabbing brunch here every week for some beautiful looking drinks and tacos with the girls. Loved the ambiance and chill vibes. Make a reservation and definitely check out the place!!"
5,"Walking distance from the hotel so we decided to do our dinner night here. I made reservations online at 9pm. Upon arrival we sat outdoors and was told we must be off the property at 10pm. Understandable it&apos;s Boston Law, just did not know this while booking but none the less. Let&apos;s get to the amazing food! First we ordered a pitcher of classic margarita (yes we finished lol it&apos;s walking distance so 1 hour no problem). It was refreshing and light. Not too much mix which I hate. We ordered steak tacos and cauliflower tacos and shrimp tacos. There was a mix of homemade salsas that came out, salsa verde was the best followed by the chipotle one. Also ordered mushroom empanadas and fresh guacamole! We finished everything absolutely delish!!! Inside is a fun gothic theme decor which we saw briefly on way to the bathroom. Nice staff excellent server forgot his name."
3,"First attempt to eat here on a Saturday night, we were rebuffed with over an hour wait. Second attempt was on a Tuesday late afternoon just before the dinner rush. Was able to get a table for two in the shade without any wait.

At first we were given the lunch menu which didn&apos;t have that many options. Thankfully they were replaced with the dinner menu before we placed an order. Opted to share the Fresco Guacamole ($12) to start - a moderate sized bowl of semi-chunky guac served alongside warm tortilla chips. Consistency was between solid and liquid and the spice.level could have been better. Thankfully the free side sauces added that kick. To drink, had the Diablo Margarita ($13) which certainly packs a punch, though was hoping for more blood orange flavor.

Service here was slow despite several wait staff. Fine enough option for a margarita fix in the area."
5,"Incredible. Great decor, a little dark, and well-distanced tables. Staff was very hospitable and the FOOD and drinks - Amazing. The veggie tacos were really filling and flavorful. The starting boozy ice is a fun touch and a great way to pass time while we decided what to order. The dessert was a little lacking though - churros were really standard and the chocolate flan was way too dense. I would pass on dessert here and just enjoy the complimentary cotton candy"
5,"This place!! 

How has it taken me 4 years of living in Boston to come here?! 

They&apos;re always busy here so make a reservation far in advance unless you don&apos;t mind dining at 9pm. I&apos;ve even tried dropping in at 4 in the afternoon to try to swing a table but they&apos;re always full. 

For good reason. 

Food is flavorful, ambiance is dark and sexy, and for lack of a better word, they add a lot of pizzazz to the meal. For example, an icee palate cleanser with tequila to start and a giant green apple cotton candy finisher are on the house! Delightful surprises, especially on your first time. 

Come here with an out of town friend, a hot date, a gaggle of girls, a birthday party, this place is fit for occasions abound."
4,"There has been a hype about this place in Boston for a while and now I see why. 

I will start off by saying this; if you are trying to find some authentic Tex-Mex, this is not it. However as a Texan, I was pleasantly surprise by Lolita. It gave me a little bit of that tex-mex fix in somewhat a boujee way? You will not find authentic street tacos, deep fried cheesy rellenos or char-grilled fajitas here. What you will find is tequila with grapefruit flavored shaved ice as a palate cleanser, appetizers like pinto bean hummus and cauliflower fritters along with some other non traditional dishes. 

I was craving tex-mex so I went ahead and ordered what looked familiar to me, carne asada. The meat was delicious - very tender and juicy. IT was served with grilled onions and scallions. I also got an order of hibachi shrimp which was served with a garlic-lime marinade and yellow rice. Did I need two plates? Yes because the portions are not Texas sized portions whatsoever and I like to eat. Finally, I did not personally try the grilled steak tacos but my friend thoroughly enjoyed the prime sirloin with the garlic butter flavor. 

Overall, I really loved the vibe here. The atmosphere is dim. I will for sure come back to try other dishes. The server was extremely accommodating when I asked for no dairy in my food. I&apos;ll have to go back there and try some of their drinks and desserts. Only issue is that the wait time is usually ridiculous and reservation can be confusing."
5,Always great food. Drinks are a highlight but I still do t know why they removed a favorite drink from a few years ago. Something like devils advocate ... a really nice bourbon drink with a sugar rim.
5,"Good food, good drinks! Nice environment. Good customer service, love it! Tacos are good, churros very yummyyyy."
5,"Came for drinks only and glad we did....


Really cool and dark ambience with a basement kinda feel.

I went with the Diablo, a spicy margarita that was tasty af with a nice spicy kick.

Lizzy went with a strawberry basil mojito(she apparently forgot this is a Mexican joint), but she seemed to really enjoy it.

Drinks are made with all natural and fresh ingredients.

Def be back for food soon ..."
5,"How do I describe this restaurant in one word: ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS.  The dark/mysterious vibe of the restaurant makes it a perfect spot for a date night.  First off, you get a lot of freebies with your meals: a dry ice grapefruit/tequila pallet cleanser (heavy on the tequila), chips and three different types of salsa, and cotton candy to finish off your meal. 
 
For small plates, we ordered the grilled street corn, hot queso dip, fresco guacamole, and charred baby brussels sprouts.  For our main dishes, we ordered the zucchini fritter and crispy pork tacos.  Heads up- the tacos come with two tacos, but they are willing to add on a third!  Summary of our favorite dishes:
 
STREET CORN- I&apos;m a lover of street corn.  This was seasoned perfect and you get a large portion!
 
FRESCO GUACAMOLE- So fresh, flavorful, and delicious!  We enjoyed the guacamole more than the queso!
 
CHARRED BABY BRUSSELS SPROUTS-  Don&apos;t overlook this dish just because it&apos;s a side vegetable.  This was incredible!  The pinto bean and queso cotija cremas took this dish to the next level.   SO GOOD.
 
ZUCCHINI FRITTER TACOS- Okay this was such a unique taco!  The fried zucchini were so crispy and light, it was like you were eating weightless french fries.  The toppings paired perfectly with this taco, it was a hit!
 
The dishes are on the smaller side so order a lot!  We ordered the black berry sangria and we loved it!  Literally bring anyone here, it is a wonderful experience."
4,"The food and drinks were very good! I only give it four stars because of the seating issue. We went at 5Pm to put our name in but they said they don&apos;t take names or reservations. They also said there wasn&apos;t a wait and it wouldn&apos;t be an issue at 6Pm. We came back at 6 and they said that the wait would be 2 hours. They said we could have put our name in but I was so confused because they said we couldn&apos;t before. So I would say get there early or be prepared to wait. Or do what we did and wait at the bar for swats to open. 

So we waited at the bar and got two seats even though some people were trying to budge in front of us because it isn&apos;t organized. The margaritas were very good. We shared the chicken taco ($14) for two. The tacos were amazing. There aren&apos;t any sides with this taco plate. We then got guac and chips which were amazing. The chips were nice and warm and there was plenty of guac. We each had two drinks, shared two tacos, and split guac. The total was $90. We split it so it wasn&apos;t too bad but the bar was so crowded and other people were totally invading in our space. So for that much money I would rather a little more space.  Like there was a guy litterly trying to eat a full meal between me and the person next to me since there wasn&apos;t space. I&apos;m sure I&apos;d we waited for a table it would have been better but the whole seating situation was annoying. But the food was really good."
4,"Overpriced but yummy food and drinks. We&apos;ve just done takeout and haven&apos;t dined at the restaurant. They have the typical Back Bay snot attitude, which is so annoying - get over yourselves. But if u r willing to put up with the snobbery, the food is good. I wish the owners or management of these types of establishments would manage their frontline faces better and get them to wake up &amp; recognize they&apos;re in the service industry - return business is job security.  Make people feel welcomed. Treat customers as tho u r happy they&apos;re visiting &amp; spending $$. I mean, really people - WTH?
I feel bad for the chefs and cooking staff that r creating delicious meals but their frontline service people r presenting a negative on their creations."
3,"I had a reservation for a party of four on Monday at 6PM. My friends and I arrived to Lolita&apos;s five minutes before our reservation and was rudely asked to step aside so the host could help the person behind me. Ten minutes go by and was still standing in the waiting area; she did not inform me of the delay until I asked her. She said the servers are still preparing the table and would take anywhere from 10-15 minutes. However, the person that was behind me did not have a reservation and asked for a table for four people; they were seated before us. Finally, we got seated 30 minutes after our scheduled reservation.

On the other hand, our server was good! We asked her about the taco deal (the menu or servers don&apos;t mention this). The server did not know about this deal and asked her colleague. She came back and told us this deal is still available, however, we are required to purchase an alcoholic beverage - we still thought this was a good value."
5,"When it comes to Lolita, I&apos;m a longtime margarita drinker, first time Yelp reviewer. Lolita is a great place for cocktails, especially its list of creative margaritas that cover a whole range of flavors. They feature various fruits, and range from sweet to spicy. There&apos;s a margarita for everyone here.

Until recently I&apos;d only had drinks at Lolita, and was ready to give it five stars on its cocktails alone. But last night I tried some of their food, and that put me over the edge.

When you&apos;re first seated, they bring out some shaved ice (and offer to pour tequila over it) as a palate cleanser. They also bring out chips and a variety of salsas, which were delicious. For meals, they serve small plates for sharing, and recommend about two plates per person. There are various dips, as well as quesadillas and other classic fare.

I ordered a queso dip that was equal parts smoky, spicy, and tangy. Definitely a good, straightforward option. But what stole the show for me was the guacamole that I ordered. It was topped with chunks of bacon. And I mean chunks, not tiny strips or flakes. It was so hearty and filling that I couldn&apos;t be bothered to use chips! I was eating it straight from the bowl by the end of the meal.

Lolita is definitely expensive -- plates are $9 to $15 each, and the margaritas are $14 per. But you get what you pay for, both in the quality of the food and drinks, as well as the comfortable, swanky ambiance inside. Plus they give green apple cotton candy with the check; it&apos;s hard not to like that!"
5,"In the city so obviously, no dedicated parking. Greeted and got a table at 5pm on Saturday but told at the door to be finish by 730ish. Inside is very emo-vampire-gothic if I had to describe. Dark. A lot of people. 

Started with water and pallet clenser tequila, which we didnt get to finish before the waiter took it away. Nacho with 3 dips were good. 

Diablo pitcher for drink was a good mix. Recommend. 

Ceviche was fresh and love the zest in the sauce.  The tuna mix was awesome as well. Recommend both. 

Mahi mahi tacos...fish were too dried. 

Quesadillas were too salty. Recommend if not salty. 

Cornbread with the special sauce was the best cornbread I&apos;ve had. Recommend. 

Tres guacamole was good. No complaints. Recommend. 

Corn was average. I was never a big fan of corn. 

Steak asada was alright. Average amongst Mexican restaurants. 

Mango sorbet was delicious.  Recommended. 

Free sour apple cotton candy. Interesting. 

200+ for all.  Stuffed. 

Bathroom was clean."
5,"The staff was nice, outdoor sitting, requires reservations! 
Overall the drinks were so good !!! Honestly the best the cheese dip is whatever you can do without it but it&apos;s an average snack to munch on if your craving food ...will visit again"
5,"DINNER REVIEW

Lolita is the kind of place that I would usually say is just &quot;sceney&quot; and doesn&apos;t actually have good food. Everything seems to be put together to create a certain ambiance...it&apos;s dimly-lit and the wait staff all wears black/dark colors. There was clearly distinct attention put into the edginess of the wall art. It felt like we were in New York City. They even start you off with a granita covered in a shot of tequila and finish you with a huge thing of cotton candy. All this said, the food here was absolutely delicious and it warrants all 5 stars I am giving it.

My girlfriend and I arrived at 7 PM for our reservation and we were seated immediately. It&apos;s always nice when a restaurant is ready to seat you right away for a reservation.

DRINKS: I had a Pacifico which is about the same everywhere you go but my girlfriend had a passion fruit margarita, which she said was one of the best she&apos;s ever had (and this girl knows margaritas, let me tell you!)

FOOD: This is a small plates Mexican restaurant so everything is meant to be shared (no big portions of enchiladas here!).

They start you off with a trio of two salsa and a spicy queso, all of which are unique and delicious (and I&apos;m not really a queso person).

Guacamole Fresco - some of the best guacamole I&apos;ve had (and my girlfriend agreed). Definitely get one of the guacamoles.

Grilled Street Corn - This ain&apos;t your backyard barbecue corn on the cob! Otherwise known as elote, this is one of my favorite foods and this one is delicious: chipotle mayo, cotija cheese, and chili-lime salt. I don&apos;t know if I&apos;ll be able to eat plain boiled corn on the cob again.

Eggplant Asada Quesadilla - Our waiter said that the chicken quesadilla was the most ordered (which we are not surprised by, because everyone likes chicken) but that she actually thought this one was better. We&apos;re glad she steered us in the right direction because this quesadilla was spicy and sumptuous. Definitely get this! 

Grilled Steak Tacos - Steak is objectively my favorite food so on paper, I should have loved these and I did. But they weren&apos;t my favorite steak tacos I&apos;ve ever had.

Zucchini Fritter Tacos - Interestingly, I loved these tacos even more than the steak tacos (and I&apos;m a big meat eater). These were essentially lightly fried zoodles (zucchini noodles) with some amazing salsa and hot honey pepitas.

Everyone gets a big thing of cotton candy to finish with which is really nice but they give you far too much. Ours tasted like apple-flavored jolly rancher and there&apos;s only so much of it I can eat before the sweetness is overwhelming.

Next time I want to have a nicer Mexican dinner, I will come back to Lolita. I also want to try to Fort Point location!"
4,"Came to celebrate a friend&apos;s birthday but we forgot to make reservations so we ended up waiting for about an hour. Lolita Cocina is pretty popular so I would definitely recommend making a reservation beforehand, which you can do through Opentable. The ground-floor space is quite dim inside and the red/black interior palette enhances Lolita Cocina&apos;s gothic ambience. 

We ordered the street corn panzanella ($12), yellowtail ceviche ($16), the nachitos ($12), and a pitcher of the ginger peach sangria ($33) for the table. Lolita Cocina is definitely a place for sharing, which makes it a great place for groups or date night. I loved the complimentary tequila-based grapefruit granita and green apple cotton candy. Creative, playful, and tasty!"
1,"This was back in March 2020. I went to visit Boston and I came across this restaurant on Yelp. It had high reviews so I was super excited but the overall experience sucked.

Hear me out. My friend and I get there and are seated right away. about 10 minutes later they seat another party of about 6 next to us. We think nothing of it. No more than 2-3 minutes our server walks right by us and serves the table next to us water. I make a comment about not being served and he excuses himself. He expresses he&apos;ll be right with us as he starts taking the other table&apos;s order. I get a bit frustrated but think that this is just a simple mistake so it&apos;s alright (I was super hungry so I&apos;m surprised that I didn&apos;t act rude). Anyways, another server comes to us and starts taking our order. 
Everyone is served and as I&apos;m about to eat my nachos, I see a dead fly on there. I think to myself &quot;oh crud..&quot; and I wait to call the server. Thankfully they take the plate back but it looks like they just removed the fly and added more of the sauce that it came with. 

I know the servers recognized that they gave us crappy service because at the end we get a complimentary cotton candy dessert.. but I don&apos;t like cotton candy so we just leave it there. 

I still recommend you go check it for yourself cause we were probably that ONE table that just happened to get the crappy service (I get it, it happens but I won&apos;t go if I ever visit Boston again.)


Wait, I&apos;m just reading that the cotton candy is complimentary for everyone.. wth?? Rude.."
