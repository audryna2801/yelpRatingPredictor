5,"Excellent baked French toast and coffee - Both cappuccino and drip coffee ( that husband got) 
Plain croissant was just ok 
Outdoor seating was clean; not wet when raining outside. 
The hot French toast and coffee was just what we needed on a gray rainy cold day!"
5,"If you are looking for some great breakfast items with great coffee items and we can&apos;t forget pastry items, then this is the place to go to.  This place was walking distance from the Intercontinental Hotel where we stayed at.  Just cross over the bridge on Congress and it&apos;s right there about two short blocks.

We grabbed two cups of coffee, a breakfast sandwich (substituted the bun for a croissant) and of course picked up some of the best Boston Cream Pie, ever!  I would definitely be back for great breakfast items and coffee if ever back in the area."
5,Ordered a cake for a friends birthday and it was delicious! Got the small size of the almond hazelnut flavor and it was enough for 8-10 servings! The online ordering and pickup process was easy as well! Highly recommend going into the holiday season!
4,"1. Service - You deal only with the cashier and the people that calls your name whenever the food is ready. All around, they seem to be friendly and nice. This is like a fast food chain setup. So when you come in, order and pay at the front, wait a little while for your food, and finally seat yourself down. 

2. Price - Most of the items on their menu are about $10 or less. 

3. Ambiance - This place is pretty cute and petit. It&apos;s very inviting, and the display of bakery goods appeals to people. As far as seating is concern, they cannot handle a big capacity. So don&apos;t bring a large group here. Maybe at most a group of 3. I wish they have more seating. Dress code here is casual.

4. Food - The chocolate chip cookie was pretty tasty. It&apos;s not exactly the place I would go to for Breakfast or Coffee, but more for their sandwiches and bake goods. My wife had their quiche, and she seemed to enjoy it. 

5. Cleanliness - Place is well kept. Dining area was pretty clean.

I&apos;m not a die hard fan for this place yet, but I did, however, enjoyed the experience. It was a moment of relaxation and knowing that you can warm up for a little while before going back out to the frigid winter of Boston, MA."
4,"Looking for a quick bite and tasty cafe? Look no further as Flour Bakery is the one for you! I was staying in seaport and woke up late and looked around for a cafe to grab a quick bite. I placed my order for pickup and within the 7 minutes it took to get there, my order was already waiting for me.

I ordered the breakfast egg sandwich with ham. Along with some French toast. The breakfast egg sandwich tasted great and was very filling. The French toast was very heavy in dough, but nonetheless great tasting. The sandwich came wrapped in tinfoil and the French toast came in a decent sized takeout container with some syrup to be drizzled over the toast. 

This specific Flour Bakery is nestled close to the waterfront, in the seaport district of Boston. When you walk in you can place an order right from the tablet they have upfront so you can skip the actual line. Because of COVID-19 they don&apos;t have any indoor seating. However, if it&apos;s not to cold out for you, there are a couple tables located right outside the entrance.

TIP: Dependent upon when you go, it can get busy. So, my best advice is to order ahead for pickup."
4,"This place is a nightmare to navigate during lunch rush hour lol, but that&apos;s really a testament to how popular and well liked it is. I would definitely recommend ordering on the app/website ahead of time and pick up on arrival. So much faster and efficient, and I&apos;ve never had any issues with them getting the order wrong. My favorite dish is the broccoli rabe, super yummy and healthy. Perfect for even the biggest vegetable haters. 

I will say that a lot of desserts are not suitable for those with nut allergies. They have a wide selection of delicious choices, but there&apos;s really not that many options for those with allergies."
4,"This specific location did not have indoor dining, just outdoors. First time coming here and it&apos;s a super cute place! I order their green tea and it was good. Also ordered their famous sticky bun and for someone that doesn&apos;t have a sugar tooth, it was more salty than sweet that I expected. I probably wouldn&apos;t get again but my friend loved it! Definitely would recommend"
4,"Who cannot resist their cookies?!

When I heard that the founder of this bakery was the winner of food awards for the cookies, we had to plan a visit here. Moreover, I like the creative names.

The Lola cookie is my fave. The big chocolate chunks couples with the minimal oats go so well. There is a tint of orange zest. The pecans add a decadence to the cookie as well.

There is coffee to wash down the sweets, but this place does not have spectacular coffee in my opinion."
5,"Hands down the best sandwich place in Boston. This place reminds me of a San Francisco, california style bakery with really innovative sandwiches. This moves us outside of the classic Italian Bakery or sandwich shop with the regular options. I haven&apos;t eaten a lot of their sweets but i hear good things. 

Pros: 
- amazing bread 
- vegetarian options 
- huge sandwiches, great for splitting
- really good salads 
- great deal for half a sandwich &amp; small salad 

Must try: 
- cauliflower melt sandwich 
- smoked Turkey sandwich 
- homemade hummus sandwich 
- mustard greens + Farro salad"
5,"I&apos;m team Flour all the way. I always find everything so wonderfully imaginatively delicious and creative. When I come to town lately, I tend to stop by this location as it is close to the airport and my friend&apos;s office. Luckily, he obliges me when I say I prefer Flour over Sweetgreen. 

Since I hadn&apos;t done vegetarian all week, I opted for the grilled cauliflower melt. My friend tried the chicken and broccoli-rabe panini. We split the tophat cupcake which I had been eyeing for weeks. We were both surprised at the texture of the frosting. It was light and creamy and lovely with crushed peppermint candies on top. The cake itself was very moist but too crumbly. 

Seating can be tough and it seems to be the case no matter when we go. It&apos;s always as we leave, things seem to die down and there is more space."
2,"Ordered a Boston Cream Pie since many Yelpers raved about it. It tasted like tiramisu. Someone didn&apos;t clean the bowl! Texture was good. I thoroughly enjoyed the chewy ganache. However, if I wanted tiramisu I would have ordered that. For $6 I was disappointed with the quality. 

Service was nice. They don&apos;t rush. There&apos;s a kiosk system if you want to order that way too."
5,"Hard to find a better muffin.  Both the blueberry and morning glory tasted homemade and were absolutely packed with juicy fruit!  Scones were great, too, and the coffee had a rich, deep flavor.  We&apos;ll be back next time we&apos;re in Boston."
5,"This place rocks. Damn fine sandwiches AND pastries. I stopped by this location on my way back from an early-morning Trillium bottle-release visit, and having heard that they have some pretty good sticky buns, I decided this would be a good place to get some much needed sustenance. 

After looking at their sandwich menu, I was instantly drawn to the seasonal roasted lamb sandwich, with green beans, GOAT CHEESE (!!!), ras el hanout, tomato-ginger chutney, on typically served on focaccia - but I got mine on toasted multigrain. Amazing! Wow, one of the best sandwiches I&apos;ve had in a while. DISCLAIMER: I&apos;m writing this on the bus back home...which another one of these sandwiches in my backpack, half-eaten. It&apos;s that good.

Oh, and the sticky buns - yeah, that definitely lived up to the hype. Tons of pecans, gooey...goodness!

I&apos;ll say it again, this place rocks."
5,Love all their veg sandwiches I tried. The bread is fresh and so are all the ingredients in it. My personal favorite is the hummus sandwich. I also love the fruit tarts they have with seasonal fruits. They are tiny but brilliantly flavored and are so light. Just perfect for ending the meal with  definitely a must visit cafe!!
2,"Worn, Dirty.
Lots of staff....why don&apos;t some of you take initiative and clean the front of house. Gawd.

Flour has gotten a sack full of itself, I think and has chain-itis. You know that disease when you overgrow due to your once deserved popularity and then forget your roots. Yeah, I&apos;m looking at you Flour...I&apos;m sacking you as my fave.

I loved the one on Central Ave. It was always crowded but clean...and then you sank and I sifted to find another location. Doesn&apos;t matter which one, same experience.

And so there we were, pretty hungry and near the Children&apos;s Museum. That is the saving grace....so we went in. The place had the ambiance of a bus station. poorly lit dirty and worn feeling.

I would have left in disappointment, but I was hungry. The bacon something or another sandwich was VERY good. But I do wonder why it took the staff so, so long to whip it up. There was no line to speak of.

Staff friendly enough. But they seemed to be as worn by the environment they worked in.

Oh come on Flour folks...perk up your establishments, I miss the youthful exuberance when you were a new kid on the block."
5,"Boston, MA

Stopped at this 3rd location of 8 total Flour Bakery locations in Boston.  

The benefit of flying in on a red eye was the ability to pull up to this location and park in the one of three 20 minute parking spots at the front just minutes before their 6:30 AM opening and joining some of the first customers in the door to partake of their incredible, warm out of the oven, famous sticky buns...and they were worth the stop!  We were not the only ones waiting for the doors to open, and as soon as the doors opened, all of the loyal patrons started to trickle in on a weekday morning..

We also ordered:

5 stars  Sticky bun...or whatever they call it. It was warm, not too sweet, perfection...we almost got the mini but had already ordered the large when we saw the minis come out hot from the oven...the large was split between us and was gone in mere minutes.

4.5 stars egg and bacon sandwich with arugula...the bread somewhat fell apart but the bacon was unique and tasty...the eggs cooked perfectly, and the arugula a nice accompaniment, would order again.

3.5 stars lemon and ginger scone...thought this was OK would not order again (was not my pick). I was hoping I would enjoy it more as I like the flavors but glaze was too sweet.

2 stars coffee, drip coffee was underwhelming but I did like the choice for oat milk!

Cute rustic hipster looking location, beautiful fresh flowers on one large communal table, but there were other small tables as well. I wished I could have stopped here for lunch, and several more times for breakfast, but time and location did not permit."
5,"Oh boy...you are in for a treat here!! Probably even multiple!  We stopped by for breakfast when in town. I had the breakfast sandwich, which was excellent. The ingredients were very fresh and beautifully assembled. We lucked out with no line when we entered (around 8:15am on a Tuesday), but were lucky because a huge line followed us. I also had a slice of the sour cream coffee cake which was DELICIOUS. Moist, flavorful, cinnamon goodness. 
I couldn&apos;t resist picking up a bunch more things to go. So we also had the Boston cream pie, raspberry pop tart, sugared brioche, and chocolate brioche. I&apos;ll have to report back once I try them but I have a feeling they&apos;ll be as amazing as everything else!"
3,"The food is terrific but the set up is bad.  Social distancing is pathetic. The official spacers are a lot less than six feer. And it&apos;s a mosh pit waiting for your order. Also you better tip even if they just handing you something or you&apos;ll get rude/no service. Nothing like the old days off Comm Ave. This was on Cambridge st. I wont be back. If you can tolerate the lousy service, the food is very good."
5,"I went this past weekend and everything we sampled was wonderful. We bought a sticky bun, a butter &amp; jam biscuit, a brown butter rice treat, an almond croissant, and an almond meringue. I will definitely visit my next time in Boston."
5,"Vegan muffins AMAZING.  Chocolate vegan so moist and rich, not too sweet. Herb ice tea the best EVER and we like tea! Good egg sandwich.  

Back years later.  Still so yummy.  Banana bread is delicious!"
