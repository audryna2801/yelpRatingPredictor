5,"After seeing Pauli&apos;s on Food Network&apos;s Diners Drive-ins and Dives, it&apos;s been on the go-to list in Boston. Their social media presence reignited my interest in going, and finally got takeout for lunch there! Since it was lunch, had to go with sandwiches. The lobster roll and the Pauli-tician lived up to all expectations. Bread to meat ratio was absolutely perfect. Chicken cutlet super flavorful. Hot buttered lobster was the way to go for the roll imo. Can&apos;t wait to go back for dinner and try the pasta!"
5,"A great place for visitors and locals to get a boston styled lobster roll! They mainly do take out, but their menu is definitely quite expansive and goes beyond the traditional and hot buttered lobster roll. When in Rome, well gotta try out the lobster roll. I got the hot buttered preparation with onion rings (came about $27). 

Where to start... the amount of lobster that came with this roll was absurd. Like it was overfilling with lobster that chunks of the claw meat dangled out of the bun and left hanging with the onion rings. It was sooo filling and delicious! Love the light toast on the bun, and the roll wasn&apos;t too buttery and just to my liking. Onion rings were lightly fried and very crispy! no complaints here. 

Definitely highly recommend to check out Pauli&apos;s for their lobster roll, but super interested in seeing what else is there to offer on their menu!"
5,Awesome little sandwhich joint in the middle of downtown. No dine in service was available during this visit due to covid restrictions. Fast and friendly staff that&apos;s ready to help with any menu question. Super tender lobster that falls apart in your hands.  Definitely worth the 3 hour flight from florida and  45 minutes it took to find parking.
5,"Glad that I had a chance to try a lobster roll here!  When I showed up 20 min after placing online order, it was ready.  

I got a 7 oz lobster roll with onion rings for $27-28...it was a great deal, I thought.  The roll isn&apos;t shy on the lobster for sure!  

It was a great meal especially after flying for 5.5 hrs from California.  :)"
4,"Got the USS Lobstitution for a friends birthday! We ordered takeout and upgraded to hot butter and it came as 2 long sandwiches cut into two (overall 4 sandwiches). The lobster seemed plentiful in general (a little more plentiful on one sandwich than the other but it&apos;s no big deal). The bread was good and buttery. I think there was supposed to be some lemon juice on the roll? I did not detect it and needed to add more lemon juice and thought that more flavor would not have been a bad thing. 

We also got the onion rings and those were good but how can you mess up an onion ring?

Overall, I enjoyed the experience of the lobstitution and was very full splitting it with my friend. I probably wouldn&apos;t order it again just because it&apos;s pretty pricey and I&apos;m not exactly a lobster fanatic but I will definitely be back to try the other sandwiches!"
4,"My buddy and I started our East Coast Americana Tour by flying into Boston, Massachusetts arriving Saturday evening.  Our 8-day itinerary involved one day and one night stays in Boston, Cooperstown National Baseball Hall of Fame, Philadelphia, and four days in Washington, D.C.  Besides visiting all the well known historical sites, one of our objectives was to eat at Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives (DDD) restaurants to verify whether Guy Fieri knows how to pick delicious restaurants.  With Boston as our first stop of our tour, you can&apos;t visit Boston without eating a lobster roll.  Pauli&apos;s was our first DDD restaurant and I can assure you that Guy knows delicious restaurants.

We literally landed in Boston, got our rental car, and drove to Pauli&apos;s to eat our first lobster roll.  Arriving in Boston at night and this being our first ever visit to Boston, it was challenging for us to find Pauli&apos;s.  It was tough to park close to the restaurant with their only being street parking available, but we were able to find a parking garage.  We trekked a little to find the restaurant, but we were determined to verify if the hype was real.  Pauli&apos;s is a small restaurant and at the time of our visit, we could only order to go and weren&apos;t able to dine in due to the pandemic.  This review would have been 5 stars if we were able to enjoy the ambience of the restaurant.  I immediately located a framed pic of Guy Fieri showing the DDD logo as well as his spray painted cartoonish face found at most restaurants where DDD has visited.  On the outside of the restaurant there are articles recognizing Pauli&apos;s as the place to dine for lobster rolls.  Inside there are pics of celebrities who have eaten at Pauli&apos;s such as Ben Affleck.  Pauli&apos;s and the staff follow the city&apos;s pandemic guidelines and the staff had good customer service.

I rarely eat lobster rolls, so I&apos;m far from being an expert on whether Pauli&apos;s serves a quality lobster roll, but I know food and that lobster roll was delicious.  I&apos;ve eaten at several of Guy Fieri&apos;s DDD featured restaurants with only one not living up to the hype.  Add Pauli&apos;s to the list of stellar DDD restaurants.  Eating lobster is expensive no matter what form, so don&apos;t be discouraged when you see the size of your lobster roll.  I ordered the 7oz Lobsta Roll and paid extra for the hot lobster tossed in butter.  I encourage you to do the same because you&apos;ll thank me.  The Lobsta Roll contains fresh lobster meat, twist of lemon and mayo on a grilled New England style hot dog roll.  I paid extra for french fries instead of the bag of chips, which I encourage you to do the same.  I honestly wished I got to enjoy my lobster roll immediately, which was not possible due to the pandemic.  My buddy and I took our to go lobster roll orders and ate them at our hotel.  I loved every bite of that roll.  It was fresh, tasty, extravagant, yummy, delectable, and all the foodie superlatives you can think of.  The french fries complemented the lobster roll with them being crunchy, seasoned perfectly, and they were golden, lightly brown.  The almost $29 I spent for my meal was definitely worth it.

What an amazing way to start our Americana Tour by eating a lobster roll in Boston at our first DDD restaurant on our trip.  Guy Fieri and Pauli&apos;s got us started in a delicious way."
3,Tried this place as it had alot of reviews but after my experience I feel the amount of reviews it purely for the convience of the location. I had the lobster roll and claim chowder. Clam chowder tatse decent. The lobster roll.however was underwhelming. They give you a normal cold hotdog bun with some lobster heated in a little butter on it. Not nearly the best lobster roll Ive had. I personally prefer my roll tosted and if /when possible potato roll or anything rather than a basoc hotdog roll
4,"Right now this is probably the best lobster roll place in Boston, much better than next door Neptune.  Much cheaper too, so better taste and cheaper. Neptune is way overpriced for lobster roll."
5,Place is incredible... Try the vito- perfect blendof chicken  prov cheese and sweet peppers!!
5,"The best lobster rolls hands down! And all the other sandwiches on their menu are absolutely delicious. Kind service, great food. Every time I&apos;m in Boston, I go to Pauli&apos;s for lobster rolls."
5,"A rare 5 star rating from me but the Lobster Roll here is just that good. 

It was packed with quality knuckle &amp; claw lobster meat, a tiny bit of mayo to bring it together and lemon on a nice lobster roll type bread. Although it was $17.99 plus tax, it was honestly worth it. I can honestly say it&apos;s the best one I remember ever having. 

We also ordered the Skinny Vinny, fried eggplant, fresh mozzarella, roasted red peppers &amp; pesto.  It was bombbb. Super flavorful and fresh ingredients. That sandwich was only $8.99 and was packed on a sub roll, very fair price. 

I definitely plan to come back next time I&apos;m in Boston."
3,"Got the lobster roll and clam chowder to go. The area itself is rather busy and there is very limited street parking. I would recommend coming via public transportation or some type of ride share. I ended up having to drop someone off to pick up our order while I drove a circle instead of parking anywhere in the area. 

The lobster roll was a bit small but had a good amount of lobster for the size and comes with a bag of chips. I would have preferred some more mayo but if you were looking just to taste the lobster this one is for you. The clam chowder was good had large chunks of potatoes and clams and was definitely the more enjoyable of the two."
4,"After looking at yelp reviews for a lobster roll I tried Pauli&apos;s! I ordered takeout from here this weekend and was so excited for my lobster roll. I got a regular size (7 oz) and the lobster meat and butter was delicious and so fresh with a perfectly toasted bun. My only complaint is that it was much smaller than I expected for 7 oz and $24.

I upgraded to garlic fries for my side which was DELICIOUS. I also ordered clam chowder which was very good and filled with clams for a very good price. 

My boyfriend got a steak sub which was very good and fresh.

Overall, I loved Pauli&apos;s and will be going back again!"
5,"Had some friends pick me up the hot buttered lobster roll with the fries upgrade as takeout. Wasn&apos;t able to eat the sub til almost 3 hours later, so I had to heat it up in the oven. Despite all this - the sub was still deeelicious. The lobster chunks were a right mix of chewy and tender. Went incredibly well with the butter and crisp roll. Argh if it wasn&apos;t 20$+ for a single roll, I&apos;d be eating this all the time. First world problems - I get it. But definitely stop by here if you&apos;re visiting Boston."
4,"Lobster roll was good but pretty small for the price. I&apos;ve tried the lobster rolls in Maine and in RI. Boston would be 3rd in the New England area. But it&apos;s really great for being in the city! 

When in New England, you gotta get one and I would say Paulis would be the best choice. You can get it hot for extra $. The roll was good, very oily. You can bite it in 3 bites. Comes with chips or fries for extra $. 

Place is small. But it shouldn&apos;t take you long to eat it. They have other sandwiches, looks good!"
5,They have a great system for getting your sandwich needs met safety in this time of the pandemic! I ordered online and 20 minutes later I sauntered over to their shop. They had my bag waiting for me. The sandwiches were so good. I got the prosciutto which was amazing. There was a lot of prosciutto on it which can be rare with that type of sandwich. My friend also got a wrap that he loved. Everything was great and I would recommend everyone picking up subs here!
5,"HANDS DOWN THE BEST LOBSTER ROLL IN BOSTON! 

I&apos;ve done my fair share of tastings in Boston in search of the best lobster the city has to offer. Sure, you can wait 2.5 hours at Yankee Lobster House or pay $30 at Neptune for a lobster roll like I did... but why do that when Pauli&apos;s offers a yummy lobster roll for minimal wait and half the cost? They are generous with the meat, giving the option for lobster tossed in hot butter or lobster tossed in just the right amount of cold mayo over a toasted bun. Whether it&apos;s their cold/hot roll, sub, or lobster mac and cheese... all very tasty without having to break the bank! Don&apos;t like lobster? No worries! Their wraps, other subs, and pasta are just as good!! 

Pauli&apos;s is honestly the best hidden gem in the North End with little wait time, great customer service, and delicious food! Whenever I have a friend visit me from out of town, I always take the them to Pauli&apos;s!"
4,"Upon coming to Boston, I had to make it a point to get myself a lobster roll and clam chowder, and I think I did a good job in finding the right place to get both. I really did not want to go to Luke&apos;s Lobster because while I like Luke&apos;s Lobster, I can get that anywhere.

Thanks to yelp I was able to find the perfect place for it, and it is rated incredibly well for both. This did not disappoint at all. The roll is jam packed with fresh lobster meat on a terrific roll. It comes with chips so that was a plus. I also ordered a clam chowder with it, and it comes easily in a 1/2 cup. It is delicious and not skimpy on anything. In addition, it also comes with oyster crackers which make the soup taste even better.

Forget about some of the other reviews on other joints, this place works well on so many levels you will not regret it when you eat here."
5,"Pauli&apos;s, in the North End, is always good! It&apos;s a little whole in the wall, but they have great lobster rolls and the staff is nice. I can definitely recommend this place. And during this stupid pandemic, they were still quick and friendly!"
5,Ordered the Paulitian and the Steak Tip greek salad. Planned on saving the salad for tomorrow but ended up eating both. Buyer beware!!!
