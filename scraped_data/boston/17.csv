5,"Yes! I knew this place would be a win. The tapas are divine, the drinks are spot on, the service is excellent and the atmosphere is classy yet comfortable. 
  We didn&apos;t take pictures because frankly everyone else has beat us to that part, but everything from the roasted brussels to the paella was exquisitely prepared and artfully plated.
  It&apos;s been a long time since my hubby and I have ventured out of our comfort zone (hello Boston, long time no see!!). This restaurant reminded us of how much we enjoy that. I look forward to post-covid life... I really feel like great times are ahead."
5,"What a perfect night! Sitting on the outside patio with sangria in hand, tasting delicious octopus and jamon really sent me back to Spain and pre-pandemic carefree nights out. We started off with a plate of Serrano cured ham and creamy goat cheese alongside some tasty bread and olive oil (never expected the complimentary bread to be so fluffy and good!). For tapas, the octopus was out of this world amazing! The hangar steak was also incredible. The scallops were only ok, a bit rubbery, and the patatas bravas were good, but the heaping plate of potatoes didn&apos;t stand out in my mind compared to all the other delicious things. 

Also, the portions were much larger than I anticipated, and the bill came out to much less! The sangria was potent, with noticeable rum, and the wine pour was generous, this place knows what&apos;s up! We ended our wonderful night with the chocolate cake, which is like a warm lava cake with almond crumbs on top, so good!! 

As for the covid precautions, all the tables were spaced out and everyone in the staff had a mask, no concerns there. There are no reservations, but we walked in on Saturday night and only had to wait 30 min (they text you when the table is ready). I will be back, and with friends so we can try more things!"
5,"Awesome tapas and wine bar. I have quite a few favorites as far as restaurants go in Boston and this one is right up at the top. 
Came here on Sunday night with a party of four and had a great experience. The place gets packed so you definitely need a reservation. 
We split a variety of dishes and each one was delicious in its own way. 
The spicy meatballs were great and came in a nice red sauce. The empanadas were also delicious and came with a yummy red pepper sauce. The patatas bravas and croquettes were great additions to the meal and definitely recommended. Our favorite dish of the night was the braised short rib which was simply delicious. 
The drink menu and wine list was great and featured some great options. Service was also great and the whole staff made sure you were never waiting in between rounds of food.
Overall I highly recommend this spot while in town."
4,"My family and I came to this restaurant from NH.  We waited 20 minutes for a table around 3pm on a Sunday.  Luckily, we were able to walk around a bit and they texted us when our table was ready.  

They were very welcoming for a family of 5 which included a 3-year old who needed a high chair.

The food was excellent.  There is such a wide array of tapas available and they were all delicious (e.g. patatas bravas).  Though I didn&apos;t have any, my wife really enjoyed the sangria and looking around at other tables, I didn&apos;t see many people without a glass or pitcher of the delicious drink.  

Finishing off the meal with a cafe con leche and crepas with dulce de leche was a real treat!"
4,"Food is amazing. 25% max capacity, while still in effect. Highly recommend. Ambient scene--great staff. Food is just amazing."
4,"It looks like a really popular Spanish restaurant! It has both indoor and out door dining and seemed to be packed (with some distance between tables).

The tapas looked gorgeous but because of outdoor dining, the food became cold really fast. The chorizo was not as good as I thought because it felt really hard and not juicy. The eggplant was nice and the potato was a hit! The paella took like 40 mins and it felt very crispy and flavorful but I wished it would be a little bit more- i think it barely covered the bottom of the pot.

Overall pleasant experience and would be back again!"
5,"Been here twice now, can&apos;t wait to go a third time - the service is outstanding and the dishes come out quickly. Great ambience and affordable prices too. My group of 4 ordered a main entree, 3 tapas, and dessert and it came out to under $20 per person. We all left the restaurant stuffed.

Highlights: squid ink fideos, patatas bravas, Martha&apos;s Vineyard mushrooms, Basque burnt cheesecake, and their house bread.

I do recommend booking a reservation several days in advance or going at an unpopular time like 2pm on a Sunday."
5,"My friend and I went to Barcelona in 2017- so we were definitely in the mood for some Spanish tapas style food. With restaurants opening, we decided to give it a try. 

We made reservations for a noon on Saturday . We arrived a few minutes early and were shown to our table. We ordered a few drinks and some plates to share. We got the Patata Bravas (of course), the grilled hangar steak (comes only medium rare), the meatballs, the Martha Vineyard Mushrooms and the Roasted Cauliflower. The portions are decent but also very shareable. My favorite were the steak and the roasted cauliflower. Everything else was delicious as well. This is definitely not how restaurants are in Spain, but it&apos;s a good place to hangout, enjoy food and conversation. The vibe also makes for an intimate date (maybe a second or third date), and good for date nights as well. Expect to spend $100 for a meal for two with 5-6 plates and one drink per person (without tips). 

The service was prompt, friendly and efficient. My review is going to be based on my same metric: 50% for food, 30% for service and 20% for ambience and everything else. I&apos;m going to give 5 stars for all-- so 5 stars in all."
3,"I have eaten here 3 times.

Atmosphere: hip and classy
Food and drinks: above average but very overpriced
Service: good

Overall, slightly above average.

My most recent visit will be my last as there was a small, very hard unknown item in my otherwise smooth polenta that chipped my tooth in half requiring urgent dentistry. The manager was incredibly apologetic, comped my food and drinks, and paid my medical bill. I feel they handled the situation well but this never should have happened."
5,Delicious food. Very nice and friendly service. Cozy environment. All these factors add this place a must try place in Boston.
5,"Came here for a nice Friday night meal. It took a little over an hour to be seated, but that is a testament to the food I would imagine.

It is a tapas place so we ordered a few dishes to share: artichoke hummus, zucchini, patatas bravas, and the mushroom risotto. The zucchini and patatas bravas were incredible. The artichoke hummus was above average and the mushroom risotto was average. We also got the vegetarian paella which was really really good--highly recommend. We had the chocolate cake and olive oil cake for dessert, both of which were very good, but the olive oil cake was particularly tasty.

The atmosphere and vibe are great. We sat inside which wasn&apos;t as nice, and obviously spaced out, but the outside looked especially fun to sit. The service was fantastic and all other amenities were on point."
4,Went Saturday at a round 3:30 waited 20 minutes to be seated outdoors. Ordered Red Sangria pretty good and plentiful. Barcelona offer a great value in general and the food is consistent. First time to the south end branch since we live in Brighton we usually go to the one in Brookline. Everything was good and we were even comped some Patatas Bravas. Service was good enough food came out quickly enough and the day was beautiful close to 80 what more could you ask for.
5,"I will start with our server David...he was amazing! He started off suggesting a great wine and was able to answer any questions we had as we also had 2 pre teens with us. The food was great (we had hanger steak, Brussels, spaghetti squash, empanadas, ricotta, paella and the bbq board) After learning we were from out of town he struck up a conversation about sports, pandemic and life in general! Thank you for making our night great!"
4,"Barcelona wine bar never disappoints! I&apos;ve been to the one in Washington DC and was so excited to see that Boston had one after moving here a few weeks ago. The ambiance in DC is much better than the one in Boston and wish that the BWB here would take some notes and improve their outdoor seating, especially with COVID where most of the dining takes place outdoors these days. This includes adding an outdoor heater at the very least for diners (which is what DC had) and the BWB in DC also had individual blankets for the table which I understand is not feasible during these times as well as an outdoor fireplace. 

The food itself is always a hit - the Paella is a must when you come here. The rice is a tad bit al dente and you can taste prominent seafood flavors mixed in with lemon which is makes it so good. I think I went a little HAM with the lemons though because it was a bit overwhelming so next time, will definitely squeeze in two wedges instead of the full three that were given to us. 

They recommend 2-3 tapas per person but since we ordered the paella, we decided to share three tapas which was the perfect amount. We ordered the:
+ Martha&apos;s Vineyard Mushroom
+ Patatas Bravas 
+ Grilled Hanger Steak 

All three were so good and would recommend doing a protein, vegetable and carb dish to get the full experience here. The mushrooms were crispy and doused in just the right amount of olive oil to give it that crispy, golden effect and topped with garlic and scallion that made it perfectly savory. The patatas bravas is a staple here and they top the dish with garlic aioli (which is suuuper european and I love!). There was also a hot sauce / ketchup combination sauce that you could dip your potato into which was phenomenal. It&apos;s a very basic dish but so delicious! The grilled hanger steak is also a staple here and comes with five thinly sliced hanger steaks - make sure to eat these when they&apos;re warm - since they&apos;re so thin, they will go cold fast! But they were perfectly seasoned with truffle vinaigrette and the perfect size for two people. 

I love BWB and will always be a fan. Don&apos;t forget to order some wine (it is a wine bar after all...). They separate the wine list into light, medium and full so if you&apos;re a wine noob like me, makes it so much easier to pick something! We ordered the Sauvignon Blanc (Chile) and Arinto/Loureiro (Portugal) - both were fruity and light/crisp which made for a perfect pairing for our more savory dishes. They fill up the wine half way in large wine glasses so I thought it was pretty great serving size given the $10/glass price point. Service is always so phenomenal and attentive. They brought us two lemon teas because we were freezing outside and that helped warm us up a bit. Just wish they would adjust their seating to make it more accommodating for those chilly Boston nights, especially since it&apos;s so hard to get indoor seating here!"
5,"Went on a recent visit to Boston South End. Amazing food, service and atmosphere. Trendy in place that was popping with people and excitement with proper social distance."
4,"Takeout review due to COVID:

Visiting for the weekend and discovered this Spanish place through Yelp. I had high hopes because I have always wanted to try Spanish style foods, which are kind of hard to come by in Los Angeles). Ordered through the online service and chose to pick up to bring back to my hotel to eat for safety precautions. We got there a bit early and was told our order was not entirely ready yet. Totally understandable since the inside dining area was full of diners (not sure how COVID safe it is but I&apos;m assuming that MA has much more lax COVID rules than California, where I&apos;m from). Props to those diners for still choosing to eat out during these times but also hoping they&apos;re all being responsible.

On to the food: everything is delicious 

Seafood Paella - 4/5 delicious but felt a little bit too expensive for what was essentially something similar to fried rice with slight different spices and seasoning 

Croquette - 3/5 it&apos;s good but tasted like a ham and cheese hot pocket. I have only had Japanese style croquettes and this was not what I expected. Kids might enjoy this one more than I did. 

Pork belly - 4/5 oof the spicy was nice kick. Dish was a little surprising that it came only with one piece for ~$8. But it was well worth the price. Not too dry and flavor was just right. 

Fig and chorizo - 5/5 this was the most unique dish I ordered from here. The sauce was had a nice balance of sweet and somewhat charred flavor where the chorizo paired very nicely with the roasted(?) fig. A must order from here! 

Spiced beef empanadas - 4/5 also kind of like hot pocket but it tasted a little bit more unique than the ham and cheese. Bf enjoyed this one a lot. 

We ordered a lot to try since I don&apos;t know when is the next time we would eat from here. We ended up with enough leftovers for another person. Although we did takeout, it didn&apos;t compromise the taste one bit! I would recommend this place to fellow tourists. Looking at the reviews, locals seem to enjoy this place a lot as well. If this business ever expands to SoCal, I would definitely make the effort to visit again!"
4,"This place is awesome for groups - only taking off a star because it was SO noisy and hard to hear anyone but the food made up for that! Great for groups to share the seafood paella- came out in such a masterpiece- see my photos! Pro tip is to sit further from the door so the cold air doesn&apos;t interrupt your dinner!

Try to get there before the dinner rush really starts (around 6pm). Pro-tip, get the churros for dessert! The only downside apart from the noise was how crowded the seating was for the long tables (the dishes were right next to each other for the seating arrangement).

The best part was the presentation of the paella and this meat platter we got complete with an amazing sauce! The chicken was well done and not at all dry, and the pork and beef were done to perfection as well.

Quality of food here is the top reason to come! The prices were on the higher side for what I&apos;d consider a steal in Boston, but you&apos;re going for ambiance and atmosphere so this should be right up your alley!"
2,"When the restaurant is normally operating things are great. However, I&apos;m greatly disappointed in how they&apos;re choosing to do &quot;waitlist only&quot; reservations. This is because my two friends and I put our names down for a reservation at 7:00pm, were told to give it an hour and half max, we checked in several times at the last time at 8:30 were told if we went on a &quot;short walk&quot; we should be okay. The hostess then told us at 9pm (two hours later) that there were 14 GROUPS ahead still and that they couldn&apos;t control how many people were there and not leaving. Great to know we wasted two hours of our time with limited transparent communication. Do not bother with this new system..."
5,"The brunch here is amazing. The service is basically family style with a large assortment of tapas. Our group of 30 from Hartford Stageto see a play at the Huntington theater ate very well and certainly enjoyed themselves. Our set menu which I had been asked to choreograph included Serrano Ham, Manchego cheese, rustic bread, spicy Eggplant Caponata, thick cut bacon, Egg Scramble
and Cinnamon Brioche French Toast. Dessert was a Dulce de Leche bocadillo. We started our brunch with Mimosas but the Bloody Mary Bar looked very inviting. Maybe next time!"
