5,"I&apos;ve reviewed the Cambridge location (RIP) but it&apos;s time to give the Back Bay location some love as well. 
This was one of the last Boston restaurants I ate in pre-pandemic, about a year ago now. However, The Friendly Toast has been a go-to for brunch takeout/delivery, much before pandemic forced us into takeout and delivery. One of their initial appeals was that they had cheddar grits, something that is rare for Boston restaurants. To our sad surprise, they removed the grits from the menu! 
However, everything we have ordered from here is always amazing. 
Most recently, we ordered delivery (through Doordash) for a birthday brunch. I ordered a build your own omelet, with onions, mushrooms, arugula, and goat cheese. This comes with a side of home fries and toast, which I chose an English muffin. I&apos;m pretty sure these are made in house - they taste homemade. This was delicious. 
My boyfriend ordered the breakfast burrito, which was also great. This also came with a side of home fries, and he added a side of corned beef hash. I&apos;m not usually one for corned beef hash , but it was great. 
We also ordered the biscuit sampler. 4 biscuits (really 4 biscuit halves, griddled), with a strawberry habanero jam, a cinnamon butter, and sausage gravy. This was all incredible, each bite better than the last. 
Although I&apos;m sad at the lack of grits (and if anyone from friendly toast reads this - PLEASE bring them back!!), this will continue to be a go-to spot of ours, whether for takeout or (maybe eventually) in person."
5,"I&apos;ve been here a few times but never bothered writing a review. I came here during COVID the other day. I needed a good dinner and this was one of the few places by my hotel that were still open at 7pm on a Friday night. Weird. They take COVID precautions seriously. Masks must be worn if you&apos;re not actively eating. Plastic dividers between booths. The food was delicious as always. While I&apos;m always down for some of their yummy breakfast food, I was craving a burger. It came with waffle fries which, in my opinion, are always superior to the standard. The last time I was here I got a mimosa flight. Definitely recommend. This time around I went for the margarita flight. Absolutely delicious! The flight included the classic marg, a coconut/cranberry marg, a cucumber marg and a spicy marg. You really can&apos;t go wrong with this place. Amazing food and fabulous drinks!"
5,"Just wanted to update my review since I hadn&apos;t since COVID. Was so sad to hear their other location closed, and just want to reassert that this place is the best! The menu is constantly changing for new and seasonal items, the staff is always friendly, and their breads are to die for. I will say that post-quarantine the drinks can be a bit of a hit or a miss unlike in the past all the drinks were high quality. This still reigns as my favorite brunch spot in Boston. Don&apos;t sleep on the grilled cheese on cayenne cheddar bread! The only thing I&apos;ve had here that&apos;s lackluster has been the Mac and cheese."
5,"Chicken and Waffles Breakfast --bomb.com 
Lovely esthetics 
Great service ! 
Definitely will be back"
5,"Great place to take visitors for a filling and delicious breakfast. Everyone I&apos;ve taken here has left happy and full. Most recently, my friend left raving about the sweet potato hash she got as a side to her breakfast. 

My favorite is the gluten free pancakes - they are consistently the best (and largest) chocolate chip pancakes I&apos;ve ever had! Already looking forward to my next visit"
4,Solid breakfast/brunch spot! Love that they have options for people with food sensitivities. We enjoyed our meals and the atmosphere.
5,"I sometimes get tired of &quot;basic brunch menus&quot; but this place does it differently (and breakfast is served all day)! Their housemade toasts are so thick and yummy-- I highly recommend the cayenne cheddar for any cheese fans who are not afraid of spice.

The mimosa flight ($16.5) is a great way to try their mimosas. I couldn&apos;t taste the alcohol but I felt it moments later :)

I tried the sklarmageddon omelet ($14) which came with their toast, really nicely seasoned potatoes, and an omelet that was FILLED with meat. The maple sour cream on top added a sweet element to the dish. A meat-lover friendly dish!

I also got to try the hash quiche ($14). The hash brown bowls were crispy but I felt that the eggs were a bit overdone. 

Hoping to try their other flights soon! Will definitely come back for their yummy toasts and potatoes."
5,"This place is sooo good and I will be coming back! I put myself on the waitlist and the estimated time was just right. Service was spectacular and quick! We ordered the mimosa flights immediately and not long after food arrived. Menu is huge that it can be overwhelming so I will have to come back. Portion size was great, on the bigger side. Everything had so much flavor and tasted fantastic."
5,"The Friendly Toast is hands down my favorite brunch spot to date!! The delicious food definitely makes up for the long wait time. I figured it would be busy during the weekend so I made sure to check the live waitlist on Yelp..lo and behold, 180 minutes. 

When we arrived, we simply checked in the with host and waited in the car until we received a call regarding the status of our table. The host was extremely friendly and patient with every customer. 

We were seated by the door..not the best seat on a very cold day haha. My boyfriend ordered the monster breakfast ($16.50) and I ordered the chicken and waffles ($15.00). The monster breakfast came with two cinnamon raisin french toast, two eggs and breakfast meat - opted for corned beef hash for an additional $2. 

The cinnamon raisin french toast was extremely fluffy and delicious!! The chicken and waffles came with a Belgian waffle and a large piece of chicken; the hot honey, zesty maple sour cream sauce is a perfect pair. We also got the mimosa flight ($16.50) - four signature mimosas."
1,"First off, love the ambiance. Having never been there, some one in line suggested the eggs Benedict choices, so I picked the The Irish Benny, thinking the hash would send it over the top. Actually, it&apos;s the worst Eggs Benedict I&apos;ve ever had.....period. The muffin was too doughy, the hash felt like yesterday&apos;s scrapings off the pan, and the potatoes were flavorless. The fruit bowl, coffee and OJ saved this $34.00 disaster from a complete fail. As a side note, the service from the waitress started off fantastic UNTIL I double checked that what I ordered was in fact what I ordered. You could feel the disgust emanating from behind her mask.
The interaction after that was polite but curt. When a customer pushes off most of the meal without wanting a take away box, it&apos;s the employee&apos;s responsibility to probe a little because most of us aren&apos;t going to complain and make a scene. Full disclosure, I can&apos;t remember ever having written a bad review, so it would probably be a good idea to investigate why that combo was awful. Maybe the chef had a bad day, or whatever kind of shredded meat that was should NOT be called hash."
4,"Been to friendly toast a couple times and food was good as usual. Ordered chicken and waffles - delish. 
Do want to lower the rating by a star on the very inaccurate waitlist. We joined the waitlist with an estimation of 45-63 mins and we ended up waiting for two hours. The waitlist needs to be adjusted based on most people&apos;s preferences to stay indoor as winter is approaching."
4,"Uhm.. THEY HAVE MIMOSA FLIGHTS! They have so many different kinds of mimosas including peach and apple pie which were my favorite! 

Food is absolutely delicious and they put their own spin on things. Definitely can&apos;t find many of their dishes anywhere else. 

Service is a little slow, especially drink service but on a nice day, it&apos;s great to sip mimosas and sit outside. 

Unfortunately, they no longer have an extensive tea menu. Hope they bring it back in the winter. 

During COVID they have a ton of outdoor seating and all waiters wear masks. They also have a contactless payment system."
4,"Pro tip: before going here, you can &quot;check in online&quot;. This will save you so much time. We did this when we woke up, and happened to get first in line reservations.. so when we got there, we skipped the massive line of people which was clutch. 

Ambiance and food were awesome. We sat at the bar in the basement and the waitress/bartender down there was great. Had the cranberry coconut margarita to start it off, which was very good. Ordered a custom omelette which was fine, I also got the sweet potato hash which I wouldn&apos;t recommend if you don&apos;t like onions and peppers. My gf got the avo toast which she really liked, especially bc it came with two different toppings. The best part was definitely the pumpkin waffle special that we split, which came highly recommended and rightfully so. Definitely check this place out."
5,"Amazing!!!! The food was delicious, the atmosphere was corky and very inviting. Staff was polite and very knowledgeable on the menu selections. Titles of the selections were hilarious. Definitely will be coming back and may just become my go to for a laid back breakfast and brunch!! I had the chicken cordon blu eggs Benedict which was so flavorful. The eggs were poached perfectly. My fianc√© had The Barbacoa Benedict. We also got the mimosa flights and the giant tater tots which were to die for!"
3,"Came here with a group of 5 and got seated after waiting an hour and a half. Came on a Sunday so I guess it&apos;s normal to wait that long on a Sunday. 

Our server was very kind and attentive. Portions were huge and I pricing was fair. I had to get the French toast hence the name of the restaurant. Food was very flavorful and our server always refilled my coffee when it was time."
3,"In Boston this weekend for my sisters birthday. First stop was for breakfast/lunch at this local spot. This spot is not off the main road, but rather ducked off. The vibe inside gives me an old diner feel. The decor is makes you feel back in the late 70&apos;s early 80&apos;s . We had a few different entrees, apps and drinks. Staff wore mask and gloves, no temperature checked. This unique place is not the best for breakfast, but definitely give you many unique options (entrees) to chose from. This would not be the first chose for brunch honestly."
5,"Found my new favorite breakfast spot!!

Honestly I was overwhelmed with the options because there were soooo many!! It came down to something sweet and savory, so I chose two dishes of each.

For sweet I got the KING CAKES. I found my new fav spot for waffles no joke....and I&apos;m a huge pancake fan. You know they&apos;re good waffles when there&apos;s already so much flavor and sweetness that you don&apos;t even need maple syrup. I love the banana and chocolate chip combo together in the pancakes, topped with crispy (the right amount of crispy btw) bacon and peanut butter drizzle....seriously cannot get any better than this. So glad I went with these pancakes, but they have a lot of other delicious sweet options that I&apos;m excited to try next time! If you like a bit of sweet and savory in one dish, this is a great pick!!

I still needed an all savory dish, so I went with the Barbacoa Benny! First time I&apos;ve had Eggs Benny with barbacoa (what I usually get in burrito bowls), but this won&apos;t be my last! The BBQ sauce with the meat, eggs, and hollandaise....the flavor JUMPED OUT. I was so impressed with this one because I normally don&apos;t go for Eggs Benedict since it&apos;s a pretty basic tasting but there is nothing basic or bland about this one! And it comes with the most perfect home fries!! I loved the fried onion on top for they extra crunch. Soooo good.

Definitely coming back for those pancakes alone. This is the best spot if you don&apos;t know what you&apos;re craving because they got literally everything!! NEW FAV"
4,"Yummy!    Came here when visiting Northeastern... Its a good brunch spot.  On par with NYC brunches.  Really friendly service and great COVID accommodations.  Food came out quickly and was hot.  I got the avocado toast and some choc chip pancakes to share.  Pancakes were perfect.  THe avocado was a little light in the ratio of bread to avocado, but the other flavors were good, and since they are all about the toast, I guess its allowed, but I prefer less toast more avocado.  I also got the bloody mary flight - delicious.  Also loved the ability to pay with no-touch."
4,"This place is always busy but a great place for brunch or breakfast. The wait staff is friendly and on their toes. We had a few items from the menu and there&apos;s ALOT if crazy items to choose from. The French toasts are a must, and they are bug and sharable. The Oreo pancakes were plentiful and full of Oreos. The omelets are very big and the food is always fresh. The one thing I did not care for was the Avacado toast with over easy egg and some sauce on top. The sauce was good but it just seemed as though the Avacado wasn&apos;t that fresh and it was honestly just an ok dish. I&apos;ve had better Avacado toasts. 
We also had some drinks, the flights are fun and served perfectly balanced. I really liked the spicy Bloody Mary. My husband liked the mimosa flights. The place is also pretty hip and interesting on the inside as well. We will be back!"
5,"Amazing food amazing people , went to the Portsmouth NH location. Fun, hip and super cool waitress Jess"
