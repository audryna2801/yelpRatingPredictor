5,"In my opinion, the best lobster rolls in the city! Great location right across from seaport with a super fun outdoor eating area. They have a nice selection of seafood items to try, and you can pick up some pretty HUGE lobsters if you&apos;re so inclined! 

Ideal spot to grab a beer and a hot buttery roll or cold mayo roll. Both are super delicious and full of fresh lobster meat."
5,"Every time my wife and I are in downtown Boston, we are always craving lobster rolls; I think my wife has an addiction.  With such a prime location in downtown, the size of rolls, the price and the quality, James Hook is where it&apos;s at!  Best advice if you&apos;re picking up friends/family from the airport or enroute to drop them off, it&apos;s a nice New England treat to grab a lobster roll or chowder or bisque.
Since the outbreak of the pandemic, James Hook has stayed open via curbside service.  In order to take a break from being coped up inside, the wife and decided to enjoy a (traffic free) drive into town and treat ourselves to a couple rolls.  Even in these crazy times, the business is still pumping out great comfort food at curbside service.  Will definitely be coming back again!"
5,Finally came back after months of quarantine! Of course I have to satisfy my craving for the best bowl of Clam Chowder in Boston! It hits the spot each time. Super consistent! Ordering was easy and safe. They follow the state guidelines and keep staff and customers safe! They have out door and in door seating. We opted for the outdoor and were pleasantly impressed with the ambient. Nice heat lamps and comfortable seating. If you don&apos;t want to eat outdoor you can call ahead and order for pick up! We can&apos;t wait for another bowl soon!
5,"The last stop in Boston was a homerun.

This casually set up trailer converted into a restaurant is serving up exactly what I wanted: Lobster.

The staff was super nice. I ordered and my order was ready in about 10 minutes. They have plenty of seafood options, including love lobsters, or lobster by the lb. It&apos;s half restaurant half seafood shop. 

It was chilly out, so I went with a cup of lobster bisque! Creamy with chunks of sweet lobster. This was perfect.

Lobster Mac and cheese - I&apos;m almost positive they throw in a splash of their bisque into their mac and cheese. It was also delicious! 

We devoured both of these in the car. They have a few spots to sit outside, if you decide to dine in."
1,"My friend buys seafood here and recommended this place is so me and bf stopped by before returning home to NYC. 

Overall it is Over priced and below average food. The clam chowder tasted like can soup and lobster bisque was watery and did not have even 1 piece of solid content in it (I.e lobster) lobster roll does not come with fries and it&apos;s tiny drowning in Mayo. 

Also staff was very unfriendly. We tried to order clams and oysters (1-1.5 each) and the guy grumpy-ly bagged them and told me it would be 3 dollars a piece if they open them for me. At that point with the attitude I told him it&apos;s okay please put them back I don&apos;t want them anymore. 
For similar price point do yourself a favor and go to yankee lobster across the bridge. Or just go to Luke&apos;s lobster for a better deal lol."
2,"Now, I understand James Hook to be a Boston seafood staple but the rep handling phone orders was tasteless. See below for convo:

Me: Hi, I&apos;m calling to place an order.
Her: Can you just come in? 
Me: No, id like to have items ready for pick-up. 
Her: hurry up and make the order quick and how long until you arrive. 
Me: between 25-30 mins 
Her: yeah yeah sure that&apos;s what everyone says ... *hangs up* 

I was skeptical upon arrival b/c i didn&apos;t know what to expect after being spoken to so rudely by phone rep. Luckily she was not behind the counter when I walked in and the front end staff was friendly! 

I look forward to the food but I am ranking them 2 out of 5 because of my phone encounter with Ms. Rudeness! Not cool."
5,"We lived this place, not only the food and service was beyond average but also the variety of seafood to go in the market all looked so good. Love the live lobsters.  We had the lobster roll, the bisque and the oysters all excellent."
4,"WOW. 

Probably the best lobster rolls I ever had. We both got a large lobster roll w/ mayo and it did not disappoint. I haven&apos;t tried other lobster rolls in Boston so I can&apos;t really compare but I&apos;m glad I decided to come here over the other spots. They did not skimp on the lobster meat whatsoever and it came with the perfect amount of mayo. The roll was buttered and toasted perfectly. 

The lobster bisque was so disappointing though. It was so bland and watery which wasn&apos;t what I expected.. 

There was a lot of outdoor seating here and it&apos;s located at a convenient location. Highly recommend for just the lobster rolls when visiting Boston!!!"
4,"Lobster is REAL fresh. Insane how fresh it is. Tastes like the sea ... that claw meat always gets me. Disclaimer... not into lobster meat other than the tail. For me, the star was the clam and the corn and shrimp chowders.

Clam chowder is thick ... not not a dairy mess. Still tastes like a soup. Clams are finely diced and fresh. Potatoes lend to the consistency of the soup. 

Shrimp and corn were crisp and well prepped. I like chowders a bit thicker but it was damn good.

Nothing is cheap. Get what you pay for. Splurge on this place."
5,"Well, my other sister now loves James Hook  lobsters delivered. 

This company has the greatest service. It just can&apos;t be beat. Thank you!

And the food!!! 

My sisters and families were ecstatic. 

Thank you!!!"
4,"Lobster rolls are packed with Lobster meat. I tried the regular mayo lobster roll that comes on a toasted bun and barely made it halfway through, it was pretty filling.

They also offer plenty of fresh fish, lobsters and clams to go as well as premade crabcakes. 

Prices are reasonable for Boston. Service quick."
4,"Really good spot for a decent price. Great location right across the seaport, nice outdoor seating area, parking, and a little bit of indoor seating which was really welcome since it was freezing the day we went. Ordered a large lobster roll mayo, clam chowder, and lobster bisque. The lobster roll had really nice chunks of both tail and claw meat, roll was nicely toasted and buttery, amazong. The clam chowda was the best I&apos;ve ever had anywhere. The lobster bisque was just ok, no visible lobster and a bit flat on flavor. Only reason it loses a star here. But stick with the lobster roll and clam chowder and it cant be beat!"
5,"Very good lobster roll and clam chowder. Cost us $35 for a small meal, definitely doesn&apos;t feed 2 people. But because we were traveling and eating all day non stop, it was OK. We saw other people were eating with a tiny bag of kettle chips, so we ordered it afterwards! Talk to me about impulse buy.

Was definitely delicious and worth the trip. The place is so iconic and it has a lobster statue outside, we took picture but too shy to share on yelp!"
4,"If you want to indulge in some high quality lobster rolls under the beautiful Boston sun, nothing too fancy and fast casual, James Hook is the place to be. I hate the stuffy white table cloth, expensive champagne flute, wine pairing restaurants that most seafood locations are known to take place in so it was so refreshing to see this little shack right by seaport to make it feel a little bit more like you are actually by the sea. 

The lobster rolls themselves are PACKED with meat and they have some density to them. They are on the pricey side at $25 for a small butter lobster roll and $21 for the mayo lobster roll but they are delicious and memorable (up to par with the prices of other lobster rolls in the city). 

You have to order inside their trailer and once you enter, you can see the live seafood (crabs, lobster, etc) to your right. There are also pre-cooked full lobsters and fresh fish behind the glass displays that you can grab and go if you want to make something at home. The menu is pretty small - and they have very few side dishes which I was a bit bummed about. But most people just come here for the lobster rolls and the clam chowder so make sure to grab one of each! They also have a limited beer and wine selection too and a grab and go fridge where you can grab a soda or water. They will bring the food out to you in the outdoor patio seating area so make sure to listen to when they call out your number! There is a TON of outdoor seating, under umbrellas and under the massive white tent. It took about 15-20 minutes for our order to come out - it was quick and efficient!

Overall, really like the ambiance of this place - I dont think it would be as fun to dine here on a cold winter day but it&apos;s perfect on a summer and fall day!!"
4,"Came to Boston for a conference in 2018 and had to get a lobster roll. Wish i could&apos;ve tried more, but had to try everything else too! Got the classic lobster roll and sprinkled some seasoning on top with the clam chowder. Service was pretty quick and plenty of outdoor seating"
4,"Newcomer to their lobster roll. It was delightful!
Also had the stuffed scallop which was great as well!"
5,My go to place in Boston to get live lobster. Incredible variety of sizes and they also have a ton of fresh wild caught pieces of fish
5,"Seriously the best place!!! Don&apos;t walk. Run. Everything was absolutely amazing. Lobsters rolls are packed with lobster meat. The chowder was the best we had. Pasta and lobster great. Service is fast and you can sit outside. Parking is not very easy around. They also deliver,  ship and sell other seafood like fish, shrimps and more. Highly recommend. The lobster roll with butter or the lobster with mayo."
4,"Plenty of outdoor seating and some bomb lobster rolls. The steamers were a bit dry, but the clam chowder was delicious. Staff was friendly and helpful. They have parking to the side, but it is very limited."
1,"I was in the area on a hot summer day (08/05/20) so I decided to place an order for pick up. If you see attached photo I ordered a hot buttered lobster roll. What I received was a cold one, no seasonings, with half a burnt bun, &amp; pieces of shell. Why was my lobster roll crunchy? 

But the reason behind the 1 star review is the service. I&apos;m a bartender, been in the service industry for 10 years. I walk in to get my order, it wasn&apos;t even busy! There was 1 lady in front of me who who cashing out. I could literally see my order in a white bag with my name on it next to the counter. There were 2 guys working &amp; an older blonde woman. Not one greeted me or said I&apos;ll be right with you. It must have been 10 minutes of me standing there. At this point in my head I&apos;m regretting the 20% tip I left on my card when I ordered. I make eye contact with BOTH of the guys working. At this point 2 customers come in behind me. Finally I am acknowledged. He says &quot;can I help you?&quot; Yeah you can get me my to go order &amp; I point to it right on the counter. 

I get to my car..... the orders wrong.. pieces of shell in the lobster roll. $35.00 spent on bad service &amp; a bad lobster roll. No thanks"
