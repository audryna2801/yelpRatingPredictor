5,"My husband and I had dinner at the Capital Grille Saturday night. It was perfect. Ahli was our server. He was attentive, friendly and wonderful. The vibe was great no weirdness with the pandemic. Good, small crowd. Everything we ordered was cooked to perfection. Lobster cakes, delicious, bone in rib eye, cooked perfectly sides, excellent. It was the perfect dining experience."
5,"I&apos;ve had lovely dinners at this restaurant in the past, but what really impressed me during covid is how great the quality of the takeout is.
All of the sides taste exactly like you would get in the restaurant, highly recommend the lobster Mac and cheese and creamed spinach! They even give you the bread basket. Awesome job guys!"
5,"Take out was amazing we cooked our own steaks and Capital gave us directions along with spices to put on the steaks. Omg so good. Ordered Sam&apos;s mashed and asparagus which was also cooked and ready to eat.  Even enjoyed the cookies. 

We just had the hamburgers tonight with all the fixings-perfect.!!!!

Will totally be back to order again 
Thank you capital and looking forward to seeing you open agai"
5,"Beyond impressed with the service this evening.  This has been my daughters request for her special dinner for the last 3 years, but this is the first time I have taken her to this location.  Boston went above and beyond for her and made her feel so special!  We were visited by Penny the sales manager who customized her menu and Chris, the General Manager, stopped by numerous times to ensure everything was above spectacular.  Our server Khalid was patient, attentive and personable; everything you want for a special meal.  

My daughter is 9 and said this was far the best experience at any Capital Grille.  Thank you for making her night so memorable!  We will back and tell everyone how wonderfully you treated us.  Our new favorite location."
2,"Dinner was great and server was great. Manager ruined the evening at the end when I was signing my check, he approached the table asking how everything was (being nice like a serial killer) and then informed my wife and I that we had exceeded our allowed time in restaurant and had to leave. 

Mind you, my time there was paced on how the server presented our menu choices. She was great... Perhaps I should have told my wife we didn&apos;t have time for desert... Total buzz kill on a great experience even after I gave them a pass on finding plastic wrap in my Au Gratin potatoes. SMH at the tact of the manager. I was clearly signing my check but still had to push my wife and I out."
4,"Came here with a group of friends before watching the fireworks in Boston. I must say I am just as impressed with this location as I was with the one in New York. We all were super satisfied with what we ordered and we have no complaints except it is expensive (but totally worth it). I had the filet mignon and it was good, cooked perfectly just the way I like it. The truffle fries are a must, since I am a truffle freak! The spinach was a good side choice. The calamari was also good."
5,"A few of my friends told me that Capital Grille wasn&apos;t that great, but decided to go there anyways for restaurant week (DineBoston). Made a reservation for lunch time and was able to get seated immediately. We were offered water quickly and Kristopher was great throughout the whole dining experience. I got the 8oz Filet Mignon and my friend got the Bone-In Dry Ages NY Strip. Appetizer came first and this is one of the best clam chowders I&apos;ve had...probably top 3. The steaks were cooked and seasoned flawlessly; Medium Rare and moist. The sides were alright, I don&apos;t really like cream spinach and probably could&apos;ve changed it. My friend loved his broccoli though! Dessert was pretty good, my friend loved it though. I didn&apos;t really like it because I believe they made it earlier in the day and torched it early which made the crust not crunchy at all. Regardless, it tasted delicious!

When it came to pay, my friend tried to slip in his card, but I told Kristopher that it&apos;s his Birthday and to just pay with my card, which he did. He then also brought out a Birthday dessert which was very thoughtful! Had a great meal and time there. If you go, look for Kristopher Burnham, he was impeccable!"
5,"The Capital Grille is one of the best restaurant in Boston. Amazing place, nice staff and very tasteful food. I highly recommend."
5,"Made a reservation for Friday evening for my friend&apos;s birthday.  Our server, Vanessa, was very sweet and attentive without hovering too much. We had the calamari to start,  which was robust and crunchy. I ordered the bone in filet, my friend had the porcini/balsamic rib eye, and another had the sliced filet with onions and mushrooms. All three steaks were cooked to perfection: tender, juicy and bursting with flavor. I haven&apos;t been able to stop thinking about the Brussel sprouts - don&apos;t miss those! Potatoes au gratin were also fabulous. Since we were celebrating a birthday they brought a complimentary dessert but we HAD to try the coconut cream pie. Even if you&apos;re stuffed, get it to take home. It was unbelievable. It&apos;s not too sweet, decadent without being heavy and totally drool worthy. The bill was pricey but for a special occasion it&apos;s absolutely worth it and I can&apos;t wait to come back."
5,"If you&apos;re looking for a swanky dinner night, this is the place for you   

FOOD:
My friend and I came here for Dine Out and was able to try their prixe fixed menu. Add-ons were available.

DRINKS:
I chose the Bohemian, as did my friend. The drink was super yummy, and you were able to taste the champagne enough so you know you&apos;re getting your money&apos;s worth. The raspberry adds the perfect fruity touch.

APPETIZERS:
For apps, I chose the clam chowder and my friend chose the wedge salad w/ bacon and blue cheese. Both were so good!! The chowder was surprisingly lighter than most places I&apos;ve had, but it was still creamy and flavorful. The bacon on the wedge salad was amazing w/ the thick cut bacon . 

MAIN: We were then served our main course where we both chose the bone-in dry aged NY strip and let me tell you... they&apos;re a hefty 14 oz. steak both cooked to ultimate perfection. Probably the only place I&apos;ve tried so far that has cooked my medium rare steak MEDIUM RARE. I must say, it was slightly salty for my taste, but because I opted for no sauce, it was definitely needed, so I didn&apos;t mind it. Our meal came with Sam&apos;s mashed potatoes and creamed spinach. Both were very creamy and delicious, just how I like it!

DESSERTS: Lastly, for dessert, I chose the creme brûlée, and my friend chose the mini cheesecake. Oh my goodness, when I say these are decadent, they are  I felt like I was indulging in heaven! The creme brûlée was so decadent and perfectly sweet. The  vanilla flavor was so aromatic (you can even see the vanilla bean inside!). The mini cheesecake was just as indulgent with the perfect strawberry sauce. A perfect ending to our meal.

SERVICE/AMBIANCE:
Considering we made reservations, we were seated pretty promptly to our table. The service was top-notch! Our waiter greeted us right when we got there and even gave us their drink menu through a tablet. We were served water and bread almost immediately, and our waiter checked on us every now and then to see how we were doing. Not to mention, he was super hospitable and even asked if my friend and I wanted a picture together (he noticed us taking 20 minutes just taking pictures ). The ambiance is super classy and would be an awesome location for a birthday, anniversary and/or date/dinner night. 

Would I come back? - You&apos;ll be seeing me again!"
4,"A couple of hot steaks sounded tempting on this cold and wintry feeling night in Boston. The Capital Grille was in close proximity to the office building we were visiting so we dashed over to the Grille, looking forward to a high end steak dinner. The Capital Grille is a national chain of upscale steakhouses, with locations in almost half of the US. I&apos;ve dined at several locations over the years, but not recently.

Waters and a bread basket quickly appeared, and service was excellent throughout our dinner. My colleague ordered a drink, an In Fashion ($14), which he liked, but commented that the ice cube was so large, there was little left in the small drink glass provided for him to enjoy. I ordered a glass of Cabernet which was very good.

For dinner we split a ROASTED BEET AND GOAT CHEESE SALAD $14 with toasted pistachios and citrus vinaigrette. We then selected two steaks. I had the FILET MIGNON - 10 OZ $51 and my friend select a more ambitious KC BONE IN NY STRIP Special $60. We also shared a side of GRILLED ASPARAGUS WITH LEMON MOSTO $13.

We both enjoyed the salad, the beats had a sweet sauce on them which nicely complimented the goat cheese. My friend seemed to enjoy his dinner, finishing his large steak in record time. We both thought the asparagus was nicely cooked, slightly crunchy and very tasty. My steak was tasty, but I&apos;ve had much more tender filet&apos;s than this one, and it was a little more charred than I typically like. It was properly cooked, but expectations increase as the price increases. Candidly, I was hoping to be more impressed.

The ambiance is very nice here, dark woods and an elegant dining room. We&apos;d be open to returning here, though we would likely entertain one of the other fine steak venues in the area like Abe &amp; Louie&apos;s next time. I thought this was a solid four-star experience considering the drink comment, filet toughness and $230 charge with tip."
5,"This was my first time here and I really enjoyed my visit. I was hearing some really good things about the food, so what better time to try it out than during restaurant week. Made a reservation for two on a Friday nigh. When we arrived we were seated within a few minutes. Our server was nice and friendly. I ordered and salmon, which was cooked to perfection. OMG the mashed potatoes!! Where do I start, so creamy, light, fluffy and flavorful. Everything that came out was delicious. I will go back just for the mashed potatoes, they are that good. The food came out fast, considering it looked busy that night. Of course this place might be a special occasion kind of place for som due to the pricing but it is worth it. I Was glad to get a table during restaurant week to get a feel for it. Will be going back for sure."
3,"Mehhhhhhh

I feel like I&apos;ve made better steak myself, and it certainly did not cost more than $50 for a few ounces. My husband ordered a filet mignon, while I ordered a dry strip. I felt that the sauces the Capital Grille uses took away from the steak - some simple butter and salt allows meat to really shine! No need for all that special pepper sauce! 

The redeeming factor of the meal was the lobster Mac n cheese - although it was runny, it was absolutely delicious. We also heartily enjoyed our cocktails and the bread basket. 

Unfortunately, what was supposed to be the star of the show- the steaks- failed to deliver.

Also I&apos;m pretty sure we weren&apos;t allowed to eat in the main dining room because of our clothes...so we ate in the bar area. This probably detracted from the experience. Steak tastes better when it&apos;s served in a fancy environment."
4,"I will start this by saying although this is a good four star rating this is not the best steak fine dining restaurant in Boston (hi Grill 23!). That isn&apos;t a bad thing as this is still up in the top of the list. This place is fine dining, a big check at the end, good service and beauty location inside and out. The name has built itself up for a reason with the experience and is worth the trip and night out. Pictures from the experience for reference. Mac and cheese was great but a bit too liquify for my preference. Steak and lobster good but I&apos;ve had better steak."
2,"I was very glad Capital grille opened back up during covid. However my visit this time was very mediocre. Appetizer crab and lobster cake is still amazing as usual. I ordered tonight&apos;s special bone in filet mignon and my BF ordered the dry aged NY strip, both medium rare. Filet came out well done and NY strip came out medium. I just couldn&apos;t eat a well done filet so I waited for the waiter to send it back. This disturbed the dinner flow, so I was eating my steak after my BF was done. Service was a slightly slower as well. Not the overall experience I expected at Capital Grille."
5,Where do I begin......let me start by saying what amazing staff they have. Malik was our server and he went above and beyond for us. Beyond pleasant and all smiles. My boyfriend had told him it was my birthday and out of no where came lovely plated dessert with a lighted candle. Best cheesecake of my life. Thank you  Malik and all staff for making my birthday extra special. I will definitely be going again.
3,"I&apos;m on a quest to find the best steak in Boston, but unfortunately The Capital Grille really didn&apos;t do it for me. I came during lunch time and ordered the bone-in dry aged NY strip. The meat was overly cooked (I asked for medium rare), was too salty, and felt quite dry. The crispy chicken sandwich that my friend ordered tasted way better. :("
5,"I don&apos;t know what about the Capital Grille kept me away for so long but it was my loss. Finally gave Capital Grille a go during Dine Out Boston; if you&apos;ve never been or you want to ball out on a budget, DOB is the time and this is the place. $38 for 3 courses and we ended up pairing with their summer wine tasting flight and making upgrades and we found it to be not only a steal but also worth every penny. Now on to the meal...

Started with a Wedge Salad - pretty typical - blue cheese was a little more savory &amp; bacon more smoky than your average but standard wedge nonetheless. The Boy got the 18oz Bone-In Kona Crusted Dry Aged NY Strip (+$10) &amp; I got the 8 oz Filet Mignon plus a Maine Lobster Tail (+$12). Both of our steaks were cooked to medium rare perfection and while my lobster tail felt a little dinky, I wasn&apos;t expected full-on surf and turf at the $48 price point for a whole dinner. That being said i didn&apos;t even care because all of it was cooked and seasoned to perfection. Great crust (especially The Boy&apos;s - Kona Crust FTW), char, &amp; absolutely nailed the med-rare temp.

To go with our meaty entrees by the way, French Beans with Heirloom Tomatoes &amp; Mashed Potatoes are INCLUDED in the pre-rice. Such a nice touch since most other restaurants make you pay for sides. For dessert, we got one of each on the menu, a flourless chocolate cake &amp; creme brûlée. Goes without saying dessert was in alignment with the rest of the entire meal...just divine. 

Service was also really friendly and helpful/informative without being condescending - especially when we were enjoying our wine flights. I have no doubt more Capital Grille will be in my future!"
5,"One of the best places I&apos;ve been to.

I got the clam chowder, 18oz bone-in steak, calamari, and the creme brûlée. The clam chowder was just like any. The steak was really good. It was cooked to the way I like it and the meat wasn&apos;t dry or over cooked. One of the side of my steak was burned but it didn&apos;t stop me from eating it. The calamari is something else. They use the red pepper and this picked pepper (jalapeño, maybe?) which provides a little bit of spiciness to the concoction, enjoyed it. 

I&apos;d be lying if I say the creme brûlée isn&apos;t the best part about this place but I can&apos;t pick a favorite. Is it the fact that there&apos;s bread provided along with mash potatoes and vegetables and I don&apos;t take advantage of the free refills which makes me think that I&apos;m probably delusional cuz who doesn&apos;t like free refills on things?? Speaking of refills, (awesome Segway) the fact that every time my cup was a little bit half full, someone would always come refill it, I love it! 

The service here superb. Our waiter Dante C., was really friendly and always asked us if we needed anything. Big kudos to him. It is always a pleasure dining at capital grille."
5,"Amazing Place! Food is delicious and I feel safe while eating in and out the restaurant, knowing that the food is going to be amazing! I recommend this place."
