5,"AMAZING!! The omakase experience of the chef&apos;s prefix menu was simply amazing!! Every bite was an experience of different tastes that tested your palate. We had the 20 items in the prefix and added 2 more from the ala carte. Started price is $250 for the prefix, additional cost for wine/drink pairings and ala carte items. Each item in the prefix is basically bite size, so I would recommend having a bigger lunch so you&apos;re not hungry after this dinner experience. 

The staff was very kind and knowledgeable of the menu. Due to covid, you must make a reservation and the restaurant did a great job distancing tables. I attached some pictures from our experience."
5,"Recently I treated myself to the Omakase dinner at O Ya and I have to say every bite was outstanding! Often I feel like fine dining restaurants gather a following that sort of parallels the Emperor&apos;s New Clothes, but after enjoying the meal I had, I would say any accolades for O Ya are well deserved!

First, the boring part... this restaurant is doing an amazing job with precautions during the pandemic. It appeared that maximum seating was 12 guests, although the evening I was there, no more than seven were dining at one time. The small , but attentive staff kept their distance as much as possible while explaining wine pairings or the details of each course. There was also an air purifier in the middle of the restaurant. 

Speaking of the staff, they were welcoming, knowledgeable, friendly, and made me feel relaxed while dining alone. The beverage manager was delightful and paired some amazing wines throughout me dinner! 

The food... each bite was a joy! A beautiful progression from light to rich, with variety throughout the twenty courses. Surprises included a potato chip and truffle bite, and a foie &quot;ice cream&quot; that was a delightful treat! The only slightly disappointing bite was the final seared foie which seemed a little over cooked (slightly burnt flavor overtook the beautiful rich foie.) However, even with that one bite that I personally didn&apos;t love, the meal was a once in a life time, memorable evening! 

I can not recommend O Ya enough! I wish the entire staff the best wishes during these challenging times, and I look forward to being able to join them again in future!"
5,Most amazing sushi. Everything is perfect. I dined here before covid but it was the most enjoyable experience and perfect for a special occasion
5,"This is a retro review.  

I went here as a splurge many years ago and I still remember it.

I sat next to a kind elderly man at the sushi bar and he shared with me some of his sushi. 

I tell you this... get the vegetable sushi here. I KID YOU NOT. I dare say that some of them were better than some of the regular omakase sushi.  

Just do it

I spent a pretty penny here but it was worth. I still recall it all these years later."
5,Our meal was amazing. The food is prepared so well and creatively. Worth the very expensive tab!
4,"Slippage. When a restaurant that used to be top-notch has slipped in quality and attention to detail. O Ya used to be one of the best sushi restaurants in the US. But it appears that expansion of the O Ya empire (to Mexico and New York) and the addition of other restaurants in the portfolio (viz., Hojoko, Covina, and Roof) have diluted the experience and left the &quot;mother ship&quot; unsupervised. For example, we arrived promptly at 5:00 pm for our reservation, and we were made to wait several minutes while the hostess got her act together (even though there was only one other party to seat, who also had to wait while the crew got organized). If you&apos;re going to charge $285 for an omakase dinner, be scrupulously prepared. Here&apos;s the breakdown:

Strengths:
*Still has a high level of creativity
*The Kumamoto oyster with watermelon pearls was excellent
*The cuttlefish with cherry blossom, shiso, and smokey bonito also was a highlight
*The Kagoshima A5 Wagyu seared petit strip loin was one of the best wagyu dishes you&apos;ll ever have, with a melt-in-your mouth texture
*The wine list is particularly noteworthy for a sushi restaurant
*The service was solid

Weaknesses:
*The hostess should be much more organized. Don&apos;t make people wait when they have reservations and the restaurant is empty
*The menu is a bit heavy-handed with smoking and torching. It often overpowers the beautiful, simple power of fresh sashimi and sushi
*Many of the dishes would have excelled if they had been more carefully sauced. Several dishes had the sushi resting in a puddle of sauce that had not been evenly applied
*The on-line wine list should be updated regularly. Nothing is more disappointing than expecting an excellent wine to be in stock, only to be told that it no longer is
*I detest restaurants (like O Ya) that automatically apply a 20% gratuity. Sometimes the service does not merit such a high gratuity; don&apos;t force diners to pay it if they believe a 20% tip is not deserved"
2,"Came here for a special occasion. We got the grand omakase, which was 21 courses at 285 per person before taxes and a fixed 20% gratuity, and sake flights at 65 for four glasses of the bigger end sakes. 

Quite honestly, I had really high expectations, but O Ya turns out to be little more than an old-time Japanese restaurant trying to cash in on the success of the NYC avant garde omakase scene.

If I could use one word to describe our meal, it&apos;s &quot;overkill&quot;. Each course was overly bombastic in its flavor, with one or two ingredients completely overwhelming the taste of everything else, including the fish. Isn&apos;t the point of omakases to highlight the fish? The pacing felt off too - by the time the richer courses were coming out, my stomach had expected them 3 or 4 courses ago, and we started feeling sick as a result. Far from enjoyable. However, desserts were absolutely delicious, and made for quite a pleasing end for the night. 

The one annoying part of our meal was when the hostess seated a couple (friends of hers) at the sushi bar next to us in a space for one, midway through our meal. I ended up getting bumped by his elbow every few minutes, which made the whole experience quite a bit less enjoyable.

At $440 per person total, the quality of the food and the experience did not hold up. You can get better for cheaper at both No Relation and Pabu, which is where I&apos;d rather spend my money.

Highlights were the oyster, uni and sturgeon, ora king salmon, bluefin toro, ramen, onsen egg, A5 Wagyu, and black yuzu calamansi sorbet dessert. Service was pretty solid, but I&apos;m pretty sure it was because of the 20% gratuity ‚Äç

You can do better than here. Would not recommend."
4,"Such a creative and thoughtful menu! My boyfriend surprised me with a dinner here, and we left so happy and satisfied. We&apos;ve had omakase a few times in the past, so we decided to just order off the menu. 

We were supposed to seated at the counter, but the parties were running late and it didn&apos;t seem super exciting (totally agree with other reviews that the chefs look bored). So we just sat at a table instead! Probably a good thing considering we ordered so many things lol. 

My ABSOLUTE favorite was the chocolate foie gras nigiri. It&apos;s nothing like I&apos;ve ever had before, and comes with reallllyyy good aged sake. If it wasn&apos;t so expensive I could eat so many of these and be satisfied. 

The tea brined fried pork ribs -- super yummy as well. The meat fell off the bone and had so much flavor. Ugh. 

We ordered so many things, and they all impressed. With the hamachi nigiri, the banana pepper added a very nice kick. Uni/caviar nigiri also good. Wild spot prawn nigir ALSO GOOD. I think you get the point.

Honestly, the only thing neither of us liked was the chilled soba noodles. We&apos;re big fans of soba, and theirs is housemade and comes with uni! But there was just too much wasabi and it completely overpowered the dish.

Only reason why they&apos;re not 5 stars is...honestly it&apos;s kind of pricey. Maybe we did it wrong since we didn&apos;t order the Omakase set. Who knows."
5,"Simply amazing.  Worth every penny surprisingly.  Service and food are spectacular.  Make sure you tell your server what you don&apos;t like!  Everything was great on the tasting menus.  The Japanese steak cubes was the the best I&apos;ve ever eaten.  Insanely delicious.
Hope to return one day."
5,"It&apos;s hard to put into words all of the amazing flavors and textures my mouth experienced tonight at the 17 serving omakase dinner at O Ya. The meal is stunning. Each delightful serving delivers a unique flavor experience. The fish is fresh and absolutely melts in your mouth. The sauces provide the perfect compliment without overwhelming, and the presentation is beautiful! Our waiter was friendly and knowledgeable. It&apos;s not an inexpensive experience, but it&apos;s well worth the money. I highly recommend O Ya for that special celebration!"
5,"This is the first and probably only sushi place that made me really like raw fish! I couldn&apos;t believe how good everything tasted. I have eaten in many many sushi restaurants and this one definitely takes the cake. Everything was super savory, melt in your mouth kind of delicious (except for the urchin but I really hate sea urchin). I wish that it wasn&apos;t so friggin expensive. By expensive I mean, I spent 600 dollars on a meal for two people. That is literally more than what a month&apos;s rent was for me back when I was in school. I can&apos;t justify ever returning but I would certainly recommend anyone try it at least once."
5,"Oh Yeah, O Ya is the best Sushi I have ever put in my mouth... Dumb expensive and worth every bite . Insane creations they got going on there. The sushi and the staff were outta this world. We got lucky enough to get in after a phone call and the time was at 930 pm....but we did it. And let me tell you....we would do it again. If you have been eating sushi all your life.... treat yourself to OYa so you can see how its really done. Small small small place. Getting in is the hardest part. But once your there prepare to be in for a treat. Everything was spectacular.  And the host was a sweetheart and our waiter was phenomenal....Epic night...can&apos;t wait to do it again.

3,"Gogo Ya Oh My!
I tried Gogo Ya last night for the first time and was impressed with the food but &quot;oh ya&quot;  did my wallet hurt. 

As expected, each bite was delicious but the prices are very high. I understand times are tough for restaurants and don&apos;t mind paying a bit more, but this is not your typical takeout meal. Dinner for two of us was $100, plus tip.  My rating is a result of the value, not the food. Because of the price, I won&apos;t rush back but I might visit again as a &quot;special treat&quot;"
5,"We had the most amazing omakase here! We reserved the chef&apos;s table, which gets you a seat at the bar (you don&apos;t have to be doing the omakase for this), which you have to do a month or so in advance but is very much worth it. We got a cozy little corner, with the perfect lighting, a great view of the chefs preparing the food, and even the temperature was perfect (usually I freeze in restaurants).

Our waiter was incredibly attentive and happy to explain and recommend, and even let me sample a wine before getting a glass of it (as an aside, the wine pours are very generous). Our 17 course omakase was out of this world amazing. Each plate was a whirlwind of tastes and flavors, and even things I usually don&apos;t enjoy so much were made amazing. My favorites were the salmon nigiri, Kyoto style mushrooms, and chocolate foie gras. One of the plates was wagyu beef, which was incredible!

The service, the ambiance, the food, everything was beyond amazing. This is the perfect place for a celebration!"
5,"If you are ever in the Boston area and you want a sexy, delicious, food experience, this place is everything! The freshness and mind blowing flavors of each piece of sashimi had my tastebuds dancing! Not to mention, the details in the art of the food, were absolutely stunning. I highly recommend this place for a birthday, anniversary, or if you just want a beautiful night out to celebrate life, this is your spot! 

Cheers!"
5,"This was one fabulous meal. The food was terrific and the service was absolutely perfect. I tried the inexpensive tasting menu, which at $185 isn&apos;t that inexpensive however, it really was fabulous. 
If you haven&apos;t lost your retirement or shirt at the Trump market crash, this is a great place to spend money."
2,"I&apos;ll preface this by saying that I am on my honeymoon seeing the fall colors with my wife. We have been to several high end omakase experiences in San Francisco, one in Toronto, and one in Seattle. When I booked this reservation after reading all about this place in food articles hailing this place as the most deserving of a Michelin star if they make Boston a guide city, I fully expected this to be the best meal of our trip. It was not even close.

I&apos;ll start with the things I liked - they played music from the 90s, for a fancy looking place, they were not stuffy in feel or ambiance, and the dress code is &quot;wear what you feel comfortable in&quot;. I appreciate that casual feel for a cuisine that can at times feel a bit rigid, uncomfortable or awkward. 

We booked our reservation at the sushi bar expecting to be served and conversed with by our chef. We ordered one grand omakase, and one regular omakase in an attempt to see the full breadth of their offerings. We quickly realized that none of the dishes would be served by our chef, and in fact we&apos;d not have a designated chef at all. I thought this was odd, but I was willing to give it a chance to see what advantages or disadvantages it may have.

The service of our dishes was incredibly poorly paced, as each course came out in its own dish whether it be nigiri or other. Some dishes came one after the other at a blistering pace, and at other points in the meal we were left staring at the three sushi chefs in front of us wondering if what they were preparing would eventually be our next course, at times we waited 10 minutes or more for the next dish, which would be a tiny bite we&apos;d quickly finish and be waiting another 10 minutes for the next. Temperature control is huge with a good omakase service and we also noticed many issues with that as a result of this style of service. 

I had the grand omakase and despite 22 courses being served, only six were nigiri which I found unexpected and disappointing.  The nigiri we were served was at the beginning and all were reasonably good quality fish and relatively solid preparations, though the garnish was heavy handed even on more delicate fish to where the fish had trouble competing with what was added on top. The Kinmedai with ume, plum vinaigrette, and shiso was by far the best thing I had all night. The rice was bland, overcooked, and at the wrong temperature. We were surprised we had no ginger to palate cleanse with. We were still relatively hopeful at the end of the nigiri set as things were pretty good but not great and we thought if things got better from there we might be in for a really good meal still.

Unfortunately things went downhill from there very quickly. We were served dishes with fish that was too cold to have any flavor as sashimi routinely with either caviar, truffle (even though I opted out of the truffle upgrade option in the grand omakase), or foie gras or uni on top. It felt like possibly because their price point is high and their type of restaurant is rarer in Boston that they felt they had to include expensive ingredients over the top of beautifully delicate fish. Maybe that&apos;s what&apos;s expected by most diners here, but what I really wanted was just great fish with some interesting play of garnish that would complement, not override flavor. Uni, caviar, foie gras, and truffle are tasty and all but they completely drown out the flavor of the fish I was trying to enjoy.

Two of my favorite things in the world are lean bluefin tuna and fatty bluefin tuna, both were served without rice, one with truffle, and both were mediocre texturally at best - which I believe was because neither of these fish were properly aged. I expect these pieces to melt in my mouth when having them as part of such a high end omakase.

The A5 Wagyu is something I don&apos;t exactly like to be in my omakase however it does happen a lot even in San Francisco.  This was definitely the chewiest Wagyu I&apos;ve ever eaten in my life, and the potatoes it was served on while cooked well were unbearably salty.

This was the most expensive omakase I&apos;ve ever sprung for and it was unfortunately at the very bottom of all of them.

In my opinion this place is only highly rated by folks who expect expensive meals to have expensive delicacies in every dish for no particular reason as well as pretty looking food. We were incredibly disappointed with their interpretation of what a high end omakase should be and felt that they completely disrespected the fish they were serving with the exception of a couple courses."
5,"We went to O Ya for our anniversary. A long-awaited experience, after years of hearing such high praise since we had moved to Boston.

We typically enter such hyped experiences with a bit of trepidation; having been let down so many times. Fortunately, for our first experience, it was really hard to complain about anything...except maybe the price. Maybe.

We sat at the counter and had wonderful service all night. Our server was friendly, conversational, and knowledgeable about a menu that could definitely be a bit intimidating to many. My wife and I both did the grand omakase menu with the sake pairing.

From a food perspective, it was amazing. Course after course flowing at pace that seemed somewhat fast, yet took hours to finish. At about 2 bites per dish, &quot;fast&quot; is relative, though. Refreshing dishes, savory dishes, hot, cold, you name it. O Ya served it all up on their grand omakase menu. Sure, not everything hit the highest of high notes, but if I&apos;m going to nitpick subjectively, I&apos;ve never seen a tasting menu bat 1000 for me. Even at Michelin-starred restaurants. If you want fresh fish, expertly-prepared, with a few twists and turns to keep you guessing a bit O Ya is for you. Non-fish dishes are phenomenal, as well!

The sake pairing was fairly difficult to keep up with, though, as our pours were heavy. That said, the sake was really tasty. On a level that could possibly change a sake hater into a sake lover! I&apos;m hit-or-miss with my feelings towards sake, and every glass they poured went down easily...

...perhaps too easily. Which is why we aren&apos;t likely to do the sake pairing next time. On top of the extra cost, we were legitimately drunk by the time we left. Granted, our server knew we lived a few blocks away, were walking home, and that it was our anniversary, so he was a bit heavy-handed, but I think my enjoyment of the food towards the tail end of the omakase became a bit of a blur. I&apos;m not sure if dessert was actually underwhelming after such a great &quot;main course&apos; or if I just wasn&apos;t able to process my thoughts at the time! That&apos;s the shame of it, since I&apos;m far more interested in the food aspect of any meal.

Sake-blurred senses aside, the only thing people might truly struggle with is the cost (the sake does help there!). It&apos;s a splurge to say the least, and it&apos;s certainly not for everyone, but overall, we didn&apos;t regret it at all. We had excellent service and top-notch food in a come-as-you-are environment. 

I went into O Ya skeptical, and left with only positive memories, albeit stumbling home with a lighter wallet. It was worth it."
3,"As far as I&apos;m concerned, O Ya is top tier in terms of the fish selection, the excellent attention to culinary detail, texture balancing and highly meticulous presentations. However, what O Ya lacked was consistent service, delayed food preparation, and costly menu items.

We came here for my brother&apos;s birthday and anticipated a whirlwind of culinary delight, the likes of which my brother has never experienced before. While the food ultimately did not disappoint (we selected a combination of the special omakase and normal omakase), I think the slow delay in our food preparation and delivery, as well as the dull aching hunger in our stomach, despite spending over $1400 for the 5 of us made the entire dinner event much less palatable.

Don&apos;t get me wrong, there were a few dishes that were out of the this world, such as the two variations of wagyu beef, the otoro, and myriad of foamie goodness. However, there were a few inconsistencies amongst the dishes, for example, one urchin dish reminded me of the fresh ocean tide on a cool summer evening, while another bite of another urchin reminded my of the bitter aftertaste of an ammonia bottle. The majority of the dishes were pleasant, but lacked that &apos;oh wow&apos; feeling. Our hostess was friendly, and tried to label each dish as it came out, but I can see that she was struggling and overwhelmed. 

At the end of the day, we paid for a Michelin 2-3 star dinner, but missed out on the service, food, and quality associated with a 2-3 star dinner. I do recommend that if you are to dine here, you should try out both menus as they offer very different culinary choices, I just wished they had more options in the regular omakase so one party is not just staring at the other in between meals.

Food: 4 stars
Price: 2 stars
Service: 3 stars
Ambiance: 3-4 stars"
4,"My hubby knew this was one of the top places I&apos;ve had on my food bucket list to go to in Boston for Omakase and he reserved us a spot to celebrate my latest promotion! We went with my brother in law and his gf and got 2 Grand Omakase ($285 per person) and 2 regular 17 piece Omakase ($185 per person). Overall, this experience is one for the books that we will remember for a long time. We got to indulge in a number of &quot;fancy and bougie&quot; delicacies that we would never eat on a regular basis and was surprising to enjoy with different textures, taste, etc. Each dish was unique and beautifully well plated.

My favorite dishes from the night was the King Crab Sunomono (very refreshing), Spinach and Caviar (simple but rich with plankton butter), Hokkaido Sea Urchin and Ostetra Caviar (uni was very fresh and sweet), Foie Gras Nigiri (buttery and slightly sweet from the chocolate and was paired with a cordial of aged sake!).

Overall, I would say this is a place to check out for its top notch service and one of a kind Omakase fusion flare experience in Boston."
