5,"First time came to Flour to order from the app and I was really happy with the 30% discount for the first order and the app order was also fast and contactless so I was also able to avoid the crowd and order.

I LOVE THE COCONUT CREAM TART! I ordered the tart because I thought it looked pretty and the taste was also amazing as it was fluffy, not as sweet, and the texture was really great as well.

The loaf was also delicious because of the combination of different seeds and the bread is really fluffy as well. When eating with some butter, it tastes really delicious!

I was also pleasantly surprised by the one day bakery deal with discounted price but also great quality of the goods.

Will definitely come back again!"
5,"Another wonderful Cafe in Boston with loads of tasty foods, sandwiches, drinks, and pastries! For science my buddy and I continued our quest for the best Boston cream pie and found another strong contender in Flour. Theirs is lighter and more akin to an angel food cake with a rich chocolate and tasty filling. The service was quick and everybody was friendly. Outdoor patio area for eating was a nice touch as well! I have to come back next chance for some food and drinks"
5,"For some reason Flour&apos;s bacon gives me heartburn but the breakfast egg sandwich and the bacon arugula tomato sandwich are soooo worth it. Other favorites are the iced matcha, the raspberry seltzer, any of their chicken sandwiches, chocolate chip cookies, and slice of birthday cake (the cake is overpriced but definitely craving-worthy. The frosting is a nice buttercream, not too sweet). My friends have also said great things about their quiche and salads. They almost always have a wait so I recommend preordering on their app if you&apos;re picking up the food, especially now with COVID. They&apos;re also now available on Grubhub."
4,"tried the pop tart, sour cream coffee cake, and ofc the much talked abt sticky bun. just get the sticky bun and a coffee. came back a second time to get it again!

poptart tastin like the poptart you get in stores, just sweet and cardboardy ! coffee cake was actually bad sorry, so dense and that artificial sweet taste"
4,"After being hit with a 2 hour wait next door, decided to come here for a quick breakfast on a Sunday morning. Go inside to order/pickup food (leave mask on) and take outside at the tables to eat.

Although there are legitimate meal options here, settled on the baked goods. Between two people: French Toast ($10), Sticky Bun ($4.50), and two coffees ($3.50 each). French toast doesn&apos;t look like much but it&apos;s both moist and dense (no syrup necessary). Sticky bun is even better, sweet and savory, pairing well with the bitter coffee.

Server here was slower than expected, as it seemed more of a quick takeaway spot. Go in to try the baked good options."
5,"So happy to have found this cafe on Yelp and planned to come by before we left Boston. We had no idea that this chain of cafes was related to the awesome Asian Fusion restaurant we had gone to two nights before - Myers + Chang. I love their menu, everything tastes great! 

We ordered the breakfast sandwich and blueberry and Parmesan/chive scones, along with lattes. They also have little gift shop items, like as apparel, cookbooks, and other merchandise! There are even kits that you can buy with pre-measured ingredients!

I believe there are 9 locations in Boston, this one in Back Bay did not disappoint!!"
5,Really great breakfast sandwich they got here - the egg was thick and all the toppings and aoli was amazing. The bread choice was also amazing too - probably would be slightly better if toasted so I&apos;d recommend asking to get it toasted. Definitely come!
4,"Delicious food. Service was wonky, especially with a global pandemic going on. We wanted three items from the display: a muffin, a pop tart and a sticky bun. Rather than messing up the display which the person could have quickly grabbed and put into a box or bag, someone else had to go to the back and put these items in a box. What should have take less than a minute, took five minutes. Meanwhile people were backing up inside the bakery. I took off a star for efficiency/service. The pop tart and muffin were delicious. The sticky bun did not taste fresh to me. It might have been refrigerated and not yet brought to room temp yet. It probably would have tasted better if it were warmed up. If you&apos;re not in a rush, I highly recommend.  Everything looked so delicious and I had a hard time choosing. I wish I had gone with the pop tart. Enjoy!"
5,"I came with a friend on a weekend afternoon for a snack. It was already very crowded here, which I wasn&apos;t surprised about. 

I ordered a warmed sticky bun, since I&apos;ve been hearing such amazing things about it. After one bite, I literally started laughing because I was so happy. The sticky bun was so ridiculously flavorful. The sweet pecan flavor was so delicious! The pastry, itself, was very dense and moist. After finishing the bun, I was full and satisfied. 

Overall, I&apos;m very happy with my experience! Next time I come, I&apos;ll probably get a mini sticky bun. The full sized bun was a little too much for me."
5,"I&apos;d heard amazing things about the sticky buns at Flour and they did not disappoint! Just look at that photo!

The buns are soft and chewy with a perfectly gooey, slightly salty but mostly sweet pecan topping. We shared one, but if we go back we won&apos;t be!

We also ordered two sandwiches and they were both great! The bread was homemade and all of the ingredients were fresh.  The only downside is there is minimal seating and this place is counter-service. We managed to find a few stools by the window on a Saturday, so I think seating is possible, just not easy.

When I come back to Boston, I will be going here!"
4,"I read amazing reviews about this place, particularly for its sticky bun, so on my last day in Boston, I made an early trip to grab some breakfast there. The place was already busy, but the line moved quite quickly. Fyi, the place is on the smallish side so getting a table might be tough. I ordered their egg sandwich ($8.50) and it was sooo good. The egg was in a souffle style so it was light and airy. Coupled with the argula, tomato, cheddar, bacon, and dijon sauce on some soft bread and you&apos;re in for a delicious breakfast. I also had to get a sticky bun, but knew I couldn&apos;t finish a whole one so lucky for me, they have mini versions. Not as worth it since it&apos;s $2.50 when the full one is only $4, but I didn&apos;t want to stuff myself silly. It was very tasty, especially when eaten warm. I highly recommend both items.

If you&apos;re staying in the Back Bay area or near Copley Place, it&apos;s easily walkable. Solid 4.5 stars. If it was slightly cheaper, it would be 5 stars in my book."
5,"Such a lovely bakery located by a small children&apos;s park in a calmer corner of Boston. This bakery has a lively atmosphere to it, with the bright decor and the kind and cheery staff. There is a variety of baked goods on display front and center, with goods like the very popular sticky buns and homemade pop tarts and many different kinds of cookies. Flour Bakery also sells all kinds of hot and iced coffees and breakfast sandwiches. I personally went with the iced latte and a Chunky Lola cookie. The latte was super creamy and smooth, and the cookie was amazing! Super happy with my little breakfast here, and I would totally go back if I was from around the area!"
5,"Got up SUPER early to make sure we came to Flour Bakery + Cafe! 

The wife and I are splurging on this trip, as we should! I ordered a Cold Brew coffee. The coffee tasted great and wasn&apos;t over roasted. Perfect touch! 

We ended up splitting the Breakfast Egg Sandwich. Have to say, this was one delicious sandwich. The breading was good, the ham was good, hell just order it when you go here! Haha. 

We then ordered, what everyone was raving about, the Sticky Bun. Again, something we split. I wish I could have ordered an entire one for myself but I would have been a total FATTY!!! We didn&apos;t know you could order it &quot;heated&quot; or &quot;not heated&quot;. The &quot;not heated&quot; version was the one we had and it was still damn good!! If we would have known, we would have definitely gotten it in the &quot;heated&quot; version! Next time!!

Again, this is a MUST while here or close by, or maybe on vacation!!"
5,"Their breakfast sandwich is to die for, and their pastries are heavenly! 

My friend and I stopped by Flour Bakery + Cafe early Saturday morning to get a jumpstart on our day with some breakfast and coffee. The cafe wasn&apos;t too busy, with a few customers milling around, checking out the displays. Oh, the displays.... you&apos;ll never find a more beautiful sight than the pastry display at Flour Bakery - there were so many delicious options, from cinnamon rolls to their famous lemon scones to sticky buns coated in gooey brown sugar and pecans. I don&apos;t even like pecans, but I was so tempted to get a sticky bun. 

I ended up ordering a breakfast sandwich with bacon, a lemon scone, and their winter speciality drink, a white chocolate mocha. The breakfast sandwich tasted fresh and light - the bread was dense and not buttery, which I personally liked, so sometimes I find sandwiches with flaky pastries to be a little too rich and oily for me. I loved the combination of argula, dijon mustard, white cheddar, egg, and bacon, and it seems to be a very popular item!

The lemon scone was just the perfect amount of sweet and tangy and I could see why it came highly recommended. 

I wasn&apos;t as big of a fan of the white chocolate mocha - for some reason, it tasted very buttery (probably because white chocolate is literally 50% butter) and not very sweet or coffee-y. Don&apos;t think I would get it again, but the quality of the food makes up for the subpar drink. 

The interior is very warm and nice, with plenty of seating and good lighting. I definitely recommend coming early in the morning to make sure you can snag a table to enjoy their delicious food!"
4,"After all the raving reviews I was honestly expecting a lot more from the sticky bun. The outer coating and nuts were extremely tasty, but the actual dough part was dry and tasted day old. This is not something I would come back for and was way overhyped. I honestly preferred the breakfast sandwich which had light and fluffy eggs and crispy bacon. I also loved my housemade raspberry seltzer. Looks like I&apos;ll have to try some other baked goods if I come back here."
5,"LOVED the pecan sticky buns. I usually am not a big nuts person but the sticky buns here were delicious. It pairs well with a nice cup of coffee and is a great pick me up during the day.

Haven&apos;t been here for a meal but would definitely want to go back and try the other foods. Everything looked great as far as I could tell by glancing at what people were ordering around the tables."
2,2 out of 10- slow as hell. Outdoor dining only and 1 out 3 lamps working. Dirty tables even tho they have a sign on them saying they&apos;ve &quot;been sanitized &quot;. Food just ok
4,"We got a tip from a family friend to try this bakery cafe when in Boston. We need a quick treat after dinner so decided to take a look. 

There were many cookies, cakes, tarts and pie options at Flour Bakery + Cafe&apos;. We decided to share a Boston Cream Napoleon Pastry and the Sticky Bun. 

The Boston Cream Pie was in the form of a Napoleon Pastry dessert.  It had just enough cream between the pastry layers to give the dessert a light airy texture and the sweet vanilla flavor complimented the chocolate topping nicely. 

The Sticky Bun had a good amount of Candied Pecan Nuts mixed in with the gooey caramel topping. The middle of the Bun was soft and moist. 

We enjoyed the  Sticky Bun so much we had to go back and get another one!

Tip:  If you don&apos;t get a Sticky Bun right out of the oven, make sure you ask for it warm. It makes a big difference!"
5,Flour is not only one of the best bakeries I know of - but they also have amazing sandwiches. The staff is super nice and efficient. The setting comfortable despite being often very busy. We go to the one on Clarendon St but all of the locations are equally good!
5,"My go to place forever!!
I love Flour. Everything is so delicious here, it never disappoints!
The staff are always so nice and helpful.
Love their farro salad, chicken sandwich and their banana bread but honestly everything is delish here!"
