5,"The matcha was delicious (note it is unsweetened and the small is very small) and the bagels &amp; lox were divine. The cream cheese is particularly creamy and pairs perfectly with the fresh-tasting salmon. I would avoid the indoor dining, it&apos;s a liiiiittle too close for comfort."
5,"Thank you to Thinking Cup for the experience of the honey cinnamon latte. I also got the bacon, egg, and cheese which was so yummy! I sat at a nice table (socially distant) and read my book! It&apos;s such a nice quiet vibe in there. A great coffee shop and I hope they can keep all of their locations open throughout the pandemic!"
5,"Perfect spot for a yummy sandwich and coffee. I came here and got the BLAT which is a BLT with their special aioli and I still think about it. It was so great, the service was quick, and it was delightful. I did attend pre covid, so I can&apos;t speak on any of their current precautions, but I will definitely be back!"
5,"Thinking Cup on Tremont - our go for breakfast every morning during our weeks vacation in Boston. Great people, Great coffee, Lattes and Salmon Cream Cheese Bagels everyday make this location worthy of your business.  We enjoyed it and you will too. 

Thank you Thinking Cup on Tremont."
4,"We came here a few days before the pandemic restaurant shutdown order.  It was a cold night.  We thought a nice cup of hot chocolate would be the perfect thing to end the evening after dinner and Thinking Cup (TC) fit the bill. 

TC is such a warm and cozy little shop.  We found a table and proceeded to peel off our layers.  Every pastry in the display looked so tempting we just had to add a couple of them to our tab.  The workers were very friendly and quick to prep things for us.

Our hot chocolate was nice and rich.  The Fruit Tart and the Boston Cream Tart were scrumptious.  We liked the vibe and enjoyed the edibles at TC.  In fact, our little niece asked to return the very next day!"
3,"I love this place as a Suffolk University student and I always came to the Tremont location multiple times a week to do work, but in my first time back today since pre-COVID, the milk in my iced coffee just tasted old &amp; nasty.....couldn&apos;t even drink it :( 

Lattes are great here though so next time I&apos;m only sticking with that!"
5,"Came here like three times in one weekend while I was in Boston. Iced lattes were brewed to perfection! Its a bit on the pricier side for a medium cup ($5), but highly recommended given how delicious each brew I had was. 

There were a decent amount of tables to do work, but with boston commons right by its also a great place to grab a coffee with a friend and just hangout/chill in the park."
5,"Lots of desserts here. My favorite being the croissants, they are crispy and fresh. 

The coffee, either americano or cortadito, is very good tasting. They have lots of milk options too, skim, regular cream, and even soy milk. 

The place is narrow, but it has lots of chairs in it. The place can fill up quickly. I like the tables featuring the newspaper enclosed within."
4,"This is a great little coffee shop to stop by if you&apos;re near Boston Common! They have tons of food and drinks to choose from. We came here on a Sunday morning and didn&apos;t have to wait in a line at all. That being said, it was rather cold and I imagine there weren&apos;t too many tourists around. The prices were reasonable and they had tables inside to accommodate about 20 people. What I loved most about this stop was the variety of breakfast foods. Both savory and sweet! I would definitely stop by again!"
1,"This supposed to be a cappuccino. The picture is just lame, no foam, no color, no taste, no coffee. It was clearly brewed coffee with some milk, and kind of heated. Lame overall."
5,It&apos;s a cute place to hang out and have a nice chat with a friend. There are limited tables so it will be packed during peak times.  I recommend coming early to grab a table. I ordered a cappuccino and it was so good! It is affordable and the design was fantastic .  The next time I come here.. I will make sure to try the baked goods!
4,"Really cool place I found early in the morning before exploring Boston. Only downside of this place was the fact it&apos;s 2019, it&apos;s a coffee shop, and it didn&apos;t have wifi. Not to sound like a whiny Millennial, I mean I can be, but I had some grad school homework to do before I started my day and had to use my hotspot. I know, first world problems, but I was sorta shocked there was no wifi. 

Coffee was awesome, had a large vanilla latte. Breakfast sandwich was awesome. The place was clean, the employees were super nice and kind, especially to the girl in front of me who didn&apos;t understand how to go orders work. Overall great place, I will be back!"
3,"Popped in for some coffee and a pasty to get time through the morning. The shop was confinement and pretty cute, the slow moving line, not so much. Got a couple pastries and some cold brew to go and walk to the park to eat it. Instead of the blueberry cornmeal cake I ordered, there was a chia pudding in my bag. The line was too long to even contemplate going back in so I decided to eat it, despite hating chia seeds. It wasn&apos;t so bad but it was made four days earlier (the date was written on the bottom of the cup), had some terrible grape tasting jam on top and there were three berries on the bottom that tasted almost fermented, like they had been sitting for too long. The bacon scone was good, the coffee so-so."
5,"Came here during the covid19 pandemic, originally I had planned on ordering online, picking up my order and leaving but the cafe was so clean, and virtually no customers were sitting in the eating areas so I just sat down to enjoy my meal and it was so refreshing to do so. Loved people watching by the window and enjoying my breakfast sandwich. Also ordered a blueberry cornmeal cake to go. Thinking cup never lets me down! Definitely one of my favorite cafes in Boston (I&apos;m very picky). Please support them!"
4,"This is a cute little coffee shop just across the street from Boston Common. Sat down here to do a little work after walking around town being a bit touristy. I had a chai tea and found an open table. The ambiance is very casual, seems like a lot of people were coming and going. 

As someone else said, the lack of wifi wasn&apos;t helpful, had to tether off of my cell phone. So not a fantastic spot to work from. They had a case full of delicious looking pastries and the menu of food looked good. All I tried was the tea though. It was a slightly spicier chai. 

Seems like a good spot to stop and meet friends, but I wouldn&apos;t stop there again to try and do a little work."
4,What a nice and cozy coffee shop in the heart of Boston!  I have walked past here many times as it is near my work.  I had a PSL and it was delish!   They also offer breakfast and lunch sammies.   The d√©cor is so relaxing.  I did not want to come back to work.
4,"Nice place by the Boston Common. Drinks are small, but the setting is cozy. The matcha latte also isn&apos;t sweetened, which I like."
5,Some of the best coffee I have had in a while! Wife even loved it! (She&apos;s picky with coffee) I got an iced latte &amp; she got a hot coffee with honey &amp; cinnamon! The HOUSE MADE flavors make allll the difference!
5,"Visit Date: May 28, 2019

I loved Thinking Cup. I didn&apos;t know they were a Boston chain until we passed a few of them while walking around Boston. Hubby and I just randomly picked it as the coffee shop I wanted to try. 

I was going to get a fancy drink but I recently started weight watchers and was counting points during the vacation and when I saw the gluten free donut that&apos;s what I had to have instead of the drink. 

My coffee was delicious, the donut was so awesome as well. 

My hubby wasn&apos;t so satisfied but he doesn&apos;t write for yelp, although I do like to note his opinion at times in my reviews. 

I would definitely go to thinking cup again if we were visiting Boston again, great coffee shop!"
4,"Their cheesecake and croissants are so good. It&apos;s hard to find seating sometimes. During the winter, they have a heavy curtain to block out the wind. The sandwiches are just okay and expensive. I really just recommend the desserts."
