5,"Coconut lovers, get yourself to Bova&apos;s Bakery right now.  Literally, no matter what time it is, you can go RIGHT NOW because they are open 24 hours and you will be rewarded with a coconut cake so fabulous you won&apos;t know how you lived prior to trying it.

This cake will even make you use the &quot;m&quot; word that freaks me out when people use it to describe baked goods:  &quot;moist&quot;.  I know, everyone wants their baked goods to be that way but the word is just so creepy.  Anyhow, you will think it as you are eating, trust me.

I went in on October 30th in the middle of the freaky snow we had, and blew in the front door (literally) around 3:15PM.  A really nice girl was working, I can&apos;t even tell you what she looked like because I was soaking wet and my glasses had fogged up, but I was downtown and promised a friend I would get this cake we had read so much about (only true coconut lovers would walk 15 minutes in that weather).  She boxed up two slices for me and off I went, confident in the deliciousness that was to come.

OMG, the smell of the cake was amazing.  Each piece was heavy, but felt light when eating it (if that makes any sense??) and in between each layer was the filling of a coconut cream pie (I believe).  The frosting was beautiful, bright white and fluffy and just the right amount of sweetness with all of that gorgeous coconut.

Get yourself there right now and you will not be disappointed!!"
5,"What can I say about Bova&apos;s that hasn&apos;t already been said? Skip the line at Mike&apos;s and Modern, and head straight here. Their lobster tails and pizza are incredible, and I&apos;m a sucker for their German chocolate cake. 

My only caution is that they haven&apos;t always been keeping to their capacity limit of 10 during COVID, so try to set a good example by waiting outside if the capacity is maxed out."
5,"We were walking around the North End in the early morning, and there&apos;s just a few places open, and Bova&apos;s was one of them! We were greeted by one of the Bovas - Diana Bova, who was really friendly and very inviting.  We wanted to try one of their famous cannolis, so went for a Nutella one, which was really good.  But we especially loved their &quot;lobster tails&quot; - a lobster tail shaped croissant type pastry, with a creamy mixture of Bavarian cream and whipped cream inside. Incredible. Note that there&apos;s a $10 minimum for credit cards, so we used cash for the first time in a while. Definitely worth a visit!"
5,"My favorite bakery of all times. 

I was hesitant to try the Tiramisu, because I wanted to indulge in the coconut cake again. So I took a leap of faith and not regretting my decision. Omg, what a light delicate sponge texture. My Tiramisu was so perfect in flavor with expresso and coco. I&apos;ll be thinking about you Tiramisu, until our next roundevue. 

Unfortunately, I have no pictures of my dessert, because it was too delicious to snap a picture before eating."
3,"Since Mike&apos;s is cash-only, my friend and I opted to stop by at Bova&apos;s instead for our cannoli-cravings. We got there around 3 pm and there was a small line, but it goes relatively quickly as they only offer takeout. 

I wish they had a staff to watch over the line and capacity within the store or at least stickers to indicate placements 6 ft apart from each other. Instead, it is up to the customers and unfortunately, some people choose to wait directly behind the person in front of them rather than space out. This isn&apos;t 100% the business&apos;s fault, but some enforcement or encouragement to at least get people to wait 6 ft apart from each other would be much appreciated during these times. 

There are menus and prices of the pastries taped on the fridge near the entrance which helps save time on deciding what to order. Based on their menu, I had planned to get a pistachio, creme brulee, tiramisu, cappuccino, and oreo cannoli. 

Once I reached the counter, I relayed my order to the lady who seemed overwhelmed and maybe new. She had to stop in the middle of packing to ask for my order again twice which made me very nervous that she was getting my order mixed up. When I saw that my package contained a tiramisu cake instead of a cannoli, I was very surprised. According to their menu, they have tiramisu cannolis, but I guess that is no longer the case and the menu in front is outdated? The lady who packed my order said they don&apos;t have tiramisu cannolis. 

Another problem with the whole miscommunication is because their labels are in the wrong place. The pistachio cannolis were labeled as sfogliatella, the cappuccino cannolis were pistachio cannolis, and the peanut butter cannolis were labeled under cappccino. They also had cannolis labeled under &quot;salted caramel&quot;? Although it looks more like the chocolate dipped one... but I am not 100% sure as everything is labeled incorrectly in their display. 

Quality-wise, everything was really good except for the pistachio cannoli which was very artificially flavored (plus, what&apos;s with the unnecessary food coloring?). Looking at photos of the pistachio cannoli from other reviews, it should be crusted with pistachios. That was not the case on the day I came. 

I am not sure if I&apos;d make my way here again over other nearby bakeries. The pastries were good, but the customer service and whole experience were a bit chaotic."
5,"Go here!!! Avoid Mike&apos;s &amp; Modern Pastry and do yourself the biggest favor of your Italian baked goods life &amp; buy a Florentine Cannoli from Bova&apos;s!!! Your mouth will thank you.

After watching a excerpt on &quot;The Insider, Food&quot; on YouTube, we discovered Bova&apos;s &amp; my family &amp; I were eager to learn for ourselves if the commentators knew what they were talking about. And yes, they did! In a major way! 

Bova&apos;s did NOT disappoint &amp; we&apos;re so excited to return here to try their other beautiful looking baked goods, &amp; quite often.

Thank you, Bova&apos;s!!! 
Ciao!"
5,"WOW
Why did I not get here earlier? This is so much better than the other popular cannoli places. The best part? It&apos;s open 24/7! The Florentine Cannoli is bomb but honestly, pretty much everything is! They accept credit/debit card over $10. To top it off, they have such friendly customer service. So get out here and get buying! You won&apos;t regret it."
5,Hands down best Italian cookies I have ever had in my life. I would sell my entire soul for them and possibly more. I may or may not commit the aveda kedavra  curse in order to eat more of these cookies. I would even go as far to say I would commit this curse on a small innocent child.
5,"THE PIZZA,,, enough said 
Thank me later! :)"
3,"Pre-COVID review: Everyone always talks about how this place is better than Mike&apos;s and Modern, so I had to try it out. Unfortunately, I don&apos;t see what the hype is. I got a peanut butter cannoli and noticed, to my dismay, that they were prefilled. It was alright--the peanut butter wasn&apos;t particularly strong, and it the cannoli was fairly standard. Maybe it makes me a basic tourist, but I actually like Mike&apos;s more. I also got some chocolate-covered Oreos, and they were fine. Nothing really enticed me, so maybe this place just isn&apos;t for me. I would definitely come back and give them another shot though."
5,Fantastic place!  Best in the North End.  Love the service and the pastries are the BEST!   Worth the trip!
5,"Between Mike&apos;s, Modern &amp; Bova&apos;s, Bova has the best cannolis!
Picked up cannolis from all 3 places today and the cannolis (creme brulee &amp; choco chip) were our favorites. The filling fully filled the shell &amp; was very creamy thick and full of ricotta flavor.
And considering they are 24/7 I cant imagine going anywhwere else next time I come to Boston"
5,"Again! Best service ever! They&apos;re the best!
Visited Boston once again and ordered the Florentine cannoli this time. So delicious and filling is perfect balance of ricotta and sweet. I stepped outside and noticed it was completely shattered. I decided to return to express my issue and with no hesitation they offered me another one. I feel like I wouldn&apos;t have been able to even speak to anyone at mikes"
4,"Really great cannoli &amp; it&apos;s super cool how they&apos;re open 24/7. 
Definitely gives you the &quot;Italian&quot; vibe when you&apos;re inside &amp; leaving onto the skinny Boston streets in front of Bova&apos;s. 
I&apos;ll definitely be returning &amp; I&apos;d recommend this spot!"
4,"AMAZING! It&apos;s tucked in the corner towards the back of Boston&apos;s Little Italy, but worth it! It&apos;s a little &quot;hole in the wall&quot; bakery, but that&apos;s when you know it&apos;s good! I was visiting out of town and had to get a dessert. You always hear about Mike&apos;s, but low key Bova&apos;s is where it&apos;s at!

I will say the cannoli did not &quot;wow&quot; me. I got the peanut butter chocolate chip one. There wasn&apos;t much flavor to the cream. I did enjoy the chocolate and peanut butter chips! I think it really saved it. We also got the carrot cake, chocolate covered strawberries, blueberry cheesecake, and strawberry cheesecake. All of this cost $19! They do have a $10 minimum on credit, but that won&apos;t be a problem when you see all of the goodies they have! 

Pretty much everything else tasted great! I think the only thing is the gelatin on the strawberry cheesecake tasted a little too artificial, but the blueberry one tasted more of the natural fruit. The cheesecake part itself was delicious! Not too sweet with a bit of tartness :)

I will be coming back if I ever come back to Boston!"
5,"Bova left me speechless, one of the gentlemen inside gave me a sample is something I don&apos;t know what it was but it became my form of food heroine.  Simply the most beautiful amazing wonderful taste that in an instant took me to nirvana, Valhalla, shangri-la, utopia, the promise land all at the same time. And that was just one piece of my order.  

Next: 
The Cannoli this was a life alternating moment. I have tried what bakeries call cannolis. Now I can say that all other cannolis SUCk. This was Art, the sistine chapel of Cannolis. The perfect mix of flour, salt, egg yolks, and butter all mixed with a whisk given to Bova by Zeus himself. The shell was a perfect bite with the delicate coating and firm bite. The filling was indescribable, literally indescribable I wished it was flowing thru my veins. The ricotta, the pistachio, the crème brûlée, and cappuccino you will not go wrong. 

Last but not least the whoopie pie!!!! 

What ever these things are, cake, pie, dessert sandwich they make me happy inside, outside, mentally, spiritually, and emotionally. I would gladly take shots of insulin and metformin to eat this everyday for the rest of my life.  Get one, get five you will not be disappointed. 

There are other places in Boston they are good but they are not BOVA.  This hungry Hawaiian is indebted for life for such a beautiful food experience. Mahalo I will return."
4,"Delicious Florentine cannoli. It&apos;s huge so grab a friend to share one. Love the nutty outer shell with the traditional ricotta cheese filling. Had the Nutella cannoli, the filling was smooth and creamy as well. Loved that it wasn&apos;t too sweet, even though it&apos;s Nutella! I personally would want a little bit more Nutella. Maybe drizzle the outside with some melted Nutella? But, definitely pass on the butter cookies though. Tasted a little stale. I got the prepackaged ones, maybe that&apos;s why. 

Due to covid-19, mask is mandatory if you want to get served, which is expected and respected by all. Only idiots would argue against this. Just wear the damn mask. 

Thank you for being open and serving the community!"
5,"THIS PLACE!!! Omg!! 

FLORENTINE CANNOLI!!!!!!!

And I don&apos;t even really like cannolis. Don&apos;t walk out without one. I went back 3 days in a row! 

We also had the carrot cake, coconut cream cake, oreo pie, wedding cookies.....all so good! 

I am back home in Dallas now and think about that Florentine cannoli often. Lol!

AND it&apos;s opened 24/7!!!!!"
5,Bova&apos;s has that very authentic feel makes some very good lemon powered sugar cookies.  They also have a number of other treats including cannolis and jelly filled pastries.  I ordered a strawberry sweet cream pastry and a coffee.  It was fresh and filling.  The staff were very friendly and made you feel like you were in a neighborhood bakery.
5,"I think this may be my first post on Yelp, even though I&apos;ve had it for years, it&apos;s just not my thing to post, i am more of a viewer haha! 
But this Bakery I just needed to post about, the sweet lady, Diana, absolutely made my day, so nice! I ordered a cake for my mom for her birthday and I have to say, it&apos;s the best cake I&apos;ve ever had!! Everything felt so light and delicious! (I ordered a chocolate cake with chocolate buttercream frosting).
Thank you for making my mom&apos;s birthday so special!! Looking forward to coming back, highly highly recommend!"
