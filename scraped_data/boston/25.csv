5,"Stumbled upon this place during quarantine while liking for a good Mac and cheese!

I have never visited The restaurant before but in case anyone is like me, and looking for a good lobster Mac and cheese, this is the place to order from!!

I&apos;ve order this Mac and cheese probably 5 times this year and everytime, it still surprises me how good it is. It&apos;s creamy and they always give such a large portion that I can enjoy for multiple meals."
5,"Really glad we stumbled upon this place while walking around Boston! A special shout out to our server, Robert, for answering all our questions about the area. Very modern rustic feel. They have plenty of gluten free options and the menu is clearly marked, to include beers and ciders. We had the chicken wings appetizer - highly recommend. Husband had the lobster roll, recommended by our server. I had the chicken sandwich (not available fried for gluten free) - compared to everything else we ate it was okay, but still delicious. Also recommend the sweet potato fries and brussel sprouts side dish."
5,"Amazing spot to stop by for brunch!  We walked by a few times and saw that it was always packed and decided to give it a try.

They have a very diverse brunch menu from seafood to breakfast staples to sandwiches, so there&apos;s something for everyone.  I decided on the short rib poutine which was cooked to perfection.  The short rib was rich and tender and everything was so delicious.  Their pancakes were also light/fluffy in the center with an outer crisp...so yummy!

Staff was friendly and attentive.  The restaurant also had plexiglass walls in between indoor booths as well as the outdoor tables.  They also had heat lamps outdoors.  The restaurant also offered contactless menus and payments through your phone.

Would definitely recommend!"
5,"This place was on point! High level service staff throughout the dining experience! There were three of us and we wanted to try to sample a few different menu items. 

All three of us tried the:
Crispy Pork Belly** $18.00
black pepper polenta, shaved apple, sweet &amp; sour apple cider syrup, pork crackling ...... this dish was the perfect start for our meal. I kind of think pork belly can be hit or miss, I know living in the south those are fighting words, but if it&apos;s too fatty, not really for me. This dish, that wasn&apos;t the case. Not too fatty and cooked to perfection. Ranks with one other place as the best I&apos;ve ever had.

Island Creek Oysters, Duxbury, MA* **
horseradish, lemon, mignonette
Half Dz$18.00 ... Only my wife and I had this dish. This was actually a late add after the Pork Belly was so good. Great presentation and really good oysters, again 5 star presentation ... 5 star taste.

BPH Clam Chowder $11.00
smoked bacon, leek, celery, marble potatoes ... even though this was an app we asked to have it come out for the main course. Kind of pricy, but an extremely generous portion. I&apos;m going to go out on a limb and say this is what Chowdaaa is supposed to taste like. Thank goodness my mom isn&apos;t on Yelp, I think it compares to the Oregon Clam Chowder she made when I was a kid .... I never said this and I&apos;ll deny it forever.

Spicy Beef &amp; Pork Bolognese $27.00
ground beef &amp; pork, spicy tomato ragu, whipped ricotta cheese, artisan pasta ... we made this once at home and loved it! Getting it here didn&apos;t disappoint. Great flavor execution and presentation. 5 stars again on this plate.

Our son had the:
Fish &amp; Chips $25.00
beer battered cod, crispy french fries, dill tarter sauce, lemon .... We each tried a bite...it wasn&apos;t bad, but this was probably our least favorite of all the things we tried. I&apos;d give this a solid 4 stars though. He did like it a lot thought. 

Great evening out capped off by a wonderful dining experience at Bostonia Public House."
1,"Today was the first, and last, time I will ever visit this establishment.

I had a reservation for 2:30 pm for brunch (their brunch ends at 3). As I sat down, our server asked us what we wanted to drink so I told her I wanted the big bloody mary that I saw on instagram, and my wife and mom also partook. When the cocktails were sent out, we each got three cups filled with random cocktail garnishes (olives, cheeses, pickles, etc). We did not get the full bloody mary tray with bacon, sausage, etc. When I asked about the trays, our server looked annoyed and said she would go check. She then came back with two plates full of random, old stuff as if to say &quot;here&apos;s what I could find.&quot; When I asked another server about the trays, I was told that they did not have enough and that they were being washed. Yet another server came and when asked about the trays, she too looked annoyed and said she would bring the trays.

She brought the trays, all right. One of them had half a donette on them and they were a joke of an attempt to re-create what we had originally gone there for. I arrived and ordered the cocktails at around 2:40 pm and when these trays were brought at past 3, the server made it a point to let us know that brunch ended at 3, as if to say &quot;you should be glad we&apos;re even giving you anything.&quot;

The sad thing is, my brother was visiting his friends at the table next to us and he and the friends got the full treatment: bloody mary trays with all the fixings, just like on Instagram and on their website. I would like to think it was a simple mistake by the serving team but the overall lack of care for us as customers makes me think it is a cultural issue with the restaurant. Our server was nonexistent and there were patrons  (that were friends with one of the servers since she kept going to the back and lowering her mask to talk with them) that were slamming the table and screaming expletives.

The overall feel of this place was incredible when we walked in but after our experience today, I will never be coming here again. It also does not help that we found a hair in the tator tot poutine, which was a salty, soggy cast iron skillet of disappointment.

Not sure how this place got all the hype it has but if you&apos;re a minority, you should expect to be given the bad end of the stick. lol"
4,"Great covid service! My friends were in town and we needed an early reservation for drinks/snacks, no dinner (5:30). Bostonia took a same day reservation and had no problem with us not ordering dinner.

We ended up being a little late and they didn&apos;t rush us out which was nice. It was less busy when we arrived and filled up towards 7ish when we were leaving.

We had drinks and two snacks, the sweet potato waffle fries ($12) and the burrata ($14). The fries were delicious and fried in duck fat. The burrata wasn&apos;t melty enough compared to other places but was okay overall. Both were small for the price.

I&apos;d come back to hang out for drinks. Highly recommend for covid gatherings because they have tons of space."
4,"At BPH&apos;s homey downtown patio, you can enjoy both spacious outdoor seating and an authentic Boston pub experience. Bostonia serves a diverse assortment of delicately prepared American dishes, featuring a generous array of delicious plant-based mains. It was a wonderful place to celebrate a twenty-first birthday, with a fleet of housemade cocktails and canned beverages! Bostonia&apos;s relatively pricey, but it&apos;s worth it for the cozy social atmosphere and bougie takes on rich pub favorites. Definitely recommend giving BPH a try!"
5,"Saw one picture on Yelp of the Hot Chicken Sandwich and had to come in and try it. The crispy, fried chicken sandwich did not disappoint. It was very delicious and was accompanied by crisp, thick potato fries. I dipped the fries into honey mustard, it was the perfect combination. 

I ordered the Elderfashioned as my drink and liked it so much I ordered two of them. Overall, great Boston spot for a burger and drinks. Next time will try their &quot;date night&quot; option on the menu."
4,"Been here 3 times in a matter of a few months. I found that the food is decent. Drinks are OK. I think they skimp on the alcohol content of most drinks which docked them a star. Also, everything is way overpriced for the quality. 

The chicken wings were the most memorable each time. They were so crispy and tasty; highly recommended. The sweet potato donuts are also quite memorable if you love sweets. I&apos;ve had the Nashville hot chicken sandwich, short rib breakfast poutine. the bolognese which were good but not spectacular. Had much better elsewhere with all 3 dishes. The steak frites were also okay but the yucca fries that come with it are delicious. My boyfriend also mentioned that the scallops were &quot;really good&quot; hope this helps!"
5,"If you&apos;re looking for a brunch spot, you cannot go wrong with the Bostonia. 

I have been to their brunch both pre and during Covid. Their Bloody Mary bar is unbelievable and still in Covid, they provide customers with a wide variety of tastey and unique toppings to decorate their cocktail with -  which go above and beyond any other bloody I&apos;ve seen. 

I have also visited the Bostonia a number of times for dinner and late night drinks. All of my experiences have been nothing short of wonderful. Their espresso martinis are delicious as well as just about every drink and food item I&apos;ve tried on their menu - you can&apos;t go wrong with just about anything, but I&apos;ll definitely recommend their queso and short rib poutine. 

I will say our server at brunch on Saturday, Rob, is the reason I finally decided to write a review. Rob was amazing and went above and beyond our expectations. He checked on us many times and knew when to step in and ask if we needed anything as well as when to just peak over and not interrupt. He gave excellent recommendations about both the menu and fun spots in Boston and was easily able to interact with our party. He found out it was one of our birthdays and without us asking he gave us complementary brunch shots with a candle for the birthday girl. His happy and positive attitude was both refreshing and contiguous and really made our experience."
5,"Bostonia public house was our first stop in Boston! It was open for lunch which on a Tuesday in the city not many places open until 4 so that was awesome! We got the French onion dip which you can tell was homemade with chips, simple! The inside is such a cool vibe and anyone that walked in fit in! They have all mass beers which and a wide selection of them too! Gabby was our server and she couldn&apos;t have made our experience better! She even gave us some awesome donut recommendations for the morning! Thanks gabby!"
5,Holy fuck this place is so good. I&apos;m just pissed we started with this place and now every where else we go pales in comparison lol. Clam chowder is a must. The truffle mashed potatoes were mind blowing. Everything was good and great service too.
5,"We only had a few hours in Boston and wanted to enjoy a nice brunch after visiting the New England Aquarium &amp; we stumbled across the Bostonian. We decided to stop in and we were not disappointed. We had a delicious hearty breakfast. I ordered a cup of coffee with 2 eggs scrambled, home fries and bacon. They served it with a griddled &amp; buttered English muffin that was outstanding. The bacon was really crisp and Smokey and the eggs were fluffy. The potatoes were so good! We saw sweet potato doughnuts on the menu so we had to order them, even though we were already stuffed. The doughnuts were more like &quot;holes&quot; they came out warm &amp; gooey covered in a light frosting. It was outstanding! The perfect compliment to a savory breakfast. The service was awesome. Our server was very attentive and made sure the coffee kept flowing. 
We will definitely come for dinner next time we are in Boston."
5,"Super cute trendy restaurant. I loved the ambience and the aesthetics of the restaurant as a whole. 

Our poor waiter was very patient with our orders. We were too busy talking and enjoying their yummy drinks and took too long to figure out food. 

We ordered the meatballs to start, they were sooo delicious! Very soft and so full of flavor. Definitely worth a try, cooked to perfection but still so tender."
5,"First time at Bostonia Public House and I am impressed! My co workers and I finally got together and had a great time. We had made reservations prior for outdoor seating. There were clear wall barriers between the tables adjacent to us, and the servers wore masks. Jugs of hand sanitizer were available indoor and outdoor. I felt pretty safe overall in our &quot;bubble&quot;. 

We got multiple rounds of drinks and a variety of food while we all caught up. Pretty happy with all the plates we got, the tater tot poutine was probably my favorite (I&apos;m weak for poutine haha). So simple, yet creamy and delicious. Favorite drink was the seasonal rose sangria! 

Overall, I would totally come back! Bostonia Public House is a place where you could do a cute date night,  catch up with friends and just grab a couple drinks. I&apos;ll definitely be returning!"
4,"Okay but definitely a place for tourists. The food was fine but nothing special, and there were few vegetarian and vegan options on the menu. The meal was pretty overpriced, especially given the mediocre service and lack of bread :("
5,Lovely time at Bostonia Public House! Very tasty food and drinks with lovely service and friendly staff. We had a wonderful time and felt comfortable given all the safety precautions in place. I definitely recommend checking this place out!
5,"Great food, delicious drinks, ample parking and great staff.  Our server, Robert was attentive, friendly and knowledgeable! We would definitely be back!"
5,"This was the first meal when we visited Boston last week. We were seated very promptly by the friendly hosts. Our table was upstairs, much more quiet and quaint. I thought that it was slightly dark in there but it made for a moody ambience. The bartender was our server. He was very helpful in giving his thoughts on what we should order. He was right about the Salt &amp; Pepper wings and the clam chowder. Both were the winners of our meal. We also tried the Tater Tot Poutine and the Nashville Hot Chicken Sandwich. Those were also delicious and flavorful but I can&apos;t stop thinking about those Salt &amp; Pepper wings. They are decadent in flavor with an extra crisp-no need for the dipping sauce! 

They are good about spacing each table out and felt very safe dining in the restaurant. I would visit this spot again!"
4,"Bostonia allows indoor seating with plexiglass walls in between tables. They don&apos;t leave one booth/table in between, so when I came for dinner at 5:30pm on a Sunday, by 6pm the place started getting full. The waiter seated my friend and I at a booth near the entrance, and we got an occasional cold gust of wind every time someone entered. We were also in close proximity with a huge group of people waiting to be seated. Thankfully, the waiter was stern to tell one of the people waiting to be seated who was unmasked to put his mask back on. I ordered the french onion dip with chips, and lobster mac &amp; cheese. The onion dip was well portioned for 2 people and made me quite full on its own. The lobster mac &amp; cheese was well portioned between the lobster and macaroni. I thought I wouldn&apos;t be able to finish it, but I managed to scarf it down because it was delicious."
