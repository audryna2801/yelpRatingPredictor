5,"After a day spent checking out many of the historical Boston tourist spots on our first full day of our East Coast Americana Tour, we had built up an appetite for our 2nd Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives (DDD) restaurant in a row.  The night prior when we landed in Boston, we had eaten the famous lobster roll at Pauli&apos;s.  For lunch, we decided to eat another Guy Fieri DDD featured restaurant called Yankee Lobster.  Out of the many restaurants we ate at during our 8-day trip, Yankee Lobster ranked right up there with the best.  Once again, Guy Fieri did not let us down and you won&apos;t be either when you chow down at Yankee Lobster.

Yankee Lobster is located inches from the Boston Harbor, so that should give you an indication of how fresh the seafood is at this restaurant.  From the outside, there&apos;s nothing flashy about the restaurant.  It gives off a blue collar vibe with the Yankee Lobster name clearly visible.  When you enter the restaurant, the paint on the walls are black and lobster red.  There are different forms of lobster decor throughout the space and I liked the touch of a lobster cage hanging from the ceiling.  To confirm that Guy Fieri had eaten at this restaurant, I once again his spray painted caricature  prominently hung for customers to see.  Parking could be difficult to find as my buddy had to park at a public customer pay parking lot.  Here you look over the menu, order from the register, and the food is brought to you in their indoor/outdoor dining area.  I appreciated them having a space where we can sit down and enjoy their food.  Thought their customer service was pretty good.

Boston can&apos;t be visited without eating seafood and Yankee Lobster is the place I recommend.  The food here is so memorable that I still remember how delicious everything was 8 days after I had eaten here.  I ordered the following:  a medium New England Clam Chowder, a Calamari Appetizer, and a Lobster Mac &amp; Cheese.  My buddy ordered shucked oysters.  I can&apos;t emphasize enough that Yankee Lobster has to be your go to place for Boston seafood.  Their New England Clam Chowder was the best clam chowder I have ever slurped.  The base of this soup was so tasty and slurp worthy.  That soup alone was worth it.  Add in the abundant amount of clams they put in their chowder and that soup is Hall of Fame worthy.  The only thing would have made the chowder stratospheric would have been a bread bowl to be the vessel for that soup.  The Calamari Appetizer was plentiful, fried and seasoned just right, and that was finger licking yummy.  My buddy&apos;s shucked oysters were fresh and paired really well with the lemon and hot sauce.  I thought the oysters here were the best on our trip and we ate oysters on several occasions.  Yankee Lobster&apos;s  Mac &amp; Cheese with added Lobster is a must order dish.  You&apos;ll pay an extra $10 to add lobster, but it was so worth it.  They aren&apos;t stingy with the lobster and with it paired with the cheesy mac, that was a match made in heaven.  I cleaned that dish like it was my last meal.  It really was divine.

I really enjoyed walking around Boston as it was my first time visiting this historical city.  If you want to talk about foodie historical, you&apos;ve got to eat at Yankee Lobster.  Guy Fieri once again steered us in the right direction and my tummy was very happy."
5,"I wish I could give this review more than 5 stars! Holy cow - the lobster sandwiches here are fantastic! HUGE chunks of delicious lobster, not too much butter or Mayo to take away fro the fishy taste. Paired with a nice warm / slightly crispy and buttery roll. AND it comes with perfectly crispy fries.

This place is a tiny spot but has a great spot to eat that is partially outdoors. Number one lobster roll in Boston! I will have to come back even tho it is a bit out of the way and not in too scenic of an area, it is well worth the trek!"
5,"Hot butter roll. Hot butter roll. Hot butter roll.

Get their hot buttered roll (lol?). The amount of lobster you get is absurd. The food is way too tasty. It feels like its being made by someone out of the world. Plus don&apos;t get me started on the fries. That amount of fries you get (and so crispy!) is kind of absurd - you can literally start making a castle out of the amount of fries you get and still have more hanging around. 

You order at their front and they will bring out the food in take out containers. You can sit in their side alley/backyard to enjoy this decadence that&apos;s about to hit your five sense.

This should be on everyone&apos;s lobster roll hitlist."
4,"Used to stop by this spot for  a beer and food before concerts (Blue Hill Pavilion, or whatever they  call it now is next door). I dig it. 

Harpoon is next door so the  beer is fresh, the dock is up the road so the seafood is fresh, the  fries aren&apos;t the best, but shit, I didn&apos;t come to a seafood shack for  fries. I just moved out of the city, but I&apos;ll be stopping by whenever  I&apos;m back.

A heads up: Either come real early before a concert  starts, or check to make sure one isn&apos;t happening since there isn&apos;t a  whole lot of space and the place fills up fast."
5,"I was in Boston this morning early. Around 11 a.m. I stopped by Yankee Lobster to find out they did not open until noon. On my way to my car a very nice young man asked me what I wanted. I told him clam chowder and he said some was ready. 
I got the largest for 17.50 and should have got another.
They still have the best chowder anywhere.
Thank you Yankee Chowder for making my day"
4,Open for lunch during the begining of the pandemic and they were so nice. The buttered Hot Lobster Rolls was awesome as were the fries. Just a hole in the wall but the food is pretty fantastic.
3,"Decent lobster roll. Wouldn&apos;t say it&apos;s the best I had. But when you&apos;ve worked a 16 hour shift delivering fuel to construction sites all over Boston and pull over to have a mental breakdown and shove a lobster roll down your throat with oil covered hands, it was pretty good. Good raspberry lime Rickey."
3,"Great location but just average lobster. Very bland and a bit spongy / over cooked. Nice presentation and decent service but for the outrageous price of $25.99 for a hot lobster roll vs comparable $18-$20 everywhere else, I was pretty upset with the taste. To charge $5-$7 more than the going rate it should&apos;ve been better or at least as good as the best ones, which it was not. ;(
$100 even for 3 lobster rolls and 3 small soups. Eek."
5,Great lobster rolls! Ended up sharing these two meals and while the classic lobster was great those rolls hit the spot. And there was tons of melted butter on the side.
3,"This is really a 3.5 star review. You go in and it&apos;s order at the counter. After you order, they have a dining area that is self seating. We ordered the crabcakes appetizer, New England clam chowder, and a hot buttered lobster roll.

The crabcakes came as 2 patties, a lemon wedge, and sauce on the side. The sauce is probably mayo based and mixed with ketchup. It reminded us of big mac sauce. Anyway, the crabcakes had a good consistency. Not too much flour and held up fine as we cut it into smaller pieces and dipped them in sauce. Nice 4.5 out of 5 for crabcakes. The chowder was also very good. Nice classic chowder taste with chunks in every bite. Dont get the fishy taste either. Honestly didnt need the oyster crackers, but we threw them in anyway. Chowder gets a solid 4 out of 5. Now bring on the hot buttered lobster roll! Wow.... it sucked. Very basic lobster roll. The bread was ok.. fries were ok.. taste was ok..maybe bland, overall nothing special at all... there&apos;s other places that do a little more for the same price. Definitely do not recommend the lobster roll here. It&apos;s unfortunate because I remember coming 3 years ago and thinking quite the opposite. Yankee is a nice seafood spot, but head elsewhere if you&apos;re looking for the best lobster roll in Boston."
5,"I enjoyed this place!

I was in Boston for about 20 hours and right before hitting the road back to NYC, my mom, niece and I decided to stop here for a quick seafood lunch. I have to admit I ordered with my eyes. A fried lobster roll for myself, fish sandwich for my mother, chicken fingers for my niece (she&apos;s seven and a picky eater), shrimp cocktail and crab cakes for starters and also fried shrimp. 

I called back twice after placing my order, first to add the crab cakes, then again to add the fried shrimp and I&apos;m so happy I did! Each time I called back was because I&apos;d seen another patron eating something that looked good. My excuse was &quot;we&apos;re from out of town, we should really try a sampling&quot;

Everything was delicious! The crab cakes and fried shrimp especially so! My mom and I were able to finish the shrimp cocktail and crab cakes; also put a dent in the fried shrimp platter while there but everything else hit the road with us. We took the lettuce and tomato off the fish sandwich and placed it in one of the discarded containers. 

When we got back home almost four hours later, we reheated the leftovers in our air fryer and everything was good as new!

Because of Covid, we couldn&apos;t order inside; you have to call their number and place your order, they call your phone to tell you when to come inside to collect your orders. Payment is card only, contactless. The tables outside were also wiped down by staff after patrons left. There&apos;s hand sanitizer available."
4,"Oh man if you love seafood this is the place to go to! It&apos;s kind of out of the way and right on the pier. Not anything fancy or gourmet, just good hearty grub. It&apos;s not cheap but fresh seafood isn&apos;t usually.

 We got the crab cakes ($14.99) and a couple of the baskets: shrimp ($13.99), fried calamari ($12.99), and lobster roll ($25.99). The baskets came with hot, crispy, fluffy fries and cole slaw.

Very casual setting - order at the counter and take a seat. Small and crowded (well, it was crowded when we went on a sunny afternoon)."
4,"When in Boston , a must eat is the infamous lobster roll! I highly recommend trying Yankee Lobster. Beware though, the smell of fresh seafood will hit you as soon as you enter the door. I came with three other friends around 12:30. Any later, it would have been difficult to find a seat. The restaurant is pretty small and can fill up quickly. Order at the front and they will bring the food to you.

Clam Chowder: Slim on the clams, but filled with tons of potatoes! Very creaming and amazing flavor all around.

Hot Lobster Roll: The bus was thick, buttery, and toasted perfectly. Yankee Lobster did not disappoint! My roll was filled with fresh, thick lobster. The fries on the side had great potato to fry ratio. Thin and crispy!

Overall, great lobster rolls all around! Will be coming back for my next seafood fix."
5,"It&apos;s small. It&apos;s loud. It&apos;s crowded. It&apos;s great. They move you along as you stand in line to order but they also tell you where to sit while you are in line and after ordered at the counter you already have a clear plan of action.
Got here on a Saturday early evening around 6:00 and the wait was minimal but again the place was packed
 It has a college dive bar vibe but somehow it was a cool experience."
5,"So sad to see the effect of C19 on this once sleepy little lobster shack. Following strict rules which are insulting, combined with cold and pre-cooked food, makes taking a break from YLC a mandate.
   &quot;Anthony, is your food cold?&quot;
   &quot;Yeah Erin, I called them to order while sitting on premises and then it came out in a couple of minutes.&quot; 
   &quot;But there&apos;s no one else here.&quot;
   &quot;I know, I don&apos;t get it, should be steaming.&quot;
   &quot;Well, I&apos;m steaming.&quot;
   &quot;Erin, I&apos;ll put your bisque in my closed up car and we&apos;ll let the sun re-fire it.&quot;
   &quot;Re-fire!&quot; yells Erin, pretending she&apos;s on Sweetbitter.
   Anthony says, &quot;I&apos;m not sending this back, it was too hard to order in the first place, no way I&apos;m dealing again with the overworked and underpaid trophy winning youts&quot;"
4,"Best broiled scallops i&apos;ve had in a while!!! Coming from NY to Boston, i HAD to try some seafood during my trip. I didn&apos;t have any places in mind - so i took a quick search on yelp and came across this place. 

I had a bit trouble finding parking (small parking lot with limited capacity), so we had to drive around a bit until we found a meter parking close by. Unfortunately, 5 minutes is 25 cents so be prepared to have some coins on you!! 

Once i got inside - i had this first impression where the place had a &quot;retro&quot; feels to it. Pretty old fashioned and small. The place wasn&apos;t the warmest (temperature-wised) when ppl may be looking forward to getting out of the low Boston weather, when walking in. Other than that, the staffs and cashiers were super friendly and attentative. They recommended us what to get and was pretty quick with our orders. Just like i mentioned, the SCALLOPS is a must. The lobster and oysters were just okay. And the fish n chips were phenomenal."
1,"Extremely disappointed as the quality of the food is not the same anymore. My husband and I have been eating at Yankee Lobster for almost 2 years at least once a week. The Hot Lobster Roll once was buttery and full of flavor is now tasteless swimming in cheap margarine and the amount of lobster chunks in the roll is reduced to almost half. 
I understand that restaurants are going through a difficult time because of the pandemic and are cutting on costs; however, I don&apos;t see a reason why customers should be penalized on the quality of the food. My last order was today November 4th 2020. Yankee Lobster lost 2 loyal weekly customers."
3,"This might of been a different experience if I dined in. I got my order thru Uber Eats and before getting my order the driver had another delivery before getting to me. The lobster meat in the hot lobster was good but the bread was soggy and the fries were terrible, cold, limp. Crab cakes had generous amount of crab but just lacked something. The best part of the order was the Clam Chowder, even luke warm it was good with crackers. Lots of clams in every bite."
4,"Mouthwatering hot, buttery lobster piled on a fresh brioche roll... it doesn&apos;t get much better than that. The lobster meat is fantastic and melts in your mouth. I was pleased to discover Yankee Lobster is open for outdoor sit down and take out. Next time I go, I&apos;ll definitely be trying the &quot;Crobster&quot; roll, which is half crab and half lobster."
3,Cousin took me here when I visited. Super disappointed after reading the reviews and ate what I ate. The clam box wasn&apos;t edible you can chew your teeth off and the clam meat still isn&apos;t breaking!! Lobster rolls tasted like a flower scent for some reason. I know it&apos;s not flower scented but that&apos;s the only way I can describe what I tasted. Clam chowder was the only decent thing there. There was a few tables outside of the shop. You order your food indoors and they pack it to go for you to dine outside. Clean up after yourself type of deal.
