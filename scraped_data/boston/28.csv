5,"On the eve of its reopening for its 150th anniversary, I ponder about the good times, when I would come here on a Saturday morning and spend all day, looking through the cavalcade of art. Although I didn&apos;t appreciate the MFA as much when I was younger (though it was a good excuse for a field trip and out of the classroom), I appreciate it even more now. This is especially so since it&apos;s been closed for six months because of the virus-that-shall-not-be-mentioned.

The amount and diversity of art here is remarkable. The museum really packs a lot in here and you could spend a long time going through everything. There&apos;s something for everybody here. If you&apos;re into colonial American history, as Boston is known for, they&apos;ve got it. If you want impressionists, two words: Claude Monet. The museum has an extensive East Asian art collection that can hold its own. There are artifacts from all over the world, if you&apos;re into ancient coins and pots and such. The revolving exhibits often showcase contemporary art. I won&apos;t judge you if you like Rothko. 

The good thing about the museum these days is the wide array of events it holds. I went to an evening event aimed towards younger folk and it was a lot of fun. They had food stations, board games, live music, dance floor, and group drawing. Again, there&apos;s something for everybody.

Protip: If you live around here, often your local library can provide ticket discounts. I don&apos;t think Wednesday nights are free anymore, though."
5,A beautiful place to spend your time. Discounted admission on Wednesday nights and for individuals with economic hardship. Too large to see everything in one day. I loved to sit and people watch here pre-Covid and can&apos;t wait to go back now that it&apos;s open!
5,Wonderful collection. I particularly love the ceramic reliefs by Della Robbia and the dutch art bequest that was recently added. There is a chapel brought from Spain and amazing early renaissance art next to it...oh and wonderful Rembrandts and Monets and a huge ancient Roman sculpture of Hera and Egyptian mummies and all sorts of modern design and and  modern art and interesting prints etc etc etc...its a world class museum. It has a lovely atmosphere in which to ponder and gain inspiration and  a reasonably priced cafeteria as well as 3 other eateries (not sure about now with covid but won&apos;t last for ever!) and 2 nice stores.
5,"I can&apos;t believe I haven&apos;t written a review until now. This is my favorite place to go to in Boston. There&apos;s always a new exhibit going on, and the monet area is beautiful. The architecture is pretty, and they also have fun events during the summer with music, and even some late night events! 

College students in the area (for the most part) go for free, you just need to show ID. There&apos;s also dining inside, and sometimes dance parties in the main hall. It&apos;s just such a nice little break from the rest of the city, and there&apos;s always something new to discover. Would recommend whether you like art or not!"
5,Came out to see the Basquiat exhibit and I will tell you it will not disappoint! I was really enthralled with all of the different pieces all so intricate and unique to each artist. I look forward to going back with my younger brother because this exhibit was definitely one I&apos;d say you should hit more then once if you can because you will get lost in the intricacies of each artist technique and you&apos;ll want to devour each piece for its entirety!
3,"Never had due to collection, I wasn&apos;t overly impressed this visit.  Seemed at least 1\3 galleries were closed, the food options were DISMAL especially given you can&apos;t leave and re-enter, kids worksheets and attractive foods (besides candy and potato chips) were non existent.
For 25% capacity it seemed a lot more.  The &quot;one way&quot; floor markers were not obvious when using stairs between floors and didn&apos;t make sense (entered one gallery and all markers pointed toward us).  Gift store is way to crowded with displays to even attempt social distancing.
Overall not a great experience."
5,"Love MFA! One of the best spots to take your someone special. There is so much to see and so much to learn. 

If you are in college, you can find discounts from your school! They love working with other Universities so this is a big plus."
5,"One of my absolute favorite places to go on the weekends whenever I hear a new exhibit is popping up. They have a wide variety of art ranging from classical to early american to royal jewelry and historical handcrafted instruments. 

Another really cool offering at MFA is that they offer art classes. These included basic fashion illustration to watercolors and painting. Definitely take advantage of those as you get a solid amount of classes for the price. On top of that, buying the class includes admission to the  all of the galleries in the museum so after class, you can really take advantage of that perk by sticking around and visiting an exhibit before leaving. 

Theres also night events with drinks if you&apos;re 21+ and those have pretty amazing works being displayed and showcased as well. Probably even better than whats regularly showcased  in the museum because its limited to a certain schedule."
5,"SUCH a beautiful museum! This was my favorite history and arts museum. Upon entering there was a grand staircase, it&apos;s huge and spacious with three levels. I came around 2:15pm and had 2 hours and 45 minutes to explore and had to rush through the later 70% so I would suggest coming here early especially if you like to take the time with the artworks as I do.

They have a cute cafe here that I saw people working at and cafeteria. Admission was $23 for student discount. Wear comfortable shoes ! They had different exhibitions across the globes and it was wonderful. It would probably take me all day to get through everything if I came again. I especially liked the contemporary, asian, and American art."
5,"I have been visiting Boston and had so many suggestions to come here ! 

Was NOT disappointed. 25 dollars well spent. So much culture and so much to see. All parts of the world were covered. 

Nearby university students get free admission. I would recommend to Uber because the parking was expensive.

Over all loved it. Definitely would recommend others to go !"
5,My wife and I spent a weekend in Boston and the MFA visit was certainly the highlight.  It was an absolutely breathtaking experience. I am embarrassed to admit that I did not realize some of the great masterpieces that are on display here.  Almost every room we walked into seemed to hold a treasure I had only seen in pictures before.  We spent 4 hours in the museum and barely scratched the surface... can&apos;t wait to come back soon!!
5,"Just incredible!! I had the most amazing time here yesterday. I went on a Friday (7/12/19) because this museum participates in Free Fun Friday&apos;s in the summer. (Check before going though on which Fridays). That&apos;s right. Completely free to get in and experience this awe-inspiring place. Although after going yesterday I would say that the usual ticket price of $25 is well worth it. 
Place is huge. I spent hours here and even got a little lost making sure I saw everything. Sit down restaurant inside as well. Clean bathrooms. Great gift shops that won&apos;t break the bank. All staff I spoke to were friendly. 
Get here!!"
2,"I am writing to express my public health concern and overall dissatisfaction with my visit today.

I appreciate the health check and timed entry but once inside the exhibit nearly no one was social distancing.  Your safety personal were paying no attention at all to crowd control or one way movement through the exhibit.

As a matter of fact, the exhibit was the only place in the Museum without arrows and prompts for where to stand and how to travel in one direction.

People bunched up, stood too close, walked in circles, and were simply not following protocol.

If people are expected to move through a supermarket in one way aisles, socially distanced, they certainly can in a museum!

You absolutely sold an excessive number of tickets per one hour time block.

My daughter is so distressed by the experience that she has scheduled a COVID test before she feels safe about seeing her boyfriend.

We should have left, but we were inside before we realized how difficult and unsafe and anxiety provoking the experience would be.  (Outside visitors were also having trouble following directions also, but we thought they were perhaps just excited.)

I am 66 years old.  I can only pray that what was supposed to be a lovely afternoon with my daughter was not a mistake.

I recently renewed my membership because I trusted that the MFA had the best interest of its patrons foremost."
5,"Let it be known - I&apos;m a lover of Art Museums. So, not too surprising, I loved MFA. I regretted having missed their Frida Kahlo special exhibit by only a few days. The collection here is amazing. I especially liked some of the American pieces. They had an interesting exhibit about gender and clothes and another featuring a French artist (their name escapes me!) 

The daily admission is comparable to other big city art museums. They recently started to offer free admission to military families. We were there with my dad - a Vietnam vet. We were all touched to be able to enjoy the museum for free."
5,"This place is amazing! The mummy is Exhibits are amazing! 
My 10 year old daughter loves it!!!!"
5,I love the MFA. There is so much to see and learn about. It&apos;s no wonder they are one of the premier art museums in the world. We are so lucky to have it in our back yard. They always have great special exhibits that come through. I also found out I get in free w/ my Harvard employee ID. Pretty cool!
5,"An amazing museum!!! I really loved visiting here from home (Oregon). Such a broad array of art that they have here. From Monet, to Egyptian exhibits (my favorite), to African Art - there is so much to look at! They have some really special and rare pieces."
5,"Fantastic place to visit, it&apos;s seriously seriously wonderful! The art is wonderful I seriously recommend visiting."
5,"AN ABSOLUTELY MUST DO! 5 STARS! THE MUSEUM OF FINE ARTS IN BOSTON IS A JAW DROPPING GARGANTUAN ARRAY OF PRICELESS SCULPTURES, ARTIFACTS, PAINTINGS, ANTIQUITIES, &amp; TREASURES  FROM THE ROMAN, GREEK, EGYPTIAN, CHINESE, MODERN &amp; BOSTON MADE ERAS ALL TOGETHER UNDER ONE ROOF. Plan on spending at least 4 hours to the entire day going through this Magnificent Museum. The Exterior Architecture of the building with all the columns &amp; the inside architectural style of period rooms with furnishings really lets you appreciate the Art of that time period.                                           Here&apos;s just a partial list of some of the Masters on display here: works by Vincent Van  Gogh, Monet, Degas, Jackson Pollack, Gainsborough. They have the portrait of George Washington that is used for our currency on the Dollar Bill. There are countless statues &amp; artifacts from when the Greeks, The Roman Empire &amp; the Egyptians ruled the world. They have the statue of Juno the largest classical Roman sculpture in any museum in the US. It stands 13 foot tall &amp; weighs in at 13,000 pounds. The statue is INCREDIBLE! There&apos;s the bust of King Ptolemy. They also have the antiquities that were recovered from Villa Fondo Bottaro. That is the site that was destroyed by the same Mt. Vesuvius eruption that destroyed the city of Pompeii.There is Room after Room after Room of priceless works of art &amp; treasures. The place is MASSIVE. They have a section of Boston Made Art pieces that are a site to behold. In addition to all this there are numerous contemporary artists that have there works on display as well. The Museum is always bringing in new collections for the public; so it is always evolving. There are also Sculptures &amp; Art Pieces outside the Museum on their green space. 
You can take The T here. There is a Bus &amp; the Trolley that both stop right in front of the Museum. They  also have their own Parking Lot &amp; sometimes you can even snag some Metered Parking on the street.  
Go to the Rear of the building &amp; Go across the street to The Fenway for a country setting &amp; there&apos;s a bike/ running path &amp; a great place to have a picnic lunch. There&apos;s a very picturesque view of the bridge, water &amp; the Prudential Center. 
INSIDE MONEY SAVINGS TIP.  In Boston on Sundays they have Free Parking at the Meters. So that will save you some Cash!  
The Boston Museum of Fine Arts is one of the Best Museums in the World. If you live in Boston or are just visiting the city this Must be on your to do list.   
It used to be, you had to have Mega Bucks &amp; be really rich to have The Good Life, not anymore. The Game has changed. You&apos;ve Been Upgraded. Now You Can Live Like A King On A Limited Budget!"
4,"At the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, Wednesday nights are Free Admission after 4 pm, when admission is by voluntary contribution (suggested donation $25).

I decided to hit the MFA the Wednesday after Christmas (yes, during school vacation week) to check out the Winnie-the-Pooh exhibit (Exploring a Classic), which required timed tickets, before it departed after January 6.

Let&apos;s just say that there was already a line out to the sidewalk when I had arrived there by 5:20pm.  It took 10 min to get in the front door, and 5 additional minutes to have my ticket in hand.  Yeah, I&apos;m glad I decided to stay instead of being scared away by the line.

Only terrible thing was that my timed ticket was for 8pm.  But that just meant I had a couple of hours to wander the floors of the museum, when my original plans were to just hit the special Pooh exhibit and then to run on home.

On this special school vacation week, there were several stations around for children to do crafts.  That was nice.

I also liked their seasonal decorations.

My first art stop was the French Pastels - Treasures from the Vault, since I  have a liking of Monet.  Did you know that pastels are sensitive to light?  Me neither.

Later on, my search for a bathroom led me to the photos of Ansel Adams in Our Time, since there was an issue with the first one I had sought out.

They were organized on how they handled the Pooh timed tickets, as we were sent to the visitor center where they had us queue up.  Then we were led over to the entrance in groups so as to not block the halls.

The Pooh exhibit was well done, and created with both the young and the young-at-heart in mind."
