5,"First of all Picco stands for Pizza Ice Cream Company, which makes sense because both their pizza and ice cream are amazing. The setup is a little different because of COVID restrictions but the wait staff and hosts do a great job of making seating a quick process. Didn&apos;t have to wait more than 10 minutes while they take care to clean the table. 

The pizza is fresh made and really good. The ice cream is fresh made and really good.

The outdoor seating gives you enough space to feel comfortable which today&apos;s day and age is half the battle. 

Found this place randomly online but it was so good I had to take a pizza to go, so I&apos;ll definitely be back."
5,"Ordered delivery through Caviar from Picco and it was wonderful! We were ordering dinner for two, so we got two small pizzas (pepperoni and summer vegetable) and a pint of their hand packed ice cream (PB chip). We were stuffed after the two pizzas but managed to make room a a couple scoops of ice cream. 

If there are two things you get from Picco make sure they are the pepperoni pizza and the PB chip ice cream. 

Pepperoni pizza 11/10- the small thick cut pepperonis act as a cup to capture the most amazing meaty oils and cheese. The crust is to die for. A good amount of crunch, chew and char. 

PB chip ice cream 11/10- the texture of the ice cream with the peanut butter is so smooth and creamy. It also has dark chocolate shards instead of chips which is way better in my opinion. 

Overall- I think there are few ways to go wrong at picco! You have to try!

Side note- I called the restaurant ahead to ask about the size of the pizzas and things that were available and the service was always warm and friendly!"
5,"Great pizza ordered during the COVID pandemic so it needed to be take out. Call ahead in a Friday night and then drive over. They gave you pay in advance and text you when it&apos;s ready to come into the store. It&apos;s a pretty efficient process.
     The pepperoni pizza large was excellent. Love the charred on cheese and dough. About $24 but able to leave a tip for the hard working staff members. Once they are able to have patio service we will be back. This is our favorite pizza place on Tremont Street."
5,I love Picco! They have the best everything. I live down the street and will gladly run here in the middle of a snow storm because their pizza is that good. The price is SO worth the food
3,"Saw this restaurant had high ratings and decided to give it a try. Placed a DoorDash delivery which took about an hour on a Saturday afternoon. 

Here&apos;s what we tried:
- a half order of fettuccine porcini cream (dry/hard pasta)
-Caesar salad (delicious, homemade croutons and dressing 10/10 would get again)
-mushroom conserva and brie pizza (very tasty, chewy crust with great flavor from the wood fired oven)
-braised short rib and gorgonzola pizza (sorry, but the gorgonzola was sooo overpowering. The short rib ended up tasting very gamy...not what I&apos;m looking for on a pizza)

The other menu items might shine (such as the calzones or ice cream) but on first pass I believe there are better pizza joints in this great city."
3,"Overall tasty, and I&apos;d get it again, but could use some better consistency. 

We ordered a large half cheese half pepperoni. The dough and crust were great, the sauce had a nice flavor, but definitely needed more sauce and could have benefited from a more even distribution. As you can see in my picture, there are areas of the pie that don&apos;t have any sauce...or cheese :(. Also, the pepperoni ended up kinda nesting in each other so we pulled them apart to spread the love. 

Fortunately we had some leftover Rao&apos;s sauce on hand to fix the light sauce situation. 

We got the 1/2 order of macaroni and cheese. Gemelli (I think?) wouldn&apos;t have been my first choice for the pasta but it was cooked well. There was a nice flavor but similar to the pizza it needed some extra sauce to make it creamier as some pasta were straight up dry. 

We ordered a pint of mint brownie and I&apos;m still sad about it. I assume it&apos;s made in house, but it has an insanely overpowering flavor, which we suspect is spearmint. As a diehard mint chocolate chip fan, this didn&apos;t jive with my tastebuds."
4,"Gotta try the wings that have been smoked for hours + tamale for appetizers. Both unassuming on the menu but punch above their weight, in terms of flavor at a pizza joint. 

4.5/5 - A couple back-and-forth interactions/delay because multiple beers were listed available but out. No biggie. Lots of others to choose from."
5,"I&apos;m batting over .300 for sure!

Spot was on point. Pizza was fresh and charred the way we like it. 

MEATBALLS!!!!?????!!!!! Who TF is cooking these? They were: tasty, moist and came in a fresh sauce that was made for a Sunday. Wow, well done.

Arugula salad was well prepped nicely and the ice cream was good. 

But the meatballs ... 

If I return to Beantown, I&apos;ll be back (in Arnold&apos;s voice)."
4,"Pepperoni is a must here, folks! Those bad boys are little saucers that pack a punch of flavor! I was able to put in an order for half and half. Do not go into the restaurant until they text you - this is a COVID precaution they take seriously. 

In pizza we crust!"
4,"Ordered pizza delivery thru DoorDash. We got that half cheese and have mushroom. The crust was well done and the dough had a hint sourness, which was perfect! The toppings and ingredients were fresh. It was refreshing to finally have some good pizza! Can&apos;t wait to try it in house fresh out of the oven!"
4,"While the South End is known for its upscale restaurants, Picco feels a bit more approachable and down-to-earth. My friend and I walked in on a Wednesday night to find a busy restaurant packed with families and friends. We grabbed a couple of seats at the bar and each ordered a beer and a small pizza ($14). Note: the small pizza is more than enough for one person, probably two.

My pepperoni pizza came out piping hot, packed with flavor, and with a uniquely charred crust. (There were some more creative pizza options on the menu too.) To wrap up the meal, I ordered mocha chip ice cream, which was ok. 

Overall, a solid spot to grab a slice!"
4,"Delicious

The place has a great rating on Yelp and they were 100% right about.  Amazing food, great craft beer selections, friendly service, and actually very affordable for the area the place is located.  

Food Rating: Scale 1-5

Tomato Bruschetta App - 5
Lemon Grilled Broccoli App -5
The signature pizza - Alsatian - 5
Pepperoni pizza - 4.5

The only reason the roni pizza gets a 4.5 is because the Alsatian pizza is so good and cooked so perfectly that it just can&apos;t top it.  

If I could give this a 4.5 stars out of 5 I would.  Great spot.

Thanks"
5,"Whenever I&apos;m back in Boston I try to get over to Picco for some amazing pizza and ice cream. Their pizza is delicious- charred and well flavored. The dough is springy and light.

What I really go for? The ice cream. Actually. It&apos;s amazing and so flavorful. Check in on yelp for a freebie. Pro tip- somehow they give me a free one every time. They&apos;re nice, like that."
5,"So many people rave about the pizza here so I was so excited to finally try! I was surprised to find out that this place is super casual and the menu isn&apos;t lengthy. I quickly got counter seats with my boyfriend for a quick dinner after work. You are allowed to do half and half on a pizza so we went with the mushroon/Brie and margarita on the other side. For people with small appetites, a small is a good portion between two with room left over for dessert! The pizza was crispy and good. I thought the mushroom and Brie combo was unique. Definitely save room for ice cream because that was the perfect ending to the meal. The chocolate with mixed nuts was a great flavor. 

Highly recommend for a quick bite!"
5,"Excellent pizza and ice cream spot.  We tried two pizzas and both were absolutely delicious.  Crust is a nice balance of chewy and crispy with edges that had those great burnt pieces.  We also got the Ricotta Cavatelli which had great potential but was a little flat on taste.  Ice cream is delicious. Put it this way, it was 30 degrees outside and my table of 4 all got ice cream.  Highly recommend any of the pizzas or ice cream. 

Sausage Fennel Ricotta pizza: 5/5
Alsatian pizza: 5/5
Ricotta Cavatelli pasta: 3.5/5
Caramel Swirl ice cream: 5/5
Pecan Toffee ice cream: 5/5"
5,"My go-to spot for pizza in the city, and now they deliver too! It&apos;s hard to have a restaurant that really only serves pizza and ice cream, so you can imagine how good it has to be to stay in business.

Their pizza has a chewy crust, and it&apos;s sturdy enough to hold on all the delicious toppings. We usually go for the Eggplant, Broccoli Rabe, and Mozzarella pizza and add chicken.

Although they don&apos;t always have it, the PB chip ice cream is an absolute MUST!! Especially if you get it as a brownie sundae. You&apos;ll probably be stuffed after your meal, but I always get a pint to-go regardless, you won&apos;t regret it!"
3,"Delicious and unique pizza! It&apos;s a bit crispy/burnt just the way I like it and they use the pepperoni cups that curl up and char and are a little spicier than normal.

3 stars is mostly for service - they&apos;ve taken significantly longer than I expected a few times now for pickup orders. Meaning they say it will be ready in 30 minutes and it took an hour."
5,"This is the best pizza you&apos;ll get in the South End! Honestly I dream of this pizza. We&apos;ve gotten the pepperoni and Margherita and both are fantastic. I can&apos;t get enough of the sourdough crust, and the sauce is balanced and flavorful. We have only ever gotten takeout here but cannot wait for them to open up for dine-in service, we&apos;re looking forward to sitting on the patio for the complete dining experience. Thank you Picco!"
1,"I ordered the Alsatian pizza today after hearing incredible reviews from this place and I was incredibly disappointed in the overall appearance and taste. It looked nothing like the other photos. The pizza was hard and quite literally burnt to a crisp. I couldn&apos;t even enjoy the flavor, because the taste of charred bread and onion was so overpowering. Why anyone would to pay 14.75 for 4 slices of burnt bread bread is beyond me.  If I could have taken it back, I certainly would have."
5,"I never think pizza is THAT good, but this pizza is THAT good. I feel like I&apos;ve eaten at a bunch of spots that claim to have the best pizza ever, but this is definitely one of my favorites (and it only takes 20 min of waiting).

Love that is extra charred and I&apos;m super happy with the mushroom and arugula one. It was slightly sweet, but the onions and brie were soooo good with the slightly dressed arugula. Not heavy at alll. Wish I was in Boston more because I&apos;d definitely try the other ones. The dark chocolate sorbet is also incredible. Bitter but slightly sweet the same way dark chocolate is supposed to taste -- somehow they made it equally as rich. I wasn&apos;t even hungry when I ate these things but still give it 10/10! Better pizza than &quot;NYC&quot; pizza...especially because there&apos;s no wait."
