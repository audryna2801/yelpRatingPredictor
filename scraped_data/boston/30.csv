5,"This spot will be one of my favorite restaurants of all time. When you walk in, you feel like you are about to be served dinner in a home. It is not too flashy - it is very comfortable and cute. We started off with the raw oysters and the calamari which were phenomenal. The calamari had a perfect amount of flavor and the oysters were SO fresh. HANDS DOWN the best oysters I have ever had. I wanted to order more but knew we had so much food coming. 


For entrees, we had the lobster fra diavolo for 1 person, agolio, and monkfish marsala. The appetizers and these 3 dishes were PLENTY for 4 people.

The lobster fra diavolo was one of the best dishes I ever had - it had a wonderful mix of seafood and all the flavors were phenomenal. The agolio was also very delicious - it was light and tasty. The monkfish was also phenomenal. The texture of the fish was great and the marsala sauce was delicious.

Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed each of our dishes and we look forward to coming back when we return to oston."
5,"This place is COVID-19 friendly. There are tables outside. If you would like to be inside, it is fine since the tables are separated with elastic curtain. But if it gets colder, it is not comfortable to sit outside.
We ordered following:
Aglio Olio
Taste is special and good. Worth a try here.
Alfredo
We ordered it for 1 person size, which is totally enough for us two. There are shrimps, clams, lobster in the dish, together with pasta and sauce. It tastes good with a little heavy sauce.
Fried Calamari
Always a good starter for me."
5,"Outdoor dining provided during the pandemic. I came here last week on a weekday around 7PM and there was no wait or line. The outdoor set-up was actually really cute and felt much more spacious pre-covid times.

We tried the Aglio Olio which was fantastic. Bursting with flavor and the homemade squid ink pasta was al dente. Broiled haddock was also great. Lots of flavor and super fresh. We got a side of puttanesca which was good, but definitely preferred the flavor of the aglio olio more! Also cant, forget the fried calamari which was perfection! 

Still cash only!"
1,"This place recently reopened but realistically they should have stayed closed, indefinitely. The owner is extremely unprofessional and does not deserve to be running any kind of business.

Four of us made a reservation here, when we came we were seated at a tiny table surrounded by plastic curtain on each side to supposedly prevent COVID from spreading (even though the restaurant wasn&apos;t allowed to have more than 1 table open at a time anyway by the city). Our wine and water was also served in plastic cups, also supposedly due to COVID (but more likely to minimize work for their staff).

We were aware of the 90 minute limit, but they tried to kick us out within an hour. What made it even more unpleasant was that the waitress notified us that we have 10 minutes to leave while placing the 2nd bottle of wine we ordered at the table. Had she mentioned this ahead of time, we wouldn&apos;t have ordered it.

Another thing they neglected to mention until they placed the 2nd bottle of wine on the table was that this place was cash only, despite a typical meal costing $50+. There is only one reason for a restaurant with average customer paying several hundred dollars to only take cash: tax evasion.

We spent the last 10 minutes running to the ATM, paid close to $400 for the meal, and when we asked to pack the leftovers the owner (or chef, not sure) became rude and confrontational (I guess we were inconveniencing his plan to go home by 9pm).

My friend and I told him that such treatment of customers, as well as not notifying us that the place is cash-only when we made the reservation, or at least sat down at the table, was unethical. He exploded in anger, insulted us and our wifes and then told us to get out. The guy has delusions of grandeur and speaks to everyone like he&apos;s doing them a favor.

The food may have been ok, but the owner&apos;s treatment of customers was disgusting and ruined our entire night. Do yourself a favor and avoid this shithole. Why would you pay $400 for overpriced pasta while sipping wine out of plastic cups with your table surrounded by a shower curtain where the owner rushes you out while you&apos;re eating, treats you like a second-class citizen, and insults you on your way out?"
4,"Excellent service at this no frills restaurant that puts the food first. Our waiter was great, offered fantastic recommendations and the food came out super fast. We were able to easily get an outdoor table on a busy Saturday night. 

We ordered the mussels siciliano for an appetizer, which was super tasty. We then split the aglio olio black squid ink pasta and a North End Style haddock. Both entrees were fantastic and SO much food! I thought for sure we&apos;d fill up and take some home... but then it was just too good to stop eating. My favorite thing about all the dishes was the sauce, everything was so flavorful and paired nicely with the fish. If you&apos;ve never tried squid ink pasta, I&apos;d definitely recommend!"
5,"Great food at The Daily Catch. It is located right across Mike&apos;s Pastry. Be ready to wait outside for a table. We waited about 30-40 minutes for a table for 2. There are menus taped to the glass, so you can decide what to eat beforehand (or grab a cannoli across the street while you wait). There are also many large chalk boards inside along the wall with specials. 
The space was homey. It is easier to get a table here with smaller groups. Their fried calamari was delicious. It is lightly breaded an a pretty generous portion. We also ordered the garlic squid ink pasta (comes with a squid meatball). The taste and texture of the meatball were very good. They have an open kitchen, so you can watch the chef prepare your food. We also ordered small glass bottled Coca-Colas. Great service and delicious food. One of the best spots in Boston. Definitely looking forward to coming back on my next visit to MA."
5,I&apos;ve been here multiple times on my trips to Boston and it&apos;s definitely my favorite place for seafood. Their calamari is probably the best in the world and their squid ink pasta is so bomb. Would definitely come back when I go to Boston!
5,"I don&apos;t say this lightly, but this place had the absolute best pasta I have ever had in my life! Now I like to make my pasta from scratch, so I&apos;m typically not impressed with restaurant pasta dishes, but the Aglio Olio black ink pasta was this incredibly savory dish with so much flavor and the perfect blend of spices and juuuust the right amount of sauce, served in a pan that kept it warm as I tried so hard to slow down and not inhale the whole thing at once. 

I actually loved everything I ordered here: the oysters were fresh and tasty, the octopus appetizer tasted incredible and was not even a little bit rubbery, my husband&apos;s calamari pasta was also perfectly done (though not as good as mine), and the cannoli were tiny lemony-minty perfection. The outdoor seating is amazing, way better than the Hanover location, with a quiet secluded courtyard. We had the most wonderful waiter who told us his favorites and brought out our plates with impeccable timing. This was certainly the most magical date!"
5,The food was amazing. I am not Italian but I have a palette for Italian food so take my recommendation as you will. The flavor of the Lobster Fra Diavolo was well received. They gave us a very generous amount of food! We order the Lobster Fra Diavolo for 2 but it could very well feed 4 people!  It was a rainy and cold day so we opted to order for pick up and didn&apos;t get the overall dine in experience. When we picked up the people were nice and had our order ready!
3,"I went to college in Boston, and this place had some street rep! Came back for outdoor dining in COVID times, and it kind of lived up to the hype.
To be fair, Monkfish Marsala was an unconventional order. The flavor of the sauce was revelatory; after having the taste of the Marsala wine come through so cleanly, I feel like I&apos;ve been deceived all my life for what chicken marsala is supposed to taste like.
Everything else was all right too; the monkfish itself was tender; the breading was fine even though it suffered from the sauce, and the pasta texture was fine.
Didn&apos;t really like dining out on Hanover, but I definitely don&apos;t hold that against them."
4,"Great food
Calamari is incredible - crispy breading yet so tender
Squid ink pasta was delicious with great texture as were the other dishes. Great flavor as well, seafood very fresh. With that being said, some of the noodles were stuck together. However, portions were very generous and leftovers were still delicious the next day

With that being said, it is a smaller restaurant and you can oftentimes encounter a wait. Was previously cash only, but not sure about now"
5,"Highly recommend this place and feel bad it doesn&apos;t have enough reviews! The calamari is a must order when you first sit down. We&apos;ve ordered a few different pastas... all are amazing! 

The staff is also friendly and extremely hard working. Love this place."
5,One of my favorite meals since I moved to Boston! I was a bit nervous about the squid ink pasta but decided to try it because it had such great reviews. I only got the side portion (still enough for my friend and I to share) and was pleasantly surprised! The flavor was amazing without being too overwhelming. I already can&apos;t wait to get this again!! We also got the shrimp and muscles which were both delicious as well. The sauce the shrimp comes in was the best part.
5,"Called in a to go order and it was ready in a short amount of time. The whole process was very fast, very simple, yet very impressionable. The waitress outside was waiting many tables but was very collective. Got back to the hotel and was surprised with how much food was given and how delicious it turned out to be! Definitely a must go!"
5,This is actually a review for their new Atlantic Ave Waterfront location in the North End. I&apos;ve been to the Hanover street location as well but this one far surpasses it. They have plenty of outside seating and the waitress was extremely nice. There is a good variety on the menu and everything comes out in the dish it had been cooked in. The little necks siciliano had an amazing sauce; I even took the remaining sauce home after we ate the clams! I ordered the Shrimp Scallop Broccolini and my boyfriend got the famous black pasta aglio olio. The owner even came out and asked how we liked our dishes and chatted with us for a bit. He said it&apos;s a new location and a family business. Overall amazing experience.
5,"There is shared seating, probably 6 tables in total, you&apos;re literally sitting in a kitchen. They food was served in the pan which it was cooked. That being said, I had the Aglio Olio (squid ink pasta with calamari), my new wife, the Shrimp Scampi. &quot;This is the best thing I have ever eaten&quot; Her words not mine. Can confirm it was incredibly buttery, garlicky goodness and &quot;perfectly lemony&quot;. Come January, we find that my son was conceived upon the very evening we shared this meal. Food was magic but dine at your own risk . . ."
5,"What a wonderful way to start off our Boston trip. A friend suggested we go to north end for some good food and good food we certainly did find. In fact, incredible food! 

Our wait time: There was about a 30 minute wait to be seated but entirely worth the wait. This is a very small restaurant so don&apos;t expect to be seated immediately. The kitchen takes up half the space! 

The food: We ordered Aglio Olio (the squid ink pasta with olive oil, calamari, and garlic) as well as the Monkfish Marsala. Both dishes were delicious and absolutely a must order. The monkfish Marsala was some of the best fish I&apos;ve ever ordered. My husband and I couldn&apos;t get enough of that dish. I highly recommend it. 

The portion sizes: My husband and I ordered the entree portions of both aforementioned meals, had the bread to start, and had gotten the salad instead of the pasta that comes with the fish. We were both full but didn&apos;t have to worry about taking food home as we finished our meals and nearly licked our plates clean then and there. 

The service: Great! They were friendly, quick, and helpful with our questions about the menu. They even split our salad for us without us having to ask which was great foresight on our servers end. 

This restaurant is worth the wait! I also suggest dropping by Mike&apos;s after you finish your meal if you still have room for dessert."
3,"Small place, does not look good on the inside, but it&apos;s ok, since right now you can only sit outside. Our server was very nice and attentive. The restroom is small and not the nicest one, but the location is great and what we ordered was delicious. We have a very tasty black pasta in garlic sauce and calamari. The pasta is served and brought to you on the actual pan it was cooked in.
Also you might find the chef/owner having a cigarette break while he is not cooking..."
5,"I heard a lot of great things about this place from multiple people and I will say they have exceeded my expectations. Theres a large line out the door and it is worth the wait. 
I will say, this spot has the greatest Linguine with White Clam that I have ever eaten in my life, and idk what they put in that thing that makes it so flavorful. It&apos;s such a simple dish but they have given it so much flavor! This is big coming from me because that is one of my favorite dishes! I would come back to Boston just for this experience!"
5,"Every time I come to Boston I eat at one of the Daily Catch locations. Why? Because they are AMAZING. 

The tables are small and intimate, mainly because the space itself is. But the aromas coming out of this place will make your tastebuds come to life, no matter how full you are. 

For a party of 3 we waited for 1 1/2 hours, but it was definitely worth it. Try and come as a table of 2 or 4 though because you&apos;ll get in faster.

The quality of food and amount of happiness I felt were top tier. I have 0 complaints about our experience. 

It&apos;s definitely hole in the wall. No need to dress up. But the experience you will get and the food you will taste is absolutely worth it."
