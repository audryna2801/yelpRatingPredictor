5,"Great park in Beacon Hill for walking and people watching.  The grounds are well taken care of and there&apos;s so many different flowers and plants all around.  Also, so many great places to stop for pictures.  It&apos;s especially pretty when there&apos;s fog."
5,"Today is the perfect example of Boston Public Garden.  Frozen pond, kids playing hockey, and some really fat squirrels staring down visitors hoping for a handout. It&apos;s an all-season festival at the park and you really cannot go wrong in any of them.  Ok but Spring is definitely the best season.  But not being from the NE, I was interestingly unaware that Spring means April.  The Southwest doesn&apos;t teach one these things.  I&apos;ve also only known the Public Garden during the pandemic, which means I&apos;ve relied on it for my sanity on many days, and on every day, it&apos;s delivered."
5,"Not to be confused with Boston Pubic Garden, and yes you should keep your pubic garden as well trimmed as this Public Garden, or just get rid of it as I did mine.

This is a spectacular park with a bunch of monuments, such as George Washington. It has Duck and Swan Boats of course. And it&apos;s just lovely here.

It&apos;s next to Boston Common, and between the two of them they make a massive Green Space right in the middle of Boston. Sorry I just sounded very hipster.

Less people come over here - and that includes less homeless people - which is great. Sorry.

I would definitely say it&apos;s one of the best green spaces in Boston. Absolutely no doubt about that. It&apos;s also historical and people perform here sometimes as well as of course at the common, and I guess the main problem for me is that there&apos;s no bathroom here.

Not to be confused with the Boston Pubic Garden which is something to do with genital hair."
4,It is a wonderful English style landscape park. There are many plant species typical of the city and its surroundings. There are also exotic trees and plants. This park is one of my favorite places to relax with my family and friends. Here you can take a ride on an artificial lake on an ancient century old catamaran swan or just take a walk admiring the fountains and beautiful trees. After a long walk relax on one of the park&apos;s many benches.
5,"If I visit Boston again, I&apos;d like that to be in fall again specially early fall maybe in October or September just to be able to enjoy Boston&apos;s colorful fall. If you live in California you know why I&apos;d choose that time. 
One fun thing that I recommend doing is to go to Boston public garden in fall and lay over the fallen leaves and just enjoy looking at the sky, I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll feel great after that.
One of the other tips that I learned traveling to different places is to take your time and don&apos;t rush going from one location to the other cause you really can&apos;t make the memory of that place stick to your mind and all you remember is being tired and nothing more.
The ducks were my favorite they&apos;re so cute and so popular among the kids."
4,"The Central Park of Boston, this and Boston Common are extraordinarily pretty, with the bridges and George Washington statue and the pretty lakeside walk. In addition, if you are a movie buff, go find the bench that Robin Williams and Matt Damon sat on in &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot;, it is along the lake and the third bench over the bridge near the &quot;V&quot; by the George Washington statue.

Just make sure you have no food on you. The squirrels here are so aggressive that they will not take no for an answer if they sense that you have something.

While summer is great because you get the swans and the full effect, fall is great because you really see the full fall foliage if you come at the right time.

A checkout if you can!"
5,"Lots Of Ducks! Nice Little Park! 

I like this little park when I am in Boston.... You can Stop by Cheers the bar and have a drink and then stroll across the street and sit on a bench and watch the ducks swimming around. 

It&apos;s not a huge park, but it is a nice reprieve from the concrete and brick jungle surrounding this little gem. 

They have little boat rides during the day. There is a nice little bridge and often people playing music for tips there. 

There are some homeless people sleeping off in the trees, so be mindful of your surroundings."
5,"This has to be one of my favorite spots in Boston. Any given day you can see kids playing, people taking wedding photos, people just admiring nature. It&apos;s impossible to feel bad sitting on a bench here. It&apos;s beautiful and well taken care of. The perfect mix of city and nature. If you want some great photos go on the swan boat ride!"
5,"This is a beautiful downtown park where we live to walk our dog. Well maintained. It was one of the first public parks in the whole country! There is frog pond that they turn into a skating rink in the Winter, a modest water themed playground, 2 tennis courts, a ball field, reasonably priced underground parking and lots of room to roam. It&apos;s right in the center of Boston so very easy to access."
5,"Beautiful gardens in the middle of Boston. I loved spending a slow walk here, ambling among the gardens and seeing redwoods and nature. 

What a great place to take a stroll, let the kids run free, or to have a picnic. It&apos;s near the Cheers bar, too, so if you&apos;re touristing there, there&apos;s no excuse not to end up here, in Boston Public Garden."
5,"I visited the Boston Public Garden twice during my 3-day visit to Boston! Definitely worth the visit. The park is absolutely huge and has many diverging walking paths, a large central pond with paddle boating and a boat ride, a bridge for photo ops, statues of George Washington, Colonel Thomas Cass,  Charles Sumner, and many others.

There are massive beech, elm, maple, redwood, birch, and many, many other types of trees that provide great shade from the unforgiving sun. There are also plenty of grassy areas to just hang out, watch the geese, people-watch, have a picnic, and enjoy a beautiful afternoon.

The garden is well maintained, clean, and the grass and flowers are abundant and lush. 

Truly an amazing place for tourists and locals alike!"
4,"Lovely garden in Boston. Unfortunately not too many people are out and about because of Covid, however the public garden is still as green and beautiful as ever."
4,"Love it how boston downtown is filled with these huge parks all over. Definitely gives a place to relax and rejuvenate to explore more the city has to offer.

Did take a walk through the park after exploring Beacon hill neighborhood.The park is perfect to chill out , walk or for a run.There are small ponds and boats if you want to take a ride and feed the ducks/geese.

Pros:
------
Right next to boston common
In downtown
Close to beautiful beacon hill hood
Free
Peaceful and pleasant"
5,Had a picnic in the garden and It is such a relaxing and peaceful place. It&apos;s the first public botanical garden I have ever been to and I think it&apos;s an amazing concept. The flowers by the Washington statue were beautiful.   The lawns are cared for and everything is kept clean.  This is a staple in Boston and a must visit.
5,"I love visiting Boston and stopping by the public garden.  Even though it is often full of people, it is so peaceful and beautiful.  The well sculpted plants, trees and flowers provide a spectacular back drop for the city.

The charming Swan Boats are fun to watch but my favorite part is the &quot;Make Way For Ducklings&quot; statues.   If you haven&apos;t read the book of the same name, do yourself a favor and read it!  Something about the mother duck and her little ducklings makes me feel warm inside.

In season, some of the flowers near the entrances are blazes of color and you can&apos;t help but feel in a better mood after a nice stroll through the gardens."
4,This was a nice place for a stroll. We walked through The garden and enjoyed looking at all the squirrels and ducks and geese as they played. This garden has a lot of nice walkways around the pond with a bridge that overlooks beautiful trees. This is really a good place to take a walk and look at the historical statues as well.
5,"THIS place is amazing. It&apos;s so amazing that it&apos;s beauty left me with some regrets. 

Regret #1 - My crappy camera phone: I&apos;m not a selfie guy, so I didn&apos;t invest in a great camera phone. In lieu of my camera, I have an awesome DSLR which I left at home to save money flying Spirit. (:sigh: I make too much money to be this dag on cheap!)

Regret #2 - Wearing my transitional lenses: It was a bright and sunny day, but everything was on filter because of my shades. So, I found myself taking my glasses off to try and enjoy the beauty, but I can&apos;t see without glasses to save my life. 

Anyway, I stumbled across this beautiful display of God&apos;s creation and was totally taken aback. It was like the air changed and all of a sudden I realized that everything around me was beautiful.

Definitely check out the Boston Public Garden. It&apos;s a must visit."
5,"Beautiful botanical garden right in the middle of downtown Boston.  Located right next to Boston Commons it is a convenient stroll and a wonderful way of getting out of the craziness called life if even just for the moment.

We had the privilege of staying close by so walking through and riding by on a city tour or duck tour happened a number of times during our brief 3 day visit to Boston.  

The stroll through is scenic and relaxing.  Be sure to look for the duck family sculptures; absolutely adorable..!"
5,"I come here all the time. The most beautiful and historical place in Boston and it is beautiful all year around... lots of resident students and visitors come here to see the swans or to take a walk. You can picnic, exercise or do whatever. Also the  memorial to &quot;Make way for the ducklings&quot; is here. Street performances are here once in awhile. Lovely gardens and flowers..love it. Recently, they added a 911 memorial. I found this addition profound considering I walk through this garden on 911 while 7 months pregnant away from the financial district to be safe."
5,"What an absolutely stunning park to wander through in the heart of the city. There is everything you could want in a park - wildlife, water, bridge, views of the city and big gorgeous trees throughout. So many breathtaking places to stop and picnic and lay down and take a breath. If you can find an excuse to walk through here - do it..."
