4,"We tried their Bao Buns with Tofu, Garlic and Ginger Fried Rice and Udon Noodles with vegetables. 

The food was a bit cold by the time we got home which was only 5 minutes but the flavors were really good. 

Would like to try this place again once Covid is over and dine in. 

They were also nice enough to provide curbside pickup which we really appreciate. 

Its a must try even for vegetarians..."
5,"Myers &amp; Chang is all that and DIM SUM!

I highly recommend M&amp;C take out for a date night in.  As you and your partner slurp down the variety of noodles offered, you will both be taken  back by all of the flavors M&amp;C has to offer.  The menu is loaded with small plates and I cannot wait to try them all!

Lastly, there is dumpling you should know.. the edamame comes out of the pod :)

My only question is when will indoor dining open up?"
4,"My friend made a reservation for us to come here in July. They only offered outdoor seating at the time and it was very limited seating (only 3 tables), so if you plan on visiting then make a reservation beforehand. They took appropriate COVID precautions such as wearing masks and offering hand sanitizer. They even offered small paper bags to put our masks in. I didn&apos;t really like how small the outdoor dining area was because you could easily overhear the other groups&apos; conversations, making it difficult to hear the person you&apos;re sitting with. I felt like I had to speak louder in order to be heard. 

The food was really good but expensive. We ordered Tiger&apos;s Tears Salad with Beef + Bell Peppers, Braised Pork Belly Buns, Mama Chang&apos;s Pork &amp; Chive Dumplings, Tea-Smoked Pork Spare Ribs, and Ginger-Scallion Bok Choy. We also got cocktails, which were really refreshing. 
The Tiger&apos;s Tears salad was not our favorite. It had a very strong taste (kind of like extra strong cilantro) and some bites were a lot spicier than others. The pork belly buns, dumplings, and ribs were all delicious. The bok choy was surprisingly REALLY good - it was a lot more flavorful than we expected. 

Overall, it was a nice experience and the food was great! I feel like this is a place you have to try at least once when you&apos;re in Boston. Because it&apos;s quite pricey, I probably won&apos;t visit too often but it&apos;s definitely worth a try!"
2,"I was very much eager to try this place out because I heard great things from my friends but ended up being disappointed by the experience with the restaurant. 

- First of all, the food here is definitely not the best Asian food that I had. I would not say the food here is bad but for the price, it&apos;s definitely not worth it. If it were just the food alone, I would give this place 3/5. The price is not justifiable in my opinion. 

- I understand that since it&apos;s Covid the restaurant does not open indoor dining and does outdoor instead but it was so cold to eat outside at night and there were not outdoor heaters. Being in the cold put a damper on the experience. In addition, (I understand this is NOT the restaurant&apos;s fault) I saw a rat running right next to me while eating. 

- The only good thing about the restaurant is the service. The staffs were being very responsive and quick to serve our food. 

I regret to say this but I would not return to eat here!"
4,"This could easily be a 3 star experience if you pick the wrong items. 

A trendy asian fusion spot where it might get crowded (pre-covid) but they have quite the variety of seating, from patio to tables to chef&apos;s counter. 

Pork belly bao is solid. Fluffy bao bun, fresh veggies inside, with a sauce that compliments rather than drowns out the flavor. Pork belly was fatty and moist, although I wish the outside was crispy.

The miso glazed were the best thing on the menu. Immediately the savory, umami punch hits you with such force. Its really just carrots, oil, and miso, but its so damn good. If there was one thing you had to order, this is it.

The eggplant was ok, but they dont do much other than the bare minimum. Not too hard, not too slimey. Not much going on flavor wise.

The mussels themselves had quite a handful of duds (hard closed shells that usually would make you sick if you pry them open to eat.) The majority of them were decent size and had a good texture. Not too firm nor oyster like. The broth was the show stopper in this case. Strong, potent, yet not like any mussel broth Ive had before. The sourdough bread they give is quite delicious as well. Sturdy structure, crispy edge, and plenty of oil.

The fried chicken wings had a great crispy breading, but there&apos;s nothing about it that stood out. Tasted like piping hot chicken and nothing else. For 8 dollars, they aren&apos;t giving you much either.

The mushroom lo mein I havr mixed feelings about. On one end the texture is exactly what I would expect. It comes out pretty hot, so you may get mostly steam initially. But even as the steam fades, the flavor isnt that strong. Granted if I wasnt eating all of this food by myself, others would have easily polished it off; They give you a decent amount as a portion, even if its more noodles than vegetables. On the fence about this one, but I wouldnt completely dismiss. Im also sure the price point bothered me as well. 

All in all, I enjoyed the experience enough to remember it even 5 months after I visited it!"
5,"I had a great experience at Myers &amp; Chang this past weekend. I am not usually much of a fan of cocktails but theirs were SO good. The pineapple one was subtle and just the the right amount of sweet. The sangria had a nice tang to it also. But the pineapple one...

For food: the pork dumplings were perfect. Tender and fried but not overly oily. The sweet and sour Brussels sprouts were delicious, although I don&apos;t think so much sauce was necessary at the bottom of the bowl. The scallion pancakes were soft with a crisp top layer. Everything was delicious, the music was young and fun, and the cooks looked focused and like they really cared about their work. The restaurant has a vibrant night vibe and I would be back again in a heart beat!"
4,"I am, admittedly, a Joanne Chang fangirl, but this place is too legit to quit. 
 Sometimes the food can be a bit tooooo seasoned, even for this lover of bold, spicy, savory foods.  But really you can&apos;t go wrong with whatever the menu offers.  This is a favorite date night spot.  Even during the pandemic, they&apos;ve been innovative, the service has been so lovely, and the food is always on point.  Now that they have outdoor dining, you can even get back to sitting at their colorful tables, enjoying the lovely South End.  Be sure to do 2 things: make a reservation and LEAVE A BIG TIP!  The lovely people at M&amp;C (and restaurants all over) are working their butts off."
5,"Bao WOW!  This restaurant went 11/11 on every dish we ordered.  The statistical odds of this happening are nearly impossible and quite impressive.  However, this proves you truly cannot go wrong here.  Close your eyes and point to a menu item and you will not be disappointed.  I came here for dim sum brunch with a large group last weekend and had a fantastic time!   I recommend making reservations online beforehand because it was packed!
 
Our waiter was sooo friendly!  She offered excellent suggestions on menu items and was just a nice human in general.  The food comes out when it&apos;s ready which is a great way to pace yourself! 
 
The plates are pretty small so order a lot, this is a meal you want to ball out on.  Note: the rice and noodles are on the larger side and I was able to comfortably share these dishes with ~4 people.  Full list of what we ordered:  Fresh Rolls with Spicy Peanut Sauce, Edamame Dip + Tortilla Chips, Potatoes + Shishito Relish, Ginger-Sesame Waffle Sundae, Braised Pork Belly Bao, Sweet + Sour Brussels Sprouts, Mama Chang&apos;s Pork + Chive Dumplings, Tea Smoked Ribs, Rice: Nasi Goreng/Pork + Pineapple/Fried Egg, and Wok Charred Udon Noodles with Chicken.  Here is a breakdown of my favorite dishes!
 
BRAISED PORK BELLY BAO-  To be honest, I&apos;m not the biggest fan of pork belly but this hit the spot!  The pork melted in your mouth!
 
SWEET + SOUR BRUSSELS SPROUTS-  Absolutely delicious, favorite dish of the meal!  They have nailed this dish down perfectly.  The brussels are charred, crispy, and packed with flavor!
 
NASI GORENG, PORK + PINEAPPLE, FRIED EGG RICE-  Woah try saying that 5X fast.  This dish hit the spot!  All the components of this dish paired perfectly together.   The portion size is significantly larger than other menu items which is always a plus!
 
GINGER-SESAME WAFFLE SUNDAE- Normally I&apos;m a chocolate girl for dessert, but dang this was great!  The waffle was warm, the ginger was not too overpowering, and the sesame offered a nice crunch to the dish."
5,"Probably the only good &quot;Asian Fusion&quot; restaurant I&apos;ve ever been. We got one of the Date Nights, J+C Favorites - which comes with a bottle of wine and a choice of white or brown rice. Not a bad deal for $80 for a couple. The menu included:

-Taiwanese Cool Dan Dan Noodles - great peanut flavor, and refreshing cucumbers and scallion. Just a little bit on the spicy side
-Edamame + Celery Slaw - this wasn&apos;t our favorite, not sure if the dressing was too sour/acidic or the dish was just too heavy handed on the celery
-Pan Roasted Soy-Glazed Salmon - The salmon was cooked perfectly. It was tender and flavorful while the skin was perfectly crispy. It also came with cucumbers and rice. However the sauce drowned out most of the rice.
-Taiwanese Fried Chicken Leg - this was probably my favorite dish of the night. The skin was perfectly seasoned and delicately crispy, while the inside was juicy and tender. I&apos;ve never tasted chicken prepared this way but I can&apos;t wait to come back!
- Ginger-Scallion Bok Choy - this was a good side dish to cut the fat and oils from the other main dishes. The bok choy was cooked well (could be more tender) but it was a little bit salty.

Fun Fact: this place is related to the Flour Bakery and Cafe chain!"
5,"Been here more times than I can count! AMAZING food AND service - time after time. I have tried most items on the menu and have loved every single thing. Go to&apos;s are Nasi Goreng, Wok Charred Udon Noodles and Mussels. 

Place is on the smaller side so come early or make reservations. Bar seating is a fun way to watch the action in the open concept kitchen and interact with the chefs. 

Food is meant to be shared so expect dishes to come out as they are ready."
3,"I went to Meyers &amp; Chang over the summer on a trip back to Boston. This was my first visit in four years and the atmosphere is cool as ever, but their food was not as impressive as I remembered it to be.

I ordered a bunch of small dishes so I could try different foods. I had to wait 15 minutes before eating it the piping hot eggplant stir-fry. When I finally did bite into it, the flavors were almost mild to the point of being bland. I also had the dumplings with chicken and lemongrass served with a creamy sauce. The dumplings were cooked to perfection, but the strong lemongrass flavor outweighed the chicken and when I dipped it in the creamy sauce the flavor profiles didn&apos;t seem to match. 

The winner of the evening was definitely the pork bun on a soft bao bun. The rich succulent pork paired so nicely with the bun that when I bit into it, I instantly wanted to order three more."
4,"Got one of the date night to-go meal kits and enjoyed it along the Charles! The udon noodles were my favorite but the pork belly bao came in close second. Can&apos;t forget about the papaya salad either!

The only miss..miso carrots."
4,"Myers &amp; Chang is pretty neat spot - ambiance is definitely more of a retro-diner, but serving up some very decent Asian-fusion! 

It was rather difficult to decide on what to order - their menu is extensive, from baos, to noodles, dumplings, and lots of &quot;dim sum-y things.&quot;  I ended up settling on the Tea Smoked Pork Spare Ribs and Sake-Braised Octopus.

Tea Smoked Pork Spare Ribs - these were phenomenal! Loved the earthy, smokiness to the ribs, which were super tender and had just the right amount of kick to them. I could have had two or three orders of these and called it a night.

Sake-Braised Octopus with yukon gold, shishito relish, and taro shoestrings - a very well composed dish, all the flavors and textures really worked well together. The octopus was slightly over-done, but otherwise very nice.

Service and food left me with no complaints - a super flavorful meal."
5,"Wow, Myers &amp; Chang was really epic. The look of this place is really pleasant. Extremely flavorful and delicious turned out to be their Fried Egg Banh Mi with Soy-glazed Bacon. Delightful afternoon and the staff is amazing! Definitely recommending to others."
5,"One of our favorite date night dining spots.  Food is always fun, fresh and very tasty.  Love the open kitchen and food is sent to your table as soon as it&apos;s done rather than sitting under a lamp until the full order is complete or when a runner is available to bring it to the table.  Tapas style so always order a variety to share or try.  Great updated options for takeout too - yum!"
4,"I went here around 2 weeks ago for the &quot;cheap date night&quot; special. It was a ton of food for a really reasonable price, and all of it was very tasty. We got the vegetarian menu. However, we sat in the back corner of the restaurant and felt that we were suffocating and were extremely claustrophobic from the heat of the kitchen. Additionally, when we placed our order for sake the waiter told us it was &quot;kinda small&quot; and that we should order one for each of us instead of splitting one. Turns out, the sake wasn&apos;t small, and he gave us a sake that we didn&apos;t order. This was unsurprising, since for both the food and the drink, he did not repeat the order back to us to confirm that it was correct, which in my experience, most servers do 99% of the time.

I would definitely come back again since the food is phenomenal, but would hope that the service improves."
5,"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Boston - the menu is fun, delicious and something for everyone.

I just used their catering service for a virtual corporate party and the customer service and food quality was fantastic. Highly recommend x a million!"
5,"First and foremost, 5 stars for the service!

The waiters and waitresses were so kind and very attentive to my tree nut allergy. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve been to a restaurant where after each plate that they brought out, they would mention that it was made with my allergy in mind each and every time. I really enjoyed their recommendations to different selections on the menu.

I came for the dim sum brunch and it was delicious. My favorite dishes were the sweet and sour brussel sprouts and the spicy cold dan dan noodles. The brussels were a true harmony of sweet and a hint of sour in perfectly crisp edges and soft insides. It was truly addicting. The one downside to it was that once you get towards the bottom of the bowl, it does tend to soak a lot of the excess oil making the last pieces a bit heavier than I&apos;d like. But overall, I&apos;m still obsessed with the brussels and they were definitely a winner in my book. The spicy cold dan dan noodles were a close second for me even though it was a bit too spicy after you have a couple of bits, the heat does kick quite a bit and stay there. However, the dish being cold seemed to complement the spice level quite nice.

Just a great atmosphere for brunch. Would definitely recommend and will definitely be back to try more!"
4,"Myers &amp; Chang is fusion done right. The food was so delicious and nostalgic, it almost reminded me of a time before white people started gentrifying Chinatown. With really solid service to bat, I was very satisfied with my overall experience.

The Lemongrass Chicken Wings, Braised Pork Belly Bun, Tea Smoked Ribs, and Wok Charred Udon Noodles were the clear standouts of the meal. The wings were super crispy and well balanced, the pork belly was phenomenal and tender, the ribs while on the saltier side was super tender and flavorful, and the udon had a great punch of umami and black bean flavor.

The pork dumplings and wild boar noodles were just alright. The dumplings was nothing special and the noodles had a strange noodle to meat ratio (1:3).

The fresh spring rolls were gross, pass."
5,"For no reason at all, I was yet to visit Myers &amp; Chang (which is shocking given my adoration for highly rated restaurants in Boston) until recently. I love asian fusion and I love tapas style meals, so in retrospect it&apos;s a mystery how I have never ended up here before! Nonetheless, my first impressions are delicious, unique, trendy, and overall enjoyable, so I can say is this won&apos;t be the last time I end up here!

I came with two friends, and actually none of us had been before - we ended up here on a whim, because . One friend is a slightly picky eater, so I was nervous if any of our dishes were too unique he may be scared off. We ended up splitting a few dishes, including spicy tuna poke, pork and chive potstickers, the braised pork belly buns, and the Nasi Goreng (Indonesian Fried Rice). I&apos;m not sure if it was that my friends weren&apos;t as hungry as I was, or if I just housed more than my share of the food because I was so in love, but we ate every bite of our food and scraped our plates clean. I found that the flavors were actually pretty unique, even as far as asian fusion goes.


To add some additional light, I have returned multiple times since my original visit (yes, this time with some less picky eaters!), and can confirm that my absolute, favorite dishes without a doubt remain the Surf + Turf Black Pepper Noodles (I could eat this all day and night, over and over, and never tire of this dish - so rich in flavor) and the Nasi Goreng fried rice. 

Drinks are average to pretty good, but are quite expensive. The service could stand to be slightly better - but I think this is partially because every time I&apos;ve been, it&apos;s a packed house. Only once was an order messed up / forgotten, and without even asking the waiter comped us on part of the meal for that reason. I will without a doubt be back to Myers and Chang, for dates, nights out with friends, dinners with co-workers, you name it."
