5,"This was my go-to Thai food place when I was living in the city. I have yet to find any place that makes a better gra pow fried rice, and I almost always get that (with ground chicken) and a Thai tea when I eat here. The one entree alone always gave me another 1 to 2 more meals!

Service has always been friendly and relatively fast despite there always being a line at dinner time (pre-COVID). It&apos;s a small-ish place but well worth the wait, or takeout is another good option. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been disappointed with anything I&apos;ve tried here."
5,"Pho Basil? Officially one of my favorites in Boston! 

I&apos;m extremely picky when it comes to Vietnamese food. My mom is sometimes too busy to cook so I have to resort somewhere else to satisfy my cravings. I came across this restaurant through Yelp and let me tell you, I am SO glad I had the chance to visit! 

Upon walking in, my boyfriend and I were instantly greeted by employees. Everyone was extremely friendly and welcoming. The restaurant is spacious, the tables were set 6 feet apart, and there were hand sanitizers to use right when you come in. We felt safe the entire time. 

I ended up ordering bun thit nuong (vermicelli noodles with grilled pork) and a side of crispy egg rolls. Whereas my boyfriend ordered com suon (rice with grilled lemongrass pork chops). It took approximately 15 minutes for everything to come out. The food smelled and tasted amazing! The flavors were perfect and the portions were big. Our highlight of the day was definitely the service. Our waitress frequently checked up on us and constantly refilled our drinks which were highly appreciated. 

Hands down, the best!"

My girlfriends favorite pho place! It was a cold Halloween evening so pho was perfect for our weekly date! We were seated quickly and noticed that there were far fewer tables than pre covid times which makes sense. Tables were spaced pretty far from each other. Service was fast and good so no complaints there! Pho was great as well! I almost always get the beef pho with like everything in it and this one really hit! Definitely going to be one of our go tos when we don&apos;t know where to go!"
4,"I came in here on Feb 2 2021. They have excellent anti COVID measure in place. Hand sanitizer, large distances between tables, QR menu, and the hot sauce is only served when requested.

The place was quite busy and the server decided to attend our table after taking orders from another table that came after us. This was factored into rating.

I ordered Tai; the seven pieces of beef that came with it were disappointing, very rough and felt old. Bean sprouts were great but they served too little for my preference but by a little. The broth and noodles made up for the dish. I was pretty satisfied as a consequence.

I would come back again happily. I am not convinced this is the best Boston Pho place but it is a pretty good choice."
4,"Finally found a spot in Boston that does both pho and Thai food right! The menu is huge with tons of options even for vegans, vegetarians and gluten-free eaters. 
We went for lunch and it was busy but the tables are set apart based on social distancing guidelines and service was quick! 
They even have boba tea! We got the edamame gyoza and it was the best edamame gyoza I ever had! 
Will def be back to try the Kao soi!"
3,"I did take out from here - they have both Vietnamese food and Thai food. I usually don&apos;t like to order from places that serve 2 different cuisines, but they managed to pull off both Thai food and Vietnamese food well. 
I got the goi coun (fresh spring roll)- this was so so. The rice skin was a little too thick for my liking. 
The pho came with a container of soup, noodles and raw beef in another container, and vegetables in another container. This is smart so that your noodles do not get soggy in the soup. The only thing I did not like was the fact that the raw beef was in the same bag as the noodles, it did not feel hygienic! I quickly threw the raw beef and noodles into the broth in hope of cooking it and killing off any germs. If you do take out for pho, you might want to request to have the raw beef packed separately in its own container. 
The drunken noodles were very spicy but delicious as well. The portion size was extremely generous! 
Overall, delicious food and good portion sizes."
5,"I&apos;ve never had a disappointing meal here. Amazing soups, tasty noodles, outstanding curry and great service. Also if you have room, they have some fantastic pastries!
Prices are good and service is outstanding."
3,"The pad thai was $15 and not very good
The crispy chicken was good - but not $15 food

The crab rangoon cost $7 for 5 tiny pieces but it was extremely tasty. 

My husband&apos;s bun thit nuong was really not that good either. 

All made worse by the fact that the original time of arrival by Grub Hub was 1:25 to 1:40 but arrived around 2:30. So compounded by the fact that it was late, it was overpriced and not that great."
4,"Pho Basil is a staple restaurant for me and many of my friends whenever we&apos;re craving pho or thai food. Their food never disappoints, with some of my favorites being the pho dac biet, gra pow fried rice, and drunken noodles. Before covid, they were always packed and I would usually need to wait at least 10 minutes to find a seat, which is a testament to how good their food is. Staff is pretty friendly and service is very satisfactory as well."
1,I was here dine in with my family of three. I went in and the waitress is very unhappy because I have my 6 years old son with me. Probably she think he will make a mess. When I order she really have no patient and giving attitude. When I try to order the table after us gets to order first. When I keep waiting my son is very hungry and he say when can we order. So I went to the cashier to order because my son is starving. The waitress came back and very mad and say you should wait for me and order and don&apos;t go order at the cashier. After that everything went downhill. The noodle soup is warm not even hot and all the food came out separately. Never Came back and check and see if I want to order more. Just really rude and unfriendly. I never had an experince like this at a restaurant. I will never go back and beware don&apos;t bring a kid. She will get mad.
4,"Above average spot. It&apos;s extremely convenient for me as far as location goes so I think that&apos;s how I know I&apos;ll be back but nothing here had me drooling.

Very generous portions and the restaurant inside is clean. They have average ingredients which make for a consistently average tasting food but it&apos;s good enough to go back for.

Very casual college-feeling atmosphere if you want to stop in for a quick bite to eat. They are quick to get you food and to turn tables so I&apos;ve never had to wait long. From now on I&apos;ll probably get take-out just because of the location. An important thing to keep in mind, especially if you&apos;re not familiar with the area, for either dining in or taking out, is that parking around this area is tough unless you want to pay and arm and a leg to park at the Prudential garages and walk a block or two."
4,"I enjoyed dining at Pho Basil a while ago and recently ordered takeout, which came right on time despite being a massive group order. The boxes were helpfully labeled and the cartons that had liquid were bagged to prevent mess. (The one unfortunate thing was that there were no utensils, but luckily we had them.) I tried the tofu massaman curry and beef drunken noodles. The flavors of the dishes were really good, and there was a satisfying amount of food. (The rice was really packed into the takeout box, and there were lots of noodles.) I also liked the way the tofu and beef were cooked, and there were plenty of yummy vegetables!

The only drawbacks were that the noodles were chopped to a short length rather being the normal long rice noodles, which are more pleasing to eat, and the curry was a little on the milky side and could&apos;ve used more spices/flavor. I would still definitely recommend Pho Basil as a solid Thai place and will likely return in the future!"
5,"I love getting take-out from here as I always have a reliably good experience: the food is delicious, orders are ready quickly, and staff is friendly. I usually order through UberEats and I&apos;ve never had any mistakes in my orders.

I love noodles in general, and my favorites from this restaurant are duck noodle soup (excellent soup flavoring and duck meat texture) and Pad See You (very delicious, not too oily like some other places I&apos;ve had this dish at). I&apos;m not usually a huge fan of rice dishes, but I do like a couple of them here: the Com Chien fried rice is my go-to if I&apos;ve been having noodles too much lately, and I&apos;ve also enjoyed the Com Heo rice plate as the pork is especially juicy. Pho is always a safe option as well; my boyfriend always gets pho tai.

I discovered this place after the pandemic started so I haven&apos;t yet dined in, but I&apos;ve seen a few customers dining in since the recent reopening allowed it, and they all look very happy. When I feel safe and comfortable enough to do so, this is one of the first places I would love to dine in at!"
1,"I&apos;ve been ordering here for several years now, if you look at my last review this has always been one of my favorite places and I order from them at least once per month. 

Though when they stopped their own delivery and started delivering with ubereats and other apps, their service has gotten really bad. 

They almost rarely include any sauces now, ignoring any notes placed on the app - I even sometimes call after I place my order and still they continue ignore any requests - and today for the first time I was given beyond dirty utensils and hair inside the basil bag!!! 

And to be honest, I&apos;m not going to bother calling them because their servers are beyond rude. They were always rude, I mainly went here for the food and didn&apos;t care for the service though now even that quality has gone down and I have no reason to be back here."
5,"Wow that&apos;s the best shumai and noodle soup I&apos;ve ever had in my life. 

I got the Kao Soi which is this Northern style curry noodle dish and subbed fried tofu for chicken and honestly it was the best thing I&apos;ve ever eaten in my life. It had all the textures and quantity of broth you&apos;re looking for from pho but with the richness of curry. I can&apos;t say enough good things about it, like seriously it&apos;s the best dish I&apos;ve ever had in my life.

The shumai was also very delicately crafted and you get eight pieces of deliciousness to share, or not share hehe! 

The boy got drunken noodles and loved it. The portion size was huge and he ate it for two meals. However, at the end of the day he wished he got the curry noodle soup I ordered.

I wish I could eat it again right now."
4,"Every time I go to Pho Basil there are quite a number of people in the restaurant which reflects its popularity. Last time I went there was a 10 minute wait time. Inside the restaurant is very clean but can be a little noisy because of the small space, however it is not a big deal. The staff was incredibly kind and welcoming as usual, and they filled up water cups very quickly. 

I have only tried noodles from Pho Basil, and I highly recommend their Pad See Ew and Drunken Noodles. My other friend had their Pad Thai, but that dish is honestly not their best as the noodles seem to be lacking. There is a bit more flavor with the Drunken Noodles in my opinion which is why I prefer it, but I love the Pad See Ew with a spice level of 3 -- I think the amount is perfect with just the right amount to complement the dish without overpowering the flavors presented. The vegetables seem fresh and I find myself enjoying the different textures together with the noodles.Furthermore, the portion sizes of the noodles are very big and I always take a to go box with me. 

One thing I do not recommend is their bubble teas, and for that reason I took off a star. The tapioca pearls were too overdone and were rather mushy than chewy. It is apparent that they just blend it with powder which I do not like, and couldn&apos;t taste the tea in both the milk tea or the thai tea. The bubble teas really did not have much flavor, and the thai tea kind of tasted like melted cotton candy dippin&apos; dots. I was disappointed. 

Besides the bubble teas however, the food is excellent for the price point and their customer service is very good. I will continue to visit Pho Basil."
5,"My number 1 restaurant in my college days. Location is great, easily walkable from the Northeastern campus and close to Back Bay. The wait grows pretty fast during peak dinner hours, especially on Fridays and Saturdays.

This is the best bang for your buck, Thai food that I&apos;ve ever had. I&apos;ve come here over at least 100 times by now.

The main dishes I would recommend are the pad thai or pad seew with crispy chicken, pho dac biet. The noodles are super delicious and the portion sizes are huge. The crispy chicken is very juicy and crispy. The pho dac biet has one of the best pho broths I&apos;ve ever tasted. It also comes with a generous amount of meat and noodles. Either of these won&apos;t disappoint!

If your in Boston and your ever feeling authentic Thai food, this is the spot.

Also get the thai iced tea. It&apos;s a great addition to your meal."
5,"I wish we had more of these spots in NYC. I seriously feel they either try but charge an arm an a leg for and ends up failing or they make it affordable and douse everything with MSG making everything taste like everything else of the same. 

Only got the chance to try the bon bue hue. OMG.... OH MAHHH GAWDD. Zee BALLS. were amazing. YES, AMAZING BALLS! Don&apos;t even! the noods was cooked to perfection, the broth was savory and warmed up my body quick! Great for winter time! Heck, I&apos;d probably come in the summer too! Who am i Kidding. The combinations of beef tendon, beef brisket, just ..EVERYTHING! It&apos;s CRACK TO ME! &amp; wished I had more ! Sadly I&apos;m back to NYC and I shall dream about their noms! 

Would definitely come back to try others. If yelp allows me to throw another star up. I WOULD!"
5,"Delicious as always! Friendly, fast and clean. All the tables are 6+ feet apart. My husband and I used to wait in line for a table prior to Covid-19. Today, we are the only two people sitting inside the restaurant. It is 7:30pm, prime time for dinner. 

They have a consistent flow to people coming for takeout, but it wasn&apos;t as busy as it used to be. 

Come and support your local business!"
2,"Sadly, I must lower my rating to two stars after a handful of more visits over the past year.

First off, the wait times are usually awful and the staff doesn&apos;t do much to make the experience any better. I&apos;ve been told it would take 15-20 minutes to get seated when it usually took 30-45. Try to avoid this place during peak hours or else you will probably have to wait half an hour minimum. 

Now that&apos;s not why I am leaving a bad review... really, it comes down to the food for me. I&apos;ve ordered a lot of kinds of plates yet none have been really tasty. What really disappoints me is their pho. The soup doesn&apos;t taste nice, light, and fresh as I&apos;d expect, it tastes thickened and unpure... This goes for pho and the other special noodle soups - bo kho, pho sate, bun bo hue.. etc. In addition, I usually order yellow egg noodles and it&apos;s almost always overdone! There is nothing worse than soggy noodles for me :(. Not to mention, getting extras always results in sadness... Extra meatballs = one or two extra whole meatballs! 

I&apos;ve also had the curry and rice plates, which were pretty solid but nothing special. 

Onto the drinks... Their Vietnamese coffee can be quite good - you should tell them if you like it more bitter or sweet. The bubble tea is OK but the portion is small and the boba is sometimes hard. 

In a gist:
OK: Fried rice and curry dishes, bubble tea, Vietnamese coffee, most appetizers
Bad: Noodle soups, chili oil

For unimpressive food and drinks, the prices are high. Cheap for the area? Yes, because Newbury is around the corner.. but not compared to that of other Vietnamese restaurants. And why did they have to go and get rid of the banh xeo?! At this point, I&apos;d rather go to Beantown Pho or opt for another kind of food in the area."
