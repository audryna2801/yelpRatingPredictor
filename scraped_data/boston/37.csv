5,"We could not have picked a better and safer place to celebrate our anniversary. This has always been one of our favorite restaurants but with new changes, we were not sure what to expect. This was our first time dining in and was a little nervous at first. But the moment you walk inside, there are touchless hand sanitizers, sanitizing stations and masks in case anyone needed one. There are arrows markings on the floor to prevent people from bumping into each other. Staff had masks on the whole time and wore them properly.  10/10 for safety and comfort

Now onto the food. This place never disappoints, not even during a pandemic. Their food quality was still top notch. We enjoyed every dish we had from soft warm loaf to the warm apple tart. For apps we had the Crab Ravioli (filled with crab meat) and Foie Gras Parfait with brioche. I&apos;m still thinking about that Foie Gras Parfait! We got the halibut with seafood paella and roasted duck with mushroom risotto and both were cooked to perfection. We enjoyed every bite! 
For dessert we got the warm apple tart that was a perfect way to end the meal. 

Thank you for a wonderful experience and for going above and beyond the safety measures!"
5,"The hype and 5 star rating of Mistral is absolutely accurate. My husband and I went to Mistral for dinner yesterday (during the covid19 pandemic) and were nervous about eating inside, but we felt so safe when shown to our table. They are all more than 6 feet apart, have shields, and there are sanitation stations throughout the restaurant. Its obvious that Mistral is taking the covid19 cleaning requirements seriously. 

And now onto the food! We both agreed that it was the best meal we have had in years. From the complimentary warm bread loaf with butter and chickpea spread to the appetizers of mussels, crab ravioli, and baby artichokes and then the salmon entree... everything was fantastic and worth the cost. I highly recommend eating dinner at Mistral, especially if you are nervous to eat out during the pandemic as it was a safe environment with delicious food!"
5,"We loved everything about our dinner here!! This restaurant is in such a cool building with dim lighting and high ceilings and totally gives you the French feel. We ate here on a Friday night during the pandemic and the tables were full but we were definitely more than 6 feet away from the other tables which was nice. 

They bring you warm fresh bread as well as butter and a chickpea spread, of course that was delicious. But we also started with the beef tenderloin pizza and O.M.G. I have to admit, I was a little skeptical at first because I wasn&apos;t sure if that was going to be the best one out of the three pizzas but boy was I wrong. We didn&apos;t have any of the other two but I can assure you that this one is delicious!!! I&apos;m not sure if it had cheese on it or if it was mashed potatoes instead of cheese or if the mashed potatoes had cheese in them. I don&apos;t know and I don&apos;t care because it was amazing. The beef tenderloin was thinly sliced and melt in your mouth good and the crust was so thin and crispy. We loved it. Definitely order to start with if you have enough people to help eat it (pretty large square slices).

For my main course I got the Cornish hen and it was very good. It wasn&apos;t dry and the spinach underneath had a light vinegar taste to it and I love that. Mom got the Dover sole and loved it. Dad got the duck and it was a really great duck dish. We all had a bite of that and said it was delicious. My sister got the steak and it was very good as well. When we asked each other what the best dish was we all said our own! 

For dessert we got the chocolate torte and it was absolutely phenomenal. You must get it if you like chocolate because wow. 

We loved our experience here and would definitely come back next time we visit Boston!"
5,"Service is spot on at this destination dining experience.

We came here for my daughters 18th birthday celebration and decided on a myriad of apps to share vs meals for a change. Great decision as we got to try a lot of different options.

Foie and tuna tartare were a hit! Escargot was eh. We also got the white pizza which I loved but the fam found to be a bit spicy.

Would I go back? Absolutely! Would I recommend? In a heartbeat!"
5,"We had an 8pm reservation to celebrate my husband&apos;s birthday. We were seated in a cozy corner spot with views of the TV so we could watch Kamala Harris and Joe Biden speak. Our waiter was prompt and sweet. My husband had a Citrus Basil Gimlet (where he swapped the vodka for Sapphire Gin) and I ordered the Radio Flyer. Both drinks were great, very smooth. Since we let them know that we were going to share, the kitchen would send out the orders already split in their own dishes so we each got to enjoy the plating. 

Appetizer:
- Maine Crab Ravioli with Thyme and Tomato Broth: If I could crawl in the bowl, I would. The pasta was fresh and the filling was succulent. The broth is great for dipping bread. If I didn&apos;t continue to restrain myself I wouldn&apos;t picked up the bowl and gulped down what was left in it. 
- Seared Foie Gras with Confit of Duck in Brioche with Wisconsin Dried Cherry Gastrique: The foie gras was gently seared on top nestled on a little tower of indulgence. Your first thought is not to cut open open the tower and ruin the display. However, once you do, you see that the duck confit was hiding in the brioche like Greeks in a horse. This dish was savory, fluffy, full of flavor. 

Main:
Dole Sole Meunière with Lemon Capers, Satué of Spinach and Onions, Fingerling Potatoes: I remember reading about how sole meunière changed Julia Childs life. Well this was life changing. The sole was tender and juicy with the right amount of tang from the lemon and capers. The spinach was soft which provided contrast to the crunch of the onions. The sole has deeply affected my soul. 

I definitely see myself driving back to Boston from New York just to eat here again. Sorry, no pictures of the food but please enjoy this photo of my husband with his dessert."
5,"A delicious spot with super chic vibes- great flavors on the menu, I love the flatbread pizzas and they have excellent desserts too!"
5,"My friend and I dined there last night and sat with Nancy at the bar, she was so awesome. Seriously, could not have had better service, and she was really busy! Recommended food, wine, talked to us. She was great. We didn&apos;t know much about french red wine so we had her choose a bottle for us. It was unbelievable. We started with the escargots and tuna tartare- which they split up for us without us even asking! So delicious. My friend doesn&apos;t even like escargots and she loved the appetizer. I had the half roasted duck (which I was nervous about because I had only had duck once before)!and it was unbelievable. Melted in my mouth! My friend had the lamb and said it was fantastic. We finished with some chocolate dessert that Nancy chose for us. Everything was so good- I can&apos;t wait to return!"
4,"This spot has outdoor seating. Top-tier service! We went during COVID and had outdoor seating, but the experience still felt authentic. We had the Caesar salad, truffle fries, rack of lamb and the white red pepper thin crust pizza and the food met our expectations. Fine dining at its best! We were late for for our anniversary dinner to this place because of COVID and the meal was def. worth the wait! Even the complimentary bread in the beginning was fresh out of the oven with warm butter and a garlic chickpea purée."
5,You have to sit at the bar and ask for Nancy to be your bartender/waitress because she has the best suggestions and will make your experience worth it. She&apos;s literally the greatest and just made tonight so special. Legit best restaurant in Boston
5,Do I really have to write a review for Mistral. This restaurant is one of my favorite places in the whole world. There is no need to describe the food or service or interior decor. This place is a beacon to which all the restaurants should be measured to.
4,"What can I say? This place exceeded expectations! We came here since they belong to the same restaurant group as Sorellina (one of our absolute favorites!). The first thing I noticed when we walked in was how stunning the decor was, it wasn&apos;t extravagant, but it was so elegant, had clean lines, and beautiful artwork. We sat right across from one the art that separates the bar from the restaurant so I got to stare at the picturesque French countryside while I enjoyed our out-of-this-world-good tuna tartare. We also tried the soft shell crab special appetizer which was also a showstopper. For our main courses we did the duck breast and wild mushroom risotto in addition to the cornish game hen which, although they weren&apos;t as good as the two appetizers, were thoroughly enjoyable to each of us. Both poultry dishes were a tad bit dry but that&apos;s my only complaint, they had great flavor and sides.

Kleber our waiter was the highlight though - he was incredible! When my husband and I even hinted at sharing everything, he asked if we wanted them to split the main dishes in half in the kitchen. We, of course, said yes and then he even had them do it for the appetizer! He also was so attentive (but not annoying) and was just a delightful person to talk to. Our only negative - the creme brûlée fell short, just too runny and the crystallized sugar was chewy instead of having that great crunch that I love about my favorite dessert. I would not hold this against them though and would 100% recommend Mistral to anyone who enjoys fine dining in Boston."
5,"My husband and I came here the first week of January 2020. It was our big night out, and the second to last day of our honeymoon. We made reservations earlier that week, taking a chance based on the reviews that it would be good. We were a little concerned when we walked in, the place was pretty empty. We were seated immediately. The food was outstanding. The drinks were well balanced. Although we thought our waiter was a little unenthusiastic compared to the others on staff, he surprised us with a free dessert, after finding out we had just been married. We had a lovely time, and this really made our honeymoon unforgettable. We already have plans on another Boston trip - that includes a dinner at the Mistral!"
5,I haven&apos;t lived in Boston for 3 years now but I still hold Mistral up as THE golden standard for brunch. The food is delicious and the presentation is absolutely beautiful. I love the huge windows and high ceilings. In my opinion the price is definitely worth the VIP treatment you get here.
4,"Came here for brunch. Gorgeous, sunlit classy space with high ceilings and minimalist birch themed decor. Delicious popovers and well made classic brunch options. Didn&apos;t blow me out of the water but will definitely be back and would like to try out the dinner options given the hype!"
5,"The perfect comfort food for a cold rainy Sunday morning.

Lovely setting, fine service and food to match.

I enjoyed my entire meal.

Clearly understandable why they have lasted for over 2 decades!"
4,"I came to Mistral with a colleague for dinner when we were attending a conference. The staff were accommodating that we were a bit late for our reservation, which was appreciated. The decor combines an intimate, dimly lit aesthetic with classic furniture. Highlights on the meal:
-Our 
-The steak carpaccio was an enjoyable dish with small bread pieces throughout, although the meat itself and the herbs stole the show. 
-Linguine was super fresh and exploding with flavor up front 
-I enjoyed the blueberry tart as well. I perhaps ate it too quickly as it was gone before I knew it!

Our server, Tiffany, was very friendly and helpful. She offered a tasting between two reds that I was vacillating between (I preferred the Campo al Mare Bolgheri). The folks at the table next to us were super sociable and added to the lightness of the environment, which is always welcome at a white table cloth restaurant. 

Mistral was veritably enjoyable, and I would certainly come back."
5,"My two teenage daughters and I went on a recent Sunday morning for a late breakfast. I can&apos;t begin to tell you how great our breakfast was. The girls shared the cinnamon rolls. They&apos;re handmade and came out warm from the oven. Magnificent!! Two of us had frittatas, and the third had eggs Benedict. Everything was fresh and hot and could not have been better. I can&apos;t wait to return and try dinner."
5,"When I go to fancy restaurants, I tend to see a lot of people that take themselves too seriously.

They&apos;re sitting bolt upright at the tables like the slightest movement might dislodge the two-by-four nesting comfortably in their asses.  They barely seem to be enjoying the carefully crafted gourmet cuisine in front of them.  I wonder whether they are so used to it that they take it for granted or whether they are careful not to show too much gusto in case someone thinks they are some new-money scumbag who has never seen a cloth napkin before. 

I have a feeling it&apos;s the latter. When food as is as good as Mistral&apos;s, how does a groan of pleasure NOT escape your lips from time to time?  Two-by-fours out the wazoo, literally.  I bet it&apos;s not even a foreign object by this point.  The lumber has fused to the buttocks and has become part of the ass like that louse that replaces the fish&apos;s tongue.*

When guys use Mistral&apos;s urinals, it looks like a pirate convention. 

I can&apos;t hide how much I enjoy my food.  Especially when it&apos;s a succulent half duck with a crisp skin in a cherry gastrique.  Yes, gastrique.  I told you it was a fancy place. 

A gastrique is a fancy term for how you make turkey gravy with the drippings after you take it out of the oven, but with an added flavor like cherry, in this case.  Not fancy enough?  The duck was resting on a bed of wild mushroom risotto.  Not too much though.  Just enough for a few creamy mouthfuls to fat-balance the tang of the gastrique.

It was incredible.  It didn&apos;t even need salt.  I added black pepper but I add black pepper to my chewing gum.  

I was eating so fast, I almost forgot about my mission to annoy uptight people.  So I started saving my burps.  They piled up and merged into one big one aching to be released.  Whenever anyone besides our server (a total sweetheart) walked by, I&apos;d release the burp in a controlled manner while talking so it sounded like the belch was my voice. 

I pretended I was Dr. Claw from &apos;Inspector Gadget.&apos; 

They looked at me like, &quot;God, why is this fucking THING in here?&quot;  I was over the moon.  I also made sure to reach over and yank chunks of Cornish game hen from Miss K&apos;s plate so it looked like she was helpless.  She&apos;d set them aside for me of course but no one needed to know that. She doesn&apos;t eat bacon either and the big, perfectly cooked chunks of bacon that came with the Cornish hen just made it look even more like I was stealing.  

I came up for air and looked around.  A few tables down, a girl was ignoring her date and shoveling food into her mouth faster than me.  I was overjoyed.  From the carefulness of the guy&apos;s body language and his full attention, I gathered it was early in their courtship.  And you know what every guy eventually wants out of a date.  

I watched as his hopes of getting that started dying when he looked at her riding a 30-foot wave of ecstasy and realized that he could never compete with the demi glace.  And yet he kept looking at her awkwardly waiting for an opening to run rehearsed game.  I wanted to blink him a code to tell him to just enjoy his food and buy lotion.  It&apos;s over, hoss.

As a married man, I don&apos;t have to deal with shit like conversation anymore. This is also a plus for Miss K because I talk exactly like how I write and there&apos;s only so many references to &apos;Deliverance&apos; a woman can take during dinner. 

Once the duck massacre ended, our incredible server offered us dessert and highly recommended the beef and potato pizza for next time.  We passed on dessert but I considered getting the pizza to go.  They&apos;re grilled and I&apos;ve always wanted to try a grilled pizza.  But I was so satisfied and full, and not in a greasy disgusting way, that I bookmarked it for next time.  It&apos;s also way better hot off the grill than soggy in a box.

The restaurant had gotten crowded by this point.  Stepping over all the two-by-fours poking into the aisles, I released a Parthian-shot burp and made my escape into the warm summer night.

5,"I&apos;ve eaten here several times and it&apos;s never a disappointment! Atmosphere is comfortably elegant.  Service is on point! Food is overall outstanding! There may have been a glitch or two with food or service but glitches were that! The food is always a standout! I can recommend the mussels, the escargot, the beef carpaccio potato pizza (it sounds bizarre but try it....all doubts will be erased). This time I&apos;m raving about the sushi grade tuna tartare! It&apos;s been on the menu for years and there&apos;s a reason why! Amazing! The soy/ginger/cilantro bed provided all the right flavor pops while the crispy wonton sticks added that flavorful crunch element! The pan seared halibut was cooked to perfection and although the dish was originally introduced with a paella style risotto featuring saffron ....which I am not a fan of....they graciously substituted the wild mushroom risotto in place of it. This is a restaurant that does things right! In the age of Covid this place is certainly doing it&apos;s diligence. Tables are adequately spaced and although I&apos;m not a fan of the time limits placed on customers,  I guess I understand it , sort of. Regardless, amazing atmosphere, amazing service and above all and most importantly amazing food! This is why Mistral is  in my  top three restaurants in Boston!"
5,By far one of the best places in Boston. Consistently exquisite food with exceptional service each and every time no matter who you are or how much you spend. One of the few high-end places I will go to again and again. Worth every penny.
