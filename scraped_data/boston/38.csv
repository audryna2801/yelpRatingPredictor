5,"Smooth, creamy, soft. Consistently innovative rotating flavors. Yes, this is definitely among the best ice creams in Boston. B3, Goat Cheese Brownie, and Earl Grey are all classics. Also try any seasonal ones you can get your hands on - they might not be there next time you go. Get a small cup so you can try two flavors at once!

Most recently went on a Friday night after they reopened during covid. There was no line at all. Service was fast, and all staff were wearing gloves and masks."
5,"Toscaninis is the best ice cream I have found in Boston thus far.  If you find yourself in Cambridge, or wanting a treat before you walk along the Charles, Toscaninis is the place to go.  

Toscanini&apos;s is the home to the best ice cream flavor I have ever tried, the B3.  Brown sugar, brown butter, brownie.... The holy grail ice cream trifecta.  This is very sweet but so delicious.  I especially love the large chunks of brownie in it.  Other flavors I find quite delicious and equally impressive are the salted caramel, and goat milk brownie.  You can&apos;t go wrong.  I like that Toscaninis offers both quirky and classic flavors...... this is great depending on how adventurous you are feeling. 

There are markings on the floor that allow for social distancing, and customers enter an exit through differentiations doors.  Additionally, the workers are wearing masks and gloves.  The service is always great and the workers are willing to offer suggestions on ice cream flavors.  You must check out if you find yourself in the area!"
5,Toscanini&apos;s is a staple for my summer and fall evenings. The revolving flavors make every trip here something to look forward to. The B3 is delicious and almost always there. During non-COVID times the staff is quite patient and will allow samples. In the meantime it&apos;s nice to run in and grab a big pint to last for a while.
4,"Across the street from the office and OMG the flavors are insane... I love that I can get all types of sizes and even like a 1 bite size because thats all I really can handle. 

They are great with quick last minute cake orders as well.  COVID has me working from home and I truly miss my 1 bites from time to time. 

All the staff is super friendly and accommodating when I stop in, Hoping they can withstand the world right now and be there when we get back!"
4,"So does this place deserve to be considered the best ice cream in Boston? Yes, yes it does. Although I was disappointed with one of my flavors (Salted Caramel. I was assured it is not too salty), I did love my other flavor, which was Heath. Of course they are not giving samples... I&apos;m told, because of Covid. This doesn&apos;t make sense to me since everyone would have their own samples but whatever. Had I tasted the Salted Caramel, I would not have gotten it and thus, I was a little disappointed, especially because it was the bottom flavor. Oh well, the next time I&apos;m in Boston, I will definitely get another flavor.

I will say they were fairly fast in getting our scoops to us. However, we did wait a while to pay, so that was a little annoying. We waited so long, it was actually tempting to leave and they really wouldn&apos;t have noticed. But we didn&apos;t, and we paid for our ice cream as we should have. I think they were so anxious to get us our ice cream, that nobody really noticed that we were waiting to pay and standing by the register patiently.

I would absolutely recommend. The texture was dreamy and creamy and perfect. I only wish that I had Heath for my entire serving. Then I would&apos;ve been super happy and likely given Toscanini  five stars, in spite of having to wait so long to pay."
2,"Local university students often frequent Tosci&apos;s, but I&apos;m always disappointed by the heaviness of their menu and their small, expensive cups. I&apos;d love to see lighter options, like a lower-sugar frozen yogurt or a plant-based gelato. For what you&apos;re paying, you&apos;ll get way more variety and quality at Emack &amp; Bolio&apos;s or Berryline! Definitely not a favorite, but they earn points for their creative flavors and friendly service."
3,"I know, I know, I know. You are probably reading this and going WHAT THE HECK. Toscanini&apos;s just didn&apos;t do it for me. 

After a date night we decided to go to stop by Toscanini&apos;s for some late night icecream. Inside they had marks on the floor for social distancing and they were quick at serving the icecream. One thing I did like was the sizing options. The mini cup was just the perfect size for a taste but nothing too overbearing. 

I decided on the B3 and maybe it was just me but I was not a fan. It was super sweet and tasted almost like a Guinness beer but in icecream form. I barely could finish it and I only got the mini size. The person I was with got the small with cookie dough and smore&apos;s and they weren&apos;t in love either. 

I think I would come back again to try another flavor but my first visit wasn&apos;t a hit."
5,"Toscanini&apos;s lives up to the hype with their out of the box menu, creamy taste, and rich flavors! They offer several ice creams by the cup/cone, pint, and as cakes. Lines can get long, and parking can be a hassle depending on the time (they&apos;ve got metered street parking right outside). Definitely want to visit again to try more of their flavors!"
5,Delicious! The ice cream is the best in the area and is a must-see after dinner or lunch in Central Square.
4,"Just amazing, rich, thick ice cream and flavors you can&apos;t find anywhere else (Goat cheese brownie? Wha? Trust me it works.). Friendly service. My favorites are the, B3, Khulfee, Hydrox Cookie, Earl Grey but honestly you can&apos;t go wrong with any of them. It&apos;s ice cream.

Not the cheapest but you&apos;re paying for premium ice cream. Scoops are on the small side but it&apos;s so rich you don&apos;t really need much. Note on the whipped cream if you get a sundae - it&apos;s not sweetened which was a little off putting to me. But I figure it&apos;s because the ice cream is sweet enough. Limited seating and it can get crowded."
5,A must visit when you are in Boston. And this is coming from someone who does not care for ice cream. We stopped by at 9.45 just before they were closing. No one was on line and as we started to order a long like was formed behind us. Unfortunately with Covid-18 they don&apos;t let you try any flavor but that&apos;s ok Bcs almost everything is to die for!
5,"Fantastic service and high quality ice creams. The staff was friendly and gave me great recommendations. I ended up getting their most popular flavor, B3 (brownie, brown butter, brown sugar). This flavor is popular for a reason. The ice cream base is creamy and rich. The brown sugar and brown butter comes through and the chunks of brownie are to die for. Any time I&apos;m in the MIT area I have to stop by for a scoop."
5,"As an ice cream scooper myself, I take my ice cream ratings seriously. And this place is the real deal. They have plenty of flavor options that are outside the norm. Of course they offer some of your basic chocolate and coffee flavors, but most of them are unique, like rosefluff, lemon espresso (ever think you could mix lemon and coffee together? me neither, until I tried this), matcha, or their signature B3 for example. The servers are incredibly friendly and kind of hipster. Right on for this funky ice cream spot. They are willing to explain flavors to you and are more than happy to give you a taste of something if you&apos;re interested. 

I always get a scoop of kulfi (Indian ice cream) and something else in the double size. For me, it&apos;s always the perfect amount. It&apos;s so creamy that you really don&apos;t need a lot. This time I had kulfi and rosefluff which was fragrant but light and sweet. It was such a one of a kind flavor. Their ice creams aren&apos;t necessarily cheap but the servers are incredibly kind and the ice cream is worth it. The unique flavors and creamy texture are really not like anything I&apos;ve ever seen before. While I am loyal to the ice cream shop I work at, I would go as far to say this is the best ice cream shop I&apos;ve ever been to!"
4,"Tosci&apos;s often appears in lists of top ice cream places to try in Massachusetts, and for good reason. They have a lot of unique flavors, and I feel like they&apos;re a quintessential part of a Bostonian experience. (Though technically both the old + new locations have been in Cambridge.) I do miss their former location on Mass Ave, so I&apos;m looking forward to when they return there!

My favorite flavor to order is the B3, which is brown butter, brown sugar, and brownie. It&apos;s the perfect blend of creamy and sweet, and it&apos;s a flavor I never fail to return to time and time again. Easily to see why it&apos;s one of the most popular flavors. They do err a bit pricier, though don&apos;t be deceived by the small-looking sizes. A single is usually more than enough to share for two.

I thought that the new location was a bit more sterile than the old and lost a bit of the typical Toscanini&apos;s charm, though that might be the nostalgia in me speaking. Cute experience for a date or for catching up with friends, and the new location is quite close to the Galleria."
5,"Tried their famous B3 as a recommendation from the server. Rich goodness of browned butter, brown sugar and brownie chunks is a must try! It is a little sweet, so I&apos;m glad I got a small size. You&apos;re also able to get two flavours starting from the small size."
4,"Good ice cream with strong, unique flavors.  Toscanini&apos;s Ice Cream is a medium sized ice cream shop with inventive recipes that I have not seen in specialty ice cream shops.   Orders are available in as small as a single scoop and as large as a sundae.

Location: Toscanini&apos;s is located near the Charles River at the corner of First and Rogers Street, about a block away from the CambridgeSide Mall.

Ice Cream (Single Scoop - $3.75): I sampled several flavors - the kulfi, B3, and the cookies and cream.  Keep in mind that the flavors rotate often, so these options may not be there when you go.  All of the ice creams are smooth and creamy.  The kulfi ice cream reminded me of the Indian kheer dessert in ice cream form.  There are pistachios mixed with almonds and cardamom.  I thought the cardamom was a bit strong, but appreciated how there is a dedicated effort to make unique ice cream flavors.  The B3 is a mix of brown sugar, brown butter, and brownies.  I also tried an ice cream with goat cheese in it.  Again, there was a bit too much goat cheese flavor for my preference - but it&apos;s unique.

Service: Ice cream is ordered at the counter.  As with most specialty ice cream shops, employees are very open to letting you try multiple flavors.  Servers are friendly.

Verdict: I think that some of the ice cream flavors would be better if they were more subtle, but I like the creativity and the willingness to think out of the box with flavors.  Will come back to try some of the many other flavors that I missed."
5,"Yes queen!! So good. 
First and foremost, the Vampire Weekend/Tokyo Police Club playing overhead was greatly appreciated. Secondly, this is just as creamy and delicious as I would&apos;ve hoped. Definitely coming back!"
5,"Toscanini&apos;s Ice Cream was marvelous. The location is unbeatable. You can tell they use high quality ingredients. The staff is incredibly friendly, helpful, and attentive. Toscanini&apos;s Ice Cream: Go here, go here now."
5,Wonderful ice cream and hot fudge shots. They have creative flavors. A little off the beaten path but well worth going.
4,"This place has some of the best ice cream in the Boston area! It&apos;s super smooth and creamy. I love love love the Vienna finger cookie -- it&apos;s a really sweet but not overwhelming flavor, and the texture of the finger cookie in it really adds to the experience. I also enjoy the matcha here -- it&apos;s got the right amount of matcha flavor and it&apos;s not too sweet.

The staff who serve ice cream are generally pretty friendly! There was once gochujang on the menu as an ice cream flavor. Gochujang is a spicy sauce from Korean culture, so that was surprising! One staff member made the observation that she thought the gochujang ice cream would go well with fried chicken haha.

As others say, the flavors here can be very creative (e.g., Vienna finger cookie), but they also do well with more standard flavors (e.g., matcha).

I&apos;m taking a star off because of a negative experience with Gus Rancatore, one of the founders of Toscanini&apos;s. I work in student affairs, and had been hoping to take a student group there, but my university requires that we use our tax exempt form (granted by the government) for purchases. Upon asking Gus if Toscanini&apos;s could process the form, he wrote in a very accusatory tone that &quot;The co-presidents of the Lowell House Drone Team cannot avoid paying tax on two small cups.&quot; That was not what I was suggesting at all, and I was taken back by his response. For that reason, I would not recommend going to Toscanini&apos;s if you work with universities or nonprofits and want to use your tax exempt form to purchase ice cream for your events.

Still, I wasn&apos;t going to avoid Toscanini&apos;s because of a negative experience with one of the founders -- the ice cream is too good. I&apos;ll just take my business with my student affairs work elsewhere."
