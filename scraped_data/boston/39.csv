5,"Listen I used to live 5 min from their old South End location. I ate here at least twice a month if not more. I don&apos;t even live in New England anymore but STILL dream about the Le Mistral. Suchhh a good sandwich.

Just read they&apos;re closed due to COVID. Very sad, hope they eventually come back!"
3,"I have always thought of returning here because I love their menu but did not for such a long time after that past experience.

This time we only got sandwiches (and onion rings). I had a ciabatta stuffed with an odd mix of hot and cold vegetables (if they&apos;re grilled, why are they cold). The onion rings were not too greasy but still under salted so I had to dunk them in the sauce."
4,"So I&apos;m not  much of a sandwich gal but Parish Cafe is really good! I love the concept of the sandwiches being from various popular chefs in Boston, executed by Parish Cafe. This means a lot of the sandwiches are unique and have a touch of sophistication that makes it better than your average deli sandwiches lol So I may have forgotten the name of my sandwich (whoops pls forgive me), but I DO remember how good it was. All the ingredients were really fresh with a pretty sizable portion. My friend and I were definitely stuffed and satisfied after our meal, which is a marker of a good meal!! 

Other things-- my friend and I came here for during Prime Saturday lunch hours and were surprised to be seated rather quickly. I heard the wait here can get pretty long, so I would advise not to try out your luck like we did and come here during off-hours if you don&apos;t want to wait. The atmosphere is also really laid back and I love that it is located close to Newbury, which is perfect for that walk you&apos;ll need to take afterwards  to combat that serious food coma you&apos;ll get from eating here. All in all, Parish Cafe is a great time--will be back to try out their other sandwiches."
4,"Great place for craft beers! They have such a wide selection of beer at really affordable prices for the location. My personal favorites are the elysian space dust and weihenstephaner. 

The food here is delicious as well! I got the bondir sandwich and the braised short rib was absolutely delicious, however what took away from it was the pickled cucumber. The amount they put in the sandwich was too much for the amount of meat present. It did have good flavor and helped cut some of the fattiness. The simple chicken here is also extremely good and I would recommend trying that out.

Overall I had a great time here and would recommend to my friends if they visit Boston to come here and grab a quick bite and a few drinks."
4,"A quality restaurant on Boylston that serves different sandwiches created by various chefs in the city (and more!)

I tried the brisket sandwich, which was gigantic and extremely flavorful! The meat was soft and the sauce was great. Since the meat is pretty oily, the freshness of the radish really helped cut back on the grease. The only complaint was that since the meat is greasy, the bun was slightly soaked in some areas. 

The potato salad that came with the sandwich wasn&apos;t as good. It was a little sour, which I didn&apos;t like.

Our server was nice and our orders came quickly. The restaurant is very popular so expect some wait and pretty loud noises at night."
4,"Great overall experience! First and foremost we were very lucky to sit outside at Parish Cafe on a gorgeous almost-fall day :) Our server was polite, helpful, and not pushy at all. 

My friend and I enjoyed a couple delicious cocktails and split a sandwich. The kitchen served the sandwich halves on two separate plates to make it easier for us to share. Not every restaurant does this, so I really did appreciate the effort. The sandwich we tried (the one with beef tenderloin) was delicious! It was on the rich side, and very cheesy and unctuous, so a bit of acid wouldn&apos;t have hurt, but otherwise we really enjoyed ourselves!

My friend who joined me for dinner that night liked our meal so much she returned the next day and split the same sandwich plus another one with her husband for lunch.

I would happily return the next time I&apos;m in the area."
3,"Good place to grab a sandwich, awful place to catch a game on TV.

Channeling good memories of Parish South End, walked into an almost-empty Parish Back Bay to watch the Patriots crash out of the playoffs.  Despite this, there were exactly four seats at the right side of the bar that had an unobstructed, non-oblique, non-distant view of a TV - every table in the restaurant was suboptimal.

Fortunately, the sandwiches were as good as I&apos;d remembered.  Ordered the Mistral, with tender beef, rosemary, and onions.  Unfortunately, as I was only in Boston for the weekend, no opportunity to drink my way into this particular mug club."
4,"My first reaction was that this menu contains the most haphazard collection of sandwich options I have ever seen. It&apos;s like someone made a random sandwich generator and let it run wild. 

But then I noticed that this was in fact, the point. And then I began to appreciate the genius behind the concept.

Each sandwich is designed by a local chef paying homage to the cuisine of their well-known restaurant(s). It felt a bit like a celebration of the local food scene-- a way in to what the city has to offer. This is a restaurant borrowing the formula from the music industry. This is the Putumayo of sandwich shops. And I liked it. 

Prices are a bit high which given the Back Bay location isn&apos;t all that surprising. I got the dBar, which clocked in at $22-- a pricey sandwich. But it was quite good. 

The facade is a bit underwhelming but I found the inside to be cozy and comfortable. We washed down our sandwiches with some Czech Pilsners."
3,"Sandwiches by local chefs in a small pub-style restaurant in Back Bay.

We went here on a week night for dinner as I had seen all the good reviews and it had been on my list for a while. I chose the Parish chicken sandwich: chicken, cheddar, bacon, lettuce, tomato, and a spicy sauce served alongside potato salad.

For me, the sandwich was good but not great. The prices are are high, to be expected in the area. My husband had the bravas, which he loved. Prosciutto, brussels, and chorizo. Too salty for my taste but I can see why others would dig it.

Maybe I chose wrong, but I&apos;ve had better sandwiches for less $$ elsewhere."
5,"We started coming here when our son was going to  college and we have been coming back since. We like the food, the beer options and mostly the service. From the welcome at the door, the young man who sat us, to the wait staff, she was new but very helpful and engaging. 

My wife gets the Simple Chicken and it&apos;s always good, very good.

I explored and had the onion steak salad. Just wow. We started with the Potato and Leak soup. Perfect. 

I dont always leave updated reviews but last night deserved a shout out."
4,"Parish caf√© is a great option for lunch, and everyone knows it. It&apos;s super busy on weekdays during lunch time, but there are usually a couple seats at the bar for a quick meal - that&apos;s what we ended up doing. Although they curate a bunch of sandwiches from local restaurants I wanted to try what they had to offer in-house so I went with the Parish chicken sandwich. It was really good, the chicken was cooked perfectly and I loved the sauce on top. 

Service was fast and friendly - no complaints there. Sandwiches aren&apos;t my favorite lunch option so I probably won&apos;t be back for a little while, but I would like to try some of their other options eventually. Overall I had a really good experience."
5,"I am so happy that I came across Parish.

My boyfriend has been telling me about this restaurant for months, and we finally made the trip. Their menu is one of the coolest concepts I have seen in a while - they offer sandwiches created by different notable restaurants around Boston, so every item is very different and very GOOD!

Vegetarians have plenty of options, and trust me, they are good. I had the Smoke Shop tofu sandwich this time, and was talking about it for the entire next week. It was delicious and so different from anything I&apos;ve ever had.

Their service is great, and the ambiance is very cozy. I can&apos;t wait to come back and try out their other menu items!"
5,"This is the perfect casual cafe to get lunch. A big group of friends and I were looking for a place to eat, and this place was quickly able to seat all 7 of us. There is only one area allotted for larger parties, though, so it is possible we got lucky. The food was also delicious. I didn&apos;t get to get my friends&apos; thorough opinions on their food, but everyone had a good time and the service was speedy.

I got the pasta Bolognese, which was super yummy. It had a very unique flavor and the sauce was creamy with tender beef. I tried a bite of my friend&apos;s pastrami sandwich as well, and the pastrami was thin and flaky, just perfect.

I&apos;d definitely recommend this place!"
5,"One of my colleagues recommended the Parish on our last trip up to Boston.  They have a diverse offering of beers, wines and cocktails as well as a varied food menu. The staff is friendly and makes great recommendations and the prices are very reasonable especially for the portions you get! Each time we&apos;ve gone everyone gets something different and not once have we been disappointed!"
5,"Ohhhhh boy the hype around this place!
Even before my company moved right next door, I&apos;d been hearing about how incredible this Parish Cafe was: &quot;the best sandwiches,&quot; &quot;mind blowing,&quot; &quot;turned me into a real man,&quot; etc. This is why I was excited to have lunch here for the first time, and my expectations were sky high. 
This place absolutely delivered, which is so rare, but i understood why everyone raved about it. The sandwiches seemed simple enough when I read the menu, but the execution was where the magic happened.
 I&apos;ll let the pictures tell the rest of the story."
4,"My friend and I dropped by Parish Caf√© and Bar after a long day of shopping. Although the restaurant was crowded, we had no trouble getting a seat. Our waitress was very attentive and checked in on us several times without being overbearing. 

In terms of food, I decided on Le Mistral and my friend ordered the Spicy Tuna Burger. Le Mistral was absolutely massive and definitely worth the $20.50. Despite the fact that the tenderloin was a bit chewy, it was flavorful and not too sloppy. Also, the portion was so generous that I ended up taking half of my sandwich to go. My friend also thoroughly enjoyed her tuna burger. 

Parish Caf√© and Bar is a great spot for delicious sandwiches, and I would definitely go back in the future!"
5,"Parish Caf√© is a good to spot around my office for lunch! Its on the smaller side, and doesn&apos;t take reservations so its usually the option we take when we can leave at 11:40 am and can avoid the lunch rush to secure a table! I&apos;ve tried 3 times, and gotten a table once (success!). I really liked the experience - the waiter was quick and really helpful, and the menu has a lot of options for most dietary needs! We ended up sharing the mac and cheese, and a sandwich - both were a good portion size and pretty tasty!! I&apos;d recommend it for a lunch spot in Back Bay if you can beat the seating game!"
5,"We came here for some sandwiches and were not disappointed. I got the Flour B.L.T because Flour Bakery is my FAVORITE, my boyfriend got the Parish Chicken sandwich and said it was also fantastic. Great service, nice atmosphere."
5,"I&apos;ll be traveling back to Boston SPECIFICALLY for this restaurant . 

HOLY MOLY BATMAN!! This is a sandwich place that you&apos;ve never even seen before! I had tears of joy at 11:30pm biting into the glorious sandwich. 

Appetizer: the Meatballs. They lasted about .25 seconds before they were devoured completely. Not because they were small, but because they were THAT GOOD! So tender and the sauce was on point. 

I had The Kenneth sandwich. Best sandwich I have ever had in my life! I ate the entire thing which is embarrassing because the sandwich is huge!

My hubby had the Dbar sandwich. He at his quicker than I ate mine and loved every bit of it. 


If you have no idea what you are in the mood for, you have to try this place! It exceeded all expectations! The staff was friendly and fun too! 6 out of 5 stars"
5,"What a pleasant surprise! I feel like i have passed this place a hundred times walking up and down Boylston but we were short on time one evening so we stopped in and all I can say is I will certainly be back!
The sandwiches are quite literally curated works of culinary art. I had the meatloaf club and it was so well seasoned and all of the toppings were nicely balanced. Definitely not something to eat if you are trying to avoid salt or carbs- but the menu does have some delightful looking lighter items as well.
The service was fair and so are the prices, especially for portion size.
I will be bringing people who visit me back so I can work my way through the sandwich menu. Definitely a good place to stop in if you are looking for a casually swank cafe bar scene and delicious food."
