5,"Best place for brunch! I love coming up to Boston for brunch at the Beehive! They have great food, drinks and atmosphere. When it is not Covid times they usually have a Jazz Band playing and it really adds to the brunch experience. Yesterday I was there for brunch and the coffee cake was delicious. It was the perfect appetizer if you have a sweet tooth like I do! The chicken grain bowl was delicious and it was very filling. We also had some mimosas to wash down all the delicious food! I have only been there for brunch but I have heard their dinner is really good too. It is a perfect place to meet up with friends and enjoy a great meal."
4,"I was seriously craving a hot, juicy burger, and the Dry Aged Smash Burger at Beehive definitely delivered. Part of the trio in south end with Banyan and Barcelona, the outdoor seating made for a great dinner date this past weekend.

Beehive is a no frills restaurant that has great food and large portions. In addition to the burger, which was cooked perfectly and full of flavor, we also ordered the short rib kebabs and the white bean dip as an app. The Queen Bee cocktail is a must order -- super refreshing! Overall I was very satisfied with my meal and did not leave hungry."
5,"Came here for Sunday Jazz brunch before the pandemic and had a wonderful time! The live music, cocktails, and food were all amazing. We had a St. Patrick&apos;s special of eggs Benedict with corned beef hash and then a kid&apos;s French toast casserole as a little dessert. A bit pricey but well worth the Jazz brunch experience. I can&apos;t wait to go again after the pandemic!"
3,"I haven&apos;t been The Beehive in ages.  I loved their brunches but hadn&apos;t had their dinner.

In these times, it&apos;s definitely nice to be able to go to dinner that is social distanced and outdoors.   They offer heat lamps and a tent should it drizzle.  There were nice plants/vine to corral the seating areas and they had string lights.  Menus are online - scan the QR code at host stand or pull up the menu at their website. 

We had the tuna tartare, steak frites and the truffles mushroom spaetzle.  Tuna tartare was over farro which was messy to eat so a spoon to serve would have been nice.  It was tasty but not as much tuna to the farro ratio.  My mushroom spaetzle was perfectly seasoned but look at the size of that plate!  Lol It should come in a smaller plate.  My husband felt the steak was mediocre (compared to MJ Steakhouse and Boston Chops - the ones I can think of now).  The frites were a hybrid of chips and fries?  It&apos;s slices but thick in some and thicker in others so it wasn&apos;t crispy all the way through or soft.


Food-wise, it is solid.  Good but nothing to write home about.  It was definitely over-priced for the quality and portions.  And, I&apos;m not expecting big portions by and means!  You&apos;re going for the ambience and to people watch.  Their outside set-up is impressive - very date worthy."
2,Great ambience. Food was very ordinary. Lamb with Cous Cous was ordinary. And the chicken wings seemed to be not freshly made.
4,I made a reservation through OpenTable and they were even able to seat us earlier than our reservation! The interior vibe is great and I&apos;m sure even better when there is live music. The tables are spaced out and the bar has dividers. The service was great and I&apos;ll definitely be back. The bean dip is a must! The food was delicious but smaller portions.
2,"Last time for the beehive!!! Our waiter seemed like he wanted to kill us the entire time. He was not happy at all. Do not order shots here. They&apos;re $15 each. Waste of money. The drinks are subpar at best. The smash burger was not good at all either. A smash burger should be thin and filled with juices and flavor. This burger was just a thick well done patty. This advertising seems like just a way to get around asking, &quot;how do you like your burger done&quot;... I was not impressed. Especially when the bill was nearly $700."
3,"Came here for dinner in October when indoor dining was still permitted. I had their brisket which was very delicious. They had a Charlie Brown Halloween streaming on a screen in the background. I found it off that the table was bare when we got there- no utensils or table cloth. It seemed like all of the tables were like that too. Besides the ambience and decor, which could be better, the food and service were good. They also have outdoor heating lamps for outdoor dining."
5,"This spot was way more about the atmosphere and the live music than the food, and that&apos;s totally okay. I caught up with a friend here over a nice enough meal and split a great bottle of wine while listening to a jazz band kill it on stage. Can&apos;t ask for much more than that. If possible, ask for a table close to the show so that you can make the most of your visit to the Beehive. 

It wasn&apos;t a cheap night out, but well worth it if you consider that you&apos;re paying for dinner and a show. The space itself seemed well thought out from our vantage point near the stage."
3,"Was here this past week. Out door seating made it a bit chilly honestly not enough heaters! As far as the service very pushy get in and get out type of breathing down your neck feel. 
Drinks by far made me at least give 3 stars! Got the tuna tartare that&apos;s was ok! Not my favorite in the south end."
2,"Went here today with friends and have mixed feelings about this place. Here&apos;s the rundown,

THE GOOD
-huge restaurant with multiple rooms
-the decor is outstanding, very unique and hip
-the live band, they sounded really good
-unique menu, and there&apos;s a hidden American Breakfast option with scrambled eggs, and bacon

THE BAD
-hostesses are too cool to be nice. Even with a reservation they hardly informed me of anything. They treated me with such disrespect. 
-poor service from kitchen staff, the breakfast I ordered was missing the cheddar cheese when the kitchen staff member brought it to the table. He said he would look into it, but I never heard back from him. 
-poor service from server, he was spilling coffee onto our table and not providing any apology, not cleaning it up, or providing extra napkins without asking, it was shocking.
-prices here are pretty high, 3 coffees and 3 breakfast plates came to $70, before tip. 

It&apos;s too bad the service is bad from all the staff we encountered, as it&apos;s such a nice place inside."
5,Had a great brunch at the Beehive! Got the coffee cake and the shakshuka and both were super good. All of the tables were decently separated and all of the staff were following Covid procedures.
4,"Really great space to drink, eat, and listen to music.

I started at the bar with a glass of wine, waiting for my friend. It&apos;s really fun that they project the band, which is downstairs, onto the brick wall upstairs. So you obviously hear them, and then also see them from the bar (turn around) and the mezzanine, where we sat for dinner.

We shared oysters and then I had the salmon dish. Everything was super flavorful. Our server was also very patient with us. We hadn&apos;t seen each other in 10 years, so we had a lot of catching up to do before we even contemplated the menu.

Wouldn&apos;t hesitate to come back - and next time would like to sit downstairs which looks slightly swankier."
3,"Came here yesterday for a brunch with my guys.

The service was good, everyone was very nice, attentive, and seemed like they wanted you to have a good time.

The waiter was a bit forgetful and even though wee had a big group, wasn&apos;t using his notepad to take orders, which would have been helpful because he forgot a few things.

For the food, it was ok - i had the short rib benedict and the skirt steak with eggs. The portions were decent but the flavor was mediocre in my opinion.

The drinks are really good!!&apos;
The ambiance was nice and I appreciated the live Jazz.

Probably a place to come for Jazz &amp; drinks, but not for the food, honestly. 

Also really crowded so book a reservation!"
4,Great outdoor space. No issues honoring our reservations. Good waiter service. The crumb cake was delicious and so was the white bean dip. All Of us enjoyed our meals.
4,"Went to The Beehive for Saturday brunch and was glad that I did! Also, definitely make a reservation if you can. There was live jazz which was awesome and the dining rooms downstairs have a cool rustic meets slightly swanky vibe that reminds me of New Orleans. Definitely sit downstairs instead of the mezzanine up too. 

Service was pretty good and food came out in a timely manner.

The Eggs Shakshuka was tasty but one of the poached eggs was overcooked so the yoke wasn&apos;t runny at all but the other egg was perfect. I added the merguez spiced lamb to it and it was flavorful and tender. Overall I would definitely order it again though it wasn&apos;t quite as filling as I&apos;d hoped so you might want to add a side of something if you like a bigger brunch.

The Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict was very flavorful. The salmon was delicious, the poached eggs were perfect, and the English muffins were really good. The plate comes with greens as a side, I&apos;d probably get an order of frites with the meal next time. I&apos;d say one of the Benedicts are what I&apos;d order next time I go!

The vibe is the true winner of this place! They have live jazz for weekend brunch and in the evenings on Fridays and the weekend I believe. There seems to be a shortage of nice jazz club/restaurants around Boston so I&apos;m happy to have found this one! (Let me know if you know other good ones!)"
4,"Overall, I was impressed with the quality of food and drinks. However, one star was deducted due to the service, especially the host stand. 

We had originally gotten a reservation with outdoor preference and they did not have any room at our time, which was fine because we decided to wait for a table to become available. They said they would text us when our table was ready and we left to walk around the city. 45 minutes later, still no message so we called and they said they tried to get ahold of us but we had no messages. They just seemed very disorganized and like they didn&apos;t know what they were doing. Reservations don&apos;t mean much here apparently.

In regards to the food, the service was slow to bring the food but it was worth the wait. The egg shakshuka was very unique and had lots of dimension. I really recommend this dish. The frites were also very tasty, although they were more like chips than fries. The sage was delicious and added a fresh element. The ricotta was creamy and salty but I don&apos;t think I would order again. The lamb burger was good for the price but wasn&apos;t outstanding in any regards. 

Would recommend this place if you want a nice area and atmosphere, only if you want it to be a long meal though."
5,"Located in the middle of the downtown in a cute place. Social distancing very much practiced. Nice seating outside, there are some seats inside for the current situation. Beautiful decor! It looks like they have live music. The food was great, the service was great too. Parking is tough, but at the moment you can park in front of restaurant where cast supposed to be. Other than that you have to find a parking garage before coming to enjoy this place."
5,This restaurant is absolutely phenomenal.  Erwin took really good care of us.  Everyone followed safety protocols perfectly.  And the food OMG the food was just  amazing.  The ambiance of the place is so relaxing.  If you ever get dessert the Chocolate Mousse was probably the best thing we&apos;ve ever had.  Thank you for such an amazing experience!
4,"I made a reservation for a Tuesday night with my friend before seeing a play at The Calderwood. The downstairs bar area was hoppin&apos; with folks, but most of the tables were empty at 5:45/6. By the time we left at 7:15, there were a lot of people there. Music starts at 8 PM and we saw them setting up as we were heading out the door. I&apos;m sorry to have missed the live show, but we had other places to go.

We were seated promptly and the service was great. I wasn&apos;t super hungry, so I got the mussels as my meal with a Violette cocktail to start. The Violette is basically just creme de violette with bubbly. Can&apos;t go wrong. It was delicious. My second cocktail was a bees knees. For it being &quot;The Beehive&quot;, the bees knees was only ok. The lemon/honey ratio was a bit off.

The mussels were good and it was truly an appetizer-sized portion. It came with a bit of bread with some kind of spread, but it was soggy and not my fave.

Overall, I have been to The Beehive before and would come back. My friend loved her burger and the server was helpful while she tried to choose a good beer. A solid 4-star joint."
