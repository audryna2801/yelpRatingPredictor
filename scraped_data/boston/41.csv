5,"Definitely one of the best brunch spots in Boston! 

I kept seeing posts about this place on Instagram and I needed to try it out for myself. My boyfriend was coming to visit, so I made a reservation for weekend brunch. You will definitely need to make a reservation, this place is popping on the weekends. When we got there, we were seated immediately. The place is rather small and there were plastic dividers between the tables for covid safety, but the tables were still pretty close together. This wouldn&apos;t be the place for someone who is more weary about the pandemic. 

My boyfriend and I knew right away what we were getting as I had stalked the menu beforehand. Our waitress was super friendly and attentive. They even brought out fresh banana bread to the table while we waited for our food. Brunch isn&apos;t complete without and mimosa and theirs were delicious!

We ordered the chicken and waffle sliders and the cinnamon roll french toast. Both were AMAZING! I was super excited for the chicken and waffle sliders and they did not disappoint. It is such a fun concept! The sliders also came with potatoes which were out of this world! Definitely need to go back and get a whole order of those. The cinnamon roll french toast was pretty sweet and heavy, which my sweet tooth boyfriend loves. Everything was perfect and we went on a long walk afterward to burn off some of the calories that we had just consumed."
5,"Absolutely outstanding!  Safety for covid is a high priority here. Plastic partitions between the tables. 

Corned beef hash Benedict was amazing and homemade from scratch. My husband had the prosciutto and fig Benedict.  Again. Off the hook good. 

Home fried potatoes were crispy. Potions perfect. Service staff obviously loves what they do. 

We ordered a sandwich to go and three homemade banana breads."
5,"This was an awesome place for breakfast, especially when limited restaurants are open during COVID that has indoor and outdoor seating. Expect to wait in line as it&apos;s always packed, however, it&apos;s totally worth the wait!
We came here as party of 8 on a Saturday morning. Luckily we only waited for 20 min before we were seated. They had to break us into 2 tables due to seating limit of 6, but they seated us next to each other. 
Our waiter was very nice and quick to take our drink orders: kraft of pineapple mimosa, yum! Bonus - they serve everyone with a bite size homemade banana bread which leaves you salivating for more...  
Between all of us, I had a taste of the french toast (crispy with frosted flakes outside and chewy on the inside - sooo good), lobster benedict (chunks of fresh lobster, perfectly poached eggs with yummy home fries), smoked salmon Benedict (also delish), and lobster omelette... I don&apos;t think you can go wrong with any dishes. 
This is a perfect way to start your day in Boston!"
3,"Pre-COVID-19 review: I was so excited to try this place as the menu sounds mouthwatering, but my friends and I were let down. The wait time is staggering--we couldn&apos;t believe that we decided to wait almost an hour and a half for brunch, but we had already tried and failed to come here once, so we wanted to stick it out this time. We were eventually seated at a counter by the entrance, and not only were we constantly jostled by people walking past, but we also got the drafty cold air every time someone walked in or out, which was all the time in this busy restaurant. 

Everything on the menu sounded so good, but I eventually settled on the Crudite French Toast because I had never heard of anything like it. It&apos;s an ingenious combo, but the execution was lacking. The amount of brie was puny, and the French toast was just alright. For what was essentially French toast with some sliced apples, walnuts, and brie, I could make a better version of this at home without the long wait and $14 price tag. My friends both got omelets and agreed that they were pretty standard. None of us thought the food was worth the wait. 

Given how great the reviews are and how good the menu sounds, I still want to come back and try the other specialty pancake and French toast options, but I&apos;ll definitely be doing it on a weekday."
5,"LOBSTER BENEDICT LOBSTER BENEDICT LOBSTER BENEDICT!!! You all must try North Street Grille, I just had the best Benedict nothing will ever compare LOL! No but really, wow! The amount of lobster is shocking, the eggs were perfect AND the potatoes!? That seasoning YES! 
My boyfriend had the peanut butter French toast that he said was the best he&apos;d ever had 
AND the banana bread they start you with is the most moist! The staff was great 
Must visit YES YES YES"
5,This was the best brunch I&apos;ve ever had!! It was such an extensive menu. I&apos;m sure ANYONE could find something they like. The staff was so friendly and helpful. The restaurant just feels like a place you want to go back to everyday. The iced coffee was a great start to the morning and the north end Benedict kept me full all day. It was so delicious and filling. We got way too much food for the two of us but it was so yummy- we couldn&apos;t help it!!
5,"The start on my first visit was a little rough, but the food was amazing enough that I am willing to be forgiving, at least this time. 

When my friend and I sat down, we decided rather quickly, and had to wait an inappropriately long time for even our drink (coffee) order to be taken. Once we had ordered, it was uphill from there. Other than that, the service was nice. 

Coffee and food came out without too long of a wait. Coffee was pretty standard, nothing worth writing home about. The Chicken and Waffle sliders though... let me you these things are amazing!

The waffles themselves were nothing remarkable, but they&apos;re not supposed to be. Chicken is hot, fresh, slightly crisp, and very tender! Cheese and bacon add a nice touch. First visit had sweet potato home fries, second had regular home fries. Seasoned very nicely (though I preferred the sweet potato fries). Also, that spicy maple syrup is awesome to add some sweet and heat!"
5,"Great brunch spot! I would recommend making reservations if you want to go on the weekend to avoid a long wait time. 

I ordered a cinnamon roll pancake and side of ham and my boyfriend ordered the prosciutto and mozzarella eggs benedict. The pancake was so fluffy and delicious!! I also got an orange juice and a cappuccino - without prompting, the waiter apologized for slow service with the beverages and offered me a free cappuccino to make up for it (and I didn&apos;t even think the service was slow in the first place)! 

All in all, we had a fantastic experience and would definitely return to the North Street Grille!"
5,"Had breakfast here that served as my meal of the day. Lobster Benny image on Yelp caught my attention. Well, I did have just that. It was an excellent choice. The cook did not skimp on lobster meat. Caught few lobster claws on my plate. The eggs on top were poached just right so the yolk ran as it should have. I loved my morning fare. Emma, the waitress brought me some banana bread pieces. They went with my coffee perfectly. Ah, coffee was good too. As for Emma, she was courteous, and professional. She is part reason I gave the place five stars. I&apos;m bringing my coworkers here next time."
5,Food is vibrant with amazing service. The Australian server is sure to make your day and experience well worth.
2,Paul the host was really rude! He told us &quot;go somewhere else&quot; and slammed the door when we asked if we could wait inside for one more person of our party on a Sunday morning. I understand that for COVID reasons that might not be possible but there is a nice way to explain it. Our waitress was kind and the food was great but we felt disrespected. This should not happen to anyone!!
4,"- Food was delicious ; the blood orange mimosa was great too but the chicken and waffles was a little dry for me 
- Service was fast and friendly 
- Can never find parking in this area"
5,"My friends and I got takeout breakfast here, and this place made it SO convenient. We ordered/paid online, and when we arrived, they had it sitting on a table immediately when we opened the door. It was so easy and so yum!! Large and very filling portion sizes too. Very tasty and definitely will be back!!"
5,"There is absolutely not a single dish that does not taste good in this place. EVERYTHING IS DELICIOUS!!! The potatoes are to die for. The eggs are perfect, the syrup is amazing. Oh and their hot sauce! Love it! We took one of our friends here for the first time and he was so obsessed that he wanted to make reservations for every day until his vacation was over."
5,Wow just wow! One of the best brunch spots in Boston! Definitely make a reservation as the place is very small with only a few tables. We had a reservation and still ended up waiting 20 minutes but we didn&apos;t mind as we were able to walk around the area and see some historical spots. The service here is amazing! Everyone was so nice to us. The food..omg the food was incredible. The drinks were awesome - recommend getting the Bloody Mary carafe.
4,"Came here with my boyfriend, his son and two of our friends for brunch. After seeing all the good reviews for a brunch spot, I decided we had to check it out and this place did not disappoint me or my company one bit. I had the chicken and waffles which were so good, I have no complaints whatsoever. My boyfriend ordered the breakfast wrap which he liked and my friend ordered the french toast which was also good. The orange juice is a must with the yummy breakfast!"
4,"We came on a Sunday. Service was awesome. We were seated outside . We ordered the Boston cream Pancakes, sweet &amp; salty sandwich, Benedict in bed and chicken n Waffles. The presentation on these were amazing. My chicken n Waffles was tasty. The chicken was crispy and moist. The waffles was buttery,.crunch and delicious. It was about $12-15 per dish but worth it. Definitely will be back"
3,"Excellent flavor, generous portions. Large menu.
All my favorite things

My rating would be a 5 but they ran behind schedule, causing my group to wait outside in the cold for 30+ minutes."
4,"If brunch is your favorite meal of the day you must go to North Street Grille. Reservations are practically required on weekends but easy enough to grab a few days in advance. Plenty of indoor and outdoor seating. Indoor has plastic between tables due to COVID which can be a bit off-putting but it is what it is.

Plenty of brunch favorites to choose from. I went with the strawberry shortcake French toast which comes with either one slice or three. I opted for one since the slices are thick and the dish was on the sweet side. Homemade whipped cream is a nice touch and they give plenty of syrup. Bacon as a side was super crispy and for $6 they definitely load up the plate. 

Service is good but can feel a bit rushed. Then again they ARE super busy so it&apos;s understandable. Iced coffee was good but there is a fee for a milk alternative. Overall really solid spot for brunch."
5,"THIS PLACE HITS THE SPOT EVERY SINGLE TIME!!!! I&apos;m not a fan of sitting in the street to eat my food but with new covid restrictions, it&apos;s totally understandable, and they did a great job making you feel as though you were somewhere else with the flowers and the cute setup. The food is amazing and you can tell by how long the wait usually is. lol I have had several items from the menu but the lobster omelet and the banana bourbon french toast are by far my favorite. I totally recommend this restaurant and the drinks are also a hit!"
