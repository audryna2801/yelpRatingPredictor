5,Love this place!!! Super quick if you&apos;re in a pinch and the staff are always friendly. Been a good place to grab a burrito from during the pandemic because it&apos;s a quick in and out spot. One tip is to definitely add plantains to your burrito -- they add a nice sweetness and creamy quality to it!
5,"They&apos;re doing a great job during COVID. There&apos;s space to sit outside and inside if there aren&apos;t many people around. They accept a lot of delivery apps, but I went in person and was glad I did. Same lovely atmosphere. Only thing I&apos;d say is that they were *extremely* generous with the cheese on my burrito, so if you don&apos;t want your burrito to be 20% cheese, make a note of that. 
Support local restaurants (and tip well)!"
5,Super good service! Great food! The delivery was incredibly fast and the food was delicious.
3,"I used to LOVEEEE this place when I was in college at BU! I remember these tacos fondly every time I look for a steak taco with a great cabbage coleslaw on top. My boyfriend and I planned to drive through Boston on the way back to Brooklyn just because I would talk about these tacos so much! Came today and was sadly disappointed in the salsas and tacos. 

Don&apos;t get me wrong, this wasn&apos;t a total loss! The carnitas and cheese quesadillas were that good kind of cheesy that leaves strings as you rip off that delicious bite away from the tortilla. The steak and cabbage were the combination of tart and savory that I remembered in my dreams, but those salsas... sadly the salsa that I was anticipating pushing that steak over the edge and tying the whole taco together might as well have been water. There was no flavor in the extra salsa that was given or the one that was in the taco itself. It was a nice mid-day meal, but I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll be dreaming about this any longer."

The Story:
Love this place for its affordability, the kindness and attentiveness of its staff, and the casual nature of its indoor/outdoor spaces. Have come here for lunch a couple times and so far have tried the steak quesadilla and fish tacos. Both were good, and I&apos;m looking forward to coming back and trying more.

This place gets the job done if you&apos;re looking for fast, affordable Mexican-inspired food, although I wish there was a bit more flavor in their offerings. Had to ask for extra salsa/hot sauce, which definitely helped. What I&apos;ve had so far (and again, looking forward to trying more!) tastes like it accommodates to college students. Given the area, I don&apos;t blame them.

Again, looking forward to coming back since their staff is so nice and they&apos;ve done a *great* job making customers feel safe during COVID."
5,I adore el pelon. I have been coming here since college because I often miss being near great Mexican food back home in Los Angeles. The prices are reasonable for much better food than you&apos;ll find at chipotle or maybe even other spots in the area. Here I went with my friend and he had the Carnitas taco and steak torta which both looked delicious and per his review the torta blew him away. I had the El Guapo burrito with guacamole and it was enormous I am a fairly small person with a big appetite and I could barely finish this but every bite was worth it.
3,"Recommended by friends so decided to out their food. Took the El Guapo, tasted great but I found hair in my food :( 

I discarded that side and ate the rest. Tastes great to be honest, less ratings for the hair. 

Tasted the Carne Asada Torta from a friend and that was great too."
5,"Fish Burrito? Not something I have come across before, so had to try it. The burrito was a lot larger than I was expecting it to be and had a very generous amount of cod in it. Great flavors and the hot sauce really complimented it well. The fried plantains were also packed with flavor and is a must try! So glad I found this place!"
4,"Amazing food for the price! It&apos;s an unassuming little shop located in a strip with other local food options in Fenway, but I&apos;m so glad I gravitated to the taqueria. My friends and I all throughly enjoyed our meals, from the speciality tacos, to the large burritos, to the tortas (sandwiches). The portions are large for the price and quite filling. The service is also super quick, they had our meals ready within 3 minutes. They slather on the sauce and toppings, which is definitely something I appreciate. I ordered the Caramelos house tacos, which came with two in my order. The steak was covered in cheese and really tasty, would recommend!"
5,"Best. Tacos. Ever. 

The fish tacos are great. Thick pieces of fish. Crispy and fresh. Great fresh ingredients. And it was surprisingly really filling. Simple good food."
5,Best burritos in Boston by far. Get the fish burrito or the Guapo and your tastebuds will love you infinitely. The pescado burrito is fresh and zesty while the Guapo is rich and velvety; choose whichever suits your mood!
3,"Last evening we did a self guided walking tour round the Fenway neighbourhood of Boston.

Having looked on YELP earlier in search of a HEALTHY affordable meal we decided on EL Pelon Taqueria, located in a strip of 8 small restaurants on Peterborough St.

Midst of the cluster: Middle Eastern, Japanese, Burgers, etc. A coool concept, an outdoor food court so to speak , a warm Boston evening, people sitting at picnic tables in front of these various Ethnic style perveyors of diverse food styles. Casual. Inexpensive for the most part.

El Pelon was doing a steady business of takeaway and dine in.
Clean washing facilities. Help yerself water. Disposable containers, no frills dining for the masses kinda place.

Selection is large, most of the standard Mexican &apos;names&apos; on the menu.

My dairy free = Tacos x 3, one of each: beef, chicken, pulled 
pork. Corn tortilla wrapping doubled up. Overload of red pickled cabbage, sparse onion slices, cucumber slices on top, no fresh cilantro. B I G heavy tacos impossible to pick up. Filling. Massive, shared by the two of us.

Wife&apos;s Enchelada was cheesy and black beany. Spicy. Fresh crunchy exterior. &apos;Delicious&apos; she said.

Order of corn chips in a paper bag for the table (4.95) skimpy red salsa in a tiny plastic ramekin. Probably fried hours earlier, &apos;okay&apos; Unremarkable. Undistinguished.
Total
20 bucks.

Nourishing filling &apos;vittles&apos;, HOWEVER,
Compared to the mom n pop stores we tried in the last few weeks from genre &apos;Mexican non TexMex&apos;  this one was a tad &apos;commercial&apos; and lacked finesse.

Vibe and Ambiance:
counter service / order / pay/  leave your name/ shouted out when ready / pick it up carry to your dining place of choice was patient and courteous.

Difficult to look up into the bright spotlights to read the menu board high above the counter.

Hard wooden picnic table outside, pleasant warm Boston evening in Fenway, a stones throw from the ball park, memories of Carl Y et al.

Community minded local biz.

Solid 3 star budget dining."
5,"El Pelón Taquería you are really remarkable, I had an incredible experience here yesterday. It&apos;s fantastic and totally different than the norm. I really wanted to try Tostada, I am glad that I did, it was outstanding! Team ensured every thing was all right. Everything was delicious at El Pelón Taquería. I would recommend it."
5,"I first tried their El Guapo burrito (steak and plantains) and their quesadillas through their catering, then decided that I had to see what other menu items they offer. I&apos;ve been looking for a good Mexican place in Boston and I think I&apos;ve found the one.
First of all, their prices are awesome. You can get a very long burrito for $9 and single tacos for $3. But if you&apos;re hungry then the platos are probably the best deal. 
I tried their torta ($7) and everything was super fresh. The bread could barely hold everything together because it was stuffed with so much meat.
The taquitos ($6) come with a lot of salsa and are a great appetizer, snack, or small meal on their own. 
I wasn&apos;t terribly impressed by their horchata. It&apos;s nice and cinnamoney but I felt that it was a bit watered down.
The food comes out quickly after you order. The seating is a bit limited inside and seating outside is tough when the weather is cold."
2,"Found this based on Yelp, one stop down the T from our hotel.

The sign says authentic Mexican. Maybe coming from Los Angeles and Mexican being my overall favorite food, my standard is too high, or Bostonians don&apos;t know what the real thing is.

My carnitas enchilada was just okay. Two small pork tortillas doused in a sweet green sauce and covered in a ton of unmelted white cheese. I did not see any hot sauce out. I would describe it as watered down American version of Mexican for gringos who cannot handle hot and spicy Mexican food. We have way better all round Minneapolis.

My wife got chicken enchiladas and tried to take it back because the cheese was not melted and tortillas kind of cold. I then realized mine was also not hot, just lukewarm. She then freaked out that the chicken may not be cooked thoroughly. They told her they do not have an oven to melt it, but offered to make her a new one.

My 14 year old loved her giant carnitas burrito. She gives it four stars. She gives Chipotle five stars for the same thing. Wow, if Chipotle is the scale, I would give Chipotle a three at best, so this burrito a two. 

Will not be back."
3,"Got dinner here last week while in Boston with some friends.  The place is very small and there were a lot of people here, so there was no room to sit inside.  Thankfully there is some outdoor seating and we sat there though it was a bit cold.  Nothing really else to comment on about the place itself; seemed clean enough and well run.  

I got one each of the tacos here (steak, chicken, and carnitas).  They were each $2.95 and the total came to $9.47.  Not too bad at all.  I got my food and saw that they put cucumbers on the tacos, which was appreciated, but  it was pretty impossible to bite into the taco with them there so I ate them on the side.  I was wondering how big these tacos were going to be and I was like pleased to see that they felt pretty hefty.  I started with the carnitas, as I felt it would be the best.  Unfortunately, there was so much water in the taco (not sure if it was from the pork juices or the cucumbers) that my taco fell apart and I had to eat it with a fork lol. 

Favor wise, I thought the carnitas was a bit bland.  It was soft enough, but didn&apos;t have a tremendous amount of flavor.  I liked the chicken taco the best out of all of them in terms of flavor.  Lastly the steak one was good, but the meat wasn&apos;t as tender as I liked and it was a slight chore to chew.  I have to say that the green hot sauce on the side was excellent and actually very hot.  

Overall, I was pretty satisfied at the amount of food I got for the price.  But the flavor was a little underwhelming compared to some other tacos I&apos;ve had."
5,"A little pricey but ugh so good. Their caramelos tacos always hit the spot and have a but of everything. The steak is SO juicy and the jack cheese is always perfectly melted in and incorporated with the meat. It&apos;s complemented by some salsa fresca, some hot sauce to give it a little kick, and guacamole. To top everything off, there&apos;s a lime wedge for each taco. I always use a fork to mix everything around to make sure i get a bit of everything in each bite. Absolute perfection."
5,"Few menu items on earth translate to English as accurately as el guapo. It wasn&apos;t just a steak burrito. It was somehow a new combination of savory, sweet and spicy that tasted the way the word guapo sounds. Fried plantains are going in all my burritos from now on. Well done Pelón. You gave created the only truly handsome burrito I have experienced."
5,"This review is for their catering. I haven&apos;t specifically done eat-in.

The catering with El Pelon is unreal! We recently ordered quesadillas and sides for an event at work and everyone wouldn&apos;t stop raving about the food! The meats were delicious and generously portioned. The chips were deliciously crunchy and salted well. 

Price, quality, and serving size was all ideal for work get-togethers!"
4,"We ordered a large order for pickup for a company lunch and they accommodated and even wrote all the names on the specific orders when we put it in the notes section! Super helpful when passing out what people got. In terms of my burrito, i got the Carne Asada Burrito, it was good, except I wish they used a different type of cheese and spread the ingredients more. When I was eating it, all the cheese was melted in a blob on one side so at one point I was eating plainly cheese in the burrito. Other than that, it was a good burrito and I definitely would try the other burritos and the plantains as I was told it was really good from this place!"
