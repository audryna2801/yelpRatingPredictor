5,"We&apos;ve been ordering takeout several times a week during the pandemic to support local businesses and because it&apos;s difficult to cook with our schedules. Out of the 100+ take out meals we&apos;ve had, this sushi spot has been the best one so far! 
We&apos;ve had sushi from several restaurants nearby, but nowhere have the rolls been as fresh, delicious, and creative as this location.

The signature chef&apos;s rolls are under $15 here, where as most places charge $15+ a signature maki roll. Every signature roll we tried is delicious. My favorites are: Phoenix maki, spicy crispy nice tuna, rainbow maki, crazy salmon maki. 
We tried several other regular rolls but they weren&apos;t as great as the signature rolls (definitely stay away from the California roll, it&apos;s just meh). 

All in all, highly recommend the food, although I can&apos;t say anything about dining in as we&apos;ve always bought the food home."
5,"Best take-out sushi in Boston. Rolls are cheap and done very well. We also dined in a few times, but the place is small. They are super quick to prepare your food - asap means like 10 minutes, so make sure you&apos;re close by when you order!
The place also features a couple of other small counters that sell ramen &amp; dessert - we have tried both and they are also very well worth it! If you find yourself waiting for some sushi, get a waffle dessert while you&apos;re at it!"
5,"Avana Sushi is my go-to sushi restaurant when I want quick service and fresh fish. Although the maki platter is a bit pricy, it is worth every penny and far more affordable than other sushi restaurants. During our quarantine, this became our &quot;treat yourself&quot; meal after a long week of working from home. The decorative elements and attention to detail in the preparation to the sushi made it look almost too gorgeous to eat. This was a meal that I can compare to ambrosia, the food of the gods. I would highly recommend it to anyone. I am salivating just thinking about this experience. Avana, if you ever need a taste tester you know where to find me!"
4,"Unassuming sushi spot in a mini foodcourt in Chinatown. We were pleased with what we ordered and even had leftovers. Overall it&apos;s a great bang for the buck and we&apos;d definitely order  from here again. 

The specialty rolls are reasonably priced and dare  I say cheap 

For starters we ordered the spicy seaweed salad and seafood salad. They were both good. The seafood salad came on a bed of iceberg letters with some assorted veggies and mango and crunch sprinkled on top 

For rolls we ordered the following and liked them all. Some were a little heavier on the rice but we&apos;ve definitely had worse in Boston:
- tuna cucumber avocado - good, classic 
- spicy yellowtail avocado - they accidentally added crunch but otherwise good 
- spicy rainbow maki
- spicy red dragon maki 
- spicy baked salmon maki"
3,This is hidden in Chinatown in conjunction with a ramen place in a small area. They were very busy and the wait was long. I ordered the spicy salmon roll and it was ok. The rolls were super tiny and I tasted good enough if I was craving sushi
5,"Omg. This is a HIDDEN GEM! Part of me doesn&apos;t want anyone else to find out how great Avana Sushi is because I want it to myself, but I know I would be doing them a disservice if I didn&apos;t write this review. Although a small &quot;hole in the wall&quot; type place, the sushi is FRESH. And an absolutely steal at these prices! I&apos;ve always been wary about less expensive sushi, because you always wonder if the quality is good. Let me confirm, the quality is fantastic! It seems way too good to be true. Might need to make sushi a weekly thing now because you can get a LOT of sushi that tastes amazing without breaking the bank! My favorite roll by far is The Black Pearl Boy. Don&apos;t miss out!!"
5,Best sushi in BOSTON!!!!!!! Always fresh! I&apos;ve always had it delivered and it&apos;s been great service!!! Love this place !!!
4,"Pretty good quality sushi at very reasonable prices. My boyfriend and I had two miso soups and four specialty rolls of sushi and the total came out to be just $50-$55. My favorite was their Spicy Crazy Salmon roll, which had spicy salmon, avocado, tempura flakes, and spicy mayo sauce. 

The space is small and there isn&apos;t much seating, but we came for lunch on a Saturday and there were a few tables available. They have a lot of variety on their menu, so I&apos;d be excited to try other stuff next time I&apos;m here.

5,"I love Avana sushi!! So cheap and always such good quality, fresh and delicious. My go to order is the shrimp avocado mango sushi, the tempura shrimp sushi, and mango salmon avocado sushi. Go here!!! So good!"
3,"Keep in mind - I&apos;m not a sushi connoisseur by any means and I&apos;ll happily indulge in grocery store sushi if I know it&apos;s half-decent, but I had trouble enjoying Avana Sushi. 

I don&apos;t know if it was because I ordered it for delivery, or if it was just an off day, but the sushi itself felt... dry and old. The fish seemed to be not very fresh and the rice was pretty hard. I still ate it all because again, not a sushi snob here, but definitely had an upset stomach the rest of the day (first meal of day, not trying to insinuate anything here). 

I might try it again once things are back to normal, but may hesitate next time before trying."
3,"Take out order: Tuna, salmon, bbq eel, octopus, mackerel, tamago, spicy tuna avocado and seaweed salad(not pictured). Staff was kind and service was fast. The mackerel was really sweet!"
4,"This place does the trick for a nice sushi takeout. It&apos;s not a fancy nice restaurant. It&apos;s a corner spot in Chinatown with a super busy flow and a lot of fresh fish. My review was 3 stars for the mediocre customer service (the lady hung up without getting my name ?!) and sort of messy shop environment. But 5 stars for fish quality and freshness: it&apos;s delicious good stuff. Simple sushi rolls. We got rainbow -delicious..my fave. Black pearl-delicious. Spicy tuna was good and I didn&apos;t like them shrimp tempura because it seemed the the shrimp and tempura were mashed into a paste inside the roll. It&apos;s ok to each their own. Pork goyza better than chicken take note please. 
Bottom line, got a delicious meal for only $46 , we would go again. Take out, not a place to dine in."
5,"They are opened! I ordered the maki platter and salmon lover (my personal favorite) and the items were ready in 15 minutes. Super quick and affordable if you&apos;re looking for cheap eats in the Chinatown area. 

You can tell they don&apos;t skimp on quality despite their low prices. The place is located in a small food court and seating is limited, so take out is probably the best choice. 

Prices are decent, prep time is QUICK! Definitely recommend if you haven&apos;t tried already!"
3,"Great outdoor dining area and great food packaging in response to the pandemic! The food, unfortunately, did not hit the spot for me personally."
4,"Quality sushi located in Chinatown.  The prices aren&apos;t as cheap as places like Avana, however the fish is 10000000x more fresh. The sushi tastes relatively fresh. There&apos;s also a diverse selection of unique and tasty Maki as well. We got take out and ordered an assortment of sushi along with a mochi maki and a sakura maki- both of which are probably two of my favorite rolls.  They also have a decent selection of warm foods (noodles, fried rice, curry, teryiaki). We tried the agadashi tofu and the beef Negima-- both of which are great.

Can&apos;t wait to come back!"
3,"Special rolls are good but the &quot;cheap&quot; rolls are cheap so you really get what your pay for.  Did takeout and next time, would stick with the special rolls as they tasted more fresh than the regular ones.  Reasonably priced so overall, 3.5 stars rounding down to 3."
3,"I had pretty low expectations for this place and they still managed to be lower than that... Or maybe it&apos;s my fault for ordering Poke Bowl here. I had countless poke bowls and so far I had one of the worst here. 

They are pretty skimpy on the toppings and it barely had any flavor. They give you soy sauce, but it didn&apos;t really mix well.

As other reviewers mentioned, I noticed service is pretty bad here. There were few customers and many employees, but none to properly direct me to pick up my order - and I just had to look around like a lost lamb even though I told them I was there for a pick up.

Giving 3 stars instead of 2 because the salmon seemed fresh and they give you some avocado."
5,I will admit at first I was hesitant about eating here it&apos;s a hard to find place with multiple little shops in the building but the food was absolutely amazing next time I visit Boston this is sure to be a place to come back to
4,"The food was decent. They delivered 4 hours early but they apologized for it so it was okay. They also gave extra desserts, which was thoughtful. The only thing that put me off was the seaweed salad - not too fresh. Other than that, the rolls are amazing!"
5,"We&apos;ll start with Rickrolling instead of Sushirolling.

We&apos;re no strangers to sushi
You know the rolls and so do I
Yum and good value&apos;s what I&apos;m thinking of
You wouldn&apos;t get that from any other Sushi place
I just wanna tell you what I&apos;m eating
Gotta make you try this place

Avana never give you up
Avana never let you down 
Avana never give you the runs
And hurt you
Avana never make you cry
Avana never say goodbye
Avana never overpriced
Or dessert you

And now for some limericks

So please write this down straight in your planner
While you suck on your boyfriend&apos;s banana
When in Chinatown
You must head right on down
And get cheap-ass sushi from Avana

It don&apos;t matter if you&apos;re a man or
A woman or even Cait Jenner
You&apos;ll love this raw fish
It&apos;ll make you its bish
And you&apos;ll keep coming back to Avana

Go to my site, click on their banner
While I&apos;m in the salon getting tanner
I&apos;m in love with these rolls
They provide #SushiGoals
So I&apos;ll always have love for Avana

If you&apos;re from the slums or from the manor
Eating here is obvi, a no-branner
And if you feel suspishy
It&apos;s because it tastes fishy
But it&apos;s so damn good tho at Avana

What.

Avana come back here as soon as possible, and Barbie might not expect much, but as Sushi tries it, she&apos;ll love it too.

What can I say about this amazing little sushi place inside the food court that hasn&apos;t already been said. We are talking about some of the best sushi I&apos;ve ever had in my life and I&apos;m not a big Sushi fan so for me to rave about sushi it has to be really good and this is really really really delicious stuff.

It&apos;s hefty and chunky and gooey and tasty and lovingly, expertly, classically put together. They really know what they&apos;re doing but they&apos;re also doing it for $5 for a roll. I mean these people are f***ing awesome.

The girl was a real sweetheart and super nice about taking my picture. She picked out her best roll from the cheaper menu for me and I enjoyed every bite and could have eaten about five more of them even though it was a very generous portion especially considering the price. I literally got full on it. But it&apos;s not the size that matters (although girls tell me it so does). It&apos;s the taste.

And this is not only the best sushi I&apos;ve had in Boston and not only the best I&apos;ve had in Massachusetts but probably my fave ever. No wonder this place has great reviews - but it should have even more. It&apos;s because it&apos;s hidden in a food court in Chinatown that people don&apos;t give it a try if they have spoons up their noses, or are afraid of the world and such.

Come and try it for yourself. It&apos;s in the same place where the Egg Puffs are so you can&apos;t go wrong. Try those too. They were serving them up long before puffles were a thing.

This is quite simply one of the best sushi restaurants I&apos;ve ever been to. I think a lot of people are all about the decor and the experience and how upscale getting Sushi can sometimes feel. I&apos;m not about any of those things. I want my food to be delicious and preferably I want it to be affordable and good value. So if someone is offering me $5 for a big amount of sushi that will actually semi fill me up then I&apos;m going to give it a try. Especially when the reviews are as amazing as these. I expected it to suck - wow, was I wrong.

I know that because they are in the little food court in Chinatown that they are able to keep their prices low for such a generally high price product. But oh my God that does not affect the quality whatsoever. In fact these are some of the best sushi rolls I&apos;ve ever had in my life. 

Not just that but the people serving them are angels and some of the nicest people that I&apos;ve had serve me up some sushi. I adore them and I will definitely be back here on a regular basis when I come back to Boston.

Not just my favourite sushi in Boston but in the top five of the best sushi I&apos;ve had in the country, possibly the best of all, and also the cheapest most affordable best value for money and some of the friendliest as well. The most unassuming, too. Talk about rewriting the rules and proving that Sushi can be a cheap street food instead of the overpriced crap that doesn&apos;t even taste as good as this that 95% of you will consume next time you eat sushi.

When you come to Boston please try this and tell me it&apos;s not some of the best you&apos;ve had. I couldn&apos;t honestly like it any more than I do. If I could give 10 Stars I would. And there&apos;s plenty of places to sit and eat even though it&apos;s in a tiny little food court.

Remember to try the Egg Puffs at the back of the court - there was a time when this was your only egg puff option and what a great option it was. In fact it was my introduction to the concept of Egg Puffs.

But let&apos;s focus on the sushi and how orgasmically good it is. By finishing with another limerick. Or should I say Lime-roll. You got Sushi-rolled.

Could have been worse, you could have been Rick Rolled. Again.

So I don&apos;t mean to sound really Douchey
Or to pressure you and come off Pushy
But when in Boston Mas"
