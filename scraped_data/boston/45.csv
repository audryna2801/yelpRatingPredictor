5,"Years ago, maybe 25, I took my oldest son and 3 of his Boston college buddies here. For maybe $20 bucks they stuffed their faces. It was like I was Rockefeller.
Fast forward to covid19 it&apos;s still a deal. Excellent pizza. Same guy behind the counter, but we&apos;ve both aged a bit. What hasn&apos;t changed is the outstanding Italian food.
I&apos;ve brought people here for years now. They all love the joint.
You stand in line with social distancing and masks. 
You can also call in your order."
5,"Ran here during my lunch hour to get Sicilian slices. $2 a square is a great deal - we got 4 to share and it&apos;s a perfect lunch for 2 people. They also carry arrancini and different flavors of calzone. They&apos;re open til about 2pm so it&apos;s a lunch only kind of place.

They don&apos;t accept tips - but I wish they did. They do a great job."
5,"Came back again because I had to be back in Boston to pick up my daughter from college. I could not resist the call of Galleria Umberto. This time I got the rice balls in addition to 1/2 tray of pizza. 

So they open at 11 but there were already people inside and lined up to get food at 10:45. So I went in and since the line was so long for walk-ins, I decided to call in my order and get on the takeout line. Bad move. The line was moving faster (a relative term in GU time) on the walk-in line. Next time I&apos;m going on the walk-in line. Clearly the regulars have figured this out. 

So the rice balls. They were delicious! I did read some reviews that people didn&apos;t like them. Personally, I thought they were yummy. Plenty of meat with peas and sauce. Nice ratio or rice to meat and perfectly seasoned. 

The pizza was sublime again. I tried to pay attention to what I loved so much about the flavor the second time around and I think it&apos;s the hint of oregano you get in the sauce. This is old school pizza at its best. Greasy but not too greasy. I&apos;m trying to figure how they make their crust so light even though it&apos;s a Sicilian pizza. Perhaps they proof their dough a little longer. It&apos;s almost a Grandma&apos;s pizza. Again, best Sicilian I&apos;ve ever had. I inhaled my first slice!

Set your expectation to wait, bring a book, bring a friend, bring your cash. Sooooo good."
4,"Once you reach the northern part of the city, you will definitely have time to work up an appetite. And just in time. This part of Boston is called Little Italy for a reason. There are Italian restaurants for every taste and color. I recommend Galleria Umberto. Here you will find a real Sicilian pizza at the most affordable price. Only $2 for a huge slice. For dessert, take the delicious Arancini rice balls"
5,"Pre-COVID-19 review: I came here after working a long night shift, and I think I was the first customer of the day. I had to wait for the first pizza to finish cooking, but I sat down and soon the very nice old man at the counter was sliding a plate of molten hot pizza in front of me. I&apos;m a thin-crust gal, but even I thought this was excellent. Everything was in perfect balance, between the crust, sauce, and cheese, and it was done so right. For $2, it was a great deal, and the size leaves plenty of room to sample more food around the North End (or an arancini which I didn&apos;t feel like waiting around for that day). This place feels authentically North End in a way that the ritzy newer Italian restaurants don&apos;t. Definitely make it a stop on your North End eating tour."
4,"I would give this place a five if it were based on just the pizza! 

I finally went to Galleria Umberto for the first time and I am so happy I did! I went on a rainy COVID afternoon around 1:30 and they thankfully had not run out pizza! I got myself a slice ($2) and arancini ($3.75). I ate the pizza right away and brought the arancini home to eat later (by heating it up in the air fryer)

The pizza was absolutely amazing for the price. The dough was the perfect balance of crispy and doughy, tomato sauce was flavorful, and the amount of cheese was perfect! I loved that it wasn&apos;t too salty either. I was warned by other helpers that the pizza is greasy so I had my napkins ready! What would&apos;ve made this even more perfect is for it to be warmed up more so the cheese could be ooey gooey and a healthy amount of red pepper flakes. However, it was amazing as it is and you just can&apos;t beat the price.

My problem was with the arancini. I personally did not like the meat and the peas. It made the arancini a little too salty and the risotto itself did not have much flavor. The biggest problem was that I found a long strand of hair inside the arancini. 

Despite the arancini, I know I will be coming back here when I crave a good greasy cheap pizza!"
4,Best pizza I had today. Honestly nothing I&apos;ll remember in a few days but the  pizza was ok. You certainly can&apos;t beat the price in the North End. 2 slices and a can of soda for under $6.
4,"We stopped in here around 11:45am on a Saturday in February. There were about 15 people in line in front of us and the line took about that long, 15 minutes, which was somewhat surprising to me. Kinda thought it would be a little quicker since everything is already cooked. 

When it was my turn we got 2 slices and a spinach &amp; cheese calzone, and a pepsi.  It was $10.45 - can&apos;t beat the prices.  I wanted to try pretty much everything but we were making multiple stops in the area for a little food tour. 

The pizza was good but not wait in line for much longer than I did good. The line got a lot worse before we left. The spinach and cheese calzone was okay in my opinion but my girlfriend liked it. I guess all the good pizza in my home area made it not seem too memorable. 

They had arancini, pizzette, paninis and panzarotti as well -- all cheap prices. 

The staff are excellent and they move very fast, it&apos;s just that there were 2 guys doing the counter for an endless line. One was doing to go orders which were massive like 10 slices and whatnot. 

I wouldn&apos;t go out of my way to come back but I do want to try the arancini sometime."
4,"The pizza here is pretty good.

It&apos;s your typical Sicilian pizza. The cheese is nice. The dough and the sauce are both okay. They taste like they are kind of missing something, like herbs in the sauce or salt in the dough. I&apos;m not sure, but I&apos;ve had better.

My favorite Sicilian pizza place of all time in the area was Victor&apos;s in Ball Square. The dough was so soft and fluffy. It was amazing. I&apos;m sad that it closed.

Umberto&apos;s is sort of tucked in the North End as are most places, but it&apos;s kind of like you&apos;re going down into the basement or something. The environment would be more exciting without COVID, but with it, it&apos;s okay. It&apos;s a lunch spot. The key at Umberto&apos;s is to call ahead to not have to wait too long in line.

I ate a piece on day two, and it stays tasty. I would definitely recommend this place, but don&apos;t go out of your way or expect to have your mind blown."
5,"Best cheese pizza in Boston! Every time I come here.. it is almost always crowded! During the summer time, there would be a line out the door.  I have tried the Sicilian cheese slice and arancini. The slice is filled with a lot of cheese and ONLY cost 2 dollars. You can&apos;t go wrong with that price point especially when the pizza is fresh from the oven. It is definitely bang for your buck! The burnt mark of the cheese adds a nice charcoal flavor and  the tomato sauce is not too sour or too sweet. In regards to the arancini, it was okay. The peas and meat was decent and the outer shell was very crunchy.  When getting the slice for take out, the workers put it in a nice cardboard box  with a string  tied around it. I notice that the store also sells calzone and I will definitely try it the next time I come here.  

TIP: Make sure to get at least three Sicilian cheese slice.. you won&apos;t regret it! Also the store only accepts cash 

Fun Fact: Galleria umberto won an award from the prestigious James Beard foundation in 2018"
4,"Great pizza, cheesy and not too much sauce. Relaxed atmosphere. Definitely one of the cheaper gems in the Italian district. Arancini was interesting - meat, cheese and peas. Good prices. Pizza slice $2, water $1, rice ball $3.75. Inside seating available currently."
5,"This spot was recommended by a friend who&apos;s a Boston native. All I can say is WOW. I&apos;ve been eating the fake stuff all my life cuz this is the real deal!!! It was delicious that I can&apos;t even describe it. 

When we got there, the line was up to the door and by the time we left, it was just longer but it&apos;s moving. There&apos;s just a lot of people in line for their Arancini balls and pizza. Highly recommend this place!!!!"
3,"I like the old-school charm of this place, but the food didn&apos;t really stand out.

I got a slice of their pizza and wasn&apos;t very impressed: the crust wasn&apos;t very crispy and I thought that the cheese to sauce ratio was a bit off. A little disappointing given how big a fan I am of the square slice and the hype reviews for this place.

Will say though, given that it only set me back $2 and the service was friendly, I&apos;ve made worse decisions in my life."
4,"Last month, my friend and I went here for lunch. There was a long queue of about 20 people but the line moved pretty quickly. I got two Sicilian cheese slices and a spinach and cheese calzone. Although a bit burnt, the cheese slices were cheesy, airy and crispy.  Very yummy! You can&apos;t beat a $1.85 Sicilian slice.

The spinach and cheese calzone for $5 was also warm and tasty. If you want a good quality lunch under $10, I highly recommend this place."
5,"Yeah, it really doesn&apos;t get better than this, 10 stars! A must try before you die food spot. If your visiting Boston&apos;s Italian North End, you got to eat here.

Cheese Sicilian style square slices of pizza nirvana. Once it&apos;s gone, it&apos;s gone. They do not make more. The doors close for next days business. I suggest you get there around 10-11am lines form fast. 

TIP: Order extra slices, it&apos;s so worth it. under $2 a slice.

Try at least 1 of everything on their simple menu. I also suggest you get more than one of their Arincini rice balls stuffed with meat &amp; cheese. It&apos;s kinda like getting shepherds pie in a fried rice ball, So Good!

Things to know before you go: - Cash Only, Closes around 3pm, Lines can get long, It&apos;s worth the wait, Order Extra &quot;Trust Me&quot;

Galleria Umberto is wheelchair accessible, no power door so you will need to bring help. Staff is super, super nice. The Food is insanely awesome. You would be hard pressed to find a top notch old school family run eatery like this anywhere. 

No More Words, just go there and stuff your face! 

&quot;It&apos;s your world, Eat It&quot;"
5,"OMG!!! I will start off by telling you a story from my visit. STORY TIME 

Im standing in this very very long line and Im a little curious because the menu says slices are $1.90... and Im wondering what an arancini is.... and then I order.. Like a million slices and im waiting to pick them up at the counter. When the man behind the counter motions at someone standing behind me. No doubt the dude behind me is a little awkward looking- but Im friendly so whatev&apos;s... I move out of the way so they can talk and I can ear hustle. So baby I realize this dude is speaking some deep language.. its a little harsh and I can tell its not English... ITS ITALIAN!!! The dude was completely skipping the line and now he was ordering in actual Italian and the slices were $1.90. EPIC 

SO the pizza was so good and garlicky!!!! The cheese was soft and flavorful - I opted out of the Arancini ( too many slices) and devoured some 3-4 slices... I literally love the atmosphere.. its like old world Italian meets a cafeteria."
4,"Mama Mia, that&apos;s good pan pizza!! And at $1.90 a slice, you can&apos;t beat it with a stick!! Mangia! Mangia!"
5,My father has been eating here since he was young living in the North End and I&apos;ve been eating it since I was born! I&apos;m 34 now and still find myself craving it all the time! It&apos;s like a special treat to drive into Boston for this lunch! I&apos;m currently pregnant and I&apos;d eat a rice ball everyday for the rest of my pregnancy if I could
5,"There&apos;s only one Galleria Umberto! Serving locals, tourists, professionals and just about everyone else.   Everything  has been said about it all underexaggerated! You just can&apos;t explain how great it is and how that family has endured ages of top dog Italian food for the masses! Wish I was there right now!! Yum, Yum, Yum! Did I mention the great basic red wine perfect for mixing with your favorite soda...a wine cooler to share with your significant other or friends."
5,"Do you want an affordable slice of pizza? For $2 (cash only) come grab a slice of their sicilian style square cheese pizza. No frills. What you see is what you get here. Hearty slice, very thick with an unbelievably flavorful tomato sauce. Delightful snack."
