5,"First time going to the Newbury location &amp; the quality is consistent to the times I have frequented other Thinking Cup locations.  The food is very good &amp; has fairly decent prices.  Amazing caf√©.

My go-to: Quiche w/ spinach, mushroom, &amp; roasted red pepper havarti served with arugula salad ($6.95).  Amazing as always- I love the texture and it tastes really fresh.  I have also tried the fruit tart at other locations and it is amazing!

Note: I would recommend getting your food to-go at this location as it gets fairly busy, and it definitely doesn&apos;t feel as safe during COVID as a mainly sit-down restaurant.  Hard to social distance in such a small location but the restaurant employees all seem to be wearing masks and taking necessary precautions."
5,"A friend recommended this coffee shop to me, very cute place on Newberry street !! I ordered a Hazelnut Latte and customized my own breakfast sandwich on a croissant. The food was very good and decently priced !! Their Hazelnut lattes are just happiness in a cup!! 
Loved their staff, the girls were super nice and welcoming. They were extremely carefully handling my order, noticed they changed their gloves twice.Too bad they only had 4 tables available for indoor seating but the weather was nice enough for me to sit for few minutes on the patio and finish my latte !! Heard their syrups are made In-House, definitely coming back for more!!"
5,"This have been my to go place during COVID , I am so happy they stayed open and kept serving delicious coffee drinks. My favorite hazelnut latte helped me go through tough days . I always get BALT sandwich for lunch and French macaron for dessert . Thank you thinking cup for helping us getting through that difficult time"
1,"Someone earlier made a review about their cashier-- let me assure you, that cashiers name is Karen. (Legit her real name... I even called a few hours after my visit and asked for Karen and she exists!)
Any who. Karen is the worst. We came up to put in an order (with no one in line behind us) and Karen straight up had a huge attitude, (I asked if they had the Salmon bagel still, and she said on the menu behind you-- they have like 6 chalkboards behind us, give me a break.) she would talk back to me when I asked her a question about our order, and then rolled her eyes when I asked for a stamp card. 

After receiving my stamp card (we bought two espresso drinks) she only stamped it once. I politely asked to get a second stamp -- to which my response was her snagging the card from me and stamping another hole as she rolled her eyes, puffed and walked away. 
Btw: you get a stamp per espresso drink. 

IMMEDIATELY after that she walks up to the barista and tells her about us (because immediately the barista looked over the espresso maker to look at us)... then this barista told another barista about us.
FYI college girls, when you two are whispering and both looking at someone, we know what&apos;s going on. 

Anywho, very unprofessional. Rude. And quite honestly your coffee is no longer worth my time being treated so rudely. (Earlier that morning we had rude service at their Tremont location). 

Boston has plenty other coffee options, bye thinking cup. 
Nothing to think about here, I&apos;m not coming back."
1,"I love Thinking Cup&apos;s staff and their coffee - and it is for this reason that i am so disappointed 
 that ownership allows the cafe to get so crowded. 


This is a basement-level, mostly WINDOWLESS, 
space. There are no signs of social distancing measures or capacity lowering.


Owners, please invest in a curbside pick up option and stop putting your employees and customers at risk. You will make more money and inspire more loyalty by taking the creative and tech-forward approach that businesses like Clover and 7 Pond Coffee Bar have."
2,"We usually avoid this place except for brunch a couple of times with tourist friends that wanted to see Newbury St. The food here is mediocre and unmemorable.

I read rave reviews of their French hot chocolate so went to try it recently. Took one sip, and immediately, regret washed over me. I was hit with grainy cocoa powder instead of silky smooth chocolate. Definitely not at all how decent hot chocolate should be. I am so confused by all the reviews that say it tastes like a melted chocolate bar because mine in no way resembled that.

I hate wasting food though, so I took it home, where I grabbed half a bar of Trader Joe&apos;s 85% dark Peruvian chocolate that I melted and added to this cup of disappointment. It improved the drink by 1000% but was obviously a hassle. Suffice it to say, if you find yourself on Newbury craving hot chocolate, do yourself a favor and go to Burdick&apos;s across the street."
4,"Good coffee, GREAT banana bread, and decent bagels. All locations are great but I go here most often. We made a video about our latest experience where we rated just their bagels:)

5,deliciously rich cappuccino! probably the best one of i&apos;ve had and their selection of non-dairy milks are both wide and high quality (they use Oatly for oat milk).
5,I was in search for some good coffee in the city and I stumbled upon this cute little place in town. Got the cappuccino and the cheesecake. I had a great experience and I would love to come back in the future.
2,"I&apos;ve been coming here since 08 after I graduated from northeastern, but man did I walk into the right place? Like the other reviews... why isn&apos;t this place covid safe? How does a busy coffeeshop like that not care about their customers or employees? The other reviews are true the manager/barista there has a massive attitude problem. Looks like they left the miserable manager there with a few new clueless employees that made me so mad I walked right out."
3,"A-OK is accurate. I wandered in here on my way out of town, bags in hand, looking for a decent hot cup of something caffeinated before my flight home to Seattle. I grabbed a chai and a gluten free pumpkin donut to stay as seasonally appropriate as possible. There weren&apos;t any patrons in front of my in line. I felt extremely rushed by the person at the register to read their menu. They were curt and signed and rolled their eyes when I asked questions. Wouldn&apos;t be back due to the crappy service.

The chai was good, and the donut was too. I sat and did some writing and people watching. The space is loud as hell and very cramped, but would otherwise have been enjoyable. My apologies to the person taking orders for existing!"
3,"I&apos;m a bit of a coffee snob, but the coffee isn&apos;t what I&apos;m critiquing today. The coffee was fine, but one of the cashiers was unprofessional and rude. I&apos;m making this review on behalf of a good friend because she wasn&apos;t even the one to serve me. She called &quot;next&quot; but my friend didn&apos;t hear, making her call &quot;next&quot; one or two more times. When my friend snapped into realization, the cashier looked at her co-worker, rolled her eyes, and shook her head. I&apos;m sorry, but if you want to talk trash, do it after the customer leaves. Luckily, my cashier was lovely. She complimented my outfit and informed me about her favorite drink (honey cinnamon latte with oat milk). I guess there&apos;s 1 good person for every bad person."
4,"The fruit tart in this place was perfect! There was no glaze on top, which let my taste buds enjoy the sweetness of the cream with the tartness of the fruits. The macarons are out of this world as well! They are perfectly moist. I will say that the environment is loud with dim lighting, and customer service did not deliver. I did not feel welcome, even after trying to be charming, the woman that took my order just seemed like she wanted to get the order done with. I would return here for the pastries, but not for anything else."
4,"I made the long walk to get to Thinking Cup as it was rated high on YELP and I was in search of a great cup of latte.

There were only a few people online and a few seated at Thinking Cup. The place is very welcoming with nice interior. There is a nice selection of pastries and morning pastries on display. I ordered a decaf oat milk latte, a bagel and yogurt parfait.

The coffee was by far one of the best I have tried in Boston. The flavor was rich and tasty, and the mixture with oat milk was perfect. The bagel was OK and nothing special about it. The parfait was absolutely delicious and the Greek yogurt was absolutely the best, rich with a great taste. Will definitely be back when I am in town."
1,"Though I hate to write a poor review during covid I really don&apos;t feel bad for this location because of how many times I have been greeted by a rude cashier/barista whatever you want to call it. It&apos;s almost as if these employees are trained to be rude to customers. Honestly nasty people and I won&apos;t be coming here again, which is a shame because the coffee is actually okay."
4,"London fog was excellent--thick and frothy and not too sweet. 5 stars for that one. Macarons were meh though--3 stars. My sister and I tried lavender and hazelnut macarons, and they weren&apos;t as good as others we&apos;ve had. Too cakey, moist, and sweet, not light and airy."
4,"This coffee shop is super cute and the street it&apos;s located on is really nice. 

Was brought here after dinner, and they were still busy even though they closed in about 30 minutes. The menu is posted up on the walll and they have a variety of items. 

I ended up ordering a matcha tea latte with soy milk and my friend had a vanilla cappuccino. The cashier unfortunately wasn&apos;t friendly, and looked mad she was there...

The drinks were made quick and the barista was pretty friendly when he handed me my drink. 

We sat down for about 10 minutes. The tables are interesting as they have old newspaper articles on them. The drinks were good. I loved my latte. My friends cappuccino was also pretty good. 

The inside is comfy and it was definitely a perfect ending to a rainy date night."
5,Amazing place! Busy when we wEnt but had a great atmosphere. There is no signal for the phone or WiFi available. Fast service and staff was nIce.
5,"I really like this place for coffee on Newbury St. It&apos;s a very cozy interior and a good amount of outdoor seating for people watching. Delicious coffee, sweets, snacks and small meals."
4,"Very cool little cafe. Charming. This places gets busy. Good coffee  and a nice selection of pastries and baked goods. 

I stopped in just after lunch to warm up and the place Waage pretty crowded. Lots of people working on computers and some chatting. It was a good little vibe. 

I just had a mocha and a macaroon but it was good."
