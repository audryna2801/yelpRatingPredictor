5,Came here with a friend for a drink on the first night it opened. There was an employee waiting to greet us at the door we did a quick covid questionnaire and he showed us to the downstairs bar. I asked for a Moscow mule and they brought me a drink that was similar although I forgot the name it was delicious.
5,"Literally amazing. The ppl are SO CHILL. The food? SO FUCKING GOOD. We got the apple empanadas - I hate apple pie/ but I LOVEDDD THIS. I&apos;m not kidding. And the shots were served in fancy ass wine type glasses! My boyfriend and I came here from the equinox roof top patio - and we both agreed that this place is better. DELICIOUS drinks, AMAZING service. I&apos;m not even kidding. And the prices are great. 10/10!!!!"
5,"Have been a longtime regular and I&apos;m so happy to have them back. They have their new seating/capacity standards down, and it&apos;s a really easy and safe experience. And there&apos;s sometimes patio seating availability! We sampled the new menu last week -- pretzel with cheese and mustard is a new fave, and the grilled cheese is decadent perfection. We missed this crew (and their old fashioneds!)"
5,"Stopped here for the drinks and their cheeseburger.  I had got there right at opening time at 4:00 pm.  This place is in a basement, just so you know, because if you don&apos;t know that, you will miss it when you&apos;re looking for it.

So, I didn&apos;t see anything on their drink menu I wanted, but once I described that I was a gin guy and that I wanted something refreshing, the bartender knew exactly what to make me and let me tell you, it was worth every penny.  These drinks were not only tasty, they were really strong, again, worth every penny.  I had 3 of them, :)  I should of just had two, but they were SO good!, haha!

Anywho, I ordered two double cheeseburgers and fries, (which are enough two people) to go and I have to say, they were SO good!!  The fries were cooked perfectly and the burgers were juicy and had great flavor.  If you want to get you some great drinks and great burgers and fries, then you have to make a stop here at Drink.  You won&apos;t regret it."
4,"Lovely drinks and atmosphere but frequently insane wait times (even after being &quot;seated&quot; inside). Back in February, I waited around an hour to get in, then stood at a standing area for another 30 minutes before a server came over. During this time, multiple people who came in after me were assisted by other servers... Not sure if my server was just having a night, but this definitely made my experience a bit more aggravating.

Otherwise, I&apos;ve loved Drink most times I&apos;ve been there. The bartenders rock. They&apos;ve put up with my goofy requests of a &quot;pretty-looking drink&quot; (see below: a purple foamy drink with hearts). The food is pretty overpriced but the fries are decent. I wouldn&apos;t recommend the deviled eggs, though... for $8, you deserve more than 2-3 half eggs."
5,"Vibes | Impressive | Popular

VIBES: So, I went to grad school from 2010 - 2012 and drink was always one of &quot;the spots&quot;, I was in town for a conference and wanted to see if it was still a I remembered, and it was as good if not better. The vibe is perfect for that young professional under 40 crowd that wants to hear good music at a level where you can hold a conversation. It&apos;s the idea location to chat with friends, go on a date, or chill with friends and try to meet people. 

IMPRESSIVE: The key to Drink is they don&apos;t have a drink menu. You show up and describe a feeling, a region of the world, a base liquor, a type of flavor, etc. and the mixologist makes a drink. For example, &quot;back in the day&quot; I used to say a city (Paris, London, New Orleans, Madrid, Seoul) and the mixologist would make a drink that fits the place.  This time I just wanted remixes of Moscow Mule. So they made a citrus version with tequila and a grapefruit version with vodka. It&apos;s the only place I&apos;ve ever been like it. 

Popular: given how cool the vibe and custom drinks are ... it&apos;s always packed. We showed up at 7 and got lucky we only had to wait 5 minutes to get in. When we left at 9, there was a line with 20-25 people waiting to get in. While it&apos;s popular, it isn&apos;t a TOO PACKED. They do a great job of controlling the flow of people in and out to keep it so that people can move around without pumping in to people. 

Pro tip: grab a drink at drink then go upstairs and get dinner at their sister/brotha restaurant. 

Pro tip: GET THE FRIES! they are amazing a surprisingly feeling. They are cut thick and long and have the perfect amount of salt and seasoning."
5,"I am already planning on my next visit to Drink and it honestly cannot wait to come back. Located downstairs under Sportello, the space has 2 bars with seating as well as a couple of tall tables. 

This place is known for creating their own drinks, so you tell them what your preferences are and they make the magic happen. If you prefer whiskey - they got you covered there too.
 
They also have a pretty good variety for bar food. Highlight for me was the duck taco&apos;s and the burger . Also ordered their devilled eggs, chicken wings and steak tartare, which were all well presented and great for sharing. 

Service was spot on too with the bartenders checking in, keeping water glasses topped off and keeping the food flowing."
5,"What can I say about Drink other than that it is amazing. You show up, and there&apos;s no menu to be had. You literally tell the waitress whatever you want. It can be anything from color (I literally said my favorite color) to a very specific cocktail, and you let the bartenders cook up whatever they desire.  There are no prices, and no ingredients. Every drink is a surprise, and every drink that we had was consistently delicious despite our obscure requests (one of my friends said that they wanted something for bedtime, and they came out with a sweet, creamy milk cocktail that hit the spot). Love this place, and encouraged me to explore mixology."
5,"I came here recently with a local friend while in Boston for a conference. I had more or less been doing a Barbara Lynch restaurant tour, and the speakeasy style of this place really caught my eye. I showed up a bit before meeting my friend to try to get us a table because I heard that the line could get quite long. Fortunately, at that time, there was no line, although the inside was already fairly crowded. By the time she arrived, a line had formed, but we were able to get seated without waiting too long.

I am a ridiculously huge fan of any place that makes custom cocktails based off of your preferences. I think our bartender did an excellent job of crafting us both cocktails that reflected our personality and preferences. I am trying to get into bourbon, and he made my friend a whiskey libation that was out of this world (obviously I tried it) and made me a spicy tequila-based drink that I really enjoyed. 

We ordered some different appetizers, like the Wagyu burger and fries, lamb merguez nachos, and grilled cheese, and it was all surprisingly a lot of food. The lamb nachos were the bomb, to do a throwback to the 90s. The burger was the perfect size for sharing and was cooked just right at medium. We thought they would just be small sample sizes, but it was definitely a full meal and we couldn&apos;t even finish it all.

It was pretty loud on the inside, although the ceilings aren&apos;t all that high, so it makes sense that there is a bit of an echo in some places. The overall vibe is pretty casual but nice at the same time, which is just the way I like it.

Long live Drink!"
4,"As soon as I got through the initial chilly greeting, I had a great time at Drink.  A few friends and I hung out here a while back and sat at the bar.  I highly recommend doing so as you get a front row seat to the mixologists creating their masterpieces.

I had several drinks which I do not recommend if you are on a tight budget, but I assure whatever you order it will be delicious.

I started with something vodka then went to bourbon.  Each time I gave a few other ingredients I enjoy the taste of and voila!  A unique drink made especially for me.

Although I shared that I wasn&apos;t a fan of sweet drinks, there definitely was simple syrup in each one, which gave me the sugar jitters and kept me up all night, but I got through it and felt each one was quite tasty."
4,"If you are indecisive, this place is for you. This place is a great change of scene for a Friday night. To start off, if you have not heard of this place you&apos;ll probably miss it on an uber drive over. If you do find it make your way downstairs and be amazed. I arrived and was asked several questions leading to the most perfect drink I didn&apos;t know I needed in the moment. My friends and I loved how enthusiastic our mixologist was and how each and every one of us thoroughly enjoyed our drink. Overall, the experience is very different compared to other bars in the area and I highly recommend this as your next stop in Boston. Each drink was about $14/$15!"
2,"How it works:
You tell the bartender what kind of drink you like (ie, light and fruity etc). Each drink is $13 for a small martini size drink.

The food:
I ordered deviled eggs and some hummus dish. I wish they put more veggies bc the hummus made 80% of the dish. Deviled eggs were pretty standard, nothing special.

Service:
Our bartender was a bit rude...my friend said that bartenders are rude bc that&apos;s the &quot;vibe&quot; of the bar. Even so, it took forever to get him so we could order food. We ended up eating elsewhere after we couldn&apos;t get him for second rounds of food. There weren&apos;t even a lot of people...he was just going to the other side talking to the other bartenders."
5,"The BEST ramos gin fizz i have ever had, to this day. The bar tenders are super nice, and very friendly as well. A well designed space, it&apos;s essentially everyone sitting in a large square around the bartenders in the center, with a space that probably gets busier as the night goes on. We went early on in the afternoon (around 5:30 pm on a weekend), and did not have to wait to go in. The ambiance was nice, quiet with easy conversation to hear and to have, and I would definitely go again if I were in the area."
5,"Love Love this place.

The absolute best cocktail bar in Boston. Came here with some friends on Saturday night and had an incredible time. The line was long but it moved pretty quick. We were escorted to spot near the bar where we were greeted immediately by a bartender. He asked us what we like and all three drinks he knocked it out of the park.  My friend also got the fries and man they were good. 

The drinks are expensive but absolutely worth it.

We will be back!!!"
1,"COVID UPDATE they just opened last week but honestly... they shouldn&apos;t have. I called first to see if they were open and the guy was very rude laughing very unprofessional, but whatever you know i wanna go to drink.


We get there, its NOT THE SAME EXPERIENCE AT ALL. Everyone is rude, on edge, unprepared and ive been here many times before. They didn&apos;t explain how their process worked, were very unfriendly... and didnt listen to anything I said I preferred my drinks to tAste like. I said &quot;no sweet drinks&quot; and they brought me sweet drinks.... i said i like stronger drinks and they didnt even fix it. How can you make the same drink wrong twice??

I asked for an espresso martini for my 3rd drink... they don&apos;t have them... then i asked for an old fashioned and they didn&apos;t even put the old fashioned classic cherry in it. Get it together drink. Don&apos;t open unless you have all the supplies. We are not paying for 50% of your service. Give us the full 100.

Long story short. This place is not ready to be open. They opened unprepared without supplies, and everyone had a stick up their boooooty hole for some reason which is shocking compared to the service you would usually receive here. Its sad and non-respectable for an establishment I used to rave about. After this, i don&apos;t think i can come back. Wait for YVONNEs to open and just go there. yvonnes probably is Not open yet cause they don&apos;t feel ready, this place opened back up way to soon. They were not ready and they&apos;ve lost 3 regular customers. 

NOT worth our tab and extremely disappointed. Its not the same place it used to be."
5,"Drink was a definitely a treat while visiting Boston &amp; relatively close to my hotel. I could tell that Drink was a popular place due to line on a Saturday but don&apos;t let that discourage you. The wait was relatively quick even for a party of 2 no longer than 20 mins. If you venture out solo like me, you can get seated in less than 5mins. 

I was escorted to a seat at the bar, where the bartender greeted me &amp; offered a menu listing beer, wine, &amp; a few food options to compliment the drinks. Now for the fun part...... the cocktails are bartender&apos;s choice based on your personal preference. You can kept it simple or if you&apos;re daring, let the bartender go wild. I did just that &amp; was not disappointed at all!! I enjoyed 3 well crafted cocktails that each with were more complex than the last one. My favorite was my third cocktail called &quot;Little Italy&quot;. I will definitely go again on my next visit &amp; highly recommended!!

Few tips from my bartender for solo guest or for those who would like a more intimate experience, Sundays &amp; Mondays are the best time to visit."
4,"I come here every time im in Boston, my favorite bar. The whole wait with no option for a reservation thing is a bit old, but its a good thing i don&apos;t come here when its super late since im older ;) 

They have excellent quality food and drinks. And once you&apos;re seated every bartender is always excellent, friendly, and skilled.

The problem does come in when you don&apos;t order something you know and they try and create something for you. They all essentially taste about the same, no matter what you ask for, so...

Anyway, i still really like the ambiance, the service after youre seated and the quality of their food and cocktails. Speakeasy style places are always on my list versus divy bars and clubs."
4,"This is a really fun place to go if you&apos;re looking for something a little more low-key and sophisticated. 

The bartenders are incredibly talented. Basically, you tell them the type of flavors/style of drink you are craving and they create a masterpiece for you! Every drink we had was absolutely delicious. The atmosphere was pretty quiet when we first showed up, but quickly became busy as the night went on. 

Only recommendation is to make it easier to find. (perhaps a sign or an arrow)"
5,"This is probably the coolest bar in Boston. You will probably have to wait to get in, but it&apos;s worth it. Even if you get in, you might have to wait to sit -- there are plenty of standing only spots. There&apos;s no menu which is really cool so the bartenders will come up to you and make whatever you want. You can even give them a mood and they&apos;ll craft something to fit that. It was a really fun experience and I will definitely be back!

If you can get a spot seated at the bar definitely take it as it&apos;s super fun to watch the bartenders make drinks and ask them questions about what they&apos;re making. They are always interested in teaching patrons about mixology!"
2,I found this spot on a list of cool places to have a drink in Boston and I was exceptionally underwhelmed. The music was so loud I couldn&apos;t hear my husband sitting next to me. Drinks are $15 each and I had arguably the worst margarita I&apos;ve ever had (and I&apos;m a big margarita fan.) It has a speak-easy type vibe but overall I would skip it and go somewhere more enjoyable for drinks.
