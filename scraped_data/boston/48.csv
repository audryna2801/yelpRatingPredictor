5,"My new fianc√© and I had dinner at our favorite seafood restaurant in Boston, B&amp;G, the first night of reopening during the pandemic in 2021. Unbeknownst to me, my boyfriend at the time, gave them a heads up about it being a special night for the two of us. 

When we walked in, we were warmly greeted, and given champagne to celebrate our engagement that had just happened literally minutes before walking in. The wait staff and hostess were so sweet and congratulated us multiple times throughout our meal. 

The food, as always, was absolutely incredible! We had oysters, calamari, baked lobster, a simple salad and seafood stew. I added a picture of the seafood tower we enjoyed last time bc it&apos;s literally the most amazing thing, ever! If you&apos;re looking for local seafood done right, this is the place! 

We ended the night with another surprise! Complementary dessert (to go!) to again celebrate our engagement. This was a wonderful way to end the meal and once again, everyone there made the night feel special. I can&apos;t thank these people enough for being a part of that night. I will remember it forever and B&amp;G will continue to be our favorite place to not only celebrate big milestones but also when we want the best seafood in the city! 

All safety measures were taken in the restaurant as well. Everyone took safety very seriously. There was hand sanitizer at every table and overall we felt very safe yet comfortable throughout the meal. Please support this restaurant! They do to go orders, which we will likely do as well, and everyone there works so hard to accommodate the best they can during these times."
5,"What a lovely establishment! I really really wanted oysters for my 30th birthday and was having a lot of trouble finding a place that could deliver them to me (or do takeout) last minute. I finally found this place and was able to get two dozen unshucked oysters delivered to me with all the sauces! 

We had to learn how to shuck ourselves but it was cool to learn a new skill and also get to finally enjoy some tasty oysters. So grateful I was able to get the appetizer spread I wanted on my special day! Will definitely come in person to try their yummy seafood in the future."
5,"I visited B&amp;G Oysters on a warm day last weekend and really enjoyed their outdoor dining experience! Our waitress was very kind and welcoming, and there were many COVID-19 precautions in place.

We tried oysters (I don&apos;t remember the two types, but one was especially tasty--really plump and almost sweet), and I ordered a Maine Lobster Roll. The lobster roll was chock-full of large pieces of lobster, and the sides it came with were so good! The thin fries were my favorite kind (crispy with a soft interior and well-salted), and I was surprised to find myself eating the addictive coleslaw on its own.

The restaurant has a lovely vibe. The planter near the entrance of the restaurant is filled with oyster shells! There is also a super cute wall of dog photos, and I saw the host trying to snag a photo of a distracted Scottie with a large film camera :)

There are limits on how many diners can enter the restaurant to use the restroom, which is down a tight set of stairs (not accessibility-friendly). I appreciated all of the COVID-19 precautions being taken--our waitress wore a mask the whole time, the menu is online, limited indoor capacity, etc.

I would definitely recommend B&amp;G Oysters for a nice meal!"
4,"Yep ..
. this place is the real deal - fried oysters - melt iN your mouth goodness with a light, airy, crisp batter. Tartar sauce served in the ouster shell is a brilliant hack, while avoiding the oyster to air n sauce &amp; become soggy - genius!

Fish &amp; chips were ok, could have used a smidge more salt, seared scallops over the sweet potato puree absolutely delicious .. crabcakes were crabby - nit a bunch of filler - think low carb high protein served  in a cream sauce with clams bacon &amp; spinach/broccolini -admittedly I don&apos;t recall.. 

Outdoor seating excellent service &amp; awesome South End vibe."
4,"Pricey for lunch during the week, even by Boston standards, but very good. We came here for lunch on a weekday during the pandemic. Make sure to make a reservation on open table if you want to sit outside. The scallops were fantastic as was the panna cotta for desert. We also had the shrimp cocktail which was good."
5,"Thanks B&amp;G not only for the best lobster roll in Boston, but for taking the time to pack your delivery properly so it&apos;s just as delicious at home.  

Seriously, the best delivery experience I&apos;ve had during the pandemic.  I can&apos;t wait to come in when all this is over. Huge thanks!!!"
4,"Made reservations on OpenTable an hour in advance. Only outside seating available unless a high table requested at time of reservation. The menu is limited, but I actually favor that. Come for the seafood, don&apos;t expect to see chicken tenders or burgers. 

We started with a side of fries and ketchup for my five-year-old (not exactly a kid friendly menu) and two of each for the oysters (10 total). All fresh, however our waitress dropped the card and didn&apos;t bring a new one so we really didn&apos;t know origin of the oysters. No biggie, still delicious. My husband and I then shared the hamachi crudo and the seared scallops and octopus. I realllly enjoyed the hamachi crudo, you could taste a hint of coconut but it was so light and refreshing. 

Overall, it&apos;s a nice place and staff was friendly. They didn&apos;t linger too long and make you feel uncomfortable. We had sparkling water, which they brought out a large bottle and left it for us to self serve. Amid COVID times, this was heaven. Parking garage is a few minutes down the street so that was a plus."
3,"I&apos;m a bit of an oyster and lobster roll snob. So, this might not be the review that every restaurant patron would pen. Take it with a grain of (sea) salt. 

Let me preface with the fact that, we had a lovely dinner. It was a bit on the quiet side since we went on a random Monday night, and we had a great spot by the kitchen where we could watch all the action. Love that! 

The oysters and shrimp cocktail we had were fine, but I wasn&apos;t impressed in comparison to the price/quality/size/selection of equivalent items at Row 34. 

As for the lobster roll itself... 
- There&apos;s nothing like a soft-on-the-inside, crisp-on-the-outside, butter-toasted bun. Sadly, we didn&apos;t get that at B&amp;G. The hot dog roll was hard, cold, and dry. After one exploratory bite, I didn&apos;t bother with it.
- The lobster salad inside was fine, if a bit over-dressed, but the real challenge was the underwhelming quantity of it. 
- Overall, it was just okay. You&apos;re better off at Row or Neptune.

Perhaps because we didn&apos;t bother with the lobster roll roll, we weren&apos;t exactly full by the time we finished the meal. With a $100+ check, it wasn&apos;t thrilling to walk out and immediately be thinking about where to get a snack. In conclusion, I&apos;ll continue to drop anchor at Row."
4,"A quaint, small but unexpectedly bursting with seafood yumminess restaurant. We ordered a dozen oysters  for $38.40 and clam chowder for $14. The oysters were fresh and delicious! Use all of the toppings to get that perfect burst of flavor and textures. They had some of the best clam chowder that we&apos;ve ever had before in Boston.:super flavorful and went great with the complimentary bread placed on the table.

The location is very small so call ahead for reservations. There are about 10 tables and a bar seating. I didn&apos;t particularly liked where we sat but it&apos;s whatever. The food was good and made up for it. They had a decent drink selection. I&apos;ve been to the sister restaurants: No. 9 Park and Menton, they all seem to have very similar drink selections. It&apos;s a clean establishment and doesn&apos;t smell fishy."
5,This is some of the best seafood I&apos;ve had in my life. I went years ago and remember the massive seafood tower and just amazingly fresh shrimp
3,"Meh.  Not a very robust menu at all.  5 items.  Crab cakes were lame. 
 Cherrystones were good but expensive.  No decent beers and only a couple of CA wines. To be fair, it was a nice setup, the waiter was awesome, and the wife&apos;s lobster roll looked good, but we&apos;ll not be back."
3,"Visited Boston for the weekend. I was really looking forward to having a dining experience outside in the patio area under the lights. We got a table outside on the side of the street, and I asked the hostess if we could get a patio and she was rude, with an eye roll and said no. We were already waiting 15 minutes past our reservation and  I was still willing to wait a little more. And she still said no. So, that got the experience off the wrong foot. 

The food was okay. Honestly, nothing of wow factor. Which I was bummed.

I did like the striped bass and the veggies in the broth. Very tasty.
My friends loved the scallops and octopus. 

I very much enjoyed the oysters. Very fresh and I loved the variety. We got 2 of each. I believe there was a total of 4 kinds. 

It wasnt that great of a meal for me to come back though. I would rather explore elsewhere next time Im in Boston."
1,"Sad sad day to have to put these guys in check. Been going for years, can&apos;t go again. Lots to tell here folks, and the food is so tasty. But the real story is about how you treat those who have been loyal and loving all these years. 

Food, yeah it&apos;s good. 

April... well you&apos;re not making friends. 

You work on commission? Big mistake. Sorry Babs, we take care of family and that&apos;s not negotiable."
2,"B&amp;G was recommended to us by a friend. He said it was his favorite restaurant in Boston. 

It is very cute. I didn&apos;t know they did take reservations as a walk-in, we were told there would be a 30-40 min wait.  There was a chair so my daughter sat down and went to explore the neighborhood. Not 5 min later, a table was available, score!

Our goal on the trip was to eat as much seafood, esp. lobster rolls as we could. We were really disappointed in the sandwich. It was fresh, but cut into tiny pieces and had too much extra filler(for lack of better word). Overall the flavors were just meh. The pickles and fries were tasty, but I don&apos;t want to pay $34 for a meh entree and tasty pickles and fries. The 3 piece platter was the most disappointing. As you can see in photo, it was all 3 (calamari, clams and oysters) mixed in together on a dinner plate. It was predominately calamari with a couple of clams and oysters. Presentation was an epic fail. It was extremely greasy.  I only ate it because I was hungry and we paid for it. 

On a high note, service and ambiance were great! We sat outside in the courtyard and the weather was perfect."
5,Awesome place for quality seafood in the South End.  They&apos;ve constructed some great dining on the side street and in a super cute recessed back patio.  On my last go had the fried oysters and heirloom tomato &amp; watermelon salad - both were great.  They have hand sanitizer at every table and go the extra mile to make everyone feel comfortable.
5,"If you&apos;re the type to like heavily seasoned/sauced and rich foods, this is probably not the place for you, but my mom and I loved it. The octopus appetizer was a highlight, cooked perfectly and served with really yummy romesco sauce. The lobster roll was great too - the lobster preparation was very minimal (no mayo, no butter), so the end result felt very fresh, and the lobster definitely shined. Great sides, too.

Finally, the service was excellent. There was a slight issue with my order, and our server promptly addressed the issue and brought me a brand new dish. We even got a dessert on the house."
5,Best place in the city for quality oysters!! Must try all the different ones. Also the clam chowder was a winner
5,"I love B&amp;G Oysters! Super small, very tasty oyster bar in Boston. 

Make reservations, as the restaurant fill up quick! 

As an oyster bar, you obviously need to order oysters. Something interesting, which I&apos;ve only seen here, is a Lobster BLT. It&apos;s my favorite thing on the menu! The pickles that come with it are made in house, and also incredible!

Definitely worth a stop in if you&apos;re in the area."
5,"We visited for lunch on a chilly day in early December because they are one of the few places still doing patio dining. We bundled up and sat under the lovely heaters.  So nice! The food and service was outstanding. We had the lobster roll, fish and chips and chowder.  Amazing! Can&apos;t wait to go back and I hope they can keep the outdoor thing going for as long as possible!!"
3,"Came here for lunch while visiting Boston. I&apos;m usually apathetic about oysters but had to try a couple given the restaurant&apos;s name. Our server was quite knowledgeable and gave me great recommendations from their current offerings. Would recommend!

We then ordered the fish and chips and the lobster roll. The lobster roll was quite small given the price ($30+) so I didn&apos;t feel like it was worth the money. The fish and chips were a good portion, but the fish desperately lacked seasoning. Both entrees came with coleslaw, pickles, and fries, all of which were very tasty and actually more enjoyable than the seafood, so you will definitely leave feeling full.

They were quite busy so service was slow, but otherwise very friendly. The tables feel a bit small/crowded given the size of the restaurant, but I like the open kitchen/bar layout."
