Outdoor seatings available! 
We were having a road trip of NEW ENGLAND and my husband and I only had 2 days to spend in Boston. LET me tell ya that this place, was one of the best sandwiches we&apos;ve had on the trip! To the point where we wanted to take the shop back to NOVA where we are from. If you are in Boston, it&apos;s worth trying!"
5,"I went to Sam&apos;s for the first time back in 1979. I used to visit my friends at jeweler&apos;s building which is just behind Sam&apos;s shop. I looked forward to going downtown just to go there for lunch and have my favorite, the hot corned beef sandwich which was perfection.

On a visit to Boston in 2019 ( just before the pandemic) I took my son along with me. I told him we must go the Sam&apos;s and for him to try their food. Well, the place was semi busy. I chose the timing to be after 2PM as I knew that at lunch time, from 12-2 the place is mobbed. It was still busy after 2PM but we were served quickly and found sitting at a window counter. I saw Sam and said hello to him. I am sure he did not remember me but I told him that I used to visit his place starting some almost 40 years ago. He was very gracious and welcomed us back to his place. You MUST visit this place as it is a Boston treasure. The food is to die for and the experience is priceless."
5,"For a number of years, I traveled regularly to/from Boston... so I&apos;ve developed some favorite foodie spots in the city, and Sam LaGrassa&apos;s is one of them. 

Open since 1968, Sam LaGrassa&apos;s is a must-visit when in Beantown (they&apos;ve been at the same location for 50+ years!). The sandwiches are sizable and delicious (made with meat that&apos;s prepared in-house on a daily basis), so rest assured you&apos;re not going to be left hungry... the deli pickles on the side are, of course, a delightful little addition. (Mmm... pickles...) Also, I&apos;ve always noted the exceptional service here (efficient at dealing with the line at lunchtime, and always pleasant). These folks have a tried and true system and it shows. 

It&apos;s been a while since my last trip to Boston, so I was having a craving for one of their delicious sandwiches. Besides in-store, takeout, and delivery, Sam LaGrassa&apos;s offers catering AND overnight shipping via Goldbelly (https://www.goldbelly.com/sam-lagrassas). Given my recent Goldbelly kick, I couldn&apos;t resist and ordered the Grilled Specialty Sandwich 4 Pack for overnight shipping/delivery. The sandwiches arrived well-packaged (themselves wrapped in foil, and then securely prepared for shipping), and the shipment even included their signature deli pickles! Perfection. 

You can tell that the folks at Sam LaGrassa&apos;s take a lot of pride in the quality of their menu items - from the grilled bread sandwich specials to the vegetarian/vegan offerings or a la carte meat options - as well as ensuring happy customers. I definitely miss visiting in-person (and will certainly get back as soon as I travel to Boston again), but it&apos;s great to know that I can expect the same high quality deliciousness when having items delivered as well."
1,"A buffalo chicken sandwich on a soft, sesame seed roll. No. Just no. What were you thinking?

Sandwich Making 101 would dictate that a hot chicken with sauce should always be served on a harder bread.  Sesame seed rolls are delicious but not with buffalo sauce.

The buffalo sauce had no heat.

And when the sandwich was ordered, ranch dressing was requested as a substitute for the traditional bleu cheese.  What did they include with this soggy sandwich?  Creamy Italian Dressing.  Why?  Just why?"
5,"Their pastrami is the Best in Boston!
Frankly, also like it better than Katz&apos;s Deli in
NYC.

I just had one for lunch.
Simple- Pastrami on rye bread with mustard.
Hmmmmm"
5,"Great sandwiches in downtown Boston. Street parking available? Surely you&apos;re not serious..

Sam LaGrassa&apos;s is a Boston institution, a family run business since 1968. (Seinfeld pause) Worlds number 1 sandwich? You mean numero Uno?? That&apos;s a bold claim. I&apos;m not here to debate who has the number 1 sandwich and me being from New York?? I&apos;ll be nice and simply say Boston has a kick ass sandwich maker.

This place is always slammed, there are crowd control lines but with the town being empty I was able to stroll in and order with ease. 

All these choices! I don&apos;t want a huge, piled high pastrami sandwich. I ask the counter person about the special, The Rachel. I was told it&apos;s not a hefty sammy so away we go! I placed my order, paid for my meal and stood in the social distance area. Once called, I walked outside and sat to enjoy my meal.

The rye bread served is thickly sliced and once pressed in the panini machine? It&apos;s makes it all magical. The pastrami is cooked perfectly and the slaw it&apos;s topped with makes the sandwich. 

Sammy, You rocked my lunch!"
5,"BEST PASTRAMI SANDWICH I HAVE EVER HAD. When they say Sam Lagrassa has the best sandwiches, it is no exaggeration. To be honest, I have only had their pastrami sandwiches so I cant speak about others but you should be coming here for the pastrami. It is only open weekday lunches but its usually jam packed in here and for good reason! The sandwiches are expensive at 15 dollars but it is totally worth it. The pastrami is just so tender. 

Covid Experience: they are open 11 to 2pm Monday through Fridays. They offer limited indoor and outdoor dining. You can order in the store, online, or over the phone. They did a really nice job keeping distance between customers in line and the workers clean the space really well. I ordered by the phone because I kept running into an issue with their online ordering website. The person taking the order was so nice despite the number of modifications I made. I wish I could have given them tip but it was not an option when I paid in the store. 

I have tried the travelers, chipotle, and the diablo (original and with personal modifications). Even though they are all good (you cant go wrong with this pastrami!) My favorite has to be the diablo.   

Diablo is saucy and spicy, making it a total flavor bomb. The hot cherry peppers and the onion really cut down on the heaviness. The original sandwich doesnt come grilled but I actually think it tastes better when you ask for it to be grilled. I noticed that the bbq sauce kinda caramelizes, adding another flavor profile. I cannot recommend this enough!!

The travelers is for people who may be a little hesitant to try something new. It is a classic sandwich with a little twist. This was my first sandwich I tried and I thought it was amazing until I tried the Diablo. 

Chipotle is good if you want something light and refreshing with the pastrami. It was pretty good but I dont think I would get it again. The flavor combination wasnt as good as others."
5,The Cuban was outstanding and the bread is so delicious. Wish I lived in Boston so I could have one everyday !
5,"I LOVE THIS PLACE SO MUCH.

One of the best sandwiches I have ever had. I&apos;ve tried their roasted vegetable wrap ($12.95) and the Chipotle pastrami ($14.95) and they are both absolutely divine. The pastrami itself - I&apos;ve never had something so tender and wonderfully flavored. Bread is perfectly toasted and soaks up the sauces perfectly. Trust me - deli sandwiches anywhere do not beat this.

The portions are extremely generous. Limited seating, order at the counter."
5,"Top three sandwiches I&apos;ve ever had. The place is absolutely bustling at lunch, and for good reason. The Pastrami Diablo had the perfect balance of sweetness (from the bread) and heat from the cherry peppers and monterey jack. 

The meat to bread ratio was just right, and although the price was steep for a sandwich - $15 - I felt that it was worth it. If I worked around here I know that my wallet would eventually start hurting. It would be worth it to go back and try all their specialty sandwiches. 

My buddy had the turkey sandwich and had nothing but good things to say. In fact, he wouldn&apos;t stop going on about how juicy the turkey was compared to other sandwich joints. Safe to say that he was pleased as well. 

All in all, if I&apos;m back in Boston, I&apos;ll be hitting up Sam La Grassa"
4,"Really great local sandwich shop, the biggest downside being the limited hours and days they are open. The meat is always very lean and flavorful and the sandwiches are always stuffed."
5,"I have never been a huge fan of pastrami - just too salty and too much meat packed into a sandwich. But Sam is different. My go to is the Pastrami Diablo. I have been here a handful of times and I have gotten the Diablo EVERY TIME. I have had a bite of the other variations and in my opinion the Diablo is still my favorite. There is just something about how the spicy jalepenos mixed in with that bbq sauce and the pastrami that just makes is SO DELICIOUS DOWN TO THE LAST BITE. For $16 (including tax) it is a little pricey for a sandwich but it has earned its value for me. The meat to sauce to bread ratio is just perfect and its so filling. 

They are only open for lunch and the line can get pretty long, so I usually try to get there just before the noon lunch rush. There are decent seating room or you can always just grab and go."
5,"I&apos;ve always wanted to come here for lunch but difficult to do with a Monday to Friday schedule. So today was the day during this COVID pandemic. It was great ordering and picking up as we didn&apos;t have to wait in a likely usual long line. We brought it over to the commons and had a seat by one of the tables at earls. And oh my was it worth it. 

I wasn&apos;t sure whether to do the chipotle, Diablo or classic but so glad to have tried the chipotle. The bread Had a nice toast and crunch to it. I liked the honey chipotle sauce along with the coleslaw in the sandwich. The pastrami was delicious., I only wished there was a bit more pastrami.  I also think the pickle that came on the side did a disservice as it  tasted like a cucumber in water and some salt. I immediately wanted another sandwich. Although I&apos;d like to try another sandwich, I think I&apos;d get another chipotle the next time. Will have to make my way back there before it&apos;s get too hectic again!"
5,"I typically don&apos;t give a full five star review for somewhere I have only been once. However, the sandwich that I had here was hands-down the best sandwich I&apos;ve had in my entire life. So I can&apos;t not give it five stars. 

They have really great menu options, plus the ability to custom create your own sandwich. I love the combinations that they come up with and that the flavors blend really well and aren&apos;t overwhelming.

I went with the Pastrami &amp; Corned Beef Combo. We also shared a fry. The fries were hot and crispy, just like I like them. The sandwich though. It&apos;s what dreams are made of. The meat is soft and flavorful and melts in your mouth. The cheese, sauce, and slaw accompany the meat to add other great textures and flavors. The bread brings everything together perfectly. Don&apos;t make any changes to this sandwich, it doesn&apos;t need them. 

Now I&apos;m thinking about how I can travel back to Boston to eat this again."
5,Huge portion and delicious sandwiches! I love the pickled too. The sandwiches come nicely wrapped and are still went when they were delivered to my door. Wish they were open during the weekends too
5,"I came to Sam LaGrass&apos;s expecting an overrated deli experience with poor service but I was wrong. Everything about it made me want to come back, from the tenderness of the meat, to the speed at which the line moved, to the helpfulness of the staff, to the authenticity of the interior, to the portion size.

I got the pastrami sandwich with provolone and Russian dressing on rye and added coleslaw onto the sandwich (a very good decision). The sandwich is big but not too big and the meat is fall-apart tender and perfectly seasoned. The coleslaw is perfect creamy deli coleslaw. It comes with a side of a delicious deli pickle that is perfectly sour and &quot;snappy&quot; (pickle lovers know what I&apos;m talking about).

I will definitely be back."
5,"After walking all morning around the Boston Common, we are all hungry for a late lunch place without a wait for food.

The menu at Sam LaGrass&apos;s are Deli Sandwiches. The order line starts at the entrance of the restaurant and as you move along they assemble your sandwich with the freshly cut meats or ingredients. We ordered the Pastrami and Corned Beef Combo, Santa Fe BBQ Chicken Sandwich and Roast Beef with Bacon and Cheese Sandwich. They all were filling with a good amount of meat in between fresh soft bread. Everything tasted great and Hit the spot!

We would definitely go there again for a quick bite to eat!"
5,"DAMN.

This place is good. Too good. It&apos;s too close to work good. It&apos;s everyday I can good.

Seriously, Sam you ain&apos;t kidding when you say one of the best deli sandwiches around. 

This is Boston&apos;s version of KATZ deli, not to compare the two, but they are both so famously awesome. 

I love the turkey asiago. Heavenly drooling yum.

SOOO yes this place lives up to the hype. Stay calm it can get crazy.

Tip:
The food is PRICEAYY. Around fifteen bucks for a deli sandwich and AMAZING pickle spears. This ain&apos;t subway.

Bravo!"
5,"Favorite sandwich in America the Chipotle pastrami. 

Amazing place. Thanks to triple D on food Network showing me this gem. 

Great family owned business and everything is great here. 

Whenever I am in Boston this place is a must.

Note their hours so you don&apos;t miss out."
5,"Love this place. Typically get the Reuben and potato salad, which is amazing! Line can be long, but they deliver around Boston. Or they have a special line for call ahead."
