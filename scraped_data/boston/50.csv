5,"I came to Boston Burger Company for dinner with my girlfriend and it was very pleasant. They had QR code&apos;s on the table for customers to use in order to view their menu on their smart phones. They offered indoor and outdoor seating to customers, with social distancing in mind my girlfriend and I decided to sit indoors and felt very safe. 

The burgers were great! I ordered the Waikiki Beach Burger, which was comprised of grilled pineapple, ham, bacon, and teriyaki. Along side this I got a side of their home made chips and coleslaw. For desert we ordered the Oreo, and as an Oreo lover I can say without doubt that this was one of my top favorite deserts! 

Service was pretty good, our waitress was great and food came out pretty quickly. Will definitely be back to munch down on other burgers and deserts!"
5,"Though a tourist spot, this place is a must go! The service was incredible! The food is massive and delicious! And though we sat inside during COVID (due to high wind and cold weather), we were far from other guests and could tell the staff was taking everyone&apos;s safety seriously. There is nothing bad I could say. We really had an amazing dinner and left very full!"
5,"COVID his changed a lot this year, and since moving here we hadn&apos;t been able to find a good burger around town. That said, we took a chance based on the reviews and ordered delivery from Boston Burger last week.. it nailed it for us! I had a ranch burger and my husband had the Sophie. It was cooked perfectly and delivery was on time. We also had the mini Mac-ancini and enjoyed those as well. If you&apos;re looking for a burger spot, go for it! We&apos;ll definitely order again."
5,"Short version of the review: WOW, don&apos;t miss this!

Longer version. Wow, really don&apos;t miss this!

Ok, this place is amazing! Small restaurant that took a ride to flavor town and never looked back (do a little research and that&apos;ll make more sense!). Looking for a place to indulge in our favorite past time ... trying burgers while out of town, I came across this place. Needless to say if you do a little internet searching and look at images (along with our other favorite Yelp and all the pics they have to show off), you&apos;ll see quickly why we had to check this place out!

The burgers are insane (seriously ... look at the menu and all the options). Secondly, they aren&apos;t the cheapest burger you&apos;ll come across, but they are the biggest ... hands down! 

We tried 5 different burgers (there were 5 of us ... we weren&apos;t that gluttonous...haha). Every one of them delivered! 

I had the PIGFERNO$16.5:
habanero bbq pulled pork, Inferno Habanero salsa, beer-battered onion rings, spicy mayo, american cheese

Worth every penny! It packed so much flavor into this monster it&apos;s ridiculous!

We also had the ARTERY CLOGGER$15.5:
beer-battered and deep fried burger, bacon, bbq sauce, american cheese

Yes, you read that right, beer battered deep fried burger of awsomeness!

My wife had THE SOPHIE$15.5:
prosciutto, goat cheese, candied walnuts, fig jam, mixed greens tossed with lemon vinaigrette, balsamic reduction

Again, she absolutely loved this!

Now this isn&apos;t just a run of the mill burger joint, if you want to go for broke and make it a 6000 calorie meal grab one of the signature shakes that protrude several inches above the milkshake glass with additional toppings.

Really pleased that we came here, also they have some beer on draft, and the cider they were serving was really good! THIS PLACE IS A MUST!"
4,"this place gets a 4 star because of what the hostess did.
we checked in and she said the wait was a few minutes so we left and came back. we were standing inside as we seen people leave and we were next on the wait list. the host then comes over and said we couldn&apos;t stand inside due to capacity reasons (which we understand) and left to go back to the car once we arrived to the car we get a call saying our table is ready and we can come back in. we were so angry because not only were we just inside but it was cold and we walked back to our car for no reason and had us looking stupid. 

anyway we ordered the:

chicken panini w/chips
-i had customized my sandwhich to only have a few items, when i received the sandwhich it had what i didn&apos;t want on it. so i asked for another. you can tell they just took off the stuff and gave me the same sandwhich because it was soggy and tasted like it had tomatoes on it. i was ready to leave so i didn&apos;t feel like arguing for another. despite that it was delicious with the chips. 

buffalo mac
-good ! not how i would make mac and cheese but the chicken on I.T was great 

golden bbq boneless wings 
-way better than i expected! would definitely try this flavor 

sweet potato fries 
-they were good, nothing special

churro milkshake and oreo shakes:
-Shakes were amazing would definitely recommend ending your meal with them"
4,"Damn good burger but be prepared to wait. They&apos;re only allowed to seat at 25% capacity.

We&apos;re in Boston visiting with my son for the long weekend. His girlfriend said the restaurant they wanted to take us is closed but Boston Burger is around the corner. We walk in, put on name on the list and wait to be called.

Once seated, I quickly ordered a beer on tap. The menu is geared for fun so let the fun begin! The kids ordered Buffalo Boneless Chicken Wings as well as a side of Poutine. Both dishes have issues, the boneless wings were overcooked and the Poutine was &quot;weird&quot;, steak fries with very little brown gravy. 

I ordered the &quot;KIller Bee&quot; burger. The platter came with homemade potato chips and I chose baked beans instead of coleslaw. Hey, we&apos;re in Boston! gimme those famous beans.

I can see why Guy &amp; Rachel Ray are coming here. The burger was amazing! Properly cooked and the freshest meat, this was an award winning burger. I loved how the onion rings were stacked on top of the burger with the bacon and cheese on the bottom. Again, perfect burger that was doused in BBQ sauce?? They covered the onion rings in BBQ Sauce?? What is this, Close Encounters of the Third Kind or The Brady Bunch volcano?? Now my wife is laughing at me because she ordered the same burger with no BBQ sauce...

Chef/Owner, you have a great burger. Forget Guy Fieri. I&apos;ve been to his steakhouse in Atlantic City and it sucked. This burger could compete against Josh Capon in NYC. Lose the BBQ sauce and you&apos;ll have a burger worthy of the Killer Bee title.

PS - The wait staff was amazing."
5,"I was intrigued with the milkshake and burgers they have since I saw the restaurant on my facebook feeds and damn they dont disappoint. Usually freak shakes and fancy burgers are all for the gram but this one is different. The burger is tasty and perfectly done what I wanted. The toppings complements the meal and not heavy o4 overpowering. The chips as well are great and coleslaw is being coleslaw.

My hubby ordered the Smore shake, him being a sweet tooth, he really liked the rim. His major complaint is that the graham cracker on top was burnt to his liking but it is to be expected to be in smores shake. He would try the strawberry next time we are in boston. A must add whenever I visit."
4,"This restaurant lived up to the reviews that I&apos;d read before.  The burgers were so full of flavor and juicy and the garlic Parmesan fries were excellent.  I had the Alpine burger with garlic parmesan mushrooms and Swiss cheese with turkey rather beef.  It&apos;s my assumption that most don&apos;t ask for condiments because my burger didn&apos;t come with any but it needed a little mayo.  Other than that, the burger was great.  And the service here was top notch. The manager came bu several times to make sure that we were okay.  It was busy but they were also keeping a contact persons list in the case it was needed.   I appreciate them taking the extra steps to keep everyone safe."
5,"I have been here three times so far and each time for one of their milkshakes and they really are as amazing as they say! They are not just pretty, but also delicious and the staff brings them out pretty quick! The staff are also quite on top of things! I felt they could smile a little more, but they have always been busy and needing to run from costumer to costumer so I&apos;ll cut them some slack!

I havn&apos;t tried one of their main courses yet, but I hope to the next time I go and will write an updated review!"
3,"Birthday burger with daughter and her boyfriend.  Food was ok.   Service was poor.  Value for price paid is poor.   Had three burgers, shared one order of fries and one shake.  After tip was $100.  Would expect better service and above average food for that price tag.   

One specific food note:  we shared one order of the garlic Parmesan fries.   There was at least 1/2 cup of (fake) butter poured over the fries.   Way too much!  And the fact that it was the fake stuff (Whirl?)....it made it impossible to enjoy more than a couple of the fries.

Place needs a SERIOUS cleaning."
2,I&apos;m not the biggest fan of burgers in general so here goes my review.. I can&apos;t recall what burger I got but it was okay... They packed my burger with so much that I couldn&apos;t just enjoy the burger as a whole. I had to eat bits and part of my burger one by one. I only enjoy burgers when I&apos;m craving them and that day I was craving some but this didn&apos;t satisfy my cravings. For sure getting your money&apos;s worth! I guess if you&apos;re super hungry and a burger fan you&apos;ll love this place but for me it just wasn&apos;t it.
4,"Wow wow wow! When you hear you are minutes away from a restaurant shown on the food network it&apos;s like the foodie inside you takes over and walks you there. And boy did this place not disappoint. My friend and I tried two of the more well known burgers, The Mac Attack and The King. Both were far from lack luster and more than loved up to the hype! The Mac Attack was decadent and cheesy but not overwhelming. The King was surprisingly fantastic and the real winner of the evening. When you see what&apos;s listed peanut butter, bacon, fried banana with cinnamon sugar it sounds crazy and kind of gross. But it all comes together perfectly. I was more than pleasantly surprised. I would go back and eat any of these burgers any day.

The shakes are delightful. They are pricey but let&apos;s be honest you are ordering them for the picture and they don&apos;t disappoint. They are pretty and still tasty. We split one and it was definitely enough to finish off both our means. The sides are a little boring but can&apos;t go wrong with eating baked beans in Boston.

One problem with this place is it has a long wait. We signed up for the waitlist and still waited thirty minutes longer than the amount of time it said it would. Obviously that&apos;s not really there fault but on a Wednesday night you aren&apos;t anticipating over an hour wait when it said says only half and hour. When you walk into the restaurant you will see it&apos;s small so there&apos;s not really a place to wait  inside. We chose to wait in the bar a few doors down.thw restaurant is fairly narrow and has limited space so prepare to be a little cramped.

Overall I will definitely be going back. The burgers and shakes are great but maybe I&apos;ll try it at lunch time during the week. Maybe lunch lines will be better."
5,"My absolute favorite was The Mac Attack, embodying the quintessential Southern spirit. -- Aesthetically pleasing with its juice-oozing patty and bacon and generous amounts of mac &amp; cheese on top of that, tasted great with my Jack Abby draft. The potato chips were lit too; I didn&apos;t find it that salty as others have pointed out.

I ordered the Nutella Frappe to go, since there was no way that I can finish everything in one seating, but the waitress warned me that it would be without the chocolate rim and few toppings; but I was fine with that. It came out looking amazing even without the chocolate rim; and it has a lot more toppings than I thought."
4,"We were happy with our experience here! The mac attack burger was great and the s&apos;mores freakshake was amazing. I had the classic Mac and cheese and was a little surprised that it&apos;s made with hot sauce, although it was mild. It was still really good though and definitely a nice place to stop!"
5,"I&apos;m normally not a burger person... but I have a secret sweet tooth, so naturally, I had to try The King, which is basically a dessert burger. I mean, they even had a dessert with the same name, as an actual dessert, but I wanted to try out this strange burger dessert concoction.

Didn&apos;t think it would go so well, but it actually blew all my expectations away! The patty itself was a regular patty done medium rare and juicy, but complemented by the sugary bacon, peanut butter, and cinnamon... My perfect dessert burger was born and lived only a measly 20 minutes at most, and I&apos;m a slow eater so that means something.

Aside from the fantastic burger, the chips that came with were extra crispy, which I also loved. As for service, the waitress was so accommodating even while we were seated outside. This place has it all, especially for eclectic burgers, so definitely worth checking out, especially if you never knew you needed a dessert burger in your life."
5,"This place is INCREDIBLE!  420 Burger, The Hot Mess and a Build Your Own Burger....parmesan fries, sweet potato fries AND A Churro-Ly We Can&apos;t Taco Bout It Frappe"
2,"Purchased from grub hub. 2 burgers, pulled pork mac and cheese egg roll, and an 11 dollar shake. Got 2 nearly raw sandwiches and the egg rolls. I guess the shake never made it to the delivery guy. Who knows. My girlfriend is cooking her beef patty now. I ate my sandwich. A few of those bites were a little mushy for even my taste."
5,"Yes yes yes!!!! I love everything about this place! I&apos;m not sure why it took me 2 years to come here, but now that I&apos;ve been here I just can&apos;t stop coming! You can usually find me rushing in between 4:20p and 5p on weekdays coming in for their 420 burger (only $4.20) with a plate of their delicious unique fries on the side (Mumbo is my favorite!) On the weekend I&apos;m working my way through their other burger selections! I&apos;m not a Plain Jane when it comes to my food so I&apos;m always picking the biggest craziest sounding burger, enough for 2 meals for me!! When I have room, or plan to save room, I always go for one of their beautifully, deliciously decorated shakes! While you wait for a seat or while eating, watch behind the bar as they sculpt a tempting array of these babies! You&apos;ll want to save room too! Did you know there is a new shake every month? Neither did I until my last visit!

This place is a must try but I recommend getting on the wait list through yelp. This has saved me from some long wait times, especially in the summer!"
5,"Boston Burger was on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives where the Mac Attack burger was featured. The Mac Attack is an eight ounce patty, cooked to order, piled high with mac &amp; cheese and bacon...drool, but I&apos;m getting ahead of myself.

I read before coming to check yelp and add your name to the wait list prior to coming to avoid a long line. There was no wait time when we arrived, but upon leaving there were people lined up waiting to get in.

We started with the sampler. It comes with pulled pork mac &amp; cheese egg rolls, boneless wings, fried pickles Mac-ancini and bbc guacamole &amp; chips. We substituted out the chips for extra servings of the other options. It comes with four sauces: blue cheese, spicy ranch, marinara and cheese.

The egg rolls were the stand out. The juiciness of the pork paired with the crispy egg roll and mouthwatering mac and cheese made for a perfect combination. 

Even though the egg rolls were our favorite everything on the sampler was delicious. I love chicken wings and their boneless wings were so tasty. 

The fried pickles are thin spears and we killed the ancini.

We knew the sampler would be filling and we&apos;d be ordering frappes so we split the &quot;Mac Attack&quot;. I&apos;m kind of upset we did because ladies and gentlemen this is the perfect burger. Usually I&apos;m torn between ordering a burger between medium-rare or medium when I go to a new restaurant, but we decided upon medium. The bacon on the burger was crispy and piled high on top of the flavorful mac &amp; cheese. When we took the first bite we both looked at each other and said this is what a burger is supposed to taste like. Just super juicy, cooked perfectly with a nice buttery bun.

Our waitress said every table she had yesterday ordered one.

If you come here and don&apos;t order a frappe you&apos;re missing our! We got the chocolate peanut butter banana and strawberry shortcake. The cake on top of the frappe was one of the best strawberry shortcakes I&apos;ve ever had!

Everything on their menu looked so good. I&apos;m glad we don&apos;t live close because this place is addicting."
5,"Definitely came back for the milkshakes. We first came here for the burgers which were phenomenal and had a variety to choose from or you can also build your own with a  great selection of beers but we were too full for a milkshake so we came back again for them and did not disappoint. 

Parking is a hassle to find so we paid for parking around the corner."
