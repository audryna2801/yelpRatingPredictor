5,"I have been regularly going to Q if not ordering delivery/takeout over the past couple of years. It is undoubtedly one of my favorite restaurants in Boston.

The crazy mala soup is perfect. Not too oil and it turns even more flavorful and thick as it cooks. It is deliciously spicy and salty - the definition of umami, I am absolutely addicted to the taste.

Their sauce options - shacha, homemade hot chili oil, freshly chopped green onion and cilantro, and minced garlic mixed with a bit of soy sauce make the ultimate dipping sauce.

Another recommendation of mine is their house fried rice. It makes you question if you&apos;ve really had fried rice in your life. It is light but flavorful and has a good amount of protein/veggies. 

Their service is alway topnotch. I never have an empty water/drink glass and they regularly check-in without being annoying.

I love this place!"
5,"I am a new dedicated Customer to Q.

First of all, the food tonight was so delicious. The Antoinette Chicken Soup, the fish and chips, cheeseburger, and a corn on the cob appetizer. I had a cocktail to go. All delicious. My good friend told me the Cobb Salad is amazing and that will be next time. The corn on the cob I will most likely order everytime. The cocktail was big and rum and orange I forget the name now.
I appreciate how easy it was to order and receive curbside pick up. The restaurant is taking the pandemic very seriously and we feel so confident ordering here during these scary times. Thank you."
5,"COVID-19 update. 

The Q has thus far survived the holocaust that has closed so many of our other favorite restaurants; we hope The Q endures. 

They have begun accepting reservations, which obviates the unpleasant (and now dangerous) practice of standing in a gaggle at the host stand awaiting a table. 

The food continues to be superb. Service is always decent at a minimum; last time, our server was genuinely excellent. 

Save a great restaurant, and treat yourself: eat at The Q"
5,"We were here over the weekend as soon as it opened up for the day and were ushered in warmly by the team . The waiter was very helpful in taking time to explain the menu and combinations we could order . We ordered scallion pancake , veg spring rolls, cold spicy noodles (this was really good) and for lunch we had  the Mala broth vegetarian (need to be specific here as it contains fish sauce ) and the spicy Sichuan broth (veg) half and half and a platter of veggies and noodles to cook with . Everything was very good . 

Overall we really enjoyed the experience and left feeling all warm and fuzzy into the cold Boston weather :)
Will definitely return here ."
5,"This restaurant should be renamed to OG. Yes, OG as in the &quot;original gangsta&quot; of hotpot restaurants in Chinatown. I&apos;ve been eating here for the past 3 years. I&apos;ve seen the new hotpot restaurants poppin around Boston and even 2 more in Chinatown. After eating at the new spots, Q is still the King of hotpot.

Q specializes in Mongolian style hotpot. Essentially a single giant bowl of broth for you to share with your party. You can divide the pot into 2 halves if you&apos;re feeling saucy about trying different broths. You do have to pay extra for broth depending on the style you want. They have killer lunch special combos that get you the cut of meat you want, platter of veggies, and a side of rice or noods. Veggies included are cabbage, bok choy, spinach, enoki, bella shrooms, tofu, and sometimes tomato. We got the lamb and the beef combos. Tasted the meats side by side. The lamb is easily softer and has the melt in your mouth effect. Wherever they get their lamb from, holy smokes it&apos;s delicious! You can add different items as desired such as a golden fish ball. This is their version of fish balls with exploding roe inside of them. Beware it does get hot, but it bursts with deliciousness in your mouth. My recent visit, I noticed they are stepping up their lunch sushi game with affordable sushi/sashimi  lunch combos. I&apos;m definitely trying these next time.

Overall, Q is much more than just hotpot. You can get exceptional sushi and delicious chinese dishes if you&apos;re not in the hotpot mood. Also have a full bar.. need I say more?"
5,"First time coming with my sisters. One of my sisters brought her little dachshund in which a waiter brought over a container of water for him. To say the least, the staff was attentive and friendly. We had the hot and sour tom yum and classic maki broth both of which were delicious and required no use of the dipping sauce in my opinion. We shared the premium steak combo which came with a plate of veggies. The vegetable plate was small so we ordered extra Napa cabbage, enoki mushrooms, bean curd skin, and watercress. For carbs we had the vermicelli, udon, sweet potato noodles and rice. Everything came out quick and fresh. Will definitely come back for more!"
5,"Finally gave this place a shot after years of passing by LOL We made things super easy for our server - marked the entire menu with what we wanted, drinks, apps, food etc. I liked that there were different broth choices (ie black bone chicken and spicy beef tallow). Try the wagyu! It&apos;s a mouth-gasm. Beautiful marbling and so damn tender that it melts. Portions were generous. AND as busy as it was for a cold, Saturday night, everything came out so quickly! Another plus to combat the hanger. Overall- amazing food, great music (00&apos;s throwback playlist? Cant go wrong with that lol) and great ambiance. Cant think of one bad thing to say about my experience. Thanks for the great meal, Q team! I&apos;ll be back to visit soon!"
4,"Food was pretty good and service was alright. Could&apos;ve been better. We had made a reservation for 1:30 and didn&apos;t get sat for a while even though it seemed like they had tables. One of the things that also bothered me was that we had ordered the steamed gyozas from the lunch special menu and they ended up charging us full price. Aside from that, the food was pretty good. My favorite was the sweet and sour chicken and the chicken fried rice. The steamed gyozas were alright, I felt like they could&apos;ve used a bit more flavor in them. The sushi was good too but nothing out of the ordinary. I would definitely come back though and try the hot pots they looked amazing"
5,Wonderful place! Had many vegan options and staff was knowledgeable about the plant-based broths offered.
5,Loved the food. Interactive. Got the meat sampler for the soup. Two different kinds of noodles and a few vegetables. Would recommend getting double meat. Also got a vegetable low mein dish which was really good. Make a reservation in advance as they book up really fast
4,I went with a group of 6 people and we were all very pleased with the hot pot and drinks. Our temperatures were all taken before we were seated and we were given our own spot that was away from everyone else. I would definitely visit this place again.
5,"Fantastic Place! it was our 2nd time here but our 1st for the hot pot, what fun! Great server! Great sushi! Great veggies! Great Broth! Great fun! Exactly the fun we were looking for my daughter&apos;s 12th Birthday! We can&apos;t wait to get back there!"
3,"Not sure who makes the time estimates but we joined the waitlist at 6:11pm. According to yelp waitlist, we arrived just before 6:53. We didn&apos;t sit down until 8:42pm. I felt like I was being strung along and the people I was dining with were also very frustrated.

Fortunately when we finally sat down, we were able to order quickly and got our food quickly as well. The food was good. They have a wide variety of cuisine and use good quality ingredients."
5,"Dropped in this place two weeks ago and was not disappointed by the service and the food. Our server was very helpful and attentive. The food (hot pot and the Q roll) was really good. I recommend trying their special sushi rolls menu, and fish roe dumplings for the hot pot. Didn&apos;t like Mala beef. We enjoyed the experience but the price is kinda high compared to the food portion. We were still half hungry when leaving the restaurant. It&apos;s understandable considering the restaurant location and service provided. Overall, we would come back again for their awesome service."
3,"I made an appointment for the day before of valentines, got there 5 min late and they had already given my table away. My fault, no biggie. But when it came for social distancing and reinforcing the safety of others was lacking heavily. We were standing just feet away from people dinning and that&apos;s why I asked a table in the corner. Ended up with a huge table for 8 which made it odd to eat at. Other than that they need to keep people safe. No counting or safe spaced waiting lines at all. If it wasent COVID time I would give it a 4 but still they felt like a club space. Not a restaurant. Great food. Good service. Just gotta be safer."
1,"Forced to leave after not following 25% capacity set by the state of Massachusetts. Kept sitting people next to us. I walked up to the host stand and ask to speak with a manager. They told me that a manager wasn&apos;t there right now and they would give them a call. I waited about 5 mins, the host came back and said the manager would be on there way back. I asked our server for boxes as we didn&apos;t feel comfortable anymore. No manager came to our table nor did they say anything. Server was very nice and said I&apos;m so sorry. I have tweeted the commonwealth of Massachusetts, the city of Boston, the Boston police department and all new stations in Boston. If someone were to get Covid because this company fails to follow the law that&apos;s on them."
1,"Staff were very rude and did not treat the 90 minute policy equally, asking us to leave 30 minutes earlier despite leaving the table next to us that came earlier than us to eat for longer than us. Very disappointed by the service and the portions were small for the price."
5,"One of if not the best hotpot restaurants in the Boston area. It is by far my favorite out if the choices you have around the chinatown/downtown area. A little bit on the pricey side when you compare it to shabu-zen or other hotpot places around, however it is well worth the slight increase in price. 

My reasons is the quality of the meats and the flavor of the broth. My absolute favorites here are either the spicy mala or the pork bone broth. Get the mala if you enjoy spicy and pork bone if you don&apos;t. As for the meat, you really can&apos;t gone wrong with any of them, my personal all time favorite and what I get every time is the prime rib. Its got the right amount of meat to fat in my opinion. Get that and the mixed veggie combo and you&apos;re set for a great meal."
3,"Despite other reviews, service was excellent for our party of 6. Our drinks were never empty and everyone that served us was very friendly. Our waitress explained hotpot and gave us some suggestions on what to order.

The food, on the other hand, was hit or miss. I ordered a plate of general gau tofu with a side of white rice. It was delicious and filling! Half of the table did hotpot and were not satisfied. Everyone was still very hungry after (they ordered 2 meats + 1 appetizer + noodles + small plates). The other two at the table ordered sushi (one found a long black hair in her roll and the other kept picking out fish scales).... yikes.

Price wise, it&apos;s not cheap. My drink and tofu plate was just under $40. It was good, but not $40 good. The half of the table felt they overspent on the hotpot considering they were still extremely hungry after eating. The cocktail I ordered was pretty watered down; not worth $10 for sure.

Overall, I wouldn&apos;t revisit unless someone else in my party really wanted to go."
5,"Good food, always had great service. When other places are full for hotpot, this place always has a short wait or none at all"
