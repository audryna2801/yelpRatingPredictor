5,"One of the best all you can eat hot pot places! Their flat price is AYCE veggies, fish balls, noodles, etc. and you pay for each plate of meat. I think this is the best pricing model and what makes Spring great. Other AYCE will include meat, but the meat will be subpar quality. Spring&apos;s pricing model of paying for the meat ensures that it is higher quality and fresh. They also had the widest selection with many types of veggies, fish balls, and noodles to choose from. Quality of these were also very fresh. Their green tea soft serve is also so yummy! 

Also felt very safe with COVID precautions. Currently, you take your plate to the buffet area and follow a one-way lane where someone behind the bar will put what you want on your plate. You also tell the server what sauces you want and they will bring them in plastic containers. Tables are closed off around you to reduce capacity. Also love that it&apos;s in a shopping center so there is an actual parking lot!"

How I miss Spring Shabu-Shabu! It is one of the restaurants that I visited back in February before the covid hit in March. I had read so many reviews of the restaurant and have been wanting to visit. 

It is not cheap, but expect to pay for a quality meal and dining experience here. During my visit (pre-covid), the restaurant is clean, and I love how organized and spotless the stations are. While extra charges (like protein) can add up quickly here, I still think it is a good place for meals every once in awhile. 

I am glad to see that it is still open for business! Can&apos;t wait to come back here in the near future!"
5,"This is the best AYCE shabu place in Boston and I have been going there for years. I went there for the first time since COVID and I was pleasantly surprised. I went around 6 PM on a Wednesday night and I was seated fairly quickly. You don&apos;t need a reservation. They open at 5:30 PM now and there is no lunch. There are no menus at the table, you just scan a QR code and it directs you to the online menu which I thought was pretty cool.

They have upgraded their soup broths and all of them sound delightful. They added Mala and Kimchi broths to their options. I got the Mala and it was really good. For the sauce, you just tell the server which sauces you would like and they bring it to you in little plastic containers. 

The meat was extra but really good quality. I usually always get the beef belly. They have a good selection when it comes to vegetables, fish cakes and noodles. The noodles are fresh and go well with the broth. I can&apos;t wait to come back again and try the Kimchi broth! The green tea ice cream was really good so be sure to order that!"
1,"Came in at 8pm and standing at the front desk for a moment while the front desk girl to finish her thing on hand-(understandable)  
BUT, she looked up and staring at me and my girlfriend, no greeting, no smile, just staring at us. And my girlfriend need to say &quot;two people please&quot; to break the quiet moments. She SIGH so loud that I can hear that with my AirPod was on my ears. She told me I don&apos;t need to sign the contact sheet even though I told her I wail be waiting for 45 minutes for the table. She even roll her eyes on me when I planned to wait on my car. 

I have been here for so many times that I can&apos;t even count. This is the first time ever this place gave me such disappointment that i don&apos;t ever want to come back to see her unwelcome face. 

Plus, I just went back to confirm my wait list, because I didn&apos;t receiving the first text, which I would normally do so I think there&apos;s something wrong. she didn&apos;t put my phone number correctly after me and my girlfriend repeated it for twice individually, so four times in total after I tell her my phone numbers. Which means I won&apos;t get any text after 45 minutes. WOW Well done!  And her name is Vanessa. Good job Vanessa. Guess I will never see you again."
1,"This place might be closed. I&apos;ve visited during the dinner hours and the building and parking lot were desolate. The next day, I tried calling multiple times (on a Wednesday) to make a reservation before stopping and did not receive a response...

It&apos;s confusing because there wasn&apos;t a sign or indication on the door or store front.

Hope they get back up and starting soon."
5,"*COVID-19 UPDATE*

Super happy that they&apos;re still in business. Online reservations only! Masks required! 

Other changes:
- Single file line to get your ingredients and are served by staff only. If you want more ingredients you need to ask for a new plate! 
- No self serve for sauces (huge bummer). They&apos;ll bring the sauces to you individually. At the time (8/10/2020) they only offered five sauces: peanut, sesame, ponzu, sweet chilli and a creamy ginger sauce. Soy sauce is actually available though you have to request it. Also providing garlic, scallion, cilantro diced jalape√±os. Hoping they at least add the sa cha sauce soon...

It was smart for them to stagger reservations since it&apos;s not too busy where you&apos;re waiting in line forever to get your ingredients but not empty enough for it to feel isolating.

Broth base was $18.95 each for dinner. 

Not being able to customize your sauce is unfortunate but a understandable situation until things can get back to normal.

Good to be back!"
5,"This is a vegetarian&apos;s dream!? All you can eat vegetable/noodle hotpot for under 20 dollars! It&apos;s so healthy. You can still order meat by the plate for around 6-10 dollars, so it&apos;s not unreasonable. Since there is a virus going around, they have many brave service people to help bring sauces or serve the vegetables or noodles at the buffet section. Unfortunately, you can&apos;t make your own sauces anymore, but they will bring most of the original selection to you to mix yourself. 
I like to poach my eggs in the broth, but the spoon they give you is not great. I guess they want to test your skill. The green tea ice cream is really great in between rounds of fish tofu and wood ear mushrooms. I believe they charge extra for dumplings at lunch now. The quality of meat is really great. I&apos;m happy it&apos;s open again."
5,"I heard so much about Spring Shabu from friends over the past few months, notably that it&apos;s one of the only places in Boston that&apos;s all you can eat during Covid times. I came here on a Sunday night without any reservations and got seated immediately. 

How it works: you pick a broth (basically five different options of varied spiciness - I ordered the pork bone broth because I can&apos;t do spicy). Then you tell your server what dipping sauces you want - we opted for one of each. The vegetables are all you can eat and the meat comes at an extra charge per serving so if you want brisket it will be $6 for one serving, pork belly is an extra $5 per serving. So if you want just veg and broth, your base payment will be ($18/person) during dinner time. The more meat you want, the more $$ you will pay. 

During Covid times, you go up to the buffet area and there are servers behind glass who will serve you the vegetables, fish balls, and mushrooms/noodles, versus pre-Covid, you&apos;d normally be able to grab as much as you want yourself with the tongs. The first section is fish balls and I went HAM (basically one of each) and they had so much variation. The second section is noodles and they had so many different kinds of noodles, so hard to choose! The third section is vegetables with different kinds of leafy greens, mushrooms, root vegetables. I overflowed my plate with the fish balls in the beginning to tread carefully because you can always go back for more! 

There is a 90 minute dining limit during peak times so keep that in mind. And they have ice cream at the end (vanilla, green tea, or mix) that is included with the buffet. This is hands down the best shabu place I have been to EVER. And will definitely be coming back. My hair and clothes smelled like shabu grilled meat / vegetables by the end of the night but I&apos;m not mad about it! For $18 per person, this can&apos;t be beat!! They also have various drink options (beer, wine, sake, makkeoli) which made the meal so much tastier! Please visit if your in the Allston area! PS. Free parking in their parking lot (super easy parking if you&apos;re driving here!)"
3,"COVID-19 update:
They have made several changes to keep up with the mandate, and have done a good job overall. 
The disappointments came from the selection of the foods.  There were significantly less selections of fish cakes and vegetables, yet prices remained the same.  
Value has definitely decreased, which explained why the restaurant was not filled at 6pm on Saturday night."
5,"Spring Shabu-Shabu is an exceptional hotpot place for both vegetable lovers and those who enjoy meat.  The restaurant is solo hotpot style - each diner gets an individual bowl of their choice.  After choosing your broth, you are invited to indulge in the unlimited vegetable, tofu, and noodle bar.  The variety on the buffet is expansive and impressive.  In the tofu section, different varieties of fish tofu and fish cakes are offered.  The greens section offers a selection of Asian vegetables that rivals the selection at the supermarket.  Noodles also come in an impressive variety - you get much more than the standard egg and rice noodle here.

Meats are ordered a la carte, which is a nice way to keep the buffet clear of meats for vegetarians.  The sliced beef, pork, and fish are all of high quality and decent portion size for the price.  Broth was refilled quickly throughout the meal and it did not take long for the raw meats to come out after ordering.  I enjoyed the dashi broth, which had good flavor and was not too salty.

To cap everything off, there is a soft serve ice cream with vanilla or green tea flavors.  I really enjoyed my meal at Spring Shabu-Shabu and will definitely return for another evening of delicious hotpot."
3,"I used to live an 8 min walk away from Spring Shabu Shabu and have visited it multiple times. My conclusion from all those visits? Spring Shabu Shabu is probably one of the most overrated restaurants in Boston. 

Don&apos;t get me wrong; Spring does a couple of things well. They carry a good variety of vegetables, noodles, and fish cakes in their buffet (though sadly no more dumplings). Seeing all the different noodle options the first time I went was an awe-inspiring experience. Their sauce bar is also very complete which is great compared to places like Happy Lamb (who don&apos;t provide sauces unless you ask for them) and Liuyishou (who charges extra for their sauce bar). 

My biggest gripe with Spring is their broths which are all incredibly watery. I&apos;ve tried their spicy dashi, spicy pork bone, vegetable, and kimchi broths and they were ALL watery af. This was so disappointing to me because the broth is like 80% of the hot pot experience for me (everything else is just raw ingredients!). You can certainly have a hot pot buffet with good broths, good sauces, and good ingredients. I&apos;ve seen it done before, so I don&apos;t excuse Spring for skimping out on their broths."
4,"Great AYCE hotpot! A buffet of veggies, noodles, fishballs, sauces, and ice cream are all included in the AYCE price and you can order meat/seafood at an additional cost. Each person gets an individual pot and can choose their own broth - I love this because some of my friends like their broths extremely spicy, whereas I like mine a little milder. I do wish that there were more broth options though (like herbal or tomato, which I&apos;ve seen at other restaurants), but the basics were all covered.

Personally I felt like I didn&apos;t even need meat with all the buffet variety, but my friends ordered extra fatty beef plates and loved it. I&apos;ll have to try it next time!"
4,"This is all you can eat for everything but meat, which might be worrisome if you&apos;re more of a carnivore, but I&apos;ve actually found it to be totally fine. There&apos;s still a bunch of selection in vegetables, fish (e.g., fish balls), noodles, and eggs. And when you&apos;re all full, there&apos;s vanilla and green tea ice cream waiting for you.

The price point is a lot cheaper than other all you can eat hot pot places, probably because meat is extra. I actually am fine with that. I feel like when the price is high, I feel pressured to eat more to really make my money&apos;s worth. When it&apos;s so low, though, I can eat comfortably.

Warning: This place can get crazy busy, and there are no reservations, so be sure to go early or be prepared to wait. There&apos;s a nice texting system for people in line, so you don&apos;t need to wait in the restaurant."
5,"OMG I have so heard so much about this place. I never made it out because it&apos;s far and I&apos;ve heard the wait is horrendous (1-2 hours at meal time). So glad to come today. There&apos;s a small parking lot out front and it was easy to find a spot.

A group of 6 of us came around 5:10pm in a Sunday and we were seated within 10-15 minutes (much time my surprise).

I got the spicy mala soup broth and then loaded up with veggies, noodles, fish balls, etc. amazing assortment and the display is really clean and spacious. There was also an insane sauce bar for making your own dipping sauce. I loved that they had multiple types of noodles - all of which were curled into little bite fulls so you could easily try a bunch. We also ordered 3 plates of fatty beef and 3 plates of fish for the table. So good. Service was very quick and the waitresses were attentive. 

Had an amazing experience and would sure as heck come back here again! Topped off the meal w green tea ice cream self serve in a cone...yum. So much food and happiness for $30. Loved it :D each plate of meat was pretty inexpensive for the volume!

I would even wait 1-2 hours for this. 

Seriously."
4,"Five stars for vegetarians, four stars if you NEED to have meat with your hot pot (like me).

Multiple friends raved about this place, so I had to see if it lived up to the hype (and there is a lot of hype). An average wait time during peak hours is 30 - 45 min, but at least they have a phone system in place. It is approx $18/person. 

The decor is clean and modern, and each person gets their individual &quot;hot pot&quot;, which is nice for dietary/allergy/germaphobes. It&apos;s all you can eat buffet style, so you don&apos;t need to wait for the server and you can get as much or as little as you want. The only caveat that keeps me from giving it 5 stars is that the meat and seafood is priced separately (~$5/plate). Otherwise, the veggies were extremely fresh, and the other AYCE proteins were tofu, fish balls/cakes, and eggs. I felt like all the choices were of premium quality, and I loved the matcha soft serve at the end. Overall I would go back, but probably order a plate of meat just to satisfy the inner carnivore."
5,"I&apos;ve been missing out!!! After hearing tons of great reviews about this place I finally decided to check it out over the summer, and I have been back several times since.

The wait is usually pretty long, and they will not seat you until all members of your party arrive. I was immediately blown away by the cleanliness and the variety in the buffet. They offer a bunch of different vegetables/noodles/fishcakes/tofu etc. in the AYCE section. I have not yet ordered meat or seafood (sold separately), but personally I think the buffet section is more than enough.

Each person gets their own personal hot pot, and can choose which broth they want (which works great because unlike my friends, I do not like spicy heh). You also choose your own sauces and can adjust the temperature of your pot. The servers are attentive and quick to refill the pots with water and water glasses as well.

And last but not least, the GREEN TEA SOFT SERVE!! It&apos;s the perfect texture and flavor, a subtle green tea with a hint of sweetness, and doesn&apos;t have a powdered taste as some do. I eat at least 3 cones every time. A great ending to a hot pot meal."
3,"Pros: It&apos;s a unique and fun experience because instead of having a family style hotpot where everyone shares there are individual pots. That means that everyone can choose their own flavored broth. There is a large variety of noodles and vegetables along with fish balls and they have their own sauce bar which is pretty neat. Also with the individual pots you can choose the level of hotness ranging from 1-5 which helps decide whether the pot simmers and boils. At the end of the hotpot experience they have a matcha and vanilla soft serve machine.. and it is so delicious!! I heard that they also use their own powder to make the matcha soft serve. 

Service: Since it&apos;s all you can eat and you self-serve basically you shouldn&apos;t expect too much for service. The many times that I&apos;ve gone I&apos;ve always had great service where the waiters would come and refill my water or pot if the water level got too low and provide napkins and ask if we needed anything. 

Cons: If you&apos;re a vegetarian than Spring-Shabu is perfect because of their unlimited variety of noodles and vegetables and for some meat there is a large variety of fish balls. The only con is that the meat could be pretty pricey and you have to pay separate on top of what you have to pay for the AYCE. The shrimp/seafood platter can also get pricey if there&apos;s not a large party. Also they could have more broth like Tom-yum flavor or Kimchi in my opinion.

Overall: If you&apos;re looking for an all you can eat hotpot then I definitely recommend Spring Shabu. However if you have a party larger than 6 it&apos;s not ideal just because their max tables are 6 individual pots. I would come here and definitely have cravings for Spring-Shabu! I would give it 5 stars if the meat and seafood was all you can eat. But the price without meat and seafood is decent especially during lunch hour."
5,"This place is off the chain.

I like how at this hot pot place, you get your own pot with choice of broth. I went with spicy pork bone but got it mild and thought it was perfect.

You control the heat of your own pot so you can boil or just keep warm whenever. The add-in bar is extensive and has just about any vegetable or noodle type you could imagine. I made my own sauce with blended scallion, seasoned soy sauce, and sweet chili sauce... way better than it sounds.

All of the meats that I tried including the chicken, ribeye, and lamb were extremely fresh and rolled in the typical fashion. The ice cream machine is also just a fabulous touch to a meal that gets very warm.

This place would be tough to figure out if you&apos;ve never hot potted before, but once you get the hang of it, this place is a great, clean, and fun experience! It&apos;s a $20 entry plus the meat you order, so I assume you could go cheaply and vegetarian if you wanted also.

5/5 awesome"
3,"Just want to start this review off by sharing that the food here is still great despite the 3 star review. The Hot Pot is definitely worthy of 5 stars but the service we&apos;ve received from the staff has declined over time. I have gone to this place for about 2 years now and feel that some (not all) of the waiting staff have been rude to me and several of the people I have dined in with in the past. There have also been times where we were ignored when seeking assistance from a staff member as well as given extremely slow service when requesting something as simple as chopsticks or water.

It can be super busy at times which makes sense, but impolite service is never cool. 

Once again, food is still awesome."
5,"Wow, this place was super cool. On a Monday night, I went with a group of 5 when they opened at 6 pm. I was so surprised to see a long line and that the restaurant was packed on a Monday. The restaurant was way bigger than i expected and was bright and open. The tables had the built in burners for individual pots which i loved. Sometimes with a group of 5, a family style pot is almost too small with that many people trying to reach in and grab food. Huge fan of the individual pots. my whole table ordered the Spicy Pork Bone broth.

In the back, I was so impressed with the variety of veggies, fish balls, and noodles. There were so many types of greens and mushrooms and I loved trying them all.The noodles were all so cute in the little bundles. Also they were bundled in the perfect amount where you can try a bunch of different types and not waste. I tried the ramen, spinach, soba and green tea noodles and loved all of them! I wanted to try more types of noodles but i was so full. For my table, we ordered 2 plates of beef. I think i could have used another plate but i also was fine with filling up on the fish balls.

The sauce bar was super cool and allowed opportunities for creativity. I ended up mixing a bunch of different things and they all turned out yummy.

Also for dessert, they have Vanilla and Green Tea ice cream. Overall i had a great experience here and loved the variety of options. Would definitely return."
