They&apos;re always really consistent with good service and food. In November they still had outdoor seating and Charles Street is so cute and they made their outdoor seating nice."
4,"Went here during COVID for brunch, they have 4 or 5 tables outside and a few tables indoor for seating. I came here with my friend and she wasn&apos;t too keen that they were using reusable cups and silverware for utensils, where as other restaurants have been using disposables or water bottle. The restaurant is located in beacon hill, so good luck finding street parking. 

We got two items, their buttermilk pancakes and their chorizo omelette. Their pancakes were okay, they were as fluffy as any other small business breakfast place I have been to, but better than your average Ihop or Denny&apos;s 

I would highly recommend the chorizo omelette if you want a savory brunch/breakfast. Everything was spot on, the potato wedges had the right amount of sodium and was lightly seasoned with a BBQ dry rub so you get a little sweet and smokey, but no kick in your potatoes. Also I feel like a lot of places over do it with the quantity of potatoes, like they purposely don&apos;t want you to finish your meal, but this place had their proportions just right.  The chorizo in the omelette weren&apos;t your typical diced chorizo, but it was fantastic! And the right amount of guac on top as well as pico. 

I would come back to try other items on the menu!"
5,"I really had to think about this, the question of whether Paramount&apos;s &quot;Paramount Burger&quot; (and associated French fries) constitutes the &quot;best&quot; burger and fries I&apos;ve had in Boston. Well, from my limited perspective, the answer is: yes! I happen to work a few blocks away from Paramount Beacon Hill and have the luxury of having delivery in less than 30 minutes. The excellent bacon cheeseburger, fries and fast delivery make for an all around great lunch option!"
4,"The wait time is not bad at all.... even though there might be a line it goes by pretty fast ...the staff is so kind the waiters are on it! Without a doubt great customer service 
Food is at about average quality in comparison to the rest of the Boston places 
We ordered 2 Paramount platters and the chocolate chip pancakes 
Platters  were ok while the chocolate chip pancakes were very tasty!"
3,"When we arrived there was a line outside but the wait was not that long. Once inside we realized why, it turns out that in this restaurant they don&apos;t let you have prolonged talks after your meal, they are practically rushing you from the moment they take your order and then they bring you the bill before you have finished eating.
   The waiter who served us left a lot to be desired because he couldn&apos;t help us with the menu and got frustrated when we asked him a couple of questions instead of trying to help us with the order. He didn&apos;t bring water, and once we asked him, he didn&apos;t bring straws, and once we asked him, he brought only one so we had to ask him for the second person&apos;s straw.
   The food was fine, but average. There was not a single WOW factor that I would recommend this place for. In general it is not bad; but for the wait line, the price and the fame, it did not meet our expectations. @miamireview


   Cuando llegamos había línea afuera pero la espera no fue tan larga. Una vez adentro nos dimos cuenta de por qué. Resulta que en este restaurante no te dejan hacer sobre mesa, sino que prácticamente te están apurando desde que te toman la orden y luego te traen la cuenta antes de haber acabado de comer. 
   El camarero que nos atendió dejaba mucho que desear porque no supo ayudarnos con el menú y se frustró cuando le hicimos par de preguntas, en vez de tratar de ayudarnos a ordenar. No trajo agua, y una vez que se la pedimos no trajo absorventes, y una vez que se los pedimos, trajo uno solo así que tuvimos que pedirle el de la segunda persona. 
   La comida estuvo bien, pero normal. No hubo ni un solo factor WOW por el que recomendaría este lugar. En general no es malo pero para la fila, el precio y la fama, no cumplió nuestras espectativas. @miamireview"
4,I had the huevos rancheros &amp; they were really good. I would&apos;ve liked for the staff to be more attentive but overall the food was good.
5,My go-to for breakfast whenever I&apos;m back in Boston. You can go healthy or full-tilt with the banana pancakes (the best I&apos;ve EVER had). Don&apos;t sleep on The Paramount!
4,"Paramount has a great location in the Beacon hill area. It&apos;s very busy but the seating flow works well so we got a seat easily.
It&apos;s an order food first then you are seated restaurant. The menu includes traditional American dishes as well as some latin American style foods eg tacos, heuvos ranchos
My wife had paramount breakfast 2 eggs ham potatoes and toast. I had the caramel and banana french toast with 2 eggs sunny side up. Cafe mocha latte and hot chocolate 
4 stars because drinks were a bit warm, hotter would have been better. Potatoes were a bit salty. Otherwise great meal"
2,I am surprised with so many good reviews. This place serves just ordinary breakfast and brunch items. I ordered veggie omelette and Nutella waffle.  The waffle was very dry with a very little whipped butter in the middle. The omelette was just ordinary with extra cheese inside. The home fries were fried in old oil with burnt smell. Also they do not have any reservation process nor they write down your name and number. Literally you will have to wait outside the whole time.
3,"I&apos;m giving this place 3 stars because everything was okay. The french toast was good but was also super sweet so if you&apos;re into dessert for breakfast, order that. The eggs were also really good surprisingly. On the other hand, the pancakes were super dry which made it hard to finish. Everything was affordable though so they get points for that. Maybe the lunch here is better."
3,"This place was pretty good but felt that it was a little too hyped up. I came here because it was a suggestion of a friend who said it was his favorite but I personally, wasn&apos;t that impressed. I split the breakfast burrito and french toast with the friend and I didn&apos;t feel like the food was anything special although I still enjoyed it. However, the service definitely plays a part in the lower rating as well. It was pretty busy when we got there so I wasn&apos;t expecting much service wise but it did feel like we had to beg for refills and didn&apos;t see our server once after placing our order.  All in all, I would say that this place was pretty average but not at all worth the wait in my opinion (which was 30 min when we got there and probably double that by the time we left)."
5,"Great breakfast spot, good prices, and amazing service. I really enjoyed the outside seating area and everything was pretty clean and sanitary. Defenitely recommend if you want good food and fast service. The omelettes are very filling and delicious, they come with bread and seasoned potatoes. They also have good waffles and pancakes"
4,I stumbled upon this fine during the cover 19 crisis. It was the first restaurant in Beacon Hill I came upon that was open. It was a Sunday morning around brunch time. I had already eaten breakfast and while the menu looked so delicious for brunch I decided to go to lunch option. I chose the turkey Panini. I went inside and ordered. There was one girl ringing up orders and one cook. The place was clean and you could tell well run. They took my order and I waited outside. I went back inside and it was ready. I sat outside on a bench and the sandwich was absolutely divine packed with turkey and avocado.And my decks venture to Boston I will definitely stop there.
5,"Such a great brunch this weekend! I went with four other friends and we all loved everything. I got a mimosa to start with, I like it with hardly any OJ but other than that it was a good breakfast drink. For my meal I got the tomato, basil, mozzarella omelette. It was so yummy. I love the home fries that come on the side they were perfectly crispy. The toast was cold but that&apos;s hard to keep warm with so much food to bring out. We also got chocolate chip pancakes for the table and they were delicious. They had cinnamon in them and it was such a good touch! Loved everything here it was really great!"
4,"Tried this Boston Diner for breakfast. We heard it gets busy but we didn&apos;t have any wait arriving at 9:25am. 

We ordered a Bacon, Egg &amp; Cheese Sandwich, Blue Berry Pancakes, Chocolate chip Pancakes and had to try the Boston Cream pancakes. All the food was ready shortly after we ordered. 

The Bacon, Egg &amp; Cheese sandwich was pretty straightforward (nothing special). The hits were the fluffy and moist pancakes!  All of the Pancakes were pretty large portions. The Boston Cream pancakes tasted as well as it looked. They are definitely worth a try if you are into Pancakes for breakfast!"
1,"Food:
I ordered quinoa protein bowl which was $11. It has arugula, beets, goat cheese, nuts and it was quite filling. Dressing was light and didn&apos;t feel heavy. Would definitely get this again. 

Service:
Absolutely terrible. No sense of customer service at.all. My friends ordered huevos ranchos dish and cinnamon toast. As they shared the huevos ranchos for 20 minutes, the cinnamon toast still hadn&apos;t arrived. We asked three times on the status of our order...they never gave us a direct response and told us to wait. I watched other tables who ordered way after us get THEIR toast + waffles. After asking for the fourth time, someone working there gave us a refund on the cinnamon toast which we never received. And no apology whatsoever. Just a blank face. It&apos;s one thing to forget..but to not even apologize for making us wait for an order that wasn&apos;t even communicated is unpleasant service. We were literally just sitting there after we finished our food and watching food get served (hoping that it would be our cinnamon toast). 

If I&apos;m hungry and nothing to eat then maybe I&apos;ll come here as last resort. But I&apos;d rather go to a restaurant where they have better service bc service is everything."
5,"Quite possibly the best fries I&apos;ve ever had, servers were very friendly. We will definitely be backn"
5,Great breakfast spot at Beacon Hill. Awesome food at a great price.
5,"I love this place! I can&apos;t believe it&apos;s taken me as long as it did to get here. The line was almost out the door when we arrived and I&apos;m told that the norm there. You can&apos;t sit until you&apos;ve ordered your food from the counter. You have the entire time you&apos;re in line to look at the menu in the board, smell all the amazing food being cooked and see all the different dishes coming out. I changed my mind about to get for brunch at least 4 times while we were in line. It&apos;s a little loud and definitely wicked tight on space but the food is totally worth it! The portions are generous and the food is cooked perfectly! The pancakes were fluffy, the eggs of the omelette were soft -- I loved it all! I wouldn&apos;t recommend going with a group larger than 4-5."
5,"Luckily for us - we found The Paramount and what an experience. It&apos;s beautiful and everyone who works here seems like they are very proud of it. The Paramount has an outstanding Baby Spinach and Tomato Omelet, try it I believe you would love it, I certainly love it. The team is really courteous. I really liked that. Definitely going to go back!"
