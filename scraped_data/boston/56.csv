5,"Everything taste great.  Loved the octopus and gnocchi.  The veal Milanese was the  best I had in the area. 

Service was really good too.  Dining parties are pretty spaced out during the pandemic."
5,"My partner and I held our own &quot;Italian restaurant week&quot; for our birthday + anniversary celebration and out of the 7 restaurants we tried this week, this is our favorite! 

The restaurant is adamant about covid safety, which made me feel safe to dine there. The tables were well spread apart and the ambiance was elegant and chic. Although we went during colder weather, their patio area seems to be great for summer. 

For meals, we had lobster pasta and steak, along with risotto, salad, and tartare to share. The meals were flavorful and filled with emotion. The lobster was my favorite as it was decadent and buttery as I like it. The presentations for all the dishes are stunning. It is visible that the chefs are proud and experienced in their work! They friendly waiter even decorated our dessert dish at the end to wish us a happy anniversary + birthday. 

Most importantly, the waiter was genuine and personal. We had a lengthy conversation about my visit to Italy and the knowledge and appreciation I gained of Italian food since then. By the end of the conversation, we felt like we made a new friend when we left! I&apos;d come back to dine here just to be in the company of our new friend.

Overall, I cannot rave about this restaurant enough! Highly recommended."
5,"Dined in during COVID - was able to make reservations online through open table. 

The lobster gnocchi dish was delicious and I highly recommend. I think it was one of the most memorable dishes I&apos;ve had this year. There was a perfect proportion of gnocchi and lobster and broth (although I wouldn&apos;t mind more lobster). I also got the octopus for appetizer but it wasn&apos;t as memorable as the lobster gnocchi. 

Service was attentive and there was a bag they give you to leave your mask in."
5,"Absolutely stellar meal at Sorellinas. The sauce with meatballs was amazing - deep rich flavors. The gnocchi with lobster was so rich and delicious. The pasta with wild mushrooms was good but not quite as flavorful. The veal entree was out of this world. Every bite was heaven. We finished with the Limone dessert which was wonderful. Great service, beautiful and COVID- safe. A must visit for a special night out."
5,"Wonderful! Everything about the meal was perfect. Generous bread portions, great waiters, thoughtful menu"
1,"Awful borderline racist experience?
We had a reservation last night for my best friend birthday at 9pm.
We got there on time and were told dismissively that people were leaving soon and that our table will be ready any minute. 
We were never given any update on the waiting time and ended up having to ask every 15 minutes about the situation. 
After 30-40min of waiting we asked one last time for an update and nothing.
We ended up leaving as we had no idea how much longer we would have to wait. 
We are three black women and after seeing how other people were treated we are left wondering if it was because of the color of our skin...
Racism or not an apology or update on the waiting time would have been the decent thing to do. 
Extremely disappointed! Especially for a Birthday night!"
5,Exquisite restaurant for those special events.  The filet mignon just melted in my mouth.  Other members of our dinner party also enjoyed their meals but were a bit jealous of my selection after I shared some.  Large wine selection but very pricey.  Highly recommend
4,"Eataly was out of polenta so I came over here. Pretty good! Would return to try their chocolate cake as well.

Forgettable bread, and wasn&apos;t impressed with the octopus."
5,"Very few resturaunts reach the caliber of Sorrelina&apos;s. Courteous and attentive staff, beautiful ambiance and decor, and the most sensational dining in Boston.. We&apos;ve been going for years in they NEVER disappoint!!"
5,"Can I please add a star to my 5 previous ones??!!
During the confinement and not being able to enjoy the dining room, we ordered pick up food and it was just beyond great. The phone call to order the food, the call back from the chef bringing our attention to an ingredient we are allergic to, the pick up, the quality of packaging, and I can&apos;t rave enough about the food. Everything was beyond expectations. Thank you"
5,"Sorellina food, staff and service are simply superb.  In my opinion Sorellina is the best restaurant in Boston. Tonight, Erica took our takeout order over the telephone and she was lovely and professional.  We shall order regularly from this fine restaurant.  Thank you.  The salads, pasta, chicken and desserts were nicely packaged and we had an excellent dinner at home thanks to the wonderful staff and service."

One of the best meals I&apos;ve had in Boston! My friend and I got to try these dishes:

- Salmon tartare $27
- MACCHERONCELLI (Feather Brook Farms meatballs, Montepulciano sauce, Parmigiano) $20 as an appetizer
- FILET MIGNON* - Greater Omaha, Nebraska (8 ounce, beech mushrooms, pearl onions, whipped potatoes, Montepulciano sauce) $44
- RIBEYE* Greater Omaha, Nebraska (prime, 14 oz, king trumpets, broccolini, bone marrow, and garlic vin cotto) $48

I liked the salmon tartare a lot! My filet mignon was a little too dry, even as I asked for a medium. The meatballs were good, but both my friend and I felt like it tasted a bit funny for some reason? We also enjoyed the molten chocolate cake, which was a solid dessert choice.

I love the decor and the table set up on the inside. For once, I don&apos;t feel like I am so crammed sitting at a Boston restaurant or continuously have to make ways for waiters to get by the aisle. 

My server was friendly but as always (as I said in an earlier review), in my limited experience at high-end restaurants, I don&apos;t believe I&apos;ve encountered anyone yet where I was like okay this person entirely deserves a 20% tip. In fact, it is always these family-run businesses where I&apos;d feel welcomed and be willing to tip 20% wholeheartedly.

Their bathrooms are unisex and located by their entrance. They are clean and have both paper towels and hand dryers available. 

Overall, I enjoyed my dining experience here. Next time, I&apos;d definitely order the ribeye!"
4,"I honestly expected a lot more based on reviews. The food was great, but portions were extremely small. I ordered the cod fish, which was good but could have had more flavor. The menu stated it also came with lobster and gnocchi. There was probably 1 bite of each on my plate. However, I tried the lobster gnocchi main dish was tasty. 

Apps I enjoyed were the tuna tartare and salmon tartare. I didn&apos;t enjoy the wasabi on the tuna tartare though as I am not a fan. The burrata was alright, nothing special. We also ordered the eggplant side dish which was decent. Truffle fries were pretty good too! 

For dessert, we ordered the cioccolato, bombolini, and gelato and sorbet. I loved the cioccolato. It melted in my mouth. We also ordered ice wine which was delicious! It was sweet with an amazing flavor to it. It was pretty pricey at $35 per glass but I&apos;d say it was worth every penny! 

Service was absolutely impeccable. Great place for a business dinner or dinner for a special occasion. Just make sure you order enough apps and sides due to the extremely small portions!"
5,The lobster gnocchi is so fresh and perfectly cooked. The veal Milanese was crispy and delicious. Desserts were great too!!! Definitely recommend
3,"Whether you&apos;re having oysters and cocktails at the bar or dining experience at a table, you will be no less than impressed by Sorrelina. The service is professional and top notch. I will personally vouch that Sorellina has some of the best oysters in Boston - convince me otherwise. Every meal I&apos;ve ever had has been incredible and doesn&apos;t taste mass produced like some restaurants. If you&apos;re taking someone here they will not be disappointed and you will look like you have great taste. Perfect for dates, probably too intimate for coworkers 

UPDATE:
I just had dinner at Sorrelina tonight and am really disappointed by my experience. While the food remains amazing, our server lowered our dining experience. He told us about the ravioli special but failed to mention that it included mushrooms. When I ordered it, I was surprised by the mushrooms and the fact that he never even asked if we had allergies or dietary preferences. He also didn&apos;t come back once during the meal to see if we were enjoying it. It wasn&apos;t busy at all when we were there so I&apos;m curious as to why he slipped up or if the overall service has gone down. I&apos;d like to come back to see if this was a one off experience but I&apos;m nervous to waste a dinner out again."
5,"This is my favorite restaurant in Boston, we also tried Mistral and Ostra.  We tried quite a few dishes and my favorites were the Oysters, Lobster Gnocchi, Polpo, Veal Milanese, Valrhona Chocolate Cake, Homemade Ice Cream.  Both the service and quality of the food were excellent and we felt very safe while dining in at the restaurant."
5,"Sorellina you are totally exceptional, I had an incredible experience here yesterday. They have so many selections and prices are great. All of the staff are extremely helpful - you truly feel welcome and looked after. I really love every single thing I have ordered here. Love that spot! Will be back."
5,"I visited this great restaurant two nights in a row for company events.

Super happy with good, service and variety of dishes. Solid wine list as well.

Dishes tried:

- Polpo/octopus appetizer (5 stars, best dish)
- artichoke carpaccio with black truffles appetizer (4.5 stars)
- oyster appetizer (4 stars, too many items added, hid true oyster flavor. Still solid dish)
- branzino entree (4.5 stars. Cooked perfectly! Simple and tasty)
- scallops entree (4.5 stars. Great flavors, slightly small portion with only 4 scallops)
- filet mignon entree (5 stars. Cooked to absolute perfection - medium rare)
- broccoli rabe side dish (4.5 stars)
- mushrooms side dish (3.5 stars, tasted all garlic)
- bombardino/ Italian donuts dessert (4.5 stars. Super fresh, still warm and light)

Would rate 4.5 if I could, but closer to 5 than 4 due to  prime service."
5,"This is one of our favorite spots in Boston.  Great service, good atmosphere, excellent variety of dishes and terrific food.  We went back a few weeks ago and had another great meal.

We started with the Crescent City and Harrys Peaches for drinks.  The Crescent City is really nice if you like different takes on brown spirits.  We did a small half bottle of Tignanello along with the crudo and zuppa (a lobster bisque) and then the halibut and salmon.  Everything was cooked incredibly well, nicely seasoned and delicious.  

Sadly, we were pretty stuffed so had to pass on anything more than the biscotti for dessert but those were also pretty nice.  Another excellent night at Sorellina!"
4,This is an old school must go and very romantic experience kind of restaurant. The decor is gorgeous and food is delish. You must give it a try.
