5,"NOTE: Giacomo&apos;s is still cash only during the pandemic so make sure you have some!!!
Stopped into Giacomo&apos;s after an 8 hour train ride into Boston and was in desperate need of food. I was not disappointed! HUGE portions for reasonable price and TONS of seafood in the linguine with calamari and mussels I ordered. 
The people with me ordered a large Caesar (huge portion and was great! I loved the dressing and the croutons and 10$ for a huge one!) and the caprese (again very Big Bang for buck and fresh and delicious.) 
I ordered the linguine with calamari and mussels and scampi sauce (you pick your pasta, the seafood(s) combo you want, and the sauce you want with it so easy to customize!) and it was DELICIOUS! So much calamari and mussels plus the scampi was absolutely delicious. If anything, I almost wish there were more noodles! If you were splitting with someone, you could definitely get a Caesar and one pasta dish and leave satisfied.
We also all tried a different wine and enjoyed them all. I got a Riesling, and my friends for a Pinot noir and a Cabernet Franc.
Overall, a great spot, great portions, great for groups of 4 (that seemed to be the largest table they had right now) and still offering indoor dining! Would recommend if you&apos;re looking for a good, hearty pasta dish!"
5,"Giacomo&apos;s, a warm spot on a cold night. We were lucky enough to be seated quickly in the newly renovated upstairs area. The view out the window was straight out of a movie. We were greeted quickly. Deena and the other server worked together to give us the best service. Her recommendation of the c√°ptese for an appetizer was spot on. The addition of the charred red bell peppers were a nice spin from the traditional style. My lobster ravioli was definitely the star of the entrees, although all dishes were fantastic. 

Y&apos;all are amazing. Keep pushing thru this pandemic. See you next time!"
5,"Among the restaurants I ate in Boston during Labor Day Weekend 2020, Giacomo&apos;s in North End definitely ranks on top as one of my favorites! 

We decided to go for an early lunch/brunch on Saturday morning and was delighted by the available outdoor seating. The restaurant was able to space out a fair amount of dining tables on the sidewalk and street just outside the restaurant. Many restaurants during this time have limited seating outside, but Giacomo&apos;s has two long rows of seating that start directly outside its entrance, extending outward to the left of the restaurant (facing away from its entrance). We were able to pick our dining table and sit comfortably distanced from all others!

The food was top notch! I still remember how tasty and crunchy their calamari was. The deep fried starter was served along with fried bell peppers and sweet peppers, which are perfect complements to the calamari. The lobster ravioli was simply amazing. The sauce had a perfect amount of creaminess and cheesiness and was a perfect size to share for two!

I was quite impressed by the quickness of service at Giacomo&apos;s during this unprecedented time. I highly recommend visiting during weekend lunch hours!"
5,"Found this wonderful small neighborhood restaurant a few minutes walk from the Marriott Copley Place hotel. Got there early on a Monday night so no trouble getting a table...all the staff were very friendly and professional. Very nice and affordable menu selections. I asked the waitress for recommendations and she named a few then said they also had a pasta special...lobster and shrimp over homemade fusilli with a choice of a number of sauces. Being a pesto lover I chose that.

The food arrived within minutes...and it was magnificent. At least 6 jumbo shrimp and 10 lobster clawsl. The sauce was amazing and I struggled to finish it...a large portion indeed.

Highly recommend Giacomo&apos;s if your in the Back Bay/South Boston area!"
5,"Always a great experience at Giacomo&apos;s!!! The food is stellar, do not miss out on the Giacomo sauce on whatever pasta dish you get. Service is always quick and attentive.  Seating outside has been accommodated (weather pending) during COVID.   Highly recommend!!"
4,"As someone who never craves Italian food or pasta, their food is absolutely delicious. I heard SO much about Giacomo&apos;s from Bostoners so decided to give it a try. I ordered their Frutti di Mare in their fra diavolo sauce, Lobster Ravioli, and Goat cheese gnocchi (on their special menu) the two times I have been here. 

Their seafood is incredibly fresh and their portions are massive! I am SUPER picky about the texture of pasta but found it to be perfectly cooked. The flavors were so RICH, and there was just enough seasoning to give it a little kick instead of your generic marinara sauce. Also love that they didn&apos;t skimp out on the seafood in the Frutti di Mare - it was loaded with scallops, mussels, shrimp, squid, and clams.  Given how big the plates are, I could have comfortably shared one of their pasta dishes and been satisfied. However, there are so many different pasta combinations here, it&apos;s hard to share since I want to try it all! I still haven&apos;t tried any of their cream-based pasta sauces and would love to come back to try it (with my lactaid of course!!). 

The space is a bit cramped but still very cozy, and it&apos;s expected for most restaurants in this area. We didn&apos;t have to wait to get seated on a Sunday night, though they were about an hour from closing. I was a bit disappointed by the service however, we tried calling twice to see if there was space for us to dine-in but I got hung up on twice but we decided to drive over and see for ourselves. When we got there, it was super unclear on who to talk to to get a table, and service felt a bit cold but it might just be me... 

Also, CASH ONLY or they take Venmo (they will give you a code to scan). Kinda wish they would offer credit card in this day in age."
5,"TLDR: wonderful Italian food with a seafood focus. Not sure if it&apos;s always cash/Venmo only or just a quarantine thing. 

Broke my quarantine with their outdoor seating. Tables were all spaced apart more than 6 feet. Our waiter wore a mask and gave us plenty of space. The calamari was freshly fried and I love that they had fried peppers in it as well. I got the clam and musssels linguine in their giacomo sauce while my wife got the veal. Overall a great meal."
5,"All time favorite Italian restaurant in Boston! Seafood is extremely fresh and the sauces are to die for. My go-to is always the Fra Diavolo sauce. 

Things to order:
Frutti di Mare
Shrimp &amp; Scallops
FRIED CALAMARI APPETIZER!!!
Lobster Ravioli

*Bonus: this location accepts reservations"
5,Went here with my girlfriend for date night last night and we got the salmon fettuccine and the tuna and swordfish fettuccine dishes! They had some clear banner barriers between some of the tables and the tables were pretty well spaced. Good service! Good food! Great portions! I&apos;m someone who can EAT and I was pretty satisfied after the meal...my girlfriend finished maybe half of her pasta
5,"Great pasta and seafood place! Huge portions and everything we had was delicious. I think the original one is on the North End but judging by the reviews and pictures of both places they look equally as good. 

No wait at 630 on a Wednesday. Got full by 730. The wait staff was really nice and I think the owner/manager greeted us at the door. They brought soft yummy bread right to our table when we sat down which was great since we were starving. And brought waters right away too. 

The dishes are reasonably priced for the amount of food they give. 17 dollars for the linguine and scallop dish I ordered. Probably about 1lb of pasta and 10 scallops! Huge! My boyfriend got the tuna and swordfish fettuccine in a pesto sauce. The pesto sauce was sooo good and creamy. I liked it better than the sauce I had. Which was supposed to be a tomato and lobster cream sauce but it just tasted like tomato sauce. The swordfish (and the tuna- but I really liked the swordfish) was cooked so well and really paired better than I expected with the pesto sauce. 

We were contemplating getting the 65 dollar meal for 2 but that is pretty expensive. We saw it come out and it was like 4 servings. We wouldn&apos;t have been able to finish it and to share it with more than 2 they charge you an extra 10 dollars a plate. We got 2 huge delicious dishes for 34 total on their regular menu and that was plenty. 

The Tiramisu for dessert was amazing. The mascarpone cream was light and fluffy and a little cheesy and a lot delicious. Bold coffee flavor and great consistency with the moist cake. I had tiramisu in Italy and this was better!

Cash only too btw. 

Loved our experience here. Next time I am in Boston I will definitely come back again!"
5,"I&apos;ve lived in Boston for five years and often passed by Giacomo&apos;s (in the North End). However, I never ate there- I always thought of it as a tourist trap. I was severely mistaken!

Giacomo&apos;s is my new favorite restaurant- delicious food, huge portions, and super affordable! The only downside is that you&apos;ll probably have to wait for a table- but it&apos;s worth it.

The complimentary bread was good- pretty standard Italian bread. I had the garlic bread appetizer. It was the same bread as the appetizer, but drenched in garlic oil. I had looked at pictures on Yelp and thought the bread had cheese- sadly it did not. However, it was still definitely worth the $4. 

I ordered the lobster ravioli, based on the reviews. Lobster is my favorite food and I am very picky. The lobster ravioli was the best I&apos;ve ever had. Eight plump ravioli, stuffed with fresh lobster meat. The sauce was creamy and delicious. Highly recommend!

For desert, I was torn between the chocolate truffle bomb and tiramisu. My friend ordered the chocolate truffle bomb and I tried it. The cake (part of the truffle bomb) was nothing special- standard chocolate cake. I ordered the tiramisu, and am very happy I did! The ladyfingers were soaked in liquor and the cake was super moist. 

Highly recommend!"
5,"I came looking for superb Italian food, and that&apos;s exactly what I got. From the excellent food to the wonderful service, it&apos;s everything a foodie&apos;s looking for when trying a new restaurant. 

We waited roughly an hour on a weekday, as to be expected. We were seated at the counter where we had a great view of the kitchen. We ordered the lobster ravioli and chicken parmesan. 

It has a very intimate ambiance. From looking around, customers were having a great time - many knew the employees even. It was a blast to see the Italians joke around, I&apos;d known I came to the right place. 

Our food arrived and I dug into my ravioli. The richness of the sauce with the beautiful texture of pasta and lobster danced on my tongue. It was a little salty, but I&apos;d much prefer it to be a little more than bland. I tried the chicken parmesan and it was fantastic as well. It was so good that I was scraping the marina sauce off the plate with my fork. It took some willpower to not lick the plate clean.

For dessert, we ordered the tiramisu. And the tiramisu alone would deserve this restaurant five stars. It was beautiful. The best tiramisu I&apos;ve ever had! To this day, I still crave that slice. If I return to Boston, this might be the restaurant I&apos;ll visit first."
5,Delicious Italian food! The Bolognese tasted like it came from my Italian nana&apos;s kitchen. The pappardelle pasta was a special for the night but I would highly suggest it if that&apos;s an option. There is  plenty of outdoor seating and the South End location is currently taking reservations- possibly due to COVID. Some street parking available if needed but pretty tough to find parking during peak hours. All in all-  great food and service !
4,"DINNER REVIEW

If you don&apos;t want to wait in the long lines in the North End for some authentic Italian food, Giacomo&apos;s is a great option in the heart of the amazing culinary neighborhood that is the South End.

The restaurant is small but very homey...you will likely be nudged up next to diners at different tables. If you do have to wait, Anchovies next door is a great dive bar.

We went on a Friday at 5:45 so we got seated immediately. We started with the Caesar Salad and Burrata (which was a special) both of which were fresh and tasty. I wouldn&apos;t say these are &quot;must gets&quot; but they are good.

What I would say is a must get is the pasta (as it should be no surprise, at an Italian restaurant). Per the recommendations of the waiter, I had the frutti di mare with fra diavola sauce. The pasta was chock full of beautiful mussels, clams, oysters, and more and the sauce was perfectly spicy. This sauce...WOW!

Key things to know: It&apos;s cash only and they take reservations, but otherwise the wait will be long."
5,"This Italian food is out of this world. My daughters and I loved the fried calamari with the delicious sauce, the seafood linguini and the gnocchi! We definitely be going back on our next trip to Boston!"
4,"Have been to both Giacomos, this current location in the South End and their main location in the North End. Usually go to the one in the South End as it is more accessible to me, takes reservations, and the wait is a lot shorter (main location you will probably wait on average for 2 hours). Though I would say the North End one is noticeably better and would recommend going to that one at least one.

Onward to the food review. I usually order a plate of Calamari and their signature Frutti Di Mare with the Giacomo sauce. The calamari is delicious and pretty fresh seafood. Though it can be a hit or miss in terms of portion. Sometimes we get a lot, sometimes we get minuscule amounts. The Frutti Di Mare is one of if not the best Italian pasta dish I have had and it has a delicious sauce that goes along with it. It comes with a generous amount of seafood ranging from shrimps, scallops, clams, etc and a good-sized amount of linguine for its price. It is a pretty big portion that you will probably only finish half of it so you can have the rest some other day.

If you are around the Prudential or South End area, I would recommend giving this place a try if you want authentic, high quality Italian food."
4,"This is a really traditional Italian restaurant specializing in pasta dishes. Note that this place is in fact cash only and unlike their location in North End, you can book a reservation ahead of time!

We had the Lobster Ravioli, Frutti di Mare, and Fettuccine with Salmon and Sun-dried Tomatoes. The portion of raviolis that was given looked to be pretty small compared to other dishes, but it&apos;ll definitely fill you up because of how heavy the delicious garlic white sauce is. The Frutti di Mare pasta with Giacomo sauce was very good as well - the seafood had very good flavor and the Fettuccine dish was also very delicious - lots of tomato flavor. Overall, the food was delicious and the portion size was on the perfect-larger size, and the prices for the food was very fair.

Highly recommend this place!!"
5,My daughter and J enjoyed a wonderful meal - delivered to us hot - from this charming eatery in the South End.  We especially liked the Musssls in Guiacomo sauce - a lovely red sauce.
5,"Giacomo&apos;s is my favorite restaurant in the world. I have had 3 birthday dinners there over the past 7 years. Every time someone visits me in Boston, I take them to Giacomo&apos;s. On my last night in Boston, I ordered take-out from Giacomo&apos;s (see attached photos). My favorite dishes are:

1) Butternut squash ravioli.

2) Homemade fusilli with fra diavolo sauce and seafood. The amount of seafood they put on the plate is very generous.

Their calamari, garlic bread, and burrata appetizer are also fantastic. Giacomo&apos;s has very reasonably priced bottles of wine ($20-25! for the whole bottle!). I will dearly miss Giacomo&apos;s when I move.

I will also add that Giacomo&apos;s is doing a great job with their takeout service during the coronavirus pandemic. I ordered my food for takeout at a particular time. It was ready when I showed up, and was kept hot under heating lamps. The dishes were nicely garnished, tasted EXACTLY like I remembered when I ordered in a restaurant, and generously-priced/portioned as always. They even packed me bread!"
5,"Primary location is the way to do it. However, because it was so cold + bad timing, decided to come here tonight. Much more seating available with little to no wait time. Same menu as the famous location over on Hanover. This location definitely let&apos;s you &quot;chill&quot; vs. rushed service at other location. 

Went with calamari, fried mozz, garlic cheesy bread, chicken parm, pasta - all fantastic. Top notch service great wine pairings as well. Will be back!"
