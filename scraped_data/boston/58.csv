5,"We stopped here due to a recommendation made by a family member and I&apos;m so glad we did. The place was decorated awesomely, the food was good, and we had a great server.

I had the fish and chips, the table had a stuffed lobster (very expensive, $80 when we got it, but seems like a fair price for the quality), ribs, crab cakes, and the lobster roll. Everyone was very pleased with their food and the portions were pretty large.

As for COVID, the restaurant did a great job of maintaining cleanliness. There were dividers between all of the table, all of our servers were wearing masks and even gloves.

Our waiter, Justice, was extremely friendly and on top of filling our drinks. He was very attentive to our table and overall had a great attitude.

Again, I&apos;d have to say may favorite part of this restaurant was the decor. The Freedom Trail is depicted in 3D models that you&apos;d have to see to understand how cool they are.

Also, this place is the oldest operating restaurant in the US! Definitely a must-see."
4,"Walking the streets near Paul Revere&apos;s house is a crazy trip down americas memory lane and this restaurant fits right in. Old school digs with a dive vibe makes you feel like a Boston local. I never would have thought cheese on oysters would be a good mixture, but then I remembered cheese makes just about everything better!  Don&apos;t be scared to come out of your comfort zone every now and then, you might surprise yourself by what you find out you enjoy eating!"
5,"My boyfriend and I had so much fun here. What a great historic spot. 

Location: it&apos;s in one of the oldest buildings in Boston. Tons of great things to do and see around here. 

Food: the food was great. We had the clam chowder and shared the lobster roll. It was my very first one and I thought it was delicious. 

Price: it was a little pricey, but we were okay with it because we felt we were paying for a whole experience, not just the food. 

Service: EXCELLENT. I am kicking myself because I can&apos;t remember our servers name. She had brown (reddish brown?) curly hair. I would guess Boston born and raised. Gave us so much history and even shared some celebrities that dined there. I think she&apos;s worked there for some time. She was really passionate and knowledgeable about the restaurant and was truly a joy to talk to. I hope it&apos;s easy to figure out who I am describing. Masks don&apos;t make it as easy to identify features. 

Atmosphere: man, oh man, this place is very cool. It&apos;s like a museum. Our server encourage us to explore. It was such a treat. So much history. 

Don&apos;t skip this place. Even if it&apos;s not the best food in Boston, it&apos;s absolutely worth the experience."
5,"The lighting that hangs over the tables is YELLOW so taking pictures that give this amazing food justice is hard!!!! 
We LOVED the Union Oyster House, our server was the friendliest I believe her name was Mary and the food was superb! The oysters were in the most delicious brine and the cold lobster roll recommended by our server was so delicious, it was my first experience with a lobster roll and I Couldn&apos;t have imagined it going better. 
Please go here it is wonderful! 
Oh and it was pretty cool to sit next to &quot;The Kennedy Table&quot; 
10 stars!"
3,"Truly not a fan.  And that&apos;s just a learning lesson regarding tourist traps.  
The nostalgia is legit, but with all the places available, this isn&apos;t my first choice. 
With that said, the service is on point, located in the hot spot, and easily walking distance to other attractions."
2,"Went here on a Sunday for a quick light lunch and was feeling some oysters and chowdah (when in Boston, right?!). Seated at an old booth with tight seating but I guess the historic feel was the theme. Our waitress was aces and was super nice and accommodating! 

We ordered four cups of chowder and one of us had the corn chowder, which she immediately knew something didn&apos;t taste right when the sourness kicked in. Me being the guy that trolls and thinks everyone is being dramatic, I try the damn soup and low and behold...it was like sour milk. Immediately sent it back and the waitress looked confused and said she would bring it back to chef. She comes back and tells the chef sends his apologies and that they will take off the soup of the day. 

Oysters were fresh, food was subpar, soup cups were tiny. The spoiled soup thing really threw everyone off so that kind of ruined the meal for us cause we were skeptical of what else went bad. Place also needs a bit of a face lift."
5,"Delicious dinner, the clams, oysters, the fish and the Boston cream pie all amazing.  The service was very good and we love the ambiance and the friendly staff specially the gentleman opening and preparing the oysters. We will comeback here every time we visit Boston"
3,"Historic. 
Almost a 200 yr old history. 
Can&apos;t get anymore old-school than this.  
That&apos;s what brought hubs here. 
A Maze within a maze. 
Friendly server. 
Basque Mussels starter were divine. 
So good- we wanted to sip the broth with a spoon. 
&quot;Warm Bread&quot; is actually a corn+floury square cake. 
My alcoholic drink tasted like kool-aid. 
Meaty 1/2 dozen Oysters were good. 
However...
Oyster House doesn&apos;t serve Mignonette. 
Their Clam Chowder contains pork (thank you for letting me know). 
Hubs kinda liked his. 
He also enjoyed his lager.
My fish chowder was chunky but had too much lemon(?) and made it too sour. 
Wrapped up with starters at this point.
Didn&apos;t go further with entrees. 
I guess you come here for the nostalgia."
3,"I came for outdoor seating on a Monday night and the experience was alright. Of course things are different with COVID. The servers were friendly enough.

I ordered the Pan Seared Shrimp &amp; Scallops. The dish was served over rice with sundried tomato sauce. I have to give Union Oyster House credit for HUGE portions. I could barely finish the shrimp and scallops, and definitely couldn&apos;t finish all of the rice! 

I also ordered a Corona which wasn&apos;t totally chilled. On another note, I was happy to see that the cocktail prices were perhaps lowered a bit? I remember them being $10+ pre-COVID but they&apos;re now $10."
5,"We had the most wonderful time here! From the start the waiter told us their oysters were the best. After we tasted them we couldn&apos;t disagree. We came here because of a recommendation from another restaurant down the street. They did say these were going to be the best oysters as well. 

We tried a few other things on the menu like the clam chowder which was good. The crab cakes were very yummy! You will not be disappointed. Oh, and we also ordered French fries haha!"
5,"Very fast service and courteous staff. Loved the oysters , seafood platter and white chocolate martini. I noticed how they practice COVID safety protocols as well. Overall, I recommend visiting this iconic restaurant!"
5,Amazing food and service. And the drinks were on point as well. Oldest restaurant in the US...keep going!
1,"I was recommended to eat here by a couple of locals, the outside was beautiful but was immediately greeted by cold staff that seemed miserable to do their jobs. I ordered the clam chowder and the seafood platter. The food came out fast enough that my dad and I jokingly poked about how the food couldn&apos;t be safe. 

Boy were we right; I immediately started vomiting. I was immediately addressed by the first staff member after arriving back to me table. Her not knowing that I work in health care and am from the coast and have been eating sea food my entire life, made sure to tell me it wasn&apos;t food poising because it can&apos;t happen that fast (not true) so it must be an allergy. I ignored her cause I was focusing on not emptying my stomach contents, or what was left of them, on the table for the third time. 

After running to the bathroom AGAIN, I returned to the table and was hello&apos;d my the manager who came to tell me that my reaction had to be due to my own allergy but he would so kindly, (even though the implications of it being my fault) take my food off the bill. 

I&apos;m typing this from the floor of my hotel with a running count of 7 series of vomit."
2,I&apos;ve been to the UOH once before and told my bf that we must go because its a place you go when you visit Boston. We had reservations at 8. I can definitely  say it was not as good as I remember. The corn cake was delicious as usual but our meals were &quot;Eh&quot;. I ordered the lobster roll and something was left to be desired. He had the breaded shrimp and was not impressed. I don&apos;t know if covid-19 restrictions had anything o due with it but I won&apos;t be going back anytime I visit Boston again. The service was great though.
3,"America&apos;s oldest restaurant seems to live off it&apos;s reputation rather than its quality. While the overall experience was cool (the Kennedy&apos;s sat over there!), I can&apos;t recommend the food. It was overly buttered and salted for my taste, and didn&apos;t provide much in the way of flavour. Before you decide to go, you should realize that you&apos;re really going to a museum that happens to serve food. If visiting places with history is up your alley, head to the Oyster House, if not, stay away. 

The one dish of note were the raw clams that they had on offer. I&apos;ve never had raw clams before, and I can&apos;t say that I&apos;ll be having them again. While I didn&apos;t hate it, I&apos;m not sure that I&apos;ll be a future fan of &quot;like raw chicken from the sea&quot;, as one of my friends described it. Not the best description, but very apt. While I didn&apos;t mind it, I&apos;m not sure why people would really enjoy it"
5,"My top places to visit while I&apos;m in Boston!! The colonial ale by Sam Adams is amazing. It is the closest recipe that Sam Adams has been able to brew that is like ale back during the patriots time.  

I&apos;ve eaten at the bar and at the restaurant.

For the bar - the service is fast. Billy the bartender was a great guy and had excellent service. He is very knowledgeable about the area and about their food/drinks. He is quite personable which I love.

For the restaurant- it is quite large and can seat a lot of people. It is loud as this is a popular restaurant,  but has quite a charm!

I had the shrimp and scallops and both were very tasty in the lemon sauce. We also had the seafood fried platter (forget the name) where they offered calamari, clam, and fish (all fried). The batter was tasty and did not  taste like oil. The clam chowdah was also very good - it was very smooth and had a good balanace  of clams and potatoes. The salmon plate is also delicious as the fish tasted very fresh.

Every time I am in Boston, I will definitely make a pit stop here at the UOH!"
4,"Is an old restaurant with History, however, isn&apos;t the best food at all in Boston, we ordered a see food platter which was good, of course fried with a normal price (27.95$ ) and Lobster salad l Roll ( sandwich)  29.95 which was super expensive because is small, also the flavor wasn&apos;t amazing, just 5/10."
2,"Advertised as the oldest restaurant in America. My travel group and I tried this place. It certainly was old. 

Warning this place is not ADA compliant. No ramp, tons of staid and steps and the bathroom stalls at least for the ladies were so tiny. I&apos;m a small girl and both of my shoulders nearly touched either side of the stall walls. 

You walk in and there is an actual oyster bar to the left. There was more seating upstairs. And then through about her room and then through yet another room. Wonder how many hidden hide away rooms there were. This place is also famous because it was Kennedy&apos;s favorite spot. They even have a booth on the second floor dedicated to him as the &quot;Kennedy Booth&quot;. This apparently was his table he always sat at. 

Ordered oysters. Which were great!  The mixed drink was not so great. My main was a stuffed lobster. It took an eon to arrive and also not so great. It was just full of breading with not so much lobster. I wouldn&apos;t recommend this place if you&apos;re looking for a quality dining experience. However if you&apos;re doing the self guided freedom trail tour this stop is on the way. I&apos;d recommend to make a quick stop at the oyster bar and have a few oysters and walk upstairs to check out the Kennedy booth."
4,"Wow was the food here good. The cornbread was what did it for me. Can you believe something as simple as cornbread? Really how simple is cornbread? I think getting it right is an art. An art they have nailed to perfection.
We were happy with our meals and happy to be at a restaurant so well known for their offerings.
Great atmosphere."
3,"The first time I ate here, I dined at the half moon oyster bar downstairs and spent $40 on a plate of so-so oysters. This time, I returned and we decided to eat upstairs in the restaurant part. Know that there are 3 rooms set throughout the restaurant ... bottom floor is bright, upper portion is the old part and the most historic/dark and upper side room is brighter with windows but not at all historic.

This is mainly a tourist restaurant these days which serves average to below average seafood churned out to the masses. My suggestion is to ask at check-in if you can be seated in the oldest dining room, if you want the whole historic experience though it does feel a bit dark and dingy. Ask for The Kennedy booth, if it&apos;s available which is the big booth near the bar in the back. It is supposedly where JFK sat who was a regular ... although when I was a kid, I do remember a booth downstairs to the left of the oyster bar as having a plaque/photo and dedication, so who knows. Often restaurants designate the worst tables as &apos;histpric&apos; so people don&apos;t complain about them and the &apos;Kennedy booth&apos; is right next to a busy service bar.

The food here ... the clam chowder we got was loaded with flour and/or corn starch which is used to thicken it. It was a thick paste and had little to no clams or flavor. At $7 PER CUP!!! obviously this is a signature dish which they know they can charge a lot for but it was a piss poor effort and I wouldn&apos;t order again. It was also served barely warm. If charging $7 for a small cup of soup it better be good ... and this wasn&apos;t.

The fish of the day was a Sole, which I ordered broiled. It came as a thick piece of fish ... it looked nothing like sole. I believe they brought me haddock by mistake. No way was this sole. It was covered in a thick coating of burned tasting breadcrumbs and paprika. It was rubbery and had a strange and offputting taste ... hard to put my finger on but maybe it was the loads of paprika? I&apos;d never order this again.

Other had fried scallops and clams, which were fine ... maybe a slight taste of old oil which needed to be changed ... but it&apos;s hard to mess up fried seafood. The lobster roll was also fine ... maybe a little over dressed and the portion size was smaller than expected for the price. Mostly smaller pieces of claw meet with little tail. For the price, there are better lobster rolls in town. All meals come with cornbread which tastes made from a mix but is sort of nice. The Boston Baked Beans are $6.50 on their own as a side ... not worth it but your waitress may substitute them for french fries as your side for free if you ask. The cole slaw is nasty.

I give 4 stars for the atmosphere and because it is such a &apos;Bostonian&apos; experience that usually people from out of town will be happy if you bring them here purely from a historic atmosphere experience that they&apos;ll overlook the mediocre food at high prices. My favorite seafood restaurant in the city is the Atlantic Fish Company near Newbury Street and The Boston Common. If you are looking for good seafood in a classy atmosphere, you&apos;d do better here. If you are looking for a historic experience in a famous restaurant and don&apos;t mind average food, you&apos;ll be fine at The Union Oyster House."
