5,"Safe restaurant during the pandemic, taking all the precautions with great hot pot. I wanted a second portion! I will be back for sure"
5,"All COVID precautions are being taken! This is the first restaurant I&apos;ve been to since quarantine started, and was pleasantly surprised by how good the experience was. Out of the few hot pot places in Boston I&apos;ve been to, this shabu-zen has just the right balance of quality and price."
5,"The best. Of course. BUT where are all the veteran staff / servers? The schedule appears to have been changed and no longer prioritizes the veteran server team. Very disappointing. Please return the old / predictable, evening schedules for the team members who have been there the longest. MANY people miss their familiar faces and amazing service."
4,"This was one of my first Covid dining in experiences; I was satisfied with the level of precaution the restaurant took (taking temperatures, writing down phone numbers for contact tracing, etc), but I was a bit surprised at how crowded the restaurant got on a Sunday evening, and by the time we left 80% of the tables were filled, which made me a bit uncomfortable.

Food-wise, I was pretty satisfied with the quality of ingredients for the hot pot. The meats and veggies were all fresh, and I was impressed at how spicy the Spicy Szechuan broth was. The overall set up of the hot pot tables was nice - everyone has a personal sized hot pot and the temperature controls are all on the waiters&apos; side, so you don&apos;t have to worry about any of it.

Our bill came out to ~$50 for 2 hot pots, so slightly expensive but for good quality ingredients. Would go again, but maybe when Covid is over / on a less crowded day."
5,"This is my absolute favorite shabu shabu restaurant. I&apos;ve eaten at quite a few and I always think back to my time in Boston at Shabu-Zen and how much I miss it! Located right in Chinatown. My favorite broth is their tom yum, super flavorful with the lemon grass and just the right amount of sourness. We ordered the combo plates and the meats are very high quality, the marbling is drool worthy. They really take care of you here and it&apos;s worth the wait in my opinion if there is one."
5,"Service was quick and friendly! Everyone there is so nice. I always get the Tum yum with extra spice and alternate between the ribeye and beef. I recommend the udon noodles with the tum yum! Broth flavor 10/10, so flavorful!"
4,"I dined here during COVID and was very pleased with the cautions they took to ensure the safety of the customers as well as the employees. They put up dividers between tables so you can be socially distanced with other parties. We came on a Tuesday night so the restaurant was not packed at all. The service was very fast and our food immediately came out right after our orders. I would say hot pot base that we ordered was a little bland and I expected more from them. We ordered the Tom yum and Herbal hot pot base. I have to say I&apos;ve had better. However, all of the ingredients were very fresh. The beef was so tender and delicious! We were so full after our meal and price was pretty decent as well. Honestly, I may not frequent this place but highly recommend you try out Shabu Zen at least once!"
3,"Came here for dinner and was very disappointed. Everything was just ok and the quality isn&apos;t quite there. Also, they were sold out of the caviar fish balls :(. The service wasn&apos;t great as it was a bunch of younger kids horse playing around with each other. Wouldn&apos;t recommend."
5,"Despite my family and I being regulars at this restaurant, I&apos;ve never wrote a review here and I thought that it was time. 

We have a waiter that ended up coincidentally being our regular waiter every time we visited. My dad loves him and he&apos;s not a very easy person to please. Think stern hard-to-please asian dad. Our waiter would always bring out chopped red peppers (something they used to bring out when they first opened but don&apos;t anymore) and extra stuff to put in our sauce without asking. He&apos;d come and greet us in Vietnamese, ask where my mom was whenever she doesn&apos;t come out to eat with me and my brother. It honestly always a please trip to Shabu-zen just because of our waiter (and food of course!!). 

We just oddly never gotten his name, but will update this review when I find out!

Anyway!!! On to the food review part! 

Broth is always good! My family usually does half spicy Mongolian and half Chinese herbal. The broth is the reason why we don&apos;t go to the Allston location much. It&apos;s slightly different. 

Things we always get:
A2. Prime Grade Boneless Short Rib (Jumbo)
A11. Surf and Turf (My mom likes the seafood
Fish Paste*** (personal FAV)
Sauteed Baby Clams
Sauteed Beef Tongue
Raw Beef Tongue
Rice (it hits different here, trust)"
5,"My most favorite shabu spot in Massachusetts , ever.

Came here 3 times during my stay in Massachusetts. The ambiance is mellow. They sometimes play hipster house music. Service can be hit or miss. Right in china town. Clean establishment. Parking really sucks to find.

Lunch time before 3pm on weekdays is the business. The  jumbo or &quot;more&quot; portioned combo cost $22 instead of the dinner $32. 

Tom yum broth is very flavorful. Has that lemon grass spice, chili zing, and the sour. Miso is a good pair with it for the subtle not too strong flavor. 

I always get jumbo. The meat quality here is soo much better than other places. From the marbling to the cut, it&apos;s a nice treat. Melt in the mouth meat. Add ramen for extra $2. 

I highly recommend this spot . I&apos;ll come here every time. Not sure but the garlic chili flavor has changed. It doesn&apos;t taste garlic-y any more . Only difference from 4 years ago. Prices have been the same since 4 years ago. One of the many spots I love to come to."
5,"Pros: The food is just simply bomb. My favorite broth to get is the Tom Yum and Kim-Chee because some places like Hot Pot Buffet or Spring-Shabu doesn&apos;t offer Tom Yum which is my favorite! Their prime rib eye/beef or prime grade short ribs will always be the best meats and it&apos;s great that each meat plate comes with a side of noodles/rice and veggies. I also recommend their sautéed beef tongue (my all time favorite place to eat sautéed beef tongue is Shabu-zen), and stuffed meatballs (don&apos;t knock it till you try it!). They also have their special soy sauce and it&apos;s fun mixing in the garlic, pepper, scallion, and bbq sauce to dip the food in!

Service: The team of servers at Shabu-Zen have always been great and attentive. It&apos;s like they always knew when we needed something. 

Cons: The only con I have is that it can be a bit pricey depending on what you order or how many people the party is composed of. But it&apos;s worth every penny and to be expected because of the great quality. Also because it&apos;s located in Chinatown it&apos;s best to go in the evening where there are more parking spots and no need to pay for meters. 

Overall: Shabu-Zen has always been on my top list for hotpot spots in Boston. Every single time I&apos;ve gone I was not disappointed by the food or the service."
4,"If you&apos;re looking for a hotpot place but feels like all you can eat is too much, then this place is perfect! They have variety of selections for hotpot and they also have drinks. The servings is just enough for one person so if you&apos;re by yourself you won&apos;t have the trouble of finishing your food. It&apos;s also an easy place to find since it&apos;s in the middle of Chinatown. They are also open late so no rush going there at a certain time. Service is good. It depends on who&apos;s serving you at that moment. 
I would recommend this place and I&apos;ll come back when I&apos;m looking for hotpot again with friends"
3,"I&apos;ve gone to the Allston location a few times and had a great experience so I assumed I would have a similar one at their Chinatown location as well. While the food and broth met my expectations, which are very high considering the prices, the service was a let down. I came with a party of four and the service was initially fine, but I later found it very difficult to flag our waiter down again to place more orders. This location is significantly smaller than their Allston one, but we had trouble finding where our waiter was most of the time. We ended up having to order through the other staff members who weren&apos;t assigned to our table and reorder items that were forgotten about. I think I&apos;m going to exclusively stick to their Allston location. For the same price, you get better service and more accessible parking."
5,The soup and the sauce are very delicious. My wife and I hang out with two of our friends. Four of us really like this place. The service is wonderful. The restaurant is clean. The staffs are very quick and respectful. We definitely come back here again.
5,One of my favorite places for hot pot! The service is great! The quality of the meat is the best I have ever had! Great service! Parking lot is a great option! I recommend this place highly!
3,"Good but standard hot pot.  Best part is the selection of broth options (Spicy Szechuan is my favorite).  Broth is $5 unless you get the complimentary house broth. Went for dinner and got the A5 prime beef ($16 for regular) which comes with some veggies (e.g., Bok choy, Napa cabbage, enoki mushrooms, etc) and your choice of noodles (udon vs vermicelli) or rice. 

Service is friendly and fast.  Hot pot is served individually so easy to go with friends and each person can choose their own broth (great for those who have varying spice tolerances).  There are several hot pot choices in Chinatown and this is a good option, but certainly not a &quot;must go to&quot; spot."
2,"I used to loveeeeeee Shabu-Zen. The food was great and the food is still really great. 

However, the boss don&apos;t take care of his customers. He&apos;s more about saving himself a couple of dollars from each customer. The food are already on the pricer side to begin with. 

It started with him taking away the free sweet bean soup at the end of the meal. Then took one piece of meat away from the boneless rib plate. They use to put 16 pieces on the plate and now it&apos;s only 15. He ordered his waiting staff to fluff the rice to make it look fuller. Also, now he don&apos;t offer bbq sauce or chopped chili from the start. It&apos;s only available upon requests. 

I don&apos;t think I will be coming back. I will take my business elsewhere. The boss don&apos;t value his customers, then I don&apos;t need to value his restaurant."
3,"Never consistent with their small dishes, example sautéed baby clams, and or their veggie plating that comes on the side when an entree is ordered. New manager so prices have gone up. They added many things to the menu which is great, but for an order of SPAM $8.  Ridiculous. I think the customers that still eats here has been eating here since Shabu Zen has opened and has remained loyal. If i didn&apos;t love hot pot as much as I did, I would not come back here simply because it&apos;s so damn expensive. You can easily spend $100 for two people."
5,Quality shabu. Always fresh. Broth always amazing. The sauce is to die for. Clean environment. Service is good.
4,This was my first experience doing the hot pot and it was great. The restaurant was busy on a Saturday evening. After a few minute wait we were seated and explained our options. I opted for a beef/chicken combo and the spicy Mongolian broth. It was delicious and I loved the ability to cook the meat to my own preference. I&apos;ll be sure to come back here the next time I&apos;m in Boston.
