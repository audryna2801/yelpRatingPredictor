5,"I&apos;ve been to Luke&apos;s lobsters now two times and we decided to go to the one in Back Bay for dine in because the other locations I believe are either temporarily closed due to covid and aren&apos;t accepting dine in services which makes sense because they are much smaller compared to the back bay location. 

The staff here was super nice and food came out in a reasonable time but we did order a lot so that&apos;s understandable. The food was super good and my partner is visiting from Arizona and loves the lobster rolls from here so I have to take him here everytime he is in town. We got the trio which was like half of a regular roll and was good and ended up ordering another roll because we were still hungry. I got the shrimp roll and he got the crab I believe."

Below is a quick explanation of my rating mechanism:
1star: Absolutely horrible and will not come back under any circumstances 
2 stars: Way below my initial expectation with very few highlights. Will only come back to order specific courses if my friend strongly insist.  
3 stars: Average with some turn-offs. Might give it a second chance to test more dishes out. 
4 stars: Meets expectation with a couple highlights. Will come back. 
5 stars: Exceeds my expectation by various aspects. Will come back quite often and also recommend the place to my friends. 

An overdue review for my first lobster roll experience after moving to BOS this summer. It will prob serve as the benchmark of the many more lobster rolls to come in the near future. The restaurant offers limited dine-in and outside seating options. The credit card reader is placed on a stand in-between the customers and the cashier to create additional social distance. 

The interior of the restaurant is almost as simple as you couple imagine, which directly draws your attention to the menu above the open kitchen. The menu, again, is quite straightforward, which includes Lobster Combo, Crab Combo, Shrimp Combo, or Luke&apos;s Trio (which includes 1/3 of all the three options). One highlight is that for the drink included in the combo, you can pick whatever is available in the fridge (flavored sparkling water, soda, and other non-alcoholic drinks) with no additional cost. 
 
Luke&apos;s Trio with Coreslaw ($23): RECOMMEND
I have to say that it has exceeded my expectation (built from my limited experiences with lobster roll in other cities) for a chain restaurant. The rolls are loaded with seafood with minimum seasonings (sale, pepper, and butter on the interior of the rolls). The seafood all tastes fresh and sweet and no scent of fishy taste from the shrimps at all. The lobster roll is my personal favorite among the three, so I will likely get a full-length lobster roll next time but really you can&apos;t go wrong with any of the three. 

My only complaint would be the portion size as I feel I can easily finish another roll for lunch. Other than that, it&apos;s been really everything I can expect from my first lobster roll experience here.  Will certainly come back again."
5,"Came here on National Lobster Day to try their lobster rolls. We overheard the person ahead of us order their roll with extra seasoning and decided to go down the same path and I&apos;m really glad we did. The roll with extra seasoning was so tasty. We also tried both the bisque and mac and cheese. The mac and cheese was rich and had a distinct seafood flavor that I liked. 

I&apos;ve also listened to a podcast episode with the founders about how Luke&apos;s Lobster is supporting their workers like fishermen during this pandemic and I have to say they&apos;re doing an amazing job adapting and helping as many people as possible."
5,"If you love lobster this is a must go place for you! Luke&apos;s has been one of my a favorite of mine for some time and any trip back to my former home of Boston will always mean a trip to Luke&apos;s. 
Their lobster rolls are probably the best lobster roll I&apos;ve ever had!! I also like to order the clam chowder which is always amazing and so creamy.
The restaurant is very clean and welcoming.  Exceptional staff and prices are what you&apos;d expect here in Boston."
5,"The food here is SO good. Got it delivered and wasn&apos;t able to eat it hot but every single roll and the Mac and cheese were still phenomenal! I especially enjoyed the crab and shrimp rolls, lobster was a very close tie. They were all buttery and seasoned very well. This was sufficient for 2 people with a moderate appetite. 

I&apos;d come here more if the portions were a bit larger or if it came with more filling side options. I know seafood is expensive but would love having a simple but filling veggie side to make it a bit more affordable on the regular."
5,Wow! This place was amazing! I was in town for the day and can&apos;t wait to come back. I couldn&apos;t believe how much lobster was in my roll. Lukes&apos;s doesn&apos;t mess around! The clam chowder was also incredibly yummy! The slaw was great but after the chowder and lobster roll I had no room left for the slaw. Service was fast and very friendly! I will definitely be back next time I&apos;m in town.
5,Amazing! Best place to grab some great lobster or crab rolls. Very clean and friendly service.
5,"Very delicious food as well as a welcoming environment. Service was a1 and would highly recommend this establishment. 

The Grilled cheese with lobster with a side of truffle butter is a must try!!"
3,"I wanted to like this place so bad! I have tried two different locations in New York City and I had always thought they were pretty good. I mean to give them credit, we had just gotten lobster rolls and clam chowder from Quincy market just a few hours earlier.

Their lobster rolls are all right, But my favorite from Luke&apos;s lobster has always been their crab rolls. Don&apos;t get their lobster bisque! It is way too salty and rich."
5,"This place is awesome! The service is a little slow but the attention to quality and presentation makes up for it. As an Arizona native I never knew what a good lobster roll tasted like until I took a trip to Boston. Luke&apos;s is easily the most delicious, pure, and simple seafood restaurants that I have ever been to. The ingredients are light and they really let you appreciate the natural flavor of the seafood."
3,"*NEEDS CUSTOMERS SERVICE TRAINING*
Perhaps I went in on a bad time for the staff but my visit left me with a &quot;I don&apos;t know if I&apos;ll ever come back&quot; thought. I was so excited to try this spot, the lobster rolls are truly AMAZING. I entered Luke&apos;s happy, I said &quot;hi! Good afternoon&quot; to the 2 gentlemen who where behind the counter, none of them answered. The man who took my order was very short and overall looked as if he was in a crappy mood. There was no welcoming feeling, no &quot;hi&quot; no &quot;thank you&quot; nothing. A straight &quot;what are you going to order&quot; &amp; &quot;your total is etc.&quot; Would I come back? Maybe, (the rolls are delicious) but if I do, I will order pick up and save myself the awkward service."
4,"Easy walk up restaurant in back bay for some serious lobster rolls. They also have crab rolls and shrimp rolls or try a trio on one roll. Super fresh and delish. Order ahead or at walk up bar, dine In available."
5,This is where I take my friends when they visit Boston! They have great rolls for a reasonable price!! They also have an app you can use to acquire points and build up rewards. We all love a good discount! Definitely recommend Luke&apos;s when you&apos;re looking for a good lobstahh roll
5,"Must go place if you love lobster roll like I do! location is absolutely great!! Especially with covid, the place is totally clean and Jason the manager was following all precautions and procedures."
5,I went in there and it was shockingly quiet due to the effects of covid. it was just simply empty and they had a couple of pickups you&apos;re in there. But I went in with my family and ordered the $65 lobster roll special (four lobster rolls) and clam chowder. It was so good and it&apos;s always been a very busy place so I never really bothered coming in. but I&apos;m happy to say that the food was delicious and if anybody&apos;s around the back Bay they should pop in. The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful.
5,"Apparently I&apos;ve never had a &quot;real&quot; crab roll because this was one of the tastiest rolls I&apos;ve ever had.  The seasoning was perfect, the crab was so tender but definitely not overcooked and the butter roll that it was on was so buttery.  I really wanted a second one but that would have been greedy.  I also had the lobster bisque.  My only complaint is that I would&apos;ve loved a little more lobster in my bisque but the flavor was perfect.  We also had the shrimp roll and slaw.  I&apos;d recommend this place to anyone who loves a good seafood roll.  I&apos;ll definitely be back."
5,"One of my to go spots when I&apos;m in Boston, they are good quick and delicious. Every time I have visited Boston I come to Luke&apos;s. They don&apos;t disappoint. They have a good atmosphere and centrally located. The quality is really good as well, and the staff is amazing, sweet and helpful! 

If you&apos;re looking for a quick bite but also something that good and very delicious this is the spot. I usually get the hot lobster roll because it&apos;s buttery and delicious and my boyfriend likes the cold lobster roll which is also mouth-watering. Their clam chowder soup is also one of my favorites with a side of chip I am in heaven, writing this review is making me crave them and want a roll. Soon I will be back!"
4,"Really cute place! Came here to get the classic lobster roll, and it was pretty good! Well toasted bread, butter, and fresh lobster. We also got the combo and tried both the lobster bisque and the clam chowder. Both were decent, but I liked the clam chowder better. 

The service here was really great though! I also liked how the combo came with cute drinks (I got a blueberry wildflower honey lemonade). I feel like definitely a staple for the Boston experience."
5,"Great quick spot when you want a fresh bite. Stopped here with my parents after enjoying the library and they loved it. We had the clam chowder, lobster rolls and the Mac and cheese. All super good and well worth the price. My dad said he usually doesn&apos;t like lobster, but loved this! Way to go! Must of been the toasted bun they served the lobster on. Toasted to perfection. 
Service was fast and super friendly considering it took us a while to decide what to get. Glad for their patience. 
And the bathrooms were nice and clean-thank you! Definitely will come back."
4,"Really really good lobster roll!  

I stopped in for a quick meal late evening just before they closed. Not busy, walked right up. I went for the Luke&apos;s Trio with soup. It&apos;s the combo of threee mini rolls and a cup of soup. Shrimp roll, crab roll, and a lobster roll. The meat was so sweet and delicious. The rolls slathered in butter and oh so perfectly toasted. I went with the cup of clam chowder (lobster bisque also an  option) and it was amazing. Creamy, delicious, and loaded with clams. The trio came with a drink and will usually just pass on the drink and opt for water I did indulge this time. Craft bottled root beer. Rounded out this simple yet absolutely delicious meal. 

Not cheap but not out of line for seafood, the trio was $29 and $31 if you had I it with the chowder like I did. 

I will be back for sure!"
