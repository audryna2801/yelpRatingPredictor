5,"Coppa is one of the first places from which I ordered take-out since the pandemic started.  All three dishes I ordered were delicious, so comforting:

1. Polpette (meatballs) - a hint of spicy in a flavorful sauce, topped with finely grated Parmesan.

2. Winter Squash pizza - the mild sweetness of the squash paired perfectly with the savory pork sausage and the dabs of ricotta were so fluffy and fresh. 

3. Tagliatelle - the egg pasta was so fresh, perfect texture, and the sauce was perfectly flavored and coated the pasta well. 

Wish I had taken pictures, but the food was so good that photography wasn&apos;t even on my mind (I&apos;ll add pictures next time I order).  

Ordering take-out from Coppa has been one of the most enjoyable experiences I&apos;ve had during the pandemic.  Looking forward to having more dishes from Coppa delivered to my home (I used Uber Eats)."
5,"This is one of my favorite spots in Boston&apos;s historic South End. One of the best parts is that the restaurant is directly situated right smack in the middle of the South End neighborhood, so you really get a feel for the people and the culture while enjoying your meal. There are gorgeous brownstones and trees surrounding the tables outside and you feel like you&apos;re in a hidden part of NYC, and the caliber of the food resonates that feeling as well. 

We enjoyed aperol spritzes, tuna crudo, arancini, and two pasta dishes. I could immediately tell the pasta was home made and perfectly cooked. All dishes were BEAUTIFULLY presented, seasoned exquisitely, and had a gorgeous balance of flavors within them. This restaurant is run by and owned by two James Beard award-winning chefs (think of it as the &apos;oscars&apos; of the culinary world); Ken Oringer and Jamie Bissonnette. Chef Jamie won the 2014 Best Chef Northeast for the James Beard Foundation Awards.

You can&apos;t go wrong with any of their establishments as the service, milieu, and food are always high caliber, creative and executed with a graceful fineness. I highly recommend for indoor or outdoor seating!"
5,"Great spot. Came here for a Wednesday night dinner and was able to book a table the day of.

They have outdoor patio seating which provides for a great vibe. We ordered the summer salad, Mais pizza, margarita pizza, aranchini, and zucchini. The pizzas were phenomenal, especially the mais pizza with corn and a delicious aioli. The zucchini was also very good with a tahini sauce. The salad was really really good and had a Chardonnay viniagarette which was delicious. The arinchini, was our least favorite. I had a rose which was very refreshing as well as a Prosecco cocktail which was tasty.

Great service and great outdoor seating. Highly recommend!"
5,"So upon first glance, spending around $25+ for an order of pasta might be a little too much (at least that&apos;s how I felt). I ordered regardless, via Caviar, because I really wanted to try a new pasta place. When my order arrived, the portion of pasta they gave me seemed really small compared to other pastas (Cheesecake Factory, California Pizza Kitchen, etc) but let me tell you: Coppa is 100% quality over quantity. 

I ordered the Cavatelli and it was VERY flavorful and the pasta itself was deliciously chewy. I finished it so fast and was the perfect amount of full--not stuffed to the brim but also don&apos;t have much room to eat more. I was super satisfied with the food and I hope to make Coppa an every-now-and-then kind of treat for myself! I would highly recommend to anyone who&apos;s interested to give Coppa a try, because I don&apos;t think it will disappoint. Looking forward to trying the other dishes from here!"
4,"I hadn&apos;t been to Coppa for years prior to a recent visit. Post-COVID Coppa is consistently bumpin&apos; and, apparently, churning out awesome food. 

The good: the food. The pastas were all well-cooked and flavorful. The whole fish (branzino) was super flavorful and perfectly cooked. The wine list is small but full of good quality wines under $80 or so per bottle. 

The average: the service is COVID-standard. Order, drop off, no chatting. Nothing bad, just standard issue COVID stuff. 

The bad: Nothing particularly bad about my return visits. 

The reason for only 4 stars is that while the food was good-to-very good, it wasn&apos;t incredible. Just above average Italian in a fairly spartan environment. Hard to fault it and good enough to return!"
5,"I loved Coppa pre-COVID, but I may love them even more now.  They&apos;ve really done a stand-up job adapting to the times and have created a wonderful outdoor patio ambiance.  The servers are all super earnest, and made our first COVID-era outdoor dining experience a lovely one.  The pasta and pizza, as always, are spot on.  There&apos;s not much better than sipping an aperol spritz under a giant orange umbrella in between bites of delicious pasta.  Their new tuna watermelon crudo was delicious.  Favorite pasta remains the Cavatelli but they&apos;re all great.  Have done takeout several times during COVID as well, it all travels really well."
5,"Coppa offered one of the best culinary experiences we&apos;ve had in a long time via their Christmas Eve Feast of the 7 Fishes event.

It&apos;s a fixed price tasting menu that plays on the Italian tradition and offers paired wines (4 oz) at a super reasonable price. The creativity and execution of this meal/event was flawless and took notes from many different cuisines outside of the standard Italian staples such as Japanese, New England American, and French which added to the overall experience and variety. 

The wine pairings were as creative as the meal itself and offered varietals and types of wine not typically seen on menus which not only worked very well with the food but also to expand our palette and knowledge of offerings from different regions. 

The staff was extremely attentive and friendly throughout the whole experience which was what I would expect from an event like this. However, the way the multiple servers rotated throughout the evening was like a well-choreographed dance that had no faults.

We were so impressed with the experience we not only decided that 5 stars was appropriate but we made immediate plans to come back and try the standard menu in the next two weeks."
4,"Coppa has an awesome outdoor space that I believe they built out because of Covid. They are strict on Covid guidelines and require masks at all times until you are at your table and if you need to go inside to use the bathroom mask and gloves are required.

Came here with a group of 4 and we sampled lots of menu items. We shared a few apps, the Arancini and the cheese plate. Both were good but the cheese plate was microscopic. It would be good for maybe 2 people, definitely not 4. I shared two pizzas with a friend. The pizzas are a little bit bigger than a personal size and 2 was plenty. My other friends got pasta dishes and really enjoyed both.

Definitely try to come during the summer and check out their patio in the cozy South End. Za and Rose all day!"
5,"Everyone was wearing masks and if you have to go inside to use the restroom masks and gloves are required. 
The staff is friendly and accomodating and the menu is spectacular, each item we ordered was well prepared and delicious. Highly recommend the summer cocktails, spritzers are so refreshing in this heat."
4,"Nice little spot on Shawmut. I took my folks for an easy Sunday night dinner. These are pricey small plates but really solid, quality food. My parents got the celery Caesar with was a bunch of fresh celery and not a salad they expected but they enjoyed. I had the tagliatelle which was amazing. I got one order to go for my wife as well. 

Looks like a good spot for a nice date night as well."
5,"What brought me to Coppa was the rave reviews and I&apos;m so glad I came here, twice! Beyond being incredibly cautious about COVID-19, their pasta dishes are tasty! The spicy rigatoni has the perfect amount of kick meets sweetness with a dash of Parmesan. What I also enjoyed about Coppa was the outdoor ambiance and the neighborhood they&apos;re in. Very cute location! Will definitely return."
4,I picked up my order. They worked so fast when they received my order on toast. I have to say. The pizza is sooo yummy. Their pasta is above the average. They use handmade pasta so the noodle is quite chewy and moist. I love their vaggie. So fresh. Who doesn&apos;t like fresh food. It&apos;s a good restaurant.
3,"Coppa was good. I&apos;m glad I went. COVID really cramps the style anywhere but I take it with a grain of salt. Our tiny table wasn&apos;t quite enough for the outdoor dinning and the meal wasn&apos;t unforgettable. But it&apos;s nice to eat out, right?"
4,"Had an incredible meal sitting at the bar. Second favorite pizza in Boston behind Picco. Sandwiches look incredible. The Grinder. 

The gentleman next to me spilled an entire glass of red wine on his white polo shirt, but didn&apos;t really get upset. A great night!"
5,"Jenn is an awesome waitress. The food was just as good. Thank you!

The Cavatelli and  Polpette are must haves. The Sopressata was delicious!"
5,"It&apos;s no coincidence that my last 5 star review was given to Toro. Ken Oringer and Jamie Bisonnette knock it out the park again with Coppa. I really have to give it up to any restaurant that knows how to properly season their dishes! Now for the food:

Burrata:  Very delicious, nice texture, and the meyer lemon vinaigrette added a great acidity to the cheese. One of my favorite dishes!

Costolette: The short rib was incredible and there were two generous pieces. It almost tasted like barbacoa, also very good texture. The chickpeas were okay... but it didn&apos;t take away from the deliciousness that was the short rib.

Spaghetti Carbonara: This was a solid dish, but not my favorite. It tasted like a classic carbonara but the uni added a nice richness to the noodles.

Zucca: Incredible! Chanterelles are my favorite mushrooms and the garlic cream sauce, pasta, and mushroom made for a super tasty bite. Easily my favorite dish.

Salsiccia: A basic pizza with red sauce, and that&apos;s not necessarily a bad thing when done extremely well. And that&apos;s exactly what this pizza did; you can&apos;t go wrong with pork sausage, fennel pollen, ricotta, and roasted onions.

Avoid the stappi spritz, not good."
5,"I made a reservation here during my fiancé and I&apos;s weekend trip to Boston before Christmas. The neighborhood was adorable. We had originally planned to walk over from our hotel in back bay, but after a day of exploring Boston it was an easy Uber! We were seated immediately with a reservation and enjoyed the meatballs and bread to start with a lovely bottle of Italian red. The meatballs were amazing! We both agreed the sauce was our favorite thing we ate all weekend! 

For our entrees I had a pizza and my fiancé got Bolognese. The pizza was pretty good, but I would definitely recommend getting the pasta! The texture was perfect. We shared dessert to end the meal and left full and satisfied. I would highly recommend this if you&apos;re wanting to try some Italian food in Boston but don&apos;t want to have to stand in line or travel to north end. It was so cozy and exactly what I was looking for!"
5,Amazing cavatelli pasta - on the spicy side. A must have. We also had really good baked oysters. Highly recommend this restaurant if looking for a cozy Italian place for dinner.
4,"YUM! Let me just say this place redeemed my Italian food experience in Boston. I had gone to one other Italian place before and was very disappointed considering it had a thousand or so reviews.

I think what makes this place so unique and amazing is their modern twist and take on classic Italian dishes. I love a good New American place and this restaurant had innovative dishes with seasonal ingredients. 

We ordered a salad, gnocchi, and a margherita pizza. I couldn&apos;t have asked for a better last meal in Boston before heading out. I wish I came here earlier in the trip because I would&apos;ve come back to try their other dishes!"
5,"Amazing as always! I thought Coppa has done a great job transitioning during the pandemic and we were cozy enough sitting outside in 50 degrees with the heat lamps.  Food was outstanding as always.  We came for brunch this time and of course for the the grinder, cacio e pepe scrambled eggs and the delicious zucca!"
