5,Ostra didn&apos;t miss a beat this year. Take out for for candles and flowers on the table. The fish stayed hot and the crudo was ice cold. Thank you for making at home date night one to remember.
5,"Came here with my wife and brother in law. Very special place. We started out with a flight of oysters and they were refreshing and delicious. Absolutely fresh. Next we got the tartare and the presentation was out of this world with the smoke effect. Next I had for my entree the sea bream. One word- WOW. It was light, but savory. Flavorful, but not overpowering at all. It was an absolute treat. As for the decor in the building, it was beautiful. The service was top notch and they do a wonderful job with the COVID precautions. Will return here every time I am in the area."
5,"Wow, can&apos;t give this place enough stars.  We went for an anniversary dinner and originally planned to do outdoor seating but opted at last minute to take our chances and sit indoors as it was a chilly evening.  First time since the pandemic that we dined indoors but we didn&apos;t feel nervous at all as they did a magnificent job of keeping the layout was spacious and classy.  Food was amazing and the service was impeccable.  We started with champagne and caviar followed by oysters and their signature sea bass tartare.  Waiter recommended the octopus which was sublime and daily special of fresh mushrooms picked by one of the chefs which turned out to be our favorite dish.  Split the paella for the main course.  Each dish was well executed and class all the way.  If your looking for a safe and delicious indoor dining experience in Boston during covid can&apos;t go wrong with Ostra!"
5,"Hands down one of my favorite restaurants/experiences in Boston. We made reservations for 6:30PM for my birthday dinner. The restaurant is BEAUTIFUL. High ceilings, dimly lit and a beautiful bar. 

* Wellfleet Oysters, 1/2 dozen ($24) - a smaller and creamier oyster, my favorite. They were shucked well and so fresh! 
* Alaskan King Crab ($32) - they used a lot of lemon to flavor it which I could&apos;ve done without, but the crab was really fresh and taken out of the shell, so no dirtying your hands! 
* Salt Crusted Bronzino for 2 ($98) - hands down the best Bronzino I&apos;ve ever had, and it might just be the best fish I&apos;ve ever had. The preparation is beautiful; it&apos;s taken out of the salt shell table side. The waiter deboned and split the whole fish amongst two plates. Again, heavy on the lemon, but a light and tender fish, done really well. It also comes with a side of the roasted vegetables for each person! 
* Pommes Purée ($7) - a puréed potato, how could you go wrong?! Light and not as heavy as a mash, so good you can&apos;t get enough! 
* Apple Tart ($15) - light, caramelized apples topped with a salted caramel ice cream. They put a little candle and happy birthday around the plate, such a cute touch! 

The service and experience was unmatched; we never even had to lift a finger to pour more water. They were attentive and accommodating, making the entire experience worthwhile. Definitely recommend if you&apos;re in Boston!"
5,"Food is amazing. 25% max capacity, while still in effect. Highly recommend. Ambient scene--great staff. Food is just amazing. Are food is so delicious. It is the most pricey place in our past four weeks of dining out. But must say, the most ambient scene and most delicious food."
5,"This review is about the Management team and the magnificent job they do!  Had dinner with 5pll for a birthday celebration. Upon arrival, table ready, greeted seated and ready to rock and roll.  Orders taken and delivered with perfect oversight by the Manager - Hoshang - I truly hope I have spelled his name correctly, if not.... my sincerest apologies.  Immaculately dressed and 110% professional at all times.  The food, drink, ambience and service are always wonderful but this evening&apos;s Manager enhancements to our experience really pushed it over the top.  Thank you Sir - You are a true professional!  We will return soon."
4,"Enjoyed a good dinner at Ostra while in town for college visits with my daughter.  We sat outside enjoying the balmy weather in Boston.  My daughter had booked the place after reading about it and these reviews were correct, the food is good.  We shared 2 starters, the lobster risotto (meaty and tasty but overcooked and oily) and the grilled octopus.  As main, we ate the branzino (with heavy parmesan truffle fries) and the sea bream (with an incredible heirloom tomato salad.)

I applaud the team @Ostra for the way they&apos;re managing social distancing and cleanliness at the restaurant.  They have an attentive staff which is working to ensure diners are safe.  Well done!"
5,Lobster Gnochetti and Tuna Tartare was amazing. Everything was very fresh. Beautiful presentation. We had a great experience! Highly recommend this restaurant!
5,"Great date spot- romantic at night calm with nice music. Really fresh fish- very small and very expensive, but I really loved it as a food eating professional. The food is flavored exquisite and service is great. My favorite items were the tuna tartar and yellowtail sashimi. Everything was great, will be back to try more menu items."
5,"I had been holding off writing my review until I was able to come here a second time. Our first visit was at the start of February and our dinner was so excellent that before we even left, we had made a reservation for our five-year wedding anniversary for the end of the month. We were super excited to come back after such a great first impression.

We found Ostra due to its proximity to the playhouse where we were going to be seeing the blue man group. We were able to make a reservation for just before our show and it was about a block and a half away from that evenings festivities which made it very appealing in the brisk early February cold.

We were served by Trevor, who was friendly and professional and took our order for a bottle of Pellegrino sparkling water ($11) while we looked over the menu. We decided to start with some drinks, hubby ordered the coco non-alcoholic mocktail ($9) and I ordered the Charles on high ($17) which looked to me like a modern take on a Sazerac. Hubby thought his mocktail was delicious and it was beautifully presented, and my drink was so exquisite I barely finished the first one before I was flagging down our waiter for a second.

For our starters, hubby ordered the saffron fish stew ($19) and I ordered the lobster and truffle gnochetti ($25). They brought out a gorgeous loaf of bread topped with shaved garlic, alongside a bowl of mascarpone butter in a pool of exquisite olive oil and topped with an herb leaf. We both thought that the fish stew was good but not great, a little on the heavy side. My lobster however was perfectly cooked and they did not scrimp on the shavings of truffles.

The entrees were delicious. He ordered the sea bream ($43) which was softly poached in a leaf and topped with mixed chopped herbs and had a tantalizing smell that I could barely handle from across the table. I opted for the sea bass ($$37) from the simply grilled menu and it was topped with a lemon vinaigrette and oil with some veggies on the side. We both agreed that the sea bream was superior to the sea bass, however they were both delicious.

For dessert, we ordered the snow egg ($16) which was a delightfully unique lemon dessert and was both light, airy, and flavorful, a perfect end to a very delicious dinner. Our service with Trevor was prompt, attentive, and very friendly, and I had absolutely zero complaints on that part of our evening.

On our return trip, we started with a bottle of San Pellegrino sparkling water ($11) and I knew that I was going to order a Charles on high ($17) after how delicious they were on our past visit. The starter bread with the butter and olive oil was as good as it was the previous time, and we reserved a table in the lounge which gave us a wonderful quiet solitude during dinner.

For our starters, we chose the piquillo pepper seasonal starter ($17) and the iberico ham ($29). The peppers were soft and flavorful and stuffed with goat cheese, and the ham was served alongside manchego, quince jelly, and figs. We both agreed that the seasonal peppers were the best, however the ham was also very good.

We decided to try something different for our entrees and I ordered the grilled branzino ($41) with a side of truffle fries ($13), and he ordered the peppercorn salmon ($40). My dish was from the simply grilled menu, and was flavorful but heavy. The truffle fries however were perfectly cooked and well flavored, topped generously with parmesan. Hubby&apos;s salmon was softly cooked and served alongside purple mashed potato puree and veggies.

For dessert, we ordered the chocolate torte ($16), which they brought to us decorated for our anniversary which I thought was a nice touch. Our waitress apologized profusely for how long it took for the dessert to come out and told us that it was on the house. We were sitting in the lounge listening to live piano and celebrating our anniversary so we honestly didn&apos;t even notice that it took longer than usual for the dessert to come out.

Overall Ostra is an exceptionally well-tuned instrument, with well trained staff, impeccably detailed chefs and provides a delicious marine based product in a upscale and modern atmosphere. Prices are absolutely on point for the quality and attention to detail of their dishes, location is convenient, and there is plenty of nearby parking garages for those taking their own car. Reservations are definitely needed because this place is popular for a reason. The fact that we made a reservation before we even left our first dining experience here tells you just how good this place really is, and we can&apos;t wait to return."
5,"Aptly located in the Theater District, Ostra sure knows how to put on dinner and a show! 

The details were all there - from our beautiful charger plates featuring a gold-outlined horseshoe crab to the &quot;smoked-to-order&quot; Faroe Island salmon tartare, which was served with the smoke still trapped beneath a glass dome, to the high-ceilinged space with walls dominated by massive nautical wall art, to the whimsical plating of our mains and desserts, we were taken on a memorable visual and culinary journey from beginning to end.

It&apos;s rare that my family struggles with what we want to order, but everything on the massive menu at Ostra looked so good, we were indecisive up until the moment we placed our order. Table favorites included the aforementioned smoked salmon tartare ($23) and the intensely flavorful, perfectly cooked Valencia-style paella ($49), but really, every dish we tried was outstanding.

Service was excellent as well - though the restaurant was clearly short-staffed for the holidays, our waiter was extremely attentive and the pacing of the meal was great. Also, we ordered some cocktails in the lounge area since there was a ~30 minute wait after our reserved time for our table to clear (I will say it would have been a nice gesture if they had comp&apos;d us something for waiting that long) and all of our drinks were expertly mixed.

All in all, if you find yourself in central Boston looking for a classy (albeit very pricey) dinner spot that delivers on the wow factor in ambiance, service, and food, I would highly recommend Ostra."
5,"Still one of my top restaurants in Boston!  We came here to celebrate Valentines Day.  As always, the food and service could not be beat.  
We ordered:

Salmon Tartare: 5/5 great presentation and so delicious with smoked undertones

Sea Bass Tartare: 5/5 i love the thin crisps it comes with to dip in.  Very light, fresh taste

Ricotta Gnocchetti: 4/5 I actually ordered this as my entree as I came pretty full and it was enough.  Loved the ingredients but it was a bit too salty

48 Day Prime Dry Aged Ribeye: 5/5 this tasted pretty sweet but worked so well

Yuzu Cremeux: 4/5 a lot more citrusy and tart than we had expected but a very nice dessert to end dinner

Overall, food is amazing and they use quality ingredients.  What I was most impressed with this time was the service.  A busser accidentally spilled water on my date and she was very quick to clean it up.  We ended up getting our drinks for free along with dessert.  I&apos;ll be coming again and recommending Ostra!"
5,Ostra was amazing! Their service is like Michelin Star quality. All the staff was extremely friendly and attentive. Their food was absolutely delicious. The restaurant itself is beautifully decorated. Highly recommend this restaurant. Can&apos;t wait to dine here again.
4,"Ostra is a pretty typical fancy date spot. There is a dress code, and the ambiance and decor were classy and elegant. The price definitely reflected that, but I would say it was fair, given that the quality and taste of the food was decent as well. However, I don&apos;t think there was anything unique or special about the restaurant. Besides the fact that it was nice, it doesn&apos;t set it apart from other nice restaurants you would find at a hotel or somewhere on Newbury. So bring your date here for a nice dinner, but not if you want to impress them.

The quality of all the seafood was excellent as expected, given that this is a seafood restaurant. We ordered the grilled octopus and smoked salmon tartare to start. They automatically split them for us, so the full serving size for the dishes are actually pretty large. The portion of the main dishes were pretty large as well- the paella was probably enough for 2 people. However, the seafood in it was definitely overcooked, and the taste was probably on the lower end of all the seafood paella I ever had. We also got the seared scallops, which we enjoyed, so everything was pretty well prepared besides the paella. For dessert, we got the snow egg, which looked much better than it tasted. It was still good though, although a little too sweet for me."
4,"Ostra has impeccable service and is extremely mindful of the COVID-19 precautions.

We ordered the sea bass tartare, king crab, risotto, fried oysters and paella. Overall, I thought the food was good but not exceptional. We also thought the entree menu was limited and not eye catching.

It is a good restaurant. I had a good experience, especially with its staff. However, given that it is an upscale restaurant, i expect everything to be perfect. As I found the food to be just good, not great, I give it four stars."
5,"We had a lovely impromptu date night at this Theater District seafood restaurant. Made reservations through Opentable. Arrived on time and were seated within a minute. Too bad, because they had a live piano music playing in the bar. 

We were seated at a cozy table for 2. Spacing was decent between tables. Ambiance is elegant with white linens, black &amp; white photographs, and high ceilings. (High ceilings also means it can be a bit loud.) 

Server greeted us quickly and brought over waters, drinks &amp; bread.

A bottle of Gerard Boulay Sibylle Sancerre Rose. New one for me and complemented the seafood dishes.

Started with 1/2 dozen of the raw Kusshi Oysters from Stellar Bay, BC. Fresh with a clean &amp; delicate flavor.

For my entree, Broiled Maine Lobster. 3lbs of lobster delivered cracked and peeled over heirloom squash &amp; baby carrots, broccolini and herbed butter sauce. Delicious. I could not finish and had to share. Tried a bite of that 48 Day Prime Dry Aged Ribeye and that was juicy and delicious, as well.

Did not think I was going to be able to eat anymore, but pushed through it for some dessert:
Boston Creme Beignets, with chocolate ganache, vanilla Creme, coffee foam, salted milk chocolate ice cream. My favorite was combining the beignets and vanilla Creme and salted milk chocolate ice cream. No matter, I had help with the rest so that my plate was clean. Ha!

Service was attentive and spot on throughout the evening. 

I&apos;ll have to come back and try one of the Osetra Caviar Selections; table next to me ordered as I was leaving and I was jealous."
5,We visited Ostra for dinner on New Year&apos;s Eve and it was a great experience! Service was great and the food was delicious. I am vegan and they were very accommodating. Thank you!!
4,"Beautiful restaurant--elegant and modern. We had hamachi to start, which was so good, but a little heavy on the heat...maybe too much jalapeño oil. The fish was fresh and delicious though. The best thing I ordered was the king crab risotto. It&apos;s a big portion and is absolutely amazing. The stand out item for sure! I also had the Black Sea bass, which was good, but I didn&apos;t love it as much as I had hoped. 

We had the Boston cream beignets, which were light and airy and pure heaven. 

I would go back here in a second! Service was a little slow and our wine glasses were empty quite a bit, but overall a wonderful night."
5,"Solid place for a classy evening. Very nice experience sans a few negs. I took my One here for our first anniversary and made a rez for a quiet table... 

Let&apos;s get down to some deets: 

We got here about 6 p.m. and it was quiet as the place was near empty. The staff was well dressed and cordial and the table scape was nice and clean featuring a horseshoe crab monogram plate which was for your eyes only. It was removed as our apps and toddies arrived. Some cocktails were of the &quot;foo-foo&quot; type including mine which had teenie flowers floating and it was very good and boozy and I ate the flowers (I hate to waste food). 

Moey and I each got King Krab apps which were 30 bucks each and had a crème fraiche/Dijon sauce and was delicious and the krab was selected for big-ish chunks and was well plated. 

The main event was the Branzino (sp?) Fish for Two.  It was 92 bucks (yikes!) and was presented with a pastry-looking &quot;jacket&quot; on it which was apparently a salt jacket according to the waiter. It was brought over to the table and but then vanished quickly as it was carved by two people in the distance. This seemed &quot;weird&quot; as we assumed it would be festivus by having it fileted tableside. No go. It was very good though and mildly flavored with EVOO and house-grown herbs of parsley and oregano. 

Accompanying the entrée was an &quot;heirloom&quot; tomato salad. However, it was a culinary non sequitur. Although decently made with fresh herbs and good EVOO and olives, etc., the tomatoes were just store-bought hard/unripe pale tomatoes not selected for quality at all. Why have house-grown freshly snipped herbs and so forth and yet serve base-quality tomatoes as a main ingredient? My analogy is this: It&apos;s like a woman wearing Gucci accessories and shoes and diamond jewelry with a low-quality heinous-looking dress from Morgan Memorial Goodwill. Jettison this dish and make a dish featuring good quality/ripe ingredients. 

We each got Snow Eggs for dessert which I have to say was a great part of the meal as the meringue was as perfectly made as my mommy used to make. Most peeps aren&apos;t privy to true meringues. They should be almost Styrofoam-like and dry AF and even squeak like Styrofoam when rubbed together. Very, very good quality dessert here at Ostra and accompanied by Brandy Alexanders which are among our favorite toddies and appropriately served in coupe glasses with nutmeg.

Lastly, at the risk of sounding like a curmudgeon, the music was way too loud and totally inappropriate for elegant dining. A random playlist of bimbo/dance music and millennial tunes. Luckily some old people next to us beat me to the punch and asked staff to turn it down. I would like to be polite and ask Ostra to improve the music selection and air classy music for &quot;grown-ups&quot; like some subdued hand-selected jazz and classical. In addition, Ostra got loud as it filled up and is not a place where soft voices and chiming crystal glasses are at the sonic forefront. 

In conclusion, I do recommend Ostra to YELPers but I do hope Ostra will seriously consider my comments. Thank you for reading!"
4,"Overall - an excellent choice for a night out, Ostra offers a fine spread of contemporary and stylish dishes that please both the palette and the eyes. While there were some weak points with the paella, l enjoyed most of the dishes we order!

The Fare - 

  Grilled Spanish octopus - juicy and flavorful, the octopus was charred just right with a good pairing of Vidalia onions and capers  

  Smoked salmon tartare - a fun starter, smokey and sweet with a bed of yams and apple

  Pan seared scallops - well paired with the mandarin dressing, though I recommend pairing this with an additional side for more quantity

  Valenciana style Paella - the risotto and chorizo base was good, however the seafood portion was somewhat overcooked

  Snow egg - a signature treat worth trying to round up your evening"
