5,"Good food and service, clean and cozy indeed. 

Not sure about covid protection, it&apos;s a small cafe so eve though hall the staffs are masked, the tables can not really maintain 6 feet distance while eating. 

But overall really nice."
5,"probably my FAVORITE breakfast/brunch spot in Boston. Located on the North End. Super small, and sometimes you have to wait for a table, but they do a great job getting you in and out. CASH ONLY! 
The staff is incredibly friendly, and they remember me every time I come in and know what I like. I usually get a cappuccino with a dash or cinnamon or cocoa on top (have to ask), and holy cow, magic. All the food is great, but I usually go with breakfast. Brazilian/Italian inspired lunch dishes. They even have a small selection of alcohol for brunch (mimosas and sangria but what else do you need??) 
Great spot, please go!"
5,"The food is what you should expect at little counter service &quot;joint&quot;. The basics done perfectly if your grandma was doing the cooking. 

The food was prepared spot-on and the coffee is bottomless and delicious. Thank God this isn&apos;t another vegan smoothie bar trying to pawn off oat cakes as tasty.

We had a terrificly simple breakfast in the company of an eclectic cross-section of locals, mostly Italian, who probably live right around the corner...JUST what we were hoping for.

What a terrific experience."
3,"I came here with friends over a year ago after we were turned off by the hours-long wait at North Street Grille. While the menu is less trendy, the wait here was a lot more reasonable, and we were quickly seated in this is cute little breakfast joint. The menu is very standard for a diner. It&apos;s basic and no-frills, but if that&apos;s all you&apos;re looking for in a brunch experience, this is the place for you. I got pancakes with sausage on the side. The pancakes were fine--nothing to write home about, but they got the job done. The sausage links were fine too. Very standard sausage links like the ones you buy frozen from the store. I wasn&apos;t upset with my food, but nothing really wowed me either. I make a lot of breakfast food at home and found myself thinking I could make most of this myself and better. My friends who don&apos;t usually cook did enjoy their food much more though, so maybe I&apos;m just picky. Prices were surprisingly reasonable for the North End, and our waitress was nice. I can see why people like this charming place, but unless I&apos;m in a pinch, I probably won&apos;t be back."
4,"For a small and simple breakfast and lunch joint, they make a great meal. I went for breakfast and had a sausage and provolone omelette. Came with home fries and toast. Everything was tasty and hot and delicious. The coffee was great. The apple juice was huge. It was not expensive. This place is solid."
5,"Today we had egg and cheese sandwiches, yum!  Options for meat and types of bread.  A small diner with delicious fresh food, variety, great prices, good value$. You feel like family here. 



Theo&apos;s is my favorite breakfast and lunch place in the neighborhood.  They have been consistently turning out good food and good service for over 25 years. I have been a fan for 10, my partner since the week they opened.  What I love: big fluffy pancakes, breakfast special and chicken salad. I have liked all orders besides these. If you have a special request they are right there at an open kitchen to accommodate.  Theo and Nina are there to take your order at the window.    Vegetarian options."
3,"I was disappointed with Theo&apos;s. I may be the only one. I ordered scrambled eggs with sausage &amp; bacon, toast and pancakes. Everything was just OK. I was lured by the name and all the great reviews. It&apos;s definitely cozy and compact. Plenty of seating outside which was nice but people were seated inside too. What bummed me out was when I was waiting for my food (inside), a gentleman left who just finished eating.  And older gentleman, maybe Theo, brushed the crumbs off the table with a towel. There was a disinfectant spray RIGHT there and he didn&apos;t even use it! 

Basically the food was your standard Greek diner food. It probably would have been better if I didn&apos;t order takeout. I was so disappointed I&apos;m sure there were plenty of other places to eat that would have been better. This was one of the first time Yelpers did not steer me right. Oh well. Mine is just one opinion. Hope you have a better experience. If you&apos;re looking for decent food, I think you&apos;ll probably be alright. I wanted it to be more and better based upon the reviews."
5,"CASH ONLY. ATM around the corner. 

This is a small diner in North End &quot;Little Italy&quot; of Boston. I came here at 11:30am on Saturday, and it was maybe a 10 min wait for 2 people to sit at the window. Line really started to pile up at noon so that the wait was easily 30 min. It&apos;s worth the wait! Though to make it easier on yourself, just come at a less popular time. 

We got the house special musqueca fish stew and breakfast steak and eggs (not the big Brazilian plate ones). The portions are generous. The fish stew is PACKED with white fish, good tomato flavor, and tastes very fresh. It also comes with a bowl of rice and large salad. The steak and eggs comes with toast, home fries, and small coffee. Eggs were cooked just how we asked. The only thing is that we asked for steak to be medium rare, and it was more like medium.

Service was friendly, no frills. This is a neighborhood joint. The wait for food was appropriate, not immediate but I wouldn&apos;t call it slow either. There&apos;s a TV in the corner ceiling. 

Homey space. Chairs and packed pretty close. Medium noise. You&apos;ll be able to chat with friends. 

Tl;dr: I&apos;d recommend! Good for breakfast and the muqueca fish stew is wonderful. There is a wait in this small restaurant. 

After your meal, try swinging by Bova&apos;s or Mike&apos;s pastry nearby for desserts."
4,"We loved Theo&apos;s Cozy Corner. It&apos;s comfy, clean and attractive. Every single thing I have ever gotten here has been fresh and tastes terrific. The service was excellent. They were quick, reliable, and got everything right. Theo&apos;s Cozy Corner, I&apos;m satisfied."
2,"Soooooo we were hoping for some delish food and speedy service i mean we did only order eggs and bacon BUT it took over an hour to get us our food and a half hour to get a water and black coffee....

The table behind us got the wrong tables food then they picked the food up off the table and brought it over to the right table, it just was sloppy and also shouldn&apos;t we be more precautious because of the virus?

The server apologized saying it&apos;s busy inside but is sitting outside should be just as busy and taken care of. I feel bad leaving this review because i also work at a restaurant as well but truly only go here if you have 3+ hours to waste."
3,Cute spot. Long wait. French toast wasn&apos;t great. The corn beef hash with Hollandaise sauce and the home fries were delicious. I probably wouldn&apos;t return but I&apos;m glad I tried it once. Maybe I&apos;d order something else if other people wanted me to come back. But I wouldn&apos;t go out of my way to get breakfast here.
5,"I truly could not say better things about this place. First of all, we didn&apos;t realize it was cash only so as we sat down and ordered coffee and mimosas we realized and were about to leave. The cook came over and told us not to worry, he will give us our bill and we can mail him a check when we got home. It truly felt like we were with family when we were there. Food was awesome and will definitely be back there when we go back to the city! Theo&apos;s is the spot!!"
5,"We waited for about 25 minutes for breakfast on a Sunday morning and it was WORTH IT. The place is well-named, you step in and you just thing: &quot;wow, this is cozy&quot;. 

Service is fast, make sure to bring cash. I got a latte and ordered the eggs benedict which came with home fries. Both were great and overall the meal was very affordable!

My friend ordered a pancake on the side, and if you&apos;re into that I&apos;d also recommend their pancakes. They&apos;re huge and fluffy and perfectly golden brown.

Walking out, we ran into the owner who started talking to us about the soccer games coming up that weekend. He was so nice and wanted to know if we enjoyed the food. Great place to stop by for a nice breakfast, it&apos;s the opposite of your overpriced bougie place."
5,"Theo&apos;s Cozy Corner is definitely a gem of the area. I can see the charm and why so many love Theo&apos;s Cozy Corner. Each and every single item that we ordered was super fresh and delicious. The team is really friendly, helpful, and attentive. I have to come back to Theo&apos;s Cozy Corner."
5,"We LOVE theo&apos;s! We moved to the north end last summer and Theo&apos;s quickly became our go-to breakfast and brunch spot. When my parents came to visit, I brought them to Theo&apos;s. The staff is so friendly and the food is great and quick to come out - if you haven&apos;t dropped by, you should!!"
5,No frill tiny and authentic Italian diner in North End. My friend and I sat right at the bar and was able to watch the chef cook all the delicious omelets right I front of us. They use tea a l eggs and stuffed the omelets with so much goodies! This place is cash-only though
5,"Great breakfast. Made my omelette perfectly. I like my onions raw, not cooked. And they hit it. We also had the special and it came out just as ordered. Iced coffee came as asked.  Great to support them during that&apos;s times. Well with the visit."
5,"Such a cute and cozy location, great food and friendly staff and great prices. Such a good find on our way to see the old North Church."
3,"Cozy mom and pop shop. There is street parking but spaces are very limited. The dining area is small and limited waiting area if full, but the turnover is fast. 

I got a latte and Italian sausage mozzarella omelette, which was heavy toward the end. The hubs ordered the special which had eggs bacon toast and home fries. The items we ordered were ok, but we liked the ambiance and familial friendliness from the staff."
4,Great spot to grab breakfast! I came here to meet with a friend after flying in to BOS and was happy to find some great food options at reasonable prices. I got the french toast. I&apos;d definitely come back if I were in the mood for breakfast food again.
