5,"First time trying this place tonight.  We&apos;re not much of a take out family, and it was AMAZING!!  Better than your average pizza shop, and they even delivered to Boxford!"
5,"There&apos;s a reason I brought my wife to Pomodoro after I proposed to her: incredibly delicious food in a delightfully cozy atmosphere.

Two things to note: Reservations are a must, and you should only come here if you&apos;re not impatient or in a rush. This is a place to relax and enjoy your time with your company while the tiny kitchen make your incredible meals from scratch."
4,"Seared salmon was cooked to perfection. When it comes to their drinks, they have a good selection of wines. This time arround i went for a good old Manhattan and was really satisfied.  I ll be coming back with my wife !

1,"Made a reservation here for my 6th year anniversary and we were so excited.  We called once to make the reservation and once to confirm (we called the number on google and Yelp).  Once we get the the place it&apos;s completely dark, no one is there, so we call them
back. For some random reason this time they answer as sals place which they didn&apos;t do the other two times we called.  We soon discovered that the number listed for  pomodoro was redirected to sals place which had the same owner, I guess.  So we made a reservation for sals place which was in Provincetown and we were in Boston.  Thankfully we found somewhere else but the fact that we had to on a Saturday night at 8 almost ruined our night. I hate giving bad reviews and I&apos;m sure this place is great but why have the same number for two different places so far away from each other."
5,"I&apos;ve only been to Pomodoro twice, but it has won over my loyalty and quickly become my favorite restaurant in the North End.

The biggest reason for this is honestly all the free food they have given me over these two visits. The first time I went, my party ordered an antipasto and were given two entire orders of it. The second time we went, we ended up waiting 20-25 min past our reservation time for our table to be ready. As a consolation, we were handed a calamari appetizer while we waited outside and then given some delicious shrimp to eat once we sat down. Both times we got tiramisu for dessert for free as well. 

As far as entrees go, I&apos;ve tried the chicken carbonara and the seared chicken. I&apos;m not the best judge of Italian food (I feel like Italian food from any less casual Italian place generally tastes pretty good), but I was a big fan of both. 

I would say another reason to come to Pomodoro is the ambiance. The restaurant doesn&apos;t really have its name anywhere in the front so it has a hole-in-the-wall feel. 
It has a cozy feel inside with only one waitress serving all 6-8 tables. I would love to come back here again on a special date night.

Cons of Pomodoro are...
1) It&apos;s cash only
2) You&apos;ll have to make a reservation pretty early on if you want to eat on a weekend
3) Service can be slow (it is a small place with only one waitress after all). 

Pomodoro has made its way onto my short list of restaurants I like bringing people from out of town to. I can&apos;t wait to come back."
4,"Wow, Pomodoro is one restaurant that lives up to the North End hype! It is *extremely* cozy (read: SMALL) so make a reservation if you can. I came here with 5 girl friends for dinner, and we had such a lovely time! Looking around, I saw families, group of friends, and definitely couple dates, so I encourage anyone looking for a cozy, family-home-kitchen vibe to consider this spot.

To share, we ordered the bowl of mussels in tomato broth which was so delicious. We got 2 baskets of bread rolls and made sure the broth didn&apos;t go to waste!

I ordered Seafood Fra Diavolo and really enjoyed it. Ton of seafood and generally huge portions (could say the same about the other pastas we ordered). Tasted very buttery and heavy though, so I couldn&apos;t even finish half of it.

Come with the expectation that you will be absolutely stuffed walking out, and enjoy!"
5,"Pomodora has an intimate and homey atmosphere where the staff gives you top of the line service. Our waiter was knowledgeable of all drinks and food items on the menu and gave wonderful recommendations to a newcomer. We had the shrimp linguine and chicken carbonara for entrees, calamari for an appetizer and tiramisu for desert. Overall, the food was amazing and full of flavor. My favorite dish would be the chicken carbonara - I&apos;d recommend. 

If you are in the north end Boston area and looking for great pasta come here!"
5,"Pomodoro&apos;s atmosphere makes this place incredible alone. It is such a quaint, cozy, authentic Italian restaurant. On top of that, the food and staff were amazing. We got the chicken carbonara and grilled chicken Marsala. They are known to give out some surprising free stuff here and there - the salad and the dessert. Definitely recommend and definitely will be coming back!
What a great experience."
4,"Solid dinner with 3 others. Cash only. Small inside. Okay for small groups. No outside seating but the windows open so gives you the outside feel. 

We split the calamari which was really good. I had the tiger shrimp pasta and my wife had the carbonara which was in an amazing sauce. Our friends also really enjoyed their meal as well. 

The service was mixed but not an issue. We had one waitress helping who was great and extremely friendly. Our other was helpful but seemed like she was having a bad day. Which she might have so not an issue for us. And then they were nice enough to give us each a free tiramisu for dessert. Unprompted. 

My wife and I were on time but our friends were late. The table was also running late which sometimes I take as a good sign as you definitely need a reservation here on a Friday night. 

Overall great experience in the North End as expected. There are so many to pick from, how can these places differentiate themselves?"
5,I&apos;ve since been back and proudly stand behind and further my initial review. I can&apos;t wait to come back next Saturday or Sunday if I can get a reservation!
5,"Yet another fabulous North End restaurant! It&apos;s a cozy (albeit a little small) space. Tables are very limited so reserve in advance. 

We knew about the free dessert at the end, but the waitress was so kind to provide us with a free calamari appetizer as well. We were blown away by this service! The calamari was crispy and well-seasoned, and the sauce that came with it was delicious. The bread was also very flavorful and we finished the whole basked with no problem.

The pastas are all priced at $23. We got both the tiger shrimp w/ linguini and the tiger shrimp w/ salt cod. The linguini was with red sauce, which tasted ripe and fresh. The shrimp was well-seasoned and delicious. The salt cod was good, too. I thought the texture/quality of the pasta itself was just okay, but everything else was fantastic.

The tiramisu at the end was delicious and a very nice finish to the meal.

Our waitress was super friendly and responsive."
5,"Pomodoro feels like a family member opened a restaurant to cook for their friends. The location is small, even for the North End, but feels cozy with a lot of candles and big windows. There are all kinds of tables - some high top, some standard and even a few bar seats by the kitchen. We made reservations a few weeks in advance and had no problem with our timing or being seated.

We were seated at a high top table right next to the window, the stools had small fuzzy fabric pieces on them which I appreciated because they made it more comfortable to sit on and it felt cozier with the chilly weather outside. Their menu isn&apos;t expansive, but there&apos;s more than enough options for everyone to be satisfied. We tried the calamari appetizer and chicken carbonara pasta in addition to the bread and olive oil starter (sooo good) and the complimentary tiramisu for dessert. Service was quick, but we didn&apos;t feel rushed. All the courses were timed perfectly with just enough time to sip some wine in between dishes.

Overall I had a great experience at Pomodoro - the only downside is the amount of planning that goes into a visit here. You need to make reservations well in advance and they only take cash. Neither of which will keep us away in the future, but unfortunately this is not a spot you can just pop into if you&apos;re craving it."
4,"Cozy and romantic ambiance. Great food, good portions. Cash-only. 

I&apos;ve been coming to Pomodoro every so often when I&apos;m craving Italian food for dinner, and it has never let me down. First thing you notice when you walk in is how tiny and cozy it is. There are only a handful of tables here -- the vibe is incredibly intimate, perfect for a night out with a small group of friends, or for a date. 

My go-tos are the Seafood Fra Diavo and the Chicken Carbonara. Both have the perfect amount of meat (you get your money&apos;s worth) combined with rich, deep flavors. 

Pro-tip: My favorite seats in the house are at the counters facing out at Hanover street. Super cozy and great for people watching."
4,"Delicious food in a small restaurant. My date and I had to share a table with other customers which made it hard to have a conversation since the whole place was pretty loud on top of a conversation happening right next to you. We started with calamari which was average, but our dishes and the fresh bread made us want to come back for more. I had the chicken carbonara which was delicious and our waitress was very friendly and even topped up our wine when we had finished. Would recommend, but ensure you have your own table"
5,"The food was excellent. Amazing service!!!!! We got a wonderful goat cheese salad and tiramisu on the house. This place is wonderful, and I would definitely come again  for some pasta. The pasta is very fresh and flavorful. 

The place is pretty small so big parties are probably harder to accommodate"
3,"Yet another example of why I wished Yelp had a means of rating restaurants on multiple elements.  I really don&apos;t believe 3 stars is fair (too low), but given the overall experience, I think 4 is too high.

So in my attempt at fairness, here goes:

Food:  4.0
Service:  4.0
Comfort: 2.5
Drinks:  1.0
Payment Methods:  1.0

Food:
We all agreed the food was very good and didn&apos;t feel like we&apos;d swallowed a ton of bricks when we left... none the less, we were all full.

The Calamari was cooked well and served with a nice light marinara as well as a spicy mayo.

The Seafood Diavolo was excellent... not too spicy but not mild by any stretch.

Service:
The woman working the front of house in this small restaurant was very nice and handled both hostess and service.

Comfort:
It&apos;s very tiny inside... not a huge issue, but with the lawn-style seating, very loud space once there were more than 6 people inside and terribly undersized AC system, it wasn&apos;t a very comfortable dining experience.  I was literally exhausted when I left due to the heat and loudness of the Place by the time I left.

Drinks:
Wine &amp; water... literally, that&apos;s all they offer.  

Payment method:
I could say shame on me... but in this day and age, I don&apos;t feel it&apos;s too much to ask for places to accept cards.  I had lost my wallet a few days before while traveling.  The only payment form I had was my Amex card, so to learn only after having completed the meal they only take cash obviously led to what could have been a very embarrassing moment... fortunately my girlfriend was with me and was willing to go run down he street to an ATM (since the one we had been guided to across the street didn&apos;t work).  I can appreciate those tax-evading business owners as I&apos;d love to only take cash on my business... but if your going to only take cash, it seems logical to make a very big deal and mention up front before people order and end up in a similar situation.  If you are going to choose to go against normalcy in today&apos;s retail and hospitality business, you owe it to your patrons to prevent them from being embarrassed when they learn they can&apos;t pay in a method that has been widely used since the 1960s."
5,"I LOVED Pomodoro; it provided me with two superlatives in one meal (the mussels and the tiramisu - both the best examples of their kind I&apos;d ever had)!

Just assuming they didn&apos;t take reservations (but apparently they do) I showed up and got very, very lucky with their last available table for two. This is a TINY place and I still can&apos;t believe my luck.

I had come for their tiger shrimp and salt cod dish, which sounded unique and delicious - and it was, but I fell in love with the mussels first. A stupendous amount for $16, it seemed like one of those bottomless buckets of wings you get at an AYCE place, except in a rich, brilliant orange saffron fennel broth and with every. single. mussel! sweet and perfect. Not a bad one in the bunch, which is a feat when you&apos;re eating what feels like 50 mussels! Some were bigger (and with more of a taste of the sea) and some were smaller (with more of a sweet taste) but all were devoured enthusiastically.

By the time we had finished with the mussels and the shrimp/cod dish, we were so stuffed that if I had known free tiramisu was coming, I would have declined it. And it would have been a huge mistake. I&apos;ve never loved tiramisu - only ever ordered it for the creamy guilty pleasure of it - and this one looked too bready to even bother. But looks can be deceiving, and the lightly soaked ladyfingers had a wet yet not soggy texture and the strong overtone of good espresso. My friend, who just a minute earlier had been worried he was going to throw up from having totally overindulged, and who said I could eat his tiramisu, saw my face after I tried it and quickly changed his mind."
5,"Wow, Pomodoro was truly extremely good. It&apos;s in a great location and we were really pleased with our experience. Everything on the menu seemed really good, especially Caesar Salad. And also, the service was excellent and the staff was really polite. But, seriously. Pomodoro - Really, really good."
5,"Whoaaaaa! This place is as charming as it is delicious. A TINY restaurant next to a big popular one, we got to sit at the window and watch the passing pedestrians. 

The antipasto was unique and packed with flavor. They served crunchy, delicious rolls alongside a dish of olives. The set is was genuine and warm... like your two favorite aunts doting on you. 

They gave 3 choices for wine but the one I chose was one of the best I&apos;ve tasted. We split the chicken carbonara (thank goodness) and it was rich and flavorful. 

At the end they invited us to stay for a complimentary homemade tiramisu. I am a tiramisu SNOB and I found it utterly lovely. 

What a fantastic dining experience! Highly recommend this taste of Italian magic."
1,"Service 0/5
Food 1/5
Ambiance 1/5

There are so many wonderful restaurants in the North End, but Pomodoro definitely is not one of them. First of all, be prepared that there is no sign, and Pomodoro is a bit hard to find. I thought it was actually part of Giacomo&apos;s.

The inside of the restaurant is tiny. It maybe seats 30 people and is so loud. We were seated at this janky &quot;bar&quot;. It reminded me of a cheesy bar that somebody would put in their 70&apos;s style basement/mancave. Our view was of the kitchen which was not a pleasant view.

There was zero hospitality or warmth from the one waitress. She was inattentive and not friendly in the least.

My daughter got the cod and it stunk, literally. She said it was flavorless and left 95% of it.

I got the Chicken Carbonara and it was greasy and overpowered with pepper. It was nasty. If you like Spaghetti Carbonara, go down the street to Saraceno&apos;s, where it is amazing."
