5,"This is a cozy and cute spot for a satisfying meal. They have a fantastic menu and the service was prompt. There were other reviews that talked about the service, but our experience was attentive and personable. They offered us the option of sitting outside by a heater or inside. We elected inside and waited in the car. When our table was ready they came out and brought us in. This was great to avoid crowding as the space is small, but cozy. The coffee was fine, but their pancakes and shakshuka were great. The food here is definitely something I would not be able to easily make on my own at home. We will be returning to try the rest of their menu which also looks tasty! Thank you for a wonderful meal and we will return!

The tables were truly spaced far enough apart. All the staff wore masks. They had hand sanitizer readily available. They also have oat milk. Lots of pluses!"
5,"We have been trying a new restaurant each week in Covid. Milkweed was a standout, with excellent food a little fancier than we are used to (and quite rich). Everything was top quality! Prices very reasonable for this level of dining. Highly recommended."
5,The service is amazing. The place has a great vibe and well protected from Covid. The Irish Coffee is the best I ever had. And the cheesy grits are some of the best this side of the mason dixon. Seriously you have to eat here at least once if you are in Boston
4,"This place is a small cozy and hip location. Breakfast is great especially their corned beef hash! Since it&apos;s a Valentines weekend they gave us an unexpected surprise -complimentary pancakes! Milkweed will give you food coma right after so be careful~! But that&apos;s when you know the food is good. 

Apologies for the lack of food pictures... I was hungry so I forgot."
1,"Avoid this super spreader. The staff are rude and dismissive. To make matters more egregious the food isn&apos;t that great. 

We were told to wait an hour and ten minutes and then we did . Only to be told to wait another hour. Unacceptable. .."
4,"Went for brunch to Milkweed today and for the first time there was no wait time. I was glad to see the social distance measures they have adopted. Plexiglass between tables and disinfecting between clients. Service was reasonable, our waitress was nice.

Food wise the cappuccino was normal, truffle fries could have used some salt and the power bowl was a great healthy option. The bowl came with avocado which I sent back because it had several brown spots, and they brought a nice green slice. I rate this meal with four stars because although it was good there is room for improvement."
4,"Came here for lunch, made reservations but the service was a little slow but we finally got our table. They have QR code menus during Covid, so easy to check it online. I got the turkey burger and my mom got the fresh berry pancakes. We also got a latte and vanilla cappuccino for drinks. The turkey burger was alright not very good, but loved the idea of cranberry aioli in it. The fries that came with it, were so crispy and delicious! The fresh berry pancakes were amazing and I would definitely get the pancakes again! 
Overall this is a good place for brunch and the variety of items on the menu, so good!"
3,"This one is tough! Two visits - Two VERY different experiences. Let me break it down...

1st Visit
FOOD: (8.5/10)
Hands down one of my favorite experience I&apos;ve had at a breakfast. I ordered the special (Yuca &amp; Eggs) and the 
Shakshuka with meatballs.
The Yuca &amp; eggs was one of the most delicious things to have graced my palette. The beef and pork were so perfectly seasoned and prepared that I can only describe it as perfection. Even the avocado was perfectly ripe and was as smooth as butter.
-
The shakshuka was alright at best. It does have the potential to be great, especially with how delicious the meatballs were. The recipe just needs to be revisited and refined.
Also ordered a banana-caramel muffin. Again, probably the best muffin I&apos;ve had in a LONG time.

SERVICE: (10/10)
Greeted at the door with a smile (so big you could see it behind the mask). After being seated, we were informed about the specials and were given recommendations.
The lady (I&apos;m assuming the owner) would check on us ever so often to make sure everything was to our liking, but not too often that it was intrusive.

CLEANLINESS: (8/10)
Restroom was very clean. Tables were wiped down after every patron left.

2nd Visit - THEIR FIRST CUSTOMER of the day**
SERVICE: (2/10)
My first visit was so spot on I returned two days later to have my mind blow again. It was... just in the polar opposite way.
Greeted by a different lady. Asked to be seated at the window but was told &quot;I can&apos;t do that, we don&apos;t know how busy we might get.&quot; WE WERE THE ONLY ONES IN THERE. Checked on us once, never saw her again except when we got the receipt.

FOOD: (4/10)
Ordered the Power Bowl and Morning Madness.
The Morning Madness was a complete and utter disgrace. You can tell the cook didn&apos;t give to Fs about being there. It was $14 for sloppy diner food... eggs covered in grease, bland home fries, pork sausages (which were actually good) and BURNT BACON (pictured). It was their first order of the day and they served me chard bacon...
I wouldn&apos;t feed that meal to an animal.
-
Power Bowl was satisfactory; nothing special. Solution a there needs to be more dressing served on the side.
The eggs were undercooked around the yolk but it gets a pass. However, those too were oily."
4,"The restaurant was crazy busy at 11:30ish on a Saturday, obviously getting a strong brunch crowd.

We came for lunch and had to sit outside because of the crowd, but didn&apos;t have to wait for a table as they had a handful open in their outdoor dining section. The outdoor dining area has several tall freestanding heaters, but the one closest to our table &quot;wasn&apos;t working&quot;. Overall, I&apos;d say that the service was moderately friendly and a little slow.

We ordered a Cubano sandwich, the Sirloin mac n&apos; cheese, a grilled cheese, and the Buttermilk fried chicken. Being used to S Florida Cuban food, the Cuban was maybe 7/10. The mac n&apos; cheese was well done - creamy with tender, marinated pieces of sirloin steak throughout. The fried chicken was solid on its own, but the gravy certainly made it a dish I&apos;d order again. The gravy was unique as it wasn&apos;t smooth, but had loads of chopped and sautéed onions and chicken sausage. 

Some of the dinner entrees on the menu are interesting and all of the breakfast items we saw coming out to the brunchers looked quite good. I think next time we come, we&apos;ll try a different time of day to sample their other dishes."
4,"My friends and I ate at Milkweed on two separate occasions. One time for brunch and another for dinner. We throughly enjoyed our food on both occasions. The restaurant is small and has a nice cafe feel. There was a cute outdoor set up as well. Our dinner experience went better than our brunch experience due to customer service issues but I&apos;ll give them a pass because the food is bomb. I&apos;ll just go through my fav dishes real quick. 

Buffalo wings-THE BEST WINGS HANDS DOWN! Saucy yet very crispy as well. It was piping hot when it came out too. I wanted a plate all to myself.

Salmon cakes-Another fav! The cheesy grits and the chipotle aioli sauce just topped everything off. 

Sirloin mac &amp; cheese-looked amazing but the blue cheese was way too over powering. 

Buttermilk fried chicken dinner meal-it was served with kale mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes tasted so fresh like they whipped it together right then and there. The gravy on top was very yummy. I loved my fried chicken, it was so juicy and crispy. 

Egg, cheese &amp; chicken sausage sandwich-The perfect sandwich. I would have this for breakfast every morning if I could. 

All my friends loved their food. They really enjoyed  the fried calamari which I don&apos;t eat but I think it may be worth a try. Would I return? Of course, paid them a visit twice already lol"
4,"Delicious food. There was a wait. Even by joining the waitlist through yelp, we had to wait a bit when we arrived. However, the food was worth the wait! 

I ordered the Morning Madness with eggs over medium. The eggs were a little overdone. I also ordered two muffins of the day to go- one corn muffin and one pumpkin chocolate chip (no photos taken). The corn was delicious. A little sweetened, but I would get it again. The pumpkin muffin seemed like it had been made wrong. It was thin and rubbery. The texture was all wrong, so I&apos;m not sure what happened on that one. 

I wanted to try a cocktail but decided against it. Next time, I&apos;ll be indulging!"
4,"A very good brunch place! My boyfriend got an omelette and I got the special chorizo Benedict. Let me say, whatever seasoning they put on the potatoes were amazing!!! That alone I would come back for. The Benedict I thought was ok. The hollandaise sauce was very very bland and I think for eggs Benny that&apos;s what makes it. Wouldn&apos;t get again. I would come back to try something else"
3,"This place had been in my bookmarks for over a year, and I finally had the chance to try it. Sadly, it did not live up to my expectations. I ordered an ice chai latte and power bowl. The latte was 80% ice and barely tasted like chai, just cold milk. My power bowl was one dimensional in flavor and my friend&apos;s salmon bowl was small in portion, not worth the $13 or so. What I did appreciate was the plexiglass barriers between socially-distanced tables which made my dining experience feel more safe. The waiter was kind and prompt with our orders and the interior was bright and clean. Maybe I just came on a bad day, since I heard so much buzz about their food."
5,"I went here for the first time to meet with friends for breakfast. We put our names down and waited about 15 minutes for a table, which gave us time to walk around the block before they texted us. I&apos;d recommend getting there early on a weekend or holiday because when we left the line was pretty long. 
The breakfast was awesome! I got a pomegranate mimosa and my friends got bloody Mary&apos;s. They were all very good. I ordered the Morning Madness which had three types of meat (sausage, bacon, and ham), eggs cooked to your liking, potatoes, and I substituted a Lucky Charms pancake instead of French toast. It was a lot of food and perfect for sharing with others who wanted to try things. My friends got the daily muffin (banana and strawberry), Florentine omelet, and Bacon and Avocado scramble, which they liked. Overall it was a great dining experience and I would go back again if I&apos;m in the area!"
5,"WOW~~ I was craving brunch food and decided to try this place out based on a friend&apos;s recommendation. It was a beautiful day and we wanted to sit outside. Milkweed had tables/benches set up in the parking lot and we were all spread apart. We were served bottle water &amp; QR code was laminated to the table. Felt pretty safe! 

We were recommended the dutch baby pancake and it was *delicious*. Warning: the pan is SUPER HOT and we were warned multiple times before hand. Not as sweet as I expected too, which I prefer!

We also got the Spanish omelet w/ corn hash, &amp; the morning madness dish w/ nutella + strawberry french toast. The portions were pretty big and had to take some things home. But overall, pretty solid! I would love to come back with a group and maybe order a few cocktails"
5,What a cute spot! Was looking for a late brunch spot and stumbled upon this gem I had saved! It was right after brunch so it wasn&apos;t to busy we sat down as soon as we arrived and greeted by our hostess! I was pleased to be seated in the corner away from people and happy to see that although the space was a bit small all social distancing measures were being taken serious! The Atmosphere was very cute and quaint almost like a coffee shop but with way more in store. We ordered two main dishes and an appetizer. We were not impressed by the crispy calamari but were not charged for the dish and thoroughly enjoyed the sirloin Mac and the Steak tips! So much so my friend got more Mac to go! The drinks were very delicious and were perfect for a Sunday afternoon chill date! Would definitely recommend this spot if your looking for a cute brunch/lunch date out!
3,"Decent place with traditional American breakfast fare . We had ordered scrambled eggs, omelette varieties and potatoes . Eggs were good , but potatoes had absolutely  no seasoning  or flavor. Coffee was ok . Parking was a big issue as there is only street parking available and spots get filled ver quickly."
5,"Becca:
Came here on a Sunday morning with a friend from out of town. We joined the &quot;Yelp waitlist&quot; which they&apos;re apparently no longer doing during COVID. Despite being really busy, we only waited around 10 minutes to be seated inside and they have a ton of seating in the parking lot. 

We both got pomegranate mimosas (delicious) and reasonably priced for brunch at $10. I got the morning madness and substituted the French toast for the Lucky Charm pancake. It&apos;s basically a 2 egg breakfast with home fries and then 2 slices bacon, 2 sausage links, and a slice of ham which we shared. It was great but you really can&apos;t mess that up. The star of the show was the Lucky Charm pancake. I don&apos;t think I could eat a plate of these but it was delicious! My friend got the vegetarian egg white scramble which looked sad in comparison to my giant meal but she enjoyed. Pro tip: always get the daily muffin. No matter what it is, just get it. She had the orange coconut one and it looked 11/10. 

The staff seemed stressed (who wouldn&apos;t be stressed working a Sunday brunch during a pandemic) but they were polite and prompt. All condiments are in disposable containers and tables are spaced 6 feet apart. 

Love this place, glad I took an out of town guest here and would be back! Just don&apos;t get trapped in the Yelp waiting list like I did."
4,"Lucky Charms Pancakes - $10

Milkweed is one of the cutest brunch spots in Boston. It&apos;s small + cozy + adorable. It really gives off that cute café vibe with the high stool chairs &amp; string lights. They&apos;re usually busy so keep in mind of a wait. I ordered the lucky charms pancakes because they looked so magical!! (I also ordered scrambled eggs on the side because pancakes should always have a side).

I loved how the lucky charms were made inside the pancakes. The pancakes were good but I wish they were more soft . The butter &amp; my side of eggs (delicious btw) helped but I&apos;m really hoping it&apos;s just a one-off! I&apos;ve heard amazing things about their pancakes so I definitely will try their menu out again. You guys should definitely check them out as well!

4,"My friend and I went here last night. They&apos;re currently offering breakfast, lunch, and dinner all day. They usually only have the breakfast and lunch menu available before 4pm, but due to COVID they&apos;ve changed their services a bit. They&apos;re popular for their brunch food so if you&apos;re craving breakfast food at any time of the day, then come here!! Both outdoor and indoor seating are available. 

To see the menu, we used our phones to scan the QR code sticker on the table. It shows the breakfast, lunch, dinner, drinks and dessert menu.

When I went it was pretty empty. We arrived at 6pm and left around 7:30pm - during the whole time, we only saw one other table with customers. The other times I&apos;ve come here for brunch (pre-COVID), it was always packed and you&apos;d have to wait for a seat. 

My friend ordered the Falafel Gyro, while I ordered the Salmon Burger. We both got a side of Sweet Potato Fries. The top bun of the salmon burger was soft but also crispy from being toasted. The fried salmon cake patty was fresh and delicious - the chipotle sauce added more flavor to it, but the salmon was already pretty strong. Personally, I didn&apos;t like the cucumbers in the burger because they became warm from the salmon patty.. and I don&apos;t like warm cucumbers. The sweet potato fries were pretty good as a side. The waiter forgot to ask if we wanted drinks, so we had our meal without water until we realized we were thirsty. 

In the past, I&apos;ve only tried their brunch food (which I really like). My favorite are the Fresh Berry Pancakes. This was my first time trying dinner here and it&apos;s not bad! I&apos;d probably choose to come here for brunch next time though."
