5,"This was only about a block away from our hotel, so we made sure to take a walk through this space.

Not overly crowded, but literally everyone had on masks and were practicing social distancing ... yes outdoors. Really great scenic area with ponds, trees that were holing on to the last of their fall colors, statues ..... great open grass spaces to sit and enjoy (if it&apos;s warmer than the day we were visiting). 

People were all friendly and offered to take pics of us and we made sure to return the favor. Some awesome places to get some great pics that include high rise skylines with an amazing park in the front. Highly recommend taking a few minutes to walk through this space. 

Oh, also, landscaped obviously very nicely .... but, it is really clean! There isn&apos;t any litter anywhere, so they obviously take good care of this place."
5,"You can&apos;t go wrong with the Boston Common area, which to you all not from Boston is a park comparable to NYC&apos;s Central Park - just not as big. 

One of the coolest things which i wasn&apos;t aware until this trip was the fact this was the setting of Goodwill Hunting&apos;s duck pond scene. We went and sat on the bench and as this movie is my #2 movie of all-time? Trip made.

It is a large park, so there are plenty of things you can do from get sun or sit in shade, lawn games, pick up games, duck pond paddle boats, napping or walking from here to Cheers for a Sam Adams. 

Was a fan of this. Would come back. Cheers."
5,Beautiful park. Everyone is also being really good about wearing their masks. And the music entertainers were still out making beautiful music.
4,"A quick drive-by on a Sunday before heading down to NY, gave us a good glimpse of this park. Even though we didn&apos;t step foot here, I personally think the most interesting part of this park has got to be the underground parking garage we saw time and again driving around the city. It actually reminded me of the underground garages all over Mallorca. If anything, see this park as Boston&apos;s &quot;Central Park&quot;- not because of its size, but because it&apos;s just centrally located."
4,"Out of all the days, this day has one of my brightest spots. Although I was nervous near all the extremist groups around...what a beautiful day and to see someone else super happy makes me happy. I walked around and took some of the best photos of the trip."
5,"I visited yesterday and spent my entire morning admiring the beautiful auburn, orange and yellow trees. It was so serene and the scenery was so breathtaking."
4,"Beautiful park and America&apos;s oldest park that is located in the heart of Boston. 

So much history, this is a must go. Also, this is where the freedom trial begins."
4,"I absolutely love this park. This park, along with Boston Public Garden, make up what I call the Central Park of Boston. 

Easily accessible by the T, this park almost makes you forget you are in a big city, with it&apos;s spacious grounds and central location, but I think that is the point that this park is trying to make.

In the center of the park you will find a man (town crier if you will) that gives accurate (mostly) weather reports on the day. Frequenters of the park know he is harmless and will bring their dogs over to him to pet. I guess again gives the park it&apos;s lovable lore.

This easily rivals Central Park in aesthetics and location."
5,"Boston Common has a storied history of being a pasture for cows, a place for public oration and protest, and one of the first public &quot;parks&quot; in the Nation. 

It&apos;s a beautiful park, with so much to do and see. There&apos;s a pool for kiddos, Shakespeare in the Park, swan boats, and flora galora! Loved my visits to Boston Common on a recent trip, and will always make time to visit, when visiting Boston again."
5,"During the summer this park is poppin! Love taking a stroll and seeing how busy it gets with people! People watching here is fun! 

This time around I visited on a cold rainy winter day and it was dead! My sister and I were the only ones walking around, it was so eerie. Nonetheless though, it&apos;s such a beautiful park.

Christmas lights were put up making it extra special. This is definitely a must visit when in Boston!"
4,"My family stopped in Boston Common to take a rest as we explored the city, we sat in front of a large fountain and let the sound soothe us. The park is large and beautiful. It had plenty of seats as well as some food vendors if your feeling hungry. I was thinking about buying something and having a nice meal at the park but decided to keep going on my way and continue my exploration of the city. 

Certainly a nice stop to rest, relax and enjoy oneself."
5,"The Boston Common is easily one of the most important parts of American History and is the scene of some of this county&apos;s most important movements of all time. This is the beginning of the &quot;Freedom Trail&quot; and serves as a really good starting or meeting point for anything in downtown Boston. I really loved the park and it&apos;s natural beauty and it had that Central Park feel with large buildings surrounding all sides. There are loads of places to sit and during normal times a lot of different events that happen throughout the year. There are 2 I believe subway lines that stop in the Commons on opposite ends. The Commons has the paddle boats, duck ponds, sculptures, and some other famous sites to see from movies and TV shows. Some of the buildings near the Common are hundreds of years old and fun to explore. This is a must visit experience for any trip to Boston and one that surely won&apos;t disappoint!"
5,"LOVE THIS PARK!! PERIOD!!

I was exploring Boston alone and after exploring Freedom Trail got exhausted coz it was like 80 degrees and with a back pack . I needed some place to relax and glad it part of the Freedom Trail.

Lot of greenery with cool breeze and I just took of my shoe and laid down on the grass for 45 mins watching people and listening to an old Chinese man playing an instrument. Felt so good. Probably one of the best moments of my trip.

Pros:
----------
Great place to relax
Historical sites around and in  the park
In downtown
Close to subway and buses
Kids play area
Lot of vendors and food trucks
AMC with in 10 min"
4,"We did a lovely walking tour here. The day was perfect for a walk and we decided check out the Boston Common. There are a lot of kids playing in the area and some of the local wildlife were out.  It&apos;s a nice clean and pretty place to walk around. I heard that in the summertime there are other activities and kids playing here, but not fall in late October it was just people hanging out."
5,"Boston Common is the official beginning of the Freedom Trail. My sister and I took a walking tour, so our guide walked us around. We didn&apos;t do the whole trail, but apparently it&apos;s 2.5 miles with 16 different sites to check out. Some of the sites you&apos;ll see: Park Street Church, Massachusetts State House, site of the Boston Massacre, the Benjamin Franklin Statue, Paul Revere House and more.

Great place to read a book or take a stroll on a beautiful day!"
5,"This is a lovely park smack in the middle of downtown Boston.  The city dwellers take full advantage of this green space.  There were tons of people out walking or jogging in the park in the middle of the work day.  

It is hard to believe this park has been around since 1634.  Our founding fathers walk in through this park.  

The park is well kept and clean.  I noticed a few playgrounds for the kids, water fountains and plenty of fields for playing and trees for shade. You can also pick up some tasty street food and relax on a park bench."
5,The common is a must visit. There is always something going on here. I usually use this as my walk through the city.
5,Beautiful historical location. Definitely a must visit location of this beautiful 50 acre public park which is centrally located in Boston.  The parking is very limited so try to take a taxi or uber. Across the street is a few food spots.
4,"Huge Park With Statues, Food Vendors, Lots Of Winding Trails!

I like this little park when I am in Boston.... You can Stop by Cheers the bar and have a drink and then stroll across the street walk all over. 

It is a nice reprieve from the concrete and brick jungle surrounding this park. 

There are some statues 

There are some homeless people sleeping off in the trees, so be mindful of your surroundings."
5,"Regardless of the season, Boston Common is beautiful year-round. In the summer/spring, expect green foliage, beautiful blooms, and ducks sunning their feathers. Winter showcases the beauty of snowy New England, and fall is simply unmatched! Peruse the animals, stroll through the paths, admire the history, or take a ride on the famous swan boats. You can even enjoy light snacks (and sometimes music) from local vendors as you walk. This is my favorite place in Boston and recommend it to all my visiting friends. Don&apos;t forget to visit the duckling statue!"
