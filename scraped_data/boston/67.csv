4,"Beautiful upscale restaurant in Back Bay. We were seated next to the fireplace which gave a cozy atmosphere. All the staff members were extremely attentive and wearing masks. Here is my review on the food:

Fried Calamari ($18)
Usually fried calamari can get greasy, but not this one! The calamari was perfectly fried in a thin coating of well-seasoned batter. It tasted light and airy and paired nicely with the green goddess dressing on the side.

100 Day Aged Prime Ribeye ($60)
Ribeye is my favorite cut of steak so I got this to see what an aged ribeye would taste like. Unfortunately, it wasn&apos;t for me. I asked for medium rare, but it was rarer than I would&apos;ve liked. The outside parts were at the temperature I asked for, but the texture was soft and chewy. Perhaps that&apos;s how aged steaks are supposed to be, but I personally prefer steaks with a bit more bite to it. The caramelized onions were delicious though.

Prime New York ($54)
My friend shared this with me and I liked it a lot more than the ribeye. The steak had more body and sear on the outside. I like the pairing of the steak with the caramelized onions. The salad on the side gave a hint of acidity which balanced out the dish overall.

Grill 23 Tots ($14)
This is a must get if you like truffle! The tater tots looked plain from the distance, but once they were brought up close, the aroma of the truffle oil overtook our senses and it was absolutely incredible! The tots were perfectly cooked as well - crispy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside.

Au Poivre Asparagus ($15)
Grilled asparagus in worcestershire and parmesan. This one was okay for me. The asparagus was cooked well but the flavor wasn&apos;t mind-blowing. Unless you really love asparagus, I would skip this."
5,"Wow! We were so looking forward to going to Grill 23. We had a gift card to use from Christmas and than Covid appeared. We finally got our chance to use for take out tonight and it was certainly worth the wait. The Steak Frites, Sesame crusted Yellowfin Tuna, and Mac and Cheese with lobster were so delicious and our favorites! The Brussels sprouts and asparagus were wonderful too.  But then we got to the Chocolate Chip Cookies and the Famous Coconut Cake and we knew they were made in heaven. So fabulous.  Thank you for the great packaging and bringing to our car! The whole meal from ordering to the last crumb was fantastic.
Thanks for the 5 star experience! We will be back!"
4,"Recently dined here for my brother&apos;s milestone birthday and according to the carnivores in our party, it delivered!    

A must try is the Waygu Grade A5, Kagoshima Prefecture as an appetizer.   Our server highlighted that it&apos;s basically the world&apos;s best beef averaging the most awards for any Japanese beef lately.  Course that meant we HAD to have it!   Note: It&apos;s quite small (2 oz) so if you have a large party, you&apos;ll definitely need at least a couple orders for the table so everyone can sample but the consensus at our table was that this was so worth it!   

Another app that was a huge success was the Shellfish Sampler.  Huge portion of fresh sea treasures and I loved that it had salmon tartare and mussels escabeche, which aren&apos;t always in the usual raw bar samplers.  The fried calamari and caesar salad were okay, standard and par for the course.   

For steak entrees, the american kobe cap steak won the most nods.  My brother smiled from ear to ear as he enjoyed his birthday steak.   To my surprise, they do also offer a fair amount of options for non-beef eaters.  The kids were able to enjoy some mac and cheese, hash browns, tater tots and veggies.  For me, I went with the crab cake sandwich and tbh, it was likely the least pleasant out of everything we had tried.   Crab cake was very bland and dry with too much breading.   On a do-over, I&apos;d likely stick with a lobster roll or a fish entree instead.

Overall, our party was pretty pleased and the birthday boy had great wine, great steak and of course the best company ;)  Our server was phenomenal as well.  More importantly, he made sure we never wanted for anything.  I really wish I remembered his name.   He was super attentive but never intrusive and was on top of things.  

Definitely one of the better options for a special occasion celebration for a steak lover looking for more than average offerings for steak."
5,"We were in Boston for four days and we made reservations right away to eat here!  It was my Birthday and I just has my gall bladder out and we really couldn&apos;t find a place that the whole menu was all beef.  We searched for a while and found Grill 23.  

I am so happy we celebrated my Birthday here.  It was in the top #3 of all time for fantastic food!  I had Giannone Chicken and it was served with a horseradish mashed potatoes and by far they were the best mashed I&apos;ve ever had!  I also had a ceasar salad that was fantastic.  My fiance had the 100 day ribeye and he&apos;s still talking about it a month later.  

They really were super fun, we had a fantastic waiter and they made my birthday super fun and special! Thank you.. we&apos;re definitely going here for NYE!"
2,Got recommendations for this place so decided to do takeout. Unfortunately I was highly disappointed. The food was gross. I ended up throwing most of it away. I got the crab cake which tasted like a microwave crabcake youd by in a frozen aisle. Salmon was bland and underwhelming. &amp; the brocolli was gross.
5,"Came here for a birthday dinner with my boyfriend on a Friday night with reservations. The staff were really tentative and friendly. We started with a rose sangria which was a perfect balance of fruity sweetness. The oysters from Maine were fresh, juicy and sweet. I recommend getting some oysters if you visit. The clams were also fresh but I wasn&apos;t a big fan of them. The cream spinach was good but nothing amazing, if I can go back in time I might get another side. The tatter tots were amazing though, it was a cross of tatter tots on the outside with mashed potatoes on the inside. The tatter tots had a wonderful truffle smell too. My boyfriend said his kobe steak was well seasoned and cooked to perfection. I really enjoyed my dry aged steak too, it was juicy and it had that nice funky smell/taste."
5,I&apos;ve been to a number of steakhouses across the world and I will say that the Kobe cap steak I had at Grill 23 on Thursday night this past week was the BEST steak I&apos;ve ever had. I don&apos;t say that lightly either. Everything else was pretty good and the service stood out in terms of professionalism. This will be my go-to spot for steak in Boston from now on.
5,"Went for drinks, appetizers and dessert.  Server  was great and attentive.  Staff was accommodating as we did not make a reservation.  Oysters and shrimp were fresh. Desserts were okay. Wine and drink selection vast. And cocktails well done! Strong. Will go back for dinner."
5,"I am quite impressed! Absolutely over the top dining experience. Everything from the food to the service to the atmosphere. Steak cooked to perfection! 

Came for DineoutBoston March 2020 and they were incredibly generous with their portion size. 

Their snicker sundae is to die for!"
5,"Updated in December 2019:
Grill 23 consistently provides both incredible food and service and I&apos;m here to give it that fifth star. All I really need to say is that not one, not two, but THREE bartenders have independently remembered me, and both where I like to sit and what I like to order. I can&apos;t name a single other restaurant where I&apos;ve experienced hospitality like this, and it really stands out.

Luckily, in my opinion the food really does match up to the charm, which is not something you might expect given how upscale the dining room is. There&apos;s no question that the restaurant caters to an older and classier crowd, and seems to host a lot of family gatherings and business meetings, but if you have a chance to stop in to the bar for a nice meal I highly recommend you do so.

First of all, the 100 day (wet) aged prime rib-eye is a stunner, featuring 18 oz of meat from Brandt farms for $60 (previously $59). I tend to be quite disappointed with wet aging, but this is probably one of the finest examples of the technique I&apos;ve ever eaten. The flavor of the steak is robust and complex, and I promise you won&apos;t be disappointed. I&apos;ve compared it myself to their own dry-aged prime NY strip and I vastly prefer the ribeye, although your mileage may vary. That said, I wouldn&apos;t recommend ordering this cooked anything beyond medium rare (Grill 23 is also one of the only places that can properly do a rare plus, which would be my recommendation) as you&apos;ll lose a good amount of both flavor and texture.

The bar burger itself is also a success in my opinion. It seems the blend itself may change with the season, but when I ordered it there was American Wagyu in the blend, along with a layer of thick-cut bacon and a really fantastic remoulade. It honestly took me by surprise, and the herb &amp; parmesan fries it comes with are also delicious. I was tempted to call it the best burger I&apos;ve had in Boston, but I have to try again before making sure.

If I wanted to have a classic meal in town, perhaps something that would satisfy the whole family, Grill 23 would be at the top of my list. Sometimes tradition tends to outweigh culinary excitement, but Grill 23 is the rare exception, where memorable service and delicious food go hand in hand."
5,"The meal and service were both incredible. Staff was so friendly and extremely accommodating with my dietary restrictions - Our waiter was Brian S. The sesame crusted yellowfin tuna was amazing, especially the soy marinated mushrooms, and my boyfriend&apos;s steak was cooked to perfection!"
4,"The least expensive entree at Grill 23 &amp; Bar is their vegetarian option - Spring Mushrooms &amp; Wheat Berries $29 arugula, parmesan, citrus.  For entrees with animal protein, it was their Steak Frites $33.  A la carte pricing starts at $36 (swordfish steak 10 oz) and $38 (twin filets 8 oz), while side dishes to accompany them ranged from $12 (for their mashed potatoes and heirloom carrots) to $16 (stuffed mushrooms).  Thus it took Dine Out Boston (aka Restaurant Week, aka RW) to lure me in through their doors.

Just as I was about to sit down, I noticed that water had dripped on to my seat.  They quickly wiped it up and apologized.  A bread basket with an assortment from red speckled flatbread to twin fluffy rolls, with squares of focaccia, and sliced brown bread of sorts tucked in.  The butter was soft and spreadable.  My personal favorite were the sweet rolls.

Their $38 3 course Dine Out menu was printed right on the bottom of that day&apos;s single sheet menu.  I had no trouble making my choices:

CORN CHOWDER
with roasted peppers &amp; charred corn

BRANDT FLAT IRON STEAK
duck fat poached potatoes, parmesan creamed kale 

LEMON CURD TART
with blueberry preserves, malted meringues

Though I also got to sample my DC&apos;s choices which differed from mine (we all picked the steak as our entree):

CLAM &amp; GREEN ONION FRITTERS
with bacon remoulade, frisee

BROWNIE SUNDAE
with raspberry swirl ice cream, white chocolate puffed rice

Of the appetizers, I felt mine to be the better pick, as the fritters were soft and not very meaty.  We all ordered our steak to be medium rare, but the results ranged a bit more than to be expected.  One friend&apos;s steak was a bit thinner, and so that might have been a reason for her steak to be closer to medium than the rest, however it was still not ideal.  The potatoes were buttery, and the creamed kale a nice touch.  Both desserts were well enjoyed, and we each felt we made the better choice.  A sweet ending to an enjoyable meal.

We wondered if this would be one of those classy establishments which would have those cool crumb scrapers.  Well, definitely not after the first course, however, the bus boy was impressive as he quickly and professionally cleared our table of appetizer plates in one trip, while playing plate Tetris.  Later when he was about to set down the utensils for the dessert course, out came the scraper!

The longest wait was for dessert.  Otherwise the timing was satisfactory.

$21 valet parking.  Individual gendered bathrooms.  Noisier a space than I like prefer.  I wonder if it might have been more quiet upstairs."
3,"We had reservations at 8, but arrived at 7:30. I let the hostess know we were early and she said no problem and sat us. 

We were given a basket with an assortment of bread, which was very good.

Our waiter was very attentive and knowledgeable. If this review was based off his service it would&apos;ve been higher.

I was really looking forward to the American Kobe Cap Steak. All the reviews left me salivating, but it was such a disappointment. At first, I thought I was given the wrong steak, but was assured it was correct. How can the reviews really state&quot;best steak ever&quot;?! Mine was tough and not very tender. I immediately regretted my decision and should&apos;ve went with the ribeye. My boyfriend throughly enjoyed his filet. I had a bite and it was very good.

The mac n&apos; cheese and pan roasted broccoli were good, but nothing special. 

Later that evening I received an email from open table (where we made our reservation), stating we didn&apos;t show up. 

Not the best fine dining experience in Boston.

**The manager messaged me and offered to make things right. We were only in Boston for vacation, but very appreciative for the prompt attention."
4,"UPDATE: Grill 23 takes customer service seriously! I had a disappointing experience for my engagement dinner in terms of the service. The manager, Greg, immediately reached out to me to ask how they amend the situation for the future. We gave Grill 23 another try for another celebration, and we&apos;re glad we did. The staff were very attentive and professional. We were most impressed by speed of the responsiveness of this restaurant, and how seriously they took the situation. 

The food was excellent, as was the case last time. We had the mussels, soft shell crab, dry aged prime rib, lobster Mac &amp; Cheese, and chocolate cake with salted caramel ice cream. The mussels, lobster Mac and cheese, and chocolate cake were our favorites. I love dipping bread in the juices in the mussels dish. Lobster Mac and cheese had substantial chunks of lobster, not just little shreds. It was a positive and memorable meal."
5,"Where do I even begin? My mouth is watering as I reminisce on the meal I devoured last night. Not only was the service phenomenal, but the food was absolutely divine. The servers were incredibly kind, attentive, and well-mannered. This was the perfect location to celebrate my boyfriend&apos;s birthday. We arrived with empty stomachs and were grateful for the bowl of bread while looking over the menu. You must try the 100 Day Aged Steak, Salmon, Potato Gratin, Mac &amp; Cheese, and the Valrhona Chocolate Layered cake. This was possibly the best meal I&apos;ve ever eaten. Without making a scene in the restaurant, our server even put a candle in our dessert for the celebration. I wish I could eat like this everyday. Bravo Grill 23!"
5,Amazing place. Went here for the second time and had an awesome time with my family. The food was phenomenal and the service was exceptional. I recommend the espresso martini or the age ribeye.
4,"I always love to try a well reviewed local steakhouse not a chain and this was our choice. Service was great but then again we came late on a slow Thursday. We ordered 3 of the 100 day aged and one two mini filet mignon combo. Sides of homemade tater tots, spinach, and mushrooms. The sides were good but nothing that made you eat them all. As far as the aged steak it was cooked perfect but not the strong flavor you typically get with 45+ day aged steaks. This might be because they were wet aged over dry aged, but I expected a little more kick. Overall nice stop for this trip."
5,"Grill 23 &amp; Bar in Boston, MA, THE most incredible restaurant of all of Massachusetts. You 100% get what you pay for, amazing atmosphere, outstanding food and service. There is not one single item on their menu that is nothing less than amazing! For steak lovers, this IS the place to go, not all of the better steak house chains, There is only ONE Grill 23!"
4,"The 100 Day Aged Prime Ribeye is a fantastic deal! This 18oz steak only costs $59 -- not bad in comparison to other Boston steakhouses. The meat was perfectly cooked medium rare and came with arugula, caramelized onions, and pickled red onions. It was a tad salty, but definitely not a big deal. I also tried the side of Brussels sprouts, bacon, blue cheese, and walnuts. That order one wasn&apos;t worth it, however, since the sprouts weren&apos;t crispy."
3,"To be honest i came here for my 4 year anniversary and we ordered the oysters which were small but fresh and delish, steak tartar which came with chips, kind of downplayed the tartar or the fanciness of it. Couldve gone without it. (Chips were salty) Got some steak as well with peppercorn sauce. I believe they didnt even sauce it up because there was nothing on me or my bfs steak and the sauce was an additional 7$. Oh well. Food was mediocre. Service was excellent. Drinks were strong and got a complimentary vanilla ice cream to end the meal. Would not come here again."
