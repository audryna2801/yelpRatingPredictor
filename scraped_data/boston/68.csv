5,"This is a go to for my family when ever we visit my sister in Boston.  

They are currently offering indoor and outdoor seating. Social distancing and masks required.

Always have to have the clam chowder; so thick, and the dill takes it to a whole new level. Their lobster roll is my favorite in the city; perfect about of Mayo and the roll is sturdy but not dry. My brother loves the fisherman&apos;s platter since you get some of everything: whole belly clams, scallops, fish and shrimp.  And who doesn&apos;t love a steamer? Their steamer is all mussels but it&apos;s perfect; the broth is flavorful but not salty or too winey."
5,"EVERYTHING is SO GOOD! 
The chowder is too delicious and basically everything we ordered was the best. This is my first time in Boston and I really want to come back! 
Also, the service was amazing! Our waitress was so attentive and everyone followed the covid 19 guidelines. Best experience here in the East Coast!!!"
5,"The latest scoop on the Sail Loft on this beautiful morning walking by.  On the water Sail Loft things are looking up!   Owner on premises today leading the team with activity in the restaurant this morning with staff.  Deep cleaning truck was arriving for deep cleaning of floors and restaurant, kitchen getting upgrades.  Sail Loft owner are prepping for reopening  with plexiglass at seating, a new system for food delivery from kitchen to table, hand sanitizer at tables, and integrating other new standards for restaurants.   Also possible outside sidewalk seating- getting ready to open again in the new normal. 

Encouraging as I miss the clam chowder.  It is chunky with clam, not overly thick and has flavor, not all potato.   the Sail Loft a staple in the neighborhood with a nice water view not touristy.  Great lobster roll and bar service everything else coming out of their kitchen has always looked and smelled good.   Small business owned, same chef in place 35 years, they know what they are doing. They are a staple of the neighborhood.  Eat here not there. We have come a long way together. Did I mention the clam chowder."
5,"We had a list of specific needs in our party and Boston Sail Loft fit the bill.

*One person that needed to find whole belly clams... It was her birthday too so this was a must - surprisingly you can mostly only find them at the shacks along the shore, but we didn&apos;t have time for a trip to Ipswich. Call ahead, but they&apos;ve got &apos;em here.
*One person that needed to get a whole lobster before heading home - That&apos;s me! You can&apos;t go to Boston and not have a lobster... at least I can&apos;t. Plus it&apos;s so much cheaper than down south... I almost got two! Plus it came on a belicious bed of mussels which was a huge plus.
*One not so adventurous eater, but willing to eat limited seafood. He ordered the fried shrimp and cleared his plate.
*One non seafood eater - this can sometimes be difficult to accomodate with the other stipulations, but Boston Sail Loft had it covered. She had a reuben and potato skins and was more than happy.

All this, plus they took reservations which made it easy for us to plan our day.  They made the birthday gal feel extra special, offered a great bottle of ros√© to go with dinner, and have an amazing cup of chowder that spills so perfectly over the side of the mug. They hit everything on our list and so much more. Thanks for a memorable dinner on our last night in town."
5,"This has been a Boston staple for a long time. Great atmosphere. Drinks. Beers. Seafood. Burgers. Apps. The people are friendly. They show the games on TV. View of the harbor. 

It&apos;s an awesome spot."
4,"The clam chowder, view, and hospitality was the show stopper of the Boston sail. Besides that, the food was entrees were average. Their muscles appetizer was delicious too! . But with the even those it&apos;s worth the stop. I even got more clam chowder to go for some friends and family back home. 

Next time I come I&apos;d plan to get a bowl of clam chowder and then share an appetizer or two with the table"
5,"Look no further for a cheap, casual lunch in Boston. The clam chowder was thick, creamy, and oh so tasty. The big-windowed restaurant sits on what seems like a dock, so the views are gorgeous. The vibe of the restaurant is casual...no frills...come as you are. A great place to hang out for a while!"
5,"This restaurant is a special place! I was attracted by the look of the restaurant but at the end the food itself  was the most enjoyable experience.

Staff was very friendly, was visiting Boston for the first time with my friends, so obviously we needed to try some local foods! I told the hostess that I wanted to have the outdoor seats by the water, and we had to wait about 35mins......it was worth it! 

It&apos;s on Monday that we went, so I am guessing it would be quite impossible to get those tables on the weekends! Since there are only 2 tables out there and a total capacity of about 6 people.

We had the cocktail shrimp, the single lobster and the clam chowder. Service was really fast, I am especially in love with their clam chowder, so rich and flavorful!

The seafoods are all very fresh! I enjoyed every single moment while I was in there!

Also, I have to say that they have done an excellent job on the protection practices so everyone can feel safe dinning in! Kudos!"
5,Welcome back!! The best chowder and fried clams ANYWHERE!  Potato skins are ridiculous too- SO addictive. You&apos;re going to crave them after you&apos;ve had them once. Just saying.   #cheers #saveourrestaurants
4,"Totally overrated + overpriced. The servers were really accommodating and attentive. They are the only reason for the four stars. Everything else was mediocre. My first issue was the lack of prices on the drink list. House wines, cocktails, and beers had no prices listed. Looking back, I realize that was probably because of how expensive they ended up being. 
The cocktails tasted like watered down fountain drinks. Could not taste (or feel) the alcohol at all, even after two of them. What made it worse was that they were $14 each. (We ordered south shores and peachy keens). 

The fish and chips were pretty good, very fried. The lobster role looked delicious but lacked a little flavor. Definitely was expecting more. The soup was nice, thick, and creamy but definitely not a meal (I got hungry again right after we paid) 

The atmosphere was really nice, right on the water, and definitely made the trip worthwhile. 

Would possibly return, maybe."
4,"Takeout review

I order the clam chowder (cup) and a lobster roll with fries. The clam chowder looks a little different from the traditional clam chowder. It has more green, I believe its dill. It has a unique flavor to the clam chowder. I really enjoyed it. The clams were not junky but I enjoyed the small bites. The lobster roll was good. It came with fries and coleslaw. Everything was delicious. 
It has cute outdoor seating but I had my dog with me and in Boston, you cannot sit outside with your dog unless it&apos;s a service dog. There are about 5 benches right next to the restaurant if you want to do takeout and have a great view, right by the water. Or if you follow the harbor trail sign next to the restaurant you can find few benches with a great view of the water and the boats."
5,"I came here for the first time with a friend last weekend, and it is now my favorite restaurant in Boston! We were seated by the window overlooking the water while it was raining which was just spectacular. The most beautiful view. We started with a bottle of their William Hill Chardonnay and the appetizer combo platter - fried calamari, popcorn shrimp, and potato skins. The appetizer itself was amazing. Huge portions which I was not expecting. My friend ordered the single New England lobster on a bed of mussels, which I tried and it was amazing! We were not expecting his lobster to be served on such a large amount of mussels, which was great. I ordered the broiled scallops, and once again, I was not expecting there to be so many! They were cooked perfectly, and melted in my mouth. We ended up having two different servers as we were there between lunch and dinner, and both of them were perfect. Very attentive and accommodating. The owner also came and introduced himself which made the experience feel that much more intimate. He was so friendly and easy going! On top of all of this, the prices are so extremely reasonable I nearly gasped when we saw the bill because it was so much less expensive than what I was expecting! Overall, an outstanding experience, and I will be back very soon."
4,"Decided to try this place because it was recommended. My boyfriend enjoyed his steamed muscles entirely. My wrap was very flavorful as well. I regret not trying the lobster mac n cheese!! Next time we&apos;re in Boston it&apos;s a must. As for the clam chowder, I personally didn&apos;t enjoy it as much as I did at other places. Still a great place to try if you haven&apos;t!"
4,"This place has always been spot on for me. I used to come here in my college days, away from the typical touristy spots. Their version of the clam chowder is a little different. It has dill in it, but it was a tasteful change. We got a bowl of the soup and loved it. Although we should have gotten the cup since the entrees were huge. 

My boyfriend got the scallops which came with mashed potatoes and zuccini. He said it was delicious and it came with a lot of scallops. I got the Seafood Portofino Pasta which came with plenty of lobster, scallops, and 2 big, fat shrimp.

We also got a bottle of wine which was reasonably priced at 33 bucks. Very friendly servers and you can also get a nice view of the water depending on where you are seated."
5,"Quaint restaurant/bar on the water. It&apos;s fairly small but they can pack a lot of people in there. Tables are pretty close to each other but that&apos;s expected to allow for more guests. The bar area was packed- all seats taken and several people standing. Despite the crowd, we were seated and served very quickly. 

We started with a few of the jumbo shrimp (market price $3.50/ea) and a cup of the clam chowder- since it won Best of Boston in 2018 &amp; 2019. We ended up not eating anymore after this because the chowder was so filling! It&apos;s deceptive- looks like a small portion but it&apos;s so thick and packed it fills you up fast. I agree with the rating, it&apos;s one of the best clam chowders I&apos;ve had! If you&apos;re stopping by here you should definitely give it a try. 

We had one cocktail, an old fashioned, it was adequate but nothing to write home about. The view on the water was beautiful. I imagine it&apos;d be a wonderful little spot in the summer to check out as well."
5,"The best clam chowder! &amp; the linguini pasta awesome. The combination of flavors, shrimp scallops artichokes capers with white wine sauce extraordinary. Good attention and price"
4,"Truly the best New England clam chowder in Boston! 

You get the real dockyard experience here. From the views of the pier to the old photos on the walls showing some of the piers history. They get quite busy here but the food service is superb and they really get your food out quick.

I ordered the best fish and chips along with the clam chowder while my wife ordered the lobster and seafood pasta. The fish was super tender and  it overly greasy. The &quot;chips&quot; were the perfect mix of potato and crunch. The lobster tender and the sauce delicious. 

Great place to get a view and dinner."
4,"Super friendly bar with a lovely little view to the water. Stopped in just for a quick cocktail and the bartender was super friendly. She made a great little Kahlua and coffee. Plus she didn&apos;t flinch when I let her know I didn&apos;t want canned whipped cream...but then when she brought it I asked for regular cream that came in one of those little plastic containers. 

So when you look at my photo it isn&apos;t the most glam shot of a Kahlua and coffee one could have...but the window beyond is part of the allure. Next time I want to try their clam chowder. But I think I always want to sit at the bar and let the breeze wash over me and my cocktail."
5,"Boston Sail Loft is a nice and fresh seafood spot on Boston Harbor. It&apos;s amazing the places that just exist and you don&apos;t even realize.

They have nice fresh Dry Sea Scallops. Cooked to perfection whether their fried or broiled. (Which are sold at daily Market Value) They do all your classic seafood choices. Clam Strips, whole bellies, shrimp, calamari. They&apos;ve got it all.

I got their Platter. Came with Fries, Fried Whole Bellies, Cod, Calamari, Shrimp and Scallops. Everything was cooked perfectly. (Would of liked more Whole Bellies next time, not enough).

Sampled their clam chowder. It&apos;s really good. Not the best I&apos;ve had but it&apos;s up there. It&apos;s NE Clam, but with an ingredient I&apos;ve never had in it. It&apos;s really tasty.

The service was good and it made for a great Saturday Lunch/Dinner."
5,"After a failed attempt elsewhere, we chose this place since we were nearby and it ended up being a great choice. Our server brought out bread when greeting us and got our drinks out to us quickly after. Packed night, but service was great, very nice, and attentive with refilling our waters and wine. The clam chowder was the best we&apos;ve had so far and only place that has added dill - great flavor and chunky with lots of potatoes and fresh clam. The lobster salad roll was good and the lobster Mac and cheese was okay. The lobster chunks were huge and delicious, but the mac could have had more flavor. However I&apos;m glad it wasn&apos;t salty. This restaurant is right by the water and had a good amount of seating and a bar. If you use the bathroom, use the larger stall if possible since the smaller one will have you pressed against the door."
