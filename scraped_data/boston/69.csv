5,Food was delicious and I had enough to eat for two meals after!! Staff is friendly and I felt very safe with covid practices in place.
5,"How does this place not have 5 stars?  It&apos;s pandemic time, 2020, most restaurants are doing takeout and this might be my only chance to try this place finally as I&apos;m not s fan of editing in long lines for hours.  So my birthday came and I said let&apos;s try it out. Btw...I&apos;m big, fat and ready to eat.  

Wow is all I can say. I had calamari which was perfectly crisp, even out of the togo container. It was a huge portion, enough to share with four people.

Ok next I had the chicken stuffed with italian coldcuts over pasta. Make sure you ask for homemade pasta. Amazing. You can split it between 2-3 people, easily.

I had a bite of the Bolognese. Yup, get it!!!
I went again, got chicken cutlet and eggplant. Yes please! Again, huge portions and the sauce is delicious.

 Went again and got the lobster ravioli. Ok, I was a little worried that they&apos;d be small. Worry not my friends, these are the biggest ravioli you will ever have abd I guarantee,the best. These aren&apos;t those trashy red stripe, machine made &quot;lobster&quot; ravioli. No, these are big, overstuffed, homemade with lots of ricotta and lobster ravioli. 8 of them to be exact....EIGHT.  they&apos;re huge so you might eat just 2 or 4. The sauce....as if stuffing the ravioli with lobster wasn&apos;t enough, the tomato cream sauce is loaded with lobster too! Yeah, my photo looks gross but what can I say, these are the leftover. 

In summary, if you are thinking that the portions might be smaller think again. Look at how I described myself above and even I thi k they&apos;re huge, enough to share or for leftovers."
5,This place is soooooo good!! Italian food just like in the North End. The lobster ravioli is the best we&apos;ve had in Boston (and we have had a lot of different places&apos; lobster ravioli!). Generally a line to get in so plan accordingly...or get take out! YUM!!!!
3,"I&apos;ll get crucified here but it was just ok. We got 4 entrees. Chicken Parm with the homemade spaghetti, Veal Parm with homemade rigatoni, homemade cheese raviolis and Eggplant Parm with penne.

First, I will say if portion size is your thing, then this is your place. No exaggerated each meal is big enough for two and the eggplant is 100% enough for 3. I am not joking. That said no sharing for eat in, which I agree with. It&apos;s a small place and if you are going out to eat, y&apos;all need to get ur own meal. 

As for price, it&apos;s a good deal for quantity, again if that&apos;s ur thing. I do feel like the $7 up charge for one of the homemade pasta options is steep....but it&apos;s not a small side, so again quantity.

No for the taste test. Everything was just ok. And yes, I tried it all. We got 4 meals and all had a bit of each. I can&apos;t even really pick a favorite because I didn&apos;t want more of anything. Veal was probably the best. I actually didn&apos;t like the eggplant, it was too heavy and watery. The chicken parm had an odd taste. The homemade ravs were lacking something in flavor in the stuffing. Now, as for the homemade pasta I actually didn&apos;t like. I found them very gummy. And lacking salt. Almost as of the water wasn&apos;t salted. I found the sauce, while lacking on the pasta (definitely not enough) was a bit bland, I feel like it was just crushed tomatoes with basil....a lot of basil, you will know cause it&apos;s everywhere in the sauce. Lastly, and it&apos;s not a huge deal, the bread was a basic afterthought. That said it really didn&apos;t matter cause there really wasn&apos;t and sauce to dip it in (other than the ravioli container). And speaking of containers their Togo containers are outdated. They use the circular foil pans with the kinda cardboard top u place ontop and then crimp the sides down on. Two of the meals collapsed under the pressure of the container above and then leaked in the bag. 

Overall it was just food. Not awful. Not great. But not something I am planning on going back to. Other low/mid price Italian joints do it better."
3,"Had dinner with my friend tonight at rino&apos;s. She arrived first and despite only one table being sat, she was asked to wait outside. Perhaps a covid guideline but it wasn&apos;t the warmest welcome or start to our night. Additionally, when I arrived, they asked her to sign in and leave her number before we were directed to our table. The sign in sheet looked like it was their waitlist, so it&apos;s weird that they asked her to sign when we&apos;d be seated right away. 

Despite that we sat down and ordered. We ordered a calamari appetizer, a chicken parm with linguine and the chicken broccoli Alfredo w/ homemade ziti (available on the specials list). The price point seems high at first but the portions are huge so I would say the price point is probably fair. The calamari came out first, crispy and fresh, but a little on the saltier side. We asked for a side of marinara sauce which they brought out quickly and also a huge bowl full, which I appreciated even though we couldn&apos;t make a dent in it. I thought the batter could have been lighter and think that other places may have better calamari, but it was a decent appetizer and was a huge portion. They definitely did not skimp out on the chicken with the chicken parm; however I thought that the dish lacked some flavor overall. It was just okay for me. The chicken broccoli Alfredo was delicious. The homemade noodles were cooked well and the sauce was very flavorful. I would say it is better than other Italian restaurants that I have visited for chicken broccoli Alfredo. 

Was surprised there were no salads or desserts available on the menu but again, there was SO much food that it didn&apos;t really make a difference, just something I noted. Despite the weird start to the meal, the staff was super attentive and kind after we had sat down. We felt very taken care of. Overall I&apos;m not sure if I would come back to this restaurant. Parking is difficult I&apos;m this area as well."
3,"I got the Pollo Carrozella with fresh fusilli pasta.  I&apos;ll tell you the fresh pasta was great and tasted authentic. When it came to sauce (lemon butter sage) I found it to be too citrusy without enough flavor to balance it all. Chicken was bland and definitely needed more seasoning. So it was okay but definitely not my favorite. I&apos;d come back and get the fresh pasta with another sauce! Perhaps the chicken parm as my friend had that and it did taste great. The bruschetta is as great and I don&apos;t even like tomatoes! 

You have to buy wine by the bottle here! $33 per bottle. The Essence Riesling was great."
1,"I took my mother there for dinner. They don&apos;t take reservations so we got there around 7:30
And put our name on the list. The waitress that took our reservation was a stocky one with long black hair in a ponytail. There weren&apos;t any other party&apos;s ahead of us. My mother and I watched that same waitress seat two tables, 7 overweight men ahead of us, while my mother and I waited outside in the cold. I was beyond upset. I wouldn&apos;t have cared if I was there with a friend or my boyfriend but I was there with my mother.  I will not step foot here again."
5,"The restaurant is very small and the food is delicious so a wait is inevitable, unless you happen to get lucky like I did. I ordered a half sized appetizer - stuffed eggplant and a half order of the lobster ravioli. I honestly have no idea how I would have finished a full size of these dishes. I saw other people&apos;s pasta dishes and I swear they got served a bucket of pasta. If I lived in Boston I&apos;d order the full sized dishes and then feed myself for at least two more meals. If you&apos;re visiting you may just want to ask for half size. 

I&apos;d like to add that the service was great too. I was in a huge rush (realllllllly pushing the limit on getting to the airport on time) and they accommodated me accordingly. I&apos;d definitely come back."
5,"One of my favorite places in Boston.  Rino&apos;s is also one of the rare places where they really get Italian American food right, using excellent fresh tomatoes.   Price point may appear high but I always feel it&apos;s fair - the lobster ravioli is loaded with tons of lobster and portions are generous so it&apos;s easy to share family style to sample more dishes.   Staff is incredibly kind, particularly given how popular it is."
5,"Finally tried the famous Rino&apos;s after hearing about it for years and listening to my friend describe the massive portions.

On his suggestion, we ordered a dish that he couldn&apos;t remember the name of and I can&apos;t remember the name of. It was basically a fettucine dish with cream sauce, chicken, asparagus, sun dried tomatoes (which my friend raved about), and mushrooms. True to his proclamation, the plate was huge and it was good that we split it because we still had plenty to take home with us. 

The garden salad and bread were so so. Admittedly, I would have expected better for the bread but you don&apos;t come here (or wait) for the bread. By the way, we were told it would probably be a ten minute wait on Friday night around 8 pm so we stopped by Kelly&apos;s pub for a drink. While we were eating, we saw others waiting for probably an hour. That said, apparently, you can make a reservation ahead of time. 

We also shared an appetizer beforehand. I think it was the caprese which we probably should have finished before leaving. 

The tiramisu dessert was wonderful. As my friend described it, it was light, which is perfect for a heavy, rich dinner. We easily finished that and being a dessert lover, I wish it was as large as dinner."
5,I&apos;m super confused why this place only has 4 stars. It&apos;s the best lobster ravioli I&apos;ve ever had. It&apos;s so good so fresh so meaty so wonderful. It opens at 3 and immediately has a line. It&apos;s a bit pricey in general but worth it for the quality and amount you get. I would have this everyday if my waistband allowed me.
3,"I have loved Rino&apos;s for years but not today. 

I ordered Chicken, Broccoli and Fettuccine a fav of mine there , but today I needed extra Parmesan to make it taste better. And when I asked for coffee the waitress said &quot; We have no coffee, no tea and no dessert!&quot; &quot; Just delicious Italian food&quot;. How disappointing - a nice meal but choice of coke,pepsi or sprite???  And Bruschetta was mediocre. 

Just a disappointing trip overall."
4,"Very good home made pasta at lunch time here with plenty of leftovers.
The ambience was cute but get here off peak otherwise parking will be tough.
A lot of unique choices even for lunchtime and all were really well prepared."
5,"Didn&apos;t expect it but, Rino&apos;s Place was definitely fantastic. The price was super reasonable - I couldn&apos;t believe it! The food was excellent, Gnocchi was delightful. I became very good friends with the staff, who are all outstanding and super courteous. Highly recommend giving this place a shot!"
3,"So sad... we waited 50 min last night and then bailed to another restaurant.  We were cold and hungry!  Twenty minutes after we left the line, we got the call, already seated and ordered drinks at our back up.  We will be back, but maybe when it&apos;s warmer... hard pass on waiting in the cold for so long."
5,Authentic Italian food and a hidden hem of Eastie. Portions are amazingly huge and can be shared or good for leftovers. There&apos;s always a line for dining in but they do takeout as well! All pasta is handmade. I recommend the fried mozzarella ball app and chicken parm! I don&apos;t eat seafood but my friend always gets the lobster ravioli and swears it&apos;s the absolute best
5,"Stopped in for ddinner last night and there was NNO WAIY which is very rare for Rino&apos;s!!  By rare i mean that only happens in a blue moon.  Apparently it was a
Blue moon last night.  Theree was two of us and we walked right in!  The restaurant itself is cozy beyond cozy.  ThE staff is super knowledgeable and nice and the foood... ohhhhh my the food!  Mouth watering, cooked to perfection, perfection!"
5,"Another FIVE STARS! Had the same...calamari app, shrimp scampi and gnocchi with broccoli rabi and shrimp. Soooooo good."
5,Amazing food. Amazing service. Portions so big you could literally eat for a week. All the buzz is correct. I haven&apos;t found a single Italian place this amazing and I was shocked it was in East Boston vs the north end! RUN THERE NOW!
4,"Saw this place on diners drive ins and dives and MAN I am happy that I came! Started off with shrimp scampi that came with a side of garlic bread meant to soak up the delicious sauce it was In- complete nirvana. Also had the fried calamari topped with banana peppers-- what a surprisingly tasty combo and crispy! By the time we got to our entrees we were stuffed. Lobster ravioli is THE REASON why you need to come here. Now any time I have lobster ravioli I am going to compare it to Rino&apos;s. Oversized and stuffed to the max with huge pieces of lobster. Sauce was incredibly tasty too! Also got the gnocchi- the gmocchi were fresh however the sauce it was in left little to be desired. Skip this and just get the lobster ravioli. Also wished they would of had a dessert menu but didn&apos;t have anything. Get here early! 5-6PM is perfect, as there was a line waiting to get in when we left. All in all, an excellent choice for dinner and I&apos;d highly recommend- we&apos;ll be back next time we visit Boston!"
