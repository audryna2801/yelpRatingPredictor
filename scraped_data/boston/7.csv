5,"Ordered takeout as our first meal in Boston, and this place hit the spot!

We called ahead and they sounded super busy in the background. Our order was ready within 30 minutes, and we drove by to pick it up. Be warned, parking is tough in this area, especially on the weekend. If you&apos;re visiting and have a car, it&apos;s best to go with someone so they can hop out quick and pick up, while you circle the block.

Pumpkin tortellini - delicious. Not sure if it&apos;s seasonal, but it was excellent! 

lobster ravioli - I just wish there were more in an order. SO SO SO good. I may have drank the sauce at the bottom of the container.

Eggplant Rollo - these were the perfect app to share. Breaded eggplant, in a delicious homemade sauce.


This place is cash only, so -plan accordingly."
5,"This place has outdoor seating and there wasn&apos;t much of a wait at all (went on a Friday around 4:30pm). It&apos;s **cash only**, though. There&apos;s an ATM nearby so I wouldn&apos;t let that discourage you from dining here. 

The food was wonderful and the wait staff was quick and efficient. Our waiter was very busy since she was tending to multiple tables at once, but had such a pleasant attitude. We constantly had our drinks refilled and were well taken care of by the staff. The entrees came out pretty quickly, I&apos;d say we waited about 10-15 minutes after we ordered. 

We ordered the Shrimp Linguine with the Fracomo sauce (a combo of their Giacomo and Fra Diavolo sauces) and the Butternut Squash Ravioli. The ravioli had a great texture. It wasn&apos;t squishy and didn&apos;t taste like it came from a frozen bag. It tasted like fresh pasta that was just hand rolled an hour before. The flavors were excellent. We have no complaints and will definitely be back! 

Pro Tip: Ask for extra bread and dip it in the leftover sauce from your meal. Buon Appetito!"
5,"I love Giacomo&apos;s and I am willing to wait few hours to have some!  One upside of COVID is that Giacomo&apos;s now has way more tables due to outdoor dining. Therefore, the lines move way faster and they can accommodate more people. 

I have gotten several dishes from Giacomo&apos;s and I love how their dishes are simple and complex at the same time. 

- Caprese Salad ($12): a classic appetizer/salad that has the most fresh ingredients. The balsamic isn&apos;t too sweet or too tangy, the tomatoes are juicy and meaty, and the basil has so much aroma.
- Frutti Di Mare ($24): this is a must get dish here! You need to have it at least once as it is the most affordable frutti di mate in the Boston area. If it is your first time, I would suggest getting the Giacomo&apos;s sauce but my favorite is the fracomo, which has a teeeent bit of heat. The seafood is so well cooked and fresh, the linguini is also the perfect texture, and the sauce is so flavorful. 
- Shrimp and Scallops with Linguini ($19): it is so easy to overcook shrimp and scallops but Giacomo&apos;s do an amazing job! This is my go to dish if I&apos;m not feeling the whole Frutti Di Mare. 
- Lobster Ravioli ($19): the lobster ravioli is pretty good but not the best dish that they have. The ravioli is pretty meaty and has a good lobster flavor. The sauce is creamy without being too thick."
5,"Ambiance perfect. Food incredible. Service phenomenal. Can&apos;t wait to go back to this North End staple. 

Can&apos;t remember our servers name, but thanks, you&apos;ve earned a few repeat customers!"
2,"Decided to have dinner at Giacomos  last night. 
First of all, I ordered a bottle of Jordan Cab and the brought us these tiny wine glasses
Second, the bread that they brought us was cold, had to send it back.
The Sword fish was very tough, obviously they use  loins instead of center cut which is much cheaper 
Abs third, they only accept cash 
Guess what, not going back, after spending $210 ( not including gratuity ) I felt like I didn&apos;t get enough got my money"
5,"I&apos;m from New York and wanted to try a nice Italian place. I read many reviews on Giacomo&apos;s and was dying to try it. The reviews mentioned having to wait a long time for a table and that they do not take reservations. However that was not the case. 

Maybe it was because I arrived on a weekday - Thursday at 7pm, and we were seated immediately. I overheard the host ask a party of 6 if they have a reservation so I am assuming they do take reservations. The place is quite small and the tables are very close to each other. This is a great place for comfort food, but I wouldn&apos;t recommend this for a first date or getting to know someone here since the other tables can easily hear your conversation. 

The waiters and waitresses are very nice and accommodating. They gave us recommendations and suggestions. The portions here are also very big for the price. Compared to other places in the neighborhood, you get a bang for your buck here. I ordered a small fried calamari ($9) as an appetizer and the portion was bigger than the calamari I ordered at another restaurant for $16 which is nearly double the price! 

For those saying the linguine was bland, they do offer 5-6 choices of sauce for your pasta. I got the most popular sauce which i forgot the name of but you can easily ask the waiters what that is. And if none of the sauces sound appealing to you, maybe try the lobster ravioli which comes with delicious creamy goodness topped with cheese. 

This place is cash only which is not a problem considering that the seafood is at a reasonable price. If I lived in Boston, this would be my go to dinner spot!Keep up the great work Giacomo&apos;s!"
3,Good not great. Meatballs were subpar didn&apos;t make me want to jump off of anything. Texture was similar to a..........you know what I&apos;m talking about..........a wet sponge. Pasta was fine nothing To call home about.
2,"Honestly the pasta wasn&apos;t really that great here and we felt a bit rushed to be seated. Compared to the food you can get in NYC, this restaurant just doesn&apos;t really compare.

We got the big pasta dish with the giacomo sauce which is the red sauce with some cream. It was super bland and boring, tasting like a watered down version of the normal stuff. The pasta itself was cooked poorly and was soft and soggy instead of properly made al dente.

The place is crowded though, which is surprising given how mediocre the food was. It&apos;s also cash only so be sure to grab some before visiting."
2,"My friends and I did a road trip to Boston for Halloween weekend and ate at Giacomo&apos;s for our first dinner. I was really looking forward to the meal based on Yelp reviews and social media posts... but honestly, I found Giacomo&apos;s incredibly underwhelming.

First off, we ended up being seated in the upstairs area where the vibes were all off -- Billboard 100 playing way too loudly, densely packed tables despite COVID, etc... Our waitress also did not add to the experience: mispronouncing the restaurant name over and over again, and continually mixing our plates with other tables. Honestly, I could look past all of this if the food was good, but it was not. All of our pastas were past al dente, and the flavors were nothing special.

If you&apos;re looking for authentic, quality Italian food -- don&apos;t waste your stomach space or $ here."
4,"Two tips: go early (no reservations) and take cash (cash only). Is it worth it? Yes! I&apos;d highly recommend Giacomo&apos;s for a date night dinner in the North End.

FOOD
Really, really great. We ordered the following and were very happy with it:
* Frutti di Mare - we enjoyed this more!
* Lobster ravioli

DRANK
There was a good and affordable selection of wines.
We got the:
* Corte Pitora (Pinot Grigio)

VIBE
It&apos;s very cozy but definitely on the cramped side, so it&apos;s not 100% the most comfortable place to have an intimate conversation or stay for too long.

SERVICE
Quick and aggressive, Italian family restaurant-style.

MONEY THO
Totally reasonable for what you get - just remember to take cash (or walk to a nearby ATM)! 

*PHOTOS TAKEN PRE-COVID"
5,"Our trip to Boston was last minute so we were looking for a highly rated Italian restaurant that took walk ups. To start, the food was incredible. We got the burrata for an appetizer and split a Frutti di mare. Both were delicious and I liked that they let us choose the sauce for the frutti di mare. I like spicy pasta and have had many frutti di mares with a bland sauce. This one was spicy and full of seafood. I couldn&apos;t have been happier!

The weird thing about this place is that they won&apos;t take your name or number down so you literally have to stand in line until a table opens up. We got there at 8:15pm on a Saturday and waited in line for an hour and 15 minutes. Everyone who got behind us ended up leaving. By the time we got to the front of the line (about 9pm) a couple walked up behind us and we both got seated at the same time because two tables opened up. So they waited 15 minutes and we waited an hour and 15 min. Lol I guess it&apos;s all about your timing!"
4,"This place doesn&apos;t take reservations and also makes you wait in line to be seated. Surprisingly old fashioned and not with the times especially during COVID. 

We sat outside with heat lamps which was nice. The calamari came first and it was done well. Just the right amount of batter and chewiness. 

The lobster ravioli was good as you can taste the lobster chunks and the white cream sauce was delicious. 

Tried my friends butternut squash ravioli which was unique and I&apos;ve never really had that flavor in Italian before. 

Frutti di mare was a solid dish. Plenty of clams, mussels, and scallops. Can&apos;t go wrong with it."
4,"If you live in Boston, you are definitely going to know this place already :) I love this restaurant in Little Italy because it&apos;s a solid Italian place and majority of their food are pretty affordable. I also love their small and intimate setting! Their appetizers slapped so hard. It was definitely one of the best I&apos;ve ever had and I am willing to come back here just for their appetizers! They have 6 choices of sauce for linguine and I chose the lobster-based red sauce which I highly recommend! Honestly, their sauces were all flavorful in general haha Also, they decorated their window with red hearts and cupid for Valentine&apos;s Day theme, which I thought was so cute. FYI, they are cash-only but they do have an ATM machine inside their store, so don&apos;t worry!"
5,"I can tell that a restaurant is really good when they don&apos;t need to open during lunch &amp; strictly serve during dinner hours. Giacomo&apos;s exceeded my expectations and will be a place that I&apos;d gladly fly back to Boston for in the future. We started off with the complimentary bread along with a large order of calamari. I honestly could&apos;ve stuffed myself with the bread and called it a day because it was that good and the calamari was perfectly cooked. I couldn&apos;t leave Boston without getting the Lobster Ravioli and nearly had a mouthgasm once I had it. We enjoyed our meal so much that we ordered the butternut squash ravioli to go too.

The service was quick and straightforward, can&apos;t really ask for more considering that they&apos;re super busy. I recommend getting there a little before 4:00pm to beat the crowd. We were lucky enough to get seated when we got there at around 4:10pm. Also bring cash!!!"
4,"Not bad. My husband loves eggplant parm so we picked one up here as well as their tortellini. We got it to go and got it right before closing time.

One note: it is cash only. Bring cash or you can use the ATM across the street. They also have an ATM in the restaurant but it was not working when I tried. To be honest it is a bit annoying having to bring cash... That and the food was good but not great are the reason why I haven&apos;t been back."
1,"Really disappointed with this place. Service was fine, but the food was incredibly disappointing. With this many 5 star reviews, I expected incredible Italian food. Instead we got mushy bland pasta. 

We started with the meatballs and burrata. It was nothing special, the meatballs weren&apos;t tender and the sauce tasted straight from the can.

We ordered the seafood pasta, gnocchi, pancetta and pea pasta, and tomato pasta. All of the pasta was way over cooked and overall didn&apos;t taste great. For the amount they were charging, it is not worth it at all."
5,"Solid Italian place! Love the tiramisu. Be careful this place has long line almost all the time. We were lucky to get here just before the long line. All the food was very good. But what was most memorable was the tiramisu at the end of the dinner. Wish I could have it again!

Maybe because we were tourists, we were startled by how &apos;rude&apos; (for lack of better word) the service is. It&apos;s Italian place so I expected nice and friendly service but it&apos;s like a Chinese place. Just dump the menu on the table and took order very fast. Rude not in a bad way. I actually like rude places, they&apos;re efficient at getting the job done. So maybe rude isn&apos;t the right word. Tell me what it is if you know!"
4,"This place is cash only but go to get ATM! It&apos;s so good and fresh! And Priced reasonably! Also go inside you can see how fresh the food is, you can see the kitchen and the crab legs! Also the crew is on point clearing plates and tables fast."
1,I wrote a review months back on my racist experience at this restaurant and wanted to give you all a follow up. I called the restaurant multiple times. I&apos;m assuming they knew why and I gave them a little hint demanding to speak to their manager. Each time my phone calls were ignored and never returned. It&apos;s been months and no one cares. Disappointing and I will never return to this place or give it as a recommendation again.
4,Beautiful restaurant. Lovely staff. Delicious food. I had been wanting to try this place and am so glad I did.
