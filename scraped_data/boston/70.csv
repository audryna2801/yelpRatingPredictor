5,"I love this place. I, myself, never went in physically, but had it delivered, but the Lobstah Mac N Cheese.... OMGG!!!! that stuff is bombbb. The Lobstah Mac N Cheese has lobster claws up in there, whaaaaaat, along with the other pieces of lobster, it was sooo good. NOW, about that lobstah roll, it was loaded, it was the 6oz lobstah roll i ordered, it was packed with lobster and it was so good and that roll that it&apos;s on makes it even better, it had so much in there i borrowed some of that lobster to put it in my Lobstah Mac, it was THE BEST!!. I HIGHLY recommend this place. This pandemic needs to end someway some how cause i want to enjoy this food din"
5,"My lobstah roll was heavenly! And you couldn&apos;t tell me that the lobstah mac n cheese didn&apos;t come straight from the Lord&apos;s dinner table  trust me when I say the food is heavenly! 

Plus the owners is super nice! Came here close to closing time while out adventuring with a friend and not only did they accommodate us, they also allowed us to sit outside and made sure we had everything we needed to enjoy the food! He even came outside and conversed with us while we ate! Can&apos;t wait to my next trip back to Boston"
3,"Lobster roll was good, I&apos;ve had better and worse.  The biggest item was the staff. I understand they a busy, but the 10 to 20 second to talk to a customer makes a world of difference.  We will be back, and look forward to it."
3,"I had high expectations for this place based on the reviews. I love lobster and have had countless lobster rolls. This was disappointing.

I ordered the Standahd- 6 oz of meat. The lobster meat is cold (Maine style), and it was more fresh than the lobster from some other places, but not super fresh. There were a few small pieces of shell in the meat- not a super big deal. The roll was way too much- too much bread and not that good. (It&apos;s not a traditional hot dog bun.)

Overall, if you&apos;re a lobster aficionado, I wouldn&apos;t recommend. If you&apos;re a tourist and looking for a quick bite, it&apos;s a good option."
5,"In town for a shoot and decided to order with them on Uber Eats. 

You always expect a hit or miss expect slowly when you are ordering high end Seafood and I have to say this restaurant has not disappointed and I have already ordered from them twice.

I ordered the 6 1/2 ounce lobster roll with warm drawn butter and I have to say it is the first time I have ever ordered a lobster roll and was absolutely stuffed by the time I got finished: I do think that it is a bit pricey at almost $27 however it is absolutely packed with large chunks of lobster meat the bread was soft warm and toasted challah bread with a slightly sweet taste which is wonderful with the savory lobster. 

I also ordered the clam chowder which I have to say was extra thick creamy load it with clams a little too much potatoes for my personal liking however excellent as a meal all by it&apos;s self. 

I also had an order of the Lobster Mac n Cheese. Being from the south I would have to say I was slightly disappointed in this I&apos;m not sure what kind of cheese is used on this but it seems like more of a cheese sauce and was certainly lacking any seasoning however it did have large lumps of lobster meat. So on a scale of 1 to 5.. 5 being excellent I would give it a 3. 

Overall, clearly I thought this was a great establishment I have now ordered from them twice and I have only been in town three times and I have also recommended them to some of my crew members."
4,"Over a couple of visits I had the opportunity to try several items off the menu of Lobstah on a Roll.

This shop is located on a corner in the South End.  You order at the counter and have a dine in option at the counter by the window, but when the weather is nice, there are also a few tables set outside off the sidewalk.

The chalkboard lists their menu, but for the market price of their lobster you can find that on the menu placed on the counter.

The staff is friendly, and for the undecided, samples of their soups are available.  A bathroom is available up the stairs.

The clam chowder (New England style of course!) $6/$8 is made fresh daily  It tasted great!  That is, with the exception of the large dice firm celery, since I personally do not prefer the taste of these green fibrous stalks.  Their lobster bisque $8/$12, served with a few teaspoons of meat scooped first into the bowl, however, may be one of the best I&apos;ve had the pleasure of tasting.  I enjoyed the flavor and the rich creaminess.  Just be careful as there might be chips of shell clinging to the lobster meat.

Crab Cakes come two to an order for $16 with little filler but made of well shredded meat.  I prefer lumps in mine and found these a little salty on their own.

New England Tacos $16 (3 soft tacos stuffed with lettuce, lobster, cilantro mayo and a roasted corn and mango salsa) were a bit messy wet to consume, but sufficed for a meal.  The salsa was refreshing, but the meat a bit light a portion of fresh delicate lobster.

There&apos;s the option of adding lobster meat to your dish at 3 oz portions, market price.  Their cold was tasty and delicate.  The hot was well flavored, but the additional cooking firmed up the meat somewhat.  My mom preferred the cold due to the consistency, but I enjoyed the flavor of both.

During an October visit, their market prices were:

Bostonian 4 oz $19.99
Standahd 6 oz $26.95
Two if by Sea 12 oz $49.99
Big Papi (4 rolls 6 oz ea) $99.99"
5,"First and foremost, I love the people that work at this place. I&apos;m definitely a tourist, and so the cashier showed me all the places to go in Boston and recommended me all the places to eat in Boston. I&apos;ve never had someone take time out of their day to give me such a start to finish great customer service. I honestly would just go back to talk with that lady because she was so sweet and so nice. I would definitely asked to see their list of Boston places to go to if you&apos;re a tourist!

Now onto the food, oh my God. Do you see the amount of meat you get! They are definitely not skipping out and it would be a travesty if you did not go to this place. I think I am a person that loves more mom and pop shops rather than commercialized places. Therefore I believe that you should definitely put this place on your list if you&apos;re coming to visit. I ordered the Bostonian but I can imagine that everything else on their menu is just as great!"
2,"Bought over $200 worth of lunch menu food here (which, as it turns out, is not much food when their lobster rolls are $30 per person (the two person sandwich was $60! and not all that big). The menu felt a bit deceiving: many of the items on the menu were overtly advertised; there were a few that were not. We should have asked about prices, but we wrongly assumed they&apos;d be similarly priced to the other items. 

The rolls themselves were kind of awful. The lobster was mixed with a bland mayo and the lobster was gummy. Hot dog buns for bread. Small kid sandwich is $28. 

Lobster tacos (you get two) are $16 and really tiny. Not much lobster on them at all. 

Chowder was fine. 

Even for the Bay Area pricing we are used to, these prices for a take out casual spot was just shocking."
5,Fantastic neighborhood spot for fresh seafood and great sandwiches too. You just can&apos;t go wrong with their standard lobster roll...6 oz. of FRESH lobster meat which is about the equivalent of (3g 1 lb. lobsters in each lobster roll. It&apos;s well worth the price and probably the best lobster roll in Boston. The staff is super friendly and helpful and they just recently started selling fresh seafood there too.  My only complaint is that their chowder is not always consistent but this tells me that it is homemade and that can lend itself to a little interpretation by the chef/cook who is making it that week. But the chowder is delicious too. Highly recommend this place!
3,"I would rate this a 3.5. I started off with a chowda. Full of clams and heavy handed on the butter. I like my chowda&apos;s to be on the thicker side but this was too thick for me. I had to add some black pepper to give it some flavor.

I got the &quot;standad&quot; which was overflowing with lobster meat, from tail to claw. Unfortunately I ordered a butter style and got a cold lightly dressed lobster roll. It came on a nice 6 inch roll but if it was toasted in butter, it would&apos;ve been a home run.

Parking is difficult since it&apos;s in the south end. This location is not good for big groups, at most 4 people. They have small patio tables on the sidewalk and high top bar chairs by the windows."
5,"Fantastic food! I wanted to try an authentic lobster roll with some clam chowder and this place did not disappoint! Service was super friendly and helpful at the counter when I felt confused by the menu. 

The place is small so there is only about 3 tables inside, so I think it&apos;s more for take-out orders. I ordered the &quot;Standahd&quot; ($30, worth it) lobster roll with a bowl of &quot;Chowdah&quot; ($8) as it&apos;s written on the menu, and there were both amazing. They did NOT skimp one the lobster (see pic) since it was literally overflowing and falling out of the bread.

I am coming back to this place every single time I need a lobster roll now!!"
3,"Not bad at all Lobstah on A Roll. I definitely got a good dose of lobster meat busting out of my roll and no filler. I like that, little mayo on the lobster, stuffed in a toasted hot dog bun. Simple and done, which is fantastic. To date one of the best lobster rolls I&apos;ve had. So I&apos;m definitely satisfied with that. As well as the thick chowder that had  my spoon standing up on its on was very good. It literally had bricks of potato in it. Seriously, the chowder itself is it&apos;s own meal, for me at least. Definitely a place to try out for your quintessential summertime food.

However, looking at the yelp pictures, I feel like I was given the Bostonian because that was the one on a hot dog bun. How come my Standard lobster roll wasn&apos;t on a challah roll, no lettuce and pickle, it&apos;s inconsistent. Lobstah on A Roll, did you screw up my order????"
5,"Excellent!    Not the best I&apos;ve ever had, but pretty spectacular. I&apos;d say it was definitely in my top 3. 
I got the Standard Roll. 
 
The lobster was fresh and delicious.  Bread was perfection.  
I also sampled the Lobster Bisque. It was amazing.  If I could have eaten more, I would have ordered some of that too. 

Excellent staff.  Very friendly."
5,"As a tourist, I felt that I could not leave Boston without having a famous lobster roll. I went to Lobstah on a Roll at an off time (about 3PM on a weekday, and had a great experience! I tried the Bostonian, and it was served quickly on a warm, toasted roll with chilled lobster inside. The cashier asked if I was from the area, and when I told her I was visiting, she was nice enough to recommend different sightseeing and activities. She even gave me advice about neighborhoods in the area and was nice enough to chat with me while I ate. The food was great, but the hospitality was outstanding and really set this place apart! I would recommend it to anyone in the area."
1,"The 2 lobstah rolls and chowder bowls were outstanding, however we almost didn&apos;t eat them. We walked over to pick up lunch, that we ordered ahead, only to find the chef/cook wearing his mask below his chin and no gloves. When I asked him to please put his mask on he only placed it under his nose. That offers us NO protection, so I asked him to specifically put his mask over his nose. Really? During such Covid times, a restaurant worker needs to be asked/told to wear a mask properly so as not to endanger customers? We felt totally unsafe!"
5,"My first time in downtown Boston. There&apos;s big talk about canolis and Italian food. I&apos;m from Jersey,,, and im not about that life right now. So i whip out my super powerful Samsung Galaxy S9 with the retina scan. YEARS AHEAD of the competition. I run the super awesome YELP app and go through my options for a proper bostonian lunch lunch.

I see this spot with a 4 star rating. Only just a shy of a mile from my hotel. I suit up and get to stepping.

This spot is tiny,, only 4 little tables inside. Pretty much a take out joint. Specially if its packed. But i went early, before the whole lunch rush so i got to seat myself on a table to enjoy my meal.

Chowdah:     Boy this order was definitely a proper clam chowder. Nice and creamy with almost clam pieces in every spoonful of soup.

Standahd:     So the standard lobster roll. A pricey sandwich, but definitely super worth it. Ive had some lobster rolls before, this one is definitely a stong sammich.

Its a tiny joint so do take out as contingent because i can only imagine when a rush takes place. Staff is super nice and food is speedy and timely, plus its super delish. Would totally come and eat here again.

Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!!"
4,I&apos;ve been trying lobster rolls all over Boston and I thought the food itself was really good--bigger portions and the lobster tasted delicious! only thing is that the place was pretty small/cramped so I&apos;d go there for pick-up and not for sitting.
5,"Thee best lobster roll I had in a long time! Huge portions, Hurd lobster roll! Mm so good!"
4,"If you go to Boston and you don&apos;t have a lobster roll, did you even go to Boston? That&apos;s exactly what I said to myself and that&apos;s what brought me to this place.

It&apos;s about a 10 minute walk from the Prudential Center and since the weather was great we decided to walk it. It&apos;s a small place that fits like 7 people inside and about 3 people outside. 

In addition to lobster rolls, they also have clam chowder and lobster bisque. I decided to get the standard lobster roll, which was way bigger than I imagined since they use a challah roll instead of a regular roll. It was delicious! My sister got the clam chowder which was so creamy and filling. 

The lobster rolls are market price so be prepared to pay a pretty penny, which I wasn&apos;t, but it was well worth it!"
5,This was my first lobster roll experience ever and I must say I have been marked for good. The bread to lobster meat ratio was spot on and the melted butter to dip it all in was well worth the calories. I went for the warm roll (you can choose cold vs warm) and I enjoyed every single bite of it.
