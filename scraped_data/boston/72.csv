4,"This place is a great experience, especially when you have out-of-town visitors that would appreciate the busy no-frills atmosphere. I would not recommend coming with a large group during peak time, as the size of your group definitely scales how long your wait will be. This is the kind of tiny, bustling place that (pre-pandemic) sat my group of 4 across the table from a separate party of 2. The longest wait I&apos;ve had pre-pandemic was probably around 40 minutes for a group of 7, during peak dinner hours on a weekend night. 

The soup dumplings (xiaolongbao or XLB) are juicy, the skin isn&apos;t very thick, and they&apos;re definitely worth it at the price point! Every other dish I&apos;ve had here has been tasty - the vegetable dumplings are flavorful and have a good texture too, and the stir-fried vegetables are well-seasoned and not overcooked. I think the XLB are definitely worth the price and the other dishes are tasty and reasonably priced. I would wait for the XLB, at least!

If the wait here is too long, I&apos;ve heard that the owners also manage the dumpling house across the street. I&apos;d definitely recommend coming here for their tasty XLB and the flavor and consistent quality of other dishes."
4,"Review for Delivery/To-Go experience. 

Ordered: 
-juicy pork dumplings (Xiao long bao)
-mapo tofu
-beef wrap
-Taiwan rice came 

Juicy pork dumplings were definitely juicy! Be sure to pick these up very carefully and with a spoon under so as to not break the skin and allow the treasured soup to come oozing out and wasted! Highly recommend this order :) 

Mapo Tofu was the most underwhelming of my order. The tofu and the sauce just seemed completely separate with the tofu tasting as if it had just come out of its box and hadn&apos;t been cooked with the sauce :( I am hopeful that after my leftovers have had a day of sitting, the flavor will be there today. 

Beef wrap was solid! Very oily and fried, just the way it&apos;s supposed to be. There is beef and cilantro inside, creating a delicious taste. 

Taiwanese rice cake was spot on. With a variety of veggies and some meat, you get the perfect mixture of chewy and crunchy. I would recommend this order.


A nice lady answered the phone for my pick up order and everything went very smoothly! The food was delivered to me pretty quickly (in less than 35 minutes). I&apos;ll likely be ordering from them again or going to the restaurant to eat in person (after this whole coronavirus situation is over)."
5,"THE BEST SOUP DUMPLINGS. Im telling you. The mini juicy pork soup dumplings are delicious paired with the chili sauce and vinegar sauce. Nothing beats it. The Szechuan fish soup is also delicious. I went in today and they are doing to-go orders. I had a wonderful conversation with the sweet woman in the front. Before covid, I loved the home-y/cozy feeling dining in. Already looking forward to going back again"

Must-try: Soup Dumplings

So I have mixed feelings about this place because I&apos;ve been here pre and post-Covid. The experience pre-covid (food-wise) was pretty good. Everything was cooked properly, flavors were bold, the temperature was perfect, seasonings were appropriate, and according to my Chinese friends, this place is legit regarding authentic flavors. 

Post-Covid was a different story. I believe the fact that I had it delivered played a major factor (you cannot dine-in at the moment): Food was cold which definitely tampered with the flavor and texture, tasted a little bland, dumplings were soggy. I reheated it and the flavor improved, but it did not help the texture (rice got dry, dumplings were still soggy). The rice I got had shrimp and pork, but the texture of the pork was very weird, almost chewy. Sauteed vegetables were nice though! Cooked to perfection and the ride didn&apos;t affect them. 

I would try to pick up the food (instead of asking for delivery) so you have better control of kitchen to table time. The dumplings are the tried and true here so definitely order those. The Beef &amp; Peppers is a really good one, but extremely (extremely!) spicy, so be careful there. The rest will depend on what you really like in Chinese food. The menu is huge so I would like to try a few other items here to determine if the restaurant is worth putting on my go-to list. 

Non-Food Stuff: I think prices could be cheaper for the type of place that it is, but they are not expensive.

Hope that helps!

1,"This place is the usual disrespectful customer service but good food not great Asian place.

Try elsewhere"
1,"Great food, but LOTS IF HAIR IN MY FOOD. I ordered take out and my pork buns had a ton of hair stuck to them. Very disappointed in that."
3,"We had pork and crab pan-fried dumplings and pork and crab soup dumplings. The pan-fried ones were nice, but the soup dumplings were subpar and the dough was mushy. I&apos;d go with 3.5 on this one."
5,"Gourmet Dumpling House is the best place in Chinatown. Yes, the service is bad but I have very low expectations when I go to a great Chinese place. I really do think it is part of the experience. It is cramped and loud but the food is amazing.

I always get these three for years because they have never failed me
* Mini Juicy Dumplings with Pork (8 for $6.50)
* Sliced Fish Szechuan Style ($17.95)
* Shredded/Sauteed Julienned beef with Long Horn Peppers ($15.95)

Mini Juicy Dumplings with Pork (Xia long bao/xlb) are really good. The skin is pretty thin and chewy, the broth is extremely flavorful, and it&apos;s good sized. I also noticed that their xlb doesnt break as easily as Dumpling Cafe&apos;s. 

Sliced Fish Szechuan Style is a must from here. There is a generous amount of fish compared to other places that mostly fill the dish with napa cabbage. The soup isnt as spicy as it looks so dont be scared by how red it looks. One thing to note is that these dont have that much of a numbing sensation but I personally like it that way. Ive had many szechuan style fish in Boston but I always end up thinking that Gourmet Dumpling House is better.

Beef with Long Horn Peppers is also another amazing dish. BUT only if you like spicy food because these peppers are HOT. The beef is sauteed to perfection with a little bit of crisp. The peppers and lettuce are still crunchy so that you get various textures. These are amazing to eat with some white rice!

I cannot wait until Gourmet Dumpling House is open for dine in because I was literally drooling writing this review."
4,"What kind of dumpling you ask? It&apos;s gourmet dumpling. Their name live up to everything that I wished for in the heart of Boston Chinatown. I happened to recruit a Hong Kong journalist for this dinner at Gourmet Dumpling House on my way to the restaurant. You know its quite good when someone from the area tells you that the dumplings are legit. 

The restaurant is small, but packed with seasoned and newcomers from all ages and ethnicity. This is quite a fast paced dining environment that leaves a lot of room for imagination as their menu is very extensive. Our group of 4 did our homework while we wait in line for 20 minutes. To get a seating is a miracle in this place, but I guarantee you it is worth the time. 

The vibe of a restaurant is highly regarded as their quality of food. Conversations that would come up in one restaurants often unique to that particular experience. To say the least, our conversations in this diner was nothing short of controversial - with Hong Kong&apos;s protest against Republic of China, to conquering the Tinder game. It was a delightful dining experience that inspired many conversations, and many more dumpling bites that will satisfy your heart and soul."
5,"Gourmet Dumpling House is one of my favorite restaurants in Chinatown. They are notoriously busy. They&apos;re not one of the top restaurants in Boston for nothing. Unfortunately if you dine here as a couple you will be sharing a table with strangers which will be the only unpleasant thing about your dining experience. We came right as they opened their doors so half of the restaurant was empty but they still seated my party of two at a larger table and had us share it with another couple. As long as you only care about the food, it&apos;s a solid 5/5. 

I first visited this establishment 3 years ago and thought it was good but nothing special. I made my second visit approximately 1 month ago and basically loved everything we ordered. I have a tendency to over-order but with Gourmet having such a large menu, it&apos;s hard not to. Their soup dumplings are plump and full of delicious, flavorful soup. The Szechuan wonton with chili oil was a refreshing dish due to the cucumber and carrots that accompanied the wontons. The chili oil is a tasty mixture, however, it is lacking in heat. The wontons were solid. The Sandong style pan fried dumplings with pork &amp; shrimp were good but I would have liked them more if they were even crispier. Each of our dumpling dishes came with their own dipping sauce. You will have to ask for chili sauce because they don&apos;t keep any condiments at the table. 

The scallion pancakes were perfect! Crispy and delicious. My boyfriend and I are going through a phase where we are obsessed with salt &amp; pepper chicken wings and calamari so we had to order them. Everything was seasoned well and fried to perfection. Both the chicken wings and calamari sit on a bed of iceberg lettuce to add a different texture and balance out the saltiness. I love that the chicken wings were also seasoned with that special Chinese seasoning on top of the salt &amp; pepper that really just enhances the whole dish. We definitely had to get a few to-go boxes but our overall lunch experience was super yummy!"
2,"Stopped by on a rainy Boston Saturday. It was around 2:30pm. 

This place was crazy. Crazy busy. We stepped on in and the hostess quickly took us to our two person table. The table was awkwardly set up in a corner right in front of a door and right beside the fish tank. 

It was very crowded inside so it was really hard to move around. We didn&apos;t mind our table though and were actually glad that we were seated right away. 

We had like three different servers and for the longest time we just sat there with no one coming to get our orders. When they finally did, we ordered: 

Dumplings, chicken with broccoli, and crab ragoons. Oh and a side of white rice since it&apos;s not included with the entree. 

The food was good but in my opinion nothing special. It was very plain and lacking flavor. Soy sauce was my best friend here. 
 
Our waitresses disappeared agent they brought us our food and so we were never checked on or asked if we needed anything. 

Paid about $35 worth of food. The service sucked and the food was just ok. 

As we sat there someone actually tried opening the door that was right behind my chair and ended up hitting me with the knob.. They then made there way thru and didn&apos;t even apologize.. rude"
5,"What can I write that hasn&apos;t already been said about this place? It&apos;s delicious. It&apos;s insanely popular and busy at all hours. It&apos;s claustrophobic inside. It&apos;s a bit overrated. It&apos;s a chaotic Chinatown experience with good food. It&apos;s the place I always take visiting family and friends when want to eat in Chinatown. It&apos;s just reliably good. I recommend ordering the following:

Mini juicy dumplings (xiao long bao): They do soup dumplings very well here. Thin wrappers, deep intense broth--it&apos;s all great. You can either get these with just pork or with pork and crab. I can&apos;t get enough of the crab version and could eat an entire order myself, but if anyone in your party doesn&apos;t love seafood, you might want to stick with the pork. 

Scallion pancakes: They deep-fry them here so they&apos;re extremely crispy. Greasy, but a crowd pleaser for sure. 

Beef with scallion rolls: Same great scallion pancakes but rolled around beef, scallions, and a smear of hoisin. Really tasty. 

Salt and pepper chicken wings: Yeah they&apos;re fried chicken wings, but they do them really well. An added plus is they&apos;re great for people who are not very adventurous as well. 

Sliced Fish Szechuan Style: A must-order. The fish is so tender, and the sauce is addictive. Even the small is a huge portion that is more than enough for a party of 4. My husband&apos;s favorite dish. We also like the beef version of this for people who don&apos;t like seafood. 

Mapo tofu: Like other places in Chinatown, this is a vegetarian version and doesn&apos;t taste very Szechuan at all, but I love it. It&apos;s flavorful and comforting. Good even if you&apos;re not vegetarian."
4,"Pretty authentic Chinese food offered here! We got seaweed salad, kimchi, and spinach dumplings! Def the authentic Chinese dish I had in China! 
Fast service and large portion! 
Will come back to try other dishes for sure!
The dining space is tiny with little space between tables though. Better to order take out."
1,"We got delivery from here last night and we paid $14 for the beef pan fried noodles. There was NO MEAT in the dish whatsoever. I don&apos;t know if they just forgot to add in the beef, but it was basically a pile of soggy noodles with celery. Way too saucy. Their salt and pepper pork pieces were all cut up and small. The beef and string beans also did not have much meat in it. Remind me to never order from here again."
1,"I have been craving for scallion pancakes 
during the COVID-19 pandemic. I ordered two of the scallion pancakes today which costed $17. I was very disappointed when I opened the boxes at home. Every piece of the scallion pancakes in both orders were burnt. I had a few bite on a piece. It was not fresh at all and had a funny taste. I had stomachache right away. I ended up trashing the rest of them. How could you serve these bad quality food (leftovers?) to customers? Shame on you!"
4,"Luckily got seated right away as this place almost always has a line going out the door. Seats are tightly packed together so personal space is limited as they try to fit as many people in as possible (potentially too many). 

Had the beef tendon, mini juicy dumplings with pork, salt and pepper tofu, and Szechuan fish soup with 2 bowls of rice. This was my first time trying the beef tendon and I thoroughly enjoyed how flavorful it was and how it was served cold. The mini dumplings were good but had to ask for vinegar as there was only soy sauce on the table. The tofu had a perfect crispy layer served with a tasty oyster based sauce. The fish smelled intoxicating and tasted even better. Typically I try to avoid Szechuan as it can be easily overbearing but this was perfect. Definitely not a soup that you can sip on but very good served over white rice as a sauce. Will come back if the line isn&apos;t crazy."
4,"When I visit Boston, this is a usual spot I like to go to for soup dumplings. I only go for that and expect nothing else. The interior is sooo tiny and they pack guests in like sardines. So, if you&apos;re claustrophobic- this is not a place for you. Fair warning.

Not sure on the food quality, but it satisfies my soup dumpling cravings, which are hard to find in most cities (surprisingly). 

Wait is pretty short. No rhyme or reason to it. About 15-20 min at most."
4,"Holyyy smokes! This is by far my favorite Chinese food on earth (currently at least).

I have to eat it every time I&apos;m in Boston. Literally finger licking good. Obviously I always order too much, but for good reason!

I have had Chinese food every Sunday since I was a kid and since then my go to in Cali closed down and I couldn&apos;t find a place that was as remarkable until I was introduced to this gem. 

Super small, super crowded yes but worth it - ABSOLUTELY! 

Only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because I feel like they could be a little cleaner."
1,My friend and I visited last year and the food was less than memorable. My friend ordered the wrong dish by accident and when she asked about it the server began to yell at her and caused a scene. The staff is horribly rude and the food is forgettable.
4,"Packed in this little restaurant like sardines. Does that matter? Absolutely not!

Gourmet Dumpling House is faulted by... nothing (unless you watched the news in October, but that&apos;s another story). 

Stepping in on a cold winter day, after waiting fifteen minutes outdoors for a table, we were greeted to piping hot tea at a small table. That set the mood for the remainder of the service: warm, friendly, and homey.

We started our meal with shared udon noodles, followed by a triage of fried dumplings, steamed dumplings, and soup dumplings.

I&apos;ll be honest: the pan fried weren&apos;t my favorite. Perhaps the heat was too low, but biting into the dumpling was like a bomb of hot oil in my mouth, like it had absorbed all the oil in the pan. Unappetizing.

The remainder? Excellent. The udon noodles, which came out three minutes after ordering, were perfectly tender and full of flavor. The melt-in-your-mouth pork, tender mushrooms, and whatever sauce came on the noodles was delectable. For as quick as it came out, this dish was packed with flavor.

The juicy pork dumplings were the star of the show; edible pillows full of bone-warming soup that put a smile on my face immediately. These dumplings are special, and are made with a great deal of care. The broth in these soup dumplings is  incredibly rich, and supports the ground pork dumpling expertly.

If you&apos;re willing to wait, this is the place to be."
