5,"Coffee snob here, but Ogawa met all expectations. No indoor/outdoor seating due to Covid. Friendly barista. I ordered a cappuccino and a coffee-flavored macaroon. Both were incredible and well made. Macaroon tasted fresh, and cappuccino was perfect. Price is a bit on the higher side, but worth it for the quality."
5,"It&apos;s the best coffee/Matcha latte place in town. I am a huge coffee fan and tried various (big and small) specialty coffee places in Boston and this, by far, is the best. Like other yelpers mentioned, they are known for their matcha latte and the place is a bit small for big group, but I appreciated their attentive and how they wipe down every hard surface every time someone left since COVID-19 hit the town.

Ogawa Coffee was one of the chained specialty coffee shops from Japan, needless to say they have strict quality control and wabisabi plating. I cannot wait to visit them again next time I am in town."
5,"First off, it&apos;s pricey. Know what you&apos;re walking into. Second, you get what you pay for. A $50 bottle of wine is not the same as a $5 bottle of wine, unless you don&apos;t drink enough to know or care about the difference. Same with coffee. If you know and love Starbucks blonde roast, you won&apos;t appreciate the price tags here and you probably won&apos;t find it worth the money. If you love good coffee, run, don&apos;t walk to Ogawa. 

Second, the seating is odd, and I don&apos;t love it. I like a coffee shop that&apos;s cozy, where you can sit for a couple of hours and feel welcome. This place is more modern, austere, minimalist in its aesthetics. If nothing else, it&apos;s quite unique.

Third, they have latte art classes! I wish I wasn&apos;t visiting from out of town because their prices are super reasonable! Next time, perhaps. 

Finally, they seem responsive to necessary covid measures. Always wearing masks, well spaced out--perhaps more than most people think necessary but actually a good amount of safe space. Overall, I highly enjoyed the visit and wish them the best."
5,"Great coffee, chai latte, and bagels.  If you&apos;re in the area definitely stop in - you won&apos;t be disappointed. Best wheat everything bagel I&apos;ve ever had :)"
4,"This is strictly a review during COVID times - we ordered 1) egg + bacon + avocado sandwich on a whole wheat everything bagel 2) BLTE brioche sandwich. They don&apos;t sell any of their iconic sweets/desserts anymore right now (SO SADD!) - which I know has been hyped up all over my instagram. I&apos;ve been dying to try their matcha sundae and matcha cake roll but unfortunately, during covid, they don&apos;t do this. 

Their sandwiches were honestly pretty basic, but they were super affordable - the bagel sandwich was less than $7 and the brioche was around $9.75, but it came with chips as well. Flavorwise though, I felt like I could make this at home and was a bit underwhelming, though their chili mayo helped flavorwise to make it a bit more unique. We also ordered the Houjicha latte which was SO delicious. They made it super creamy but not too overwhelming, it has this delicious burnt, barley taste to it as well as the green tea flavor - however, this was a bit pricey at $6.25 for a small late. 

overall, if you want to try this place out during covid, I would highly suggest skipping the food. Most of the things on their menu were crossed out an unavailable anyways. I think they&apos;re best known for their lattes (ie. matcha latte &amp; Houjicha latte). I hope they open back up full after cases get better because their dessert look so good. 

PS, service was amazing here. The guy who took our order made sure out drink looked super pretty and was so accommodating in helping us order because we were so indecisive."
4,"Stopped in here for a midday coffee. Really solid! 

The staff was super nice and explained each coffee to us. They have 4 or so specialty drinks and I decided on the  Cafe noisette. It was super rich and creamy, an afternoon delight, with the kick of caffeine that I really needed.

They seem to sell out of flavors later in the day - so arrive early. That just means that they are making everything in small batches - not a bad thing.

I wanted to try the horchata but it&apos;s only made cold - and that day it was freezing outside, so I passed haha.

Do note that it&apos;s a little pricier than all the other local coffee shops we visited on this trip. You&apos;re certainly paying a premium here."
3,"OGAWA needs to seriously consider using some sort of salty measures in its food delivery business. As shown, there is no bag(s) whatsoever. Talking about common sense, for that matter, it any exist in whoever is running this business. 

Are you not profitable enough? If not profitable, please shut down. If profitable, use some paper bag(s) -- it is disgusting especially when the whole world is worried about food handling/delivering."
3,"I wish I could give a better rating as I loved their variety of Asian coffees available and the location is very beautiful but I honestly didn&apos;t love the coffee I received. I went with the cold brew and it was just okay. They put in cream for me and that helped but it was a fairly odd taste. Definitely strong but I think overpriced for what the end product tasted like. It&apos;s great if a coffee is strong but you also want to enjoy drinking it. I also ordered a Vietnamese iced coffee. I&apos;ve had these at several places and know what they should taste like and this coffee was definitely off. Not good at all but I&apos;d already left by the time I tried it and didn&apos;t feel like going back as it took longer than I expected to get the coffee in the first place. Pleasant service, nice location but I found the drinks tasted strange and were overpriced for the quality of product that I received. I wouldn&apos;t go back as there are so many options in the area."
4,"Placed an order for pick up over the phone and they were super sweet! I had the hojicha latte and asked to add an extra shot of espresso for that caffeine. Hojicha flavor was strong and nutty, how I liked it! The espresso wasn&apos;t overpowering either.  My bf had the nitro cold brew and it was pretty strong. It was kind of pricey for both drinks, mostly my latte.. it was $8 with the espresso which is pretty expensive for a latte but I definitely enjoyed the hojicha taste."
5,"The customer service here is on point and the latte arts are so cute too!

I was waiting for my friend to show up for forever while eating some cannolis from another store. None of the employees made me feel bad for sitting in the shop so long without ordering yet. One of the employees even handed me a napkin to dust off the powdered sugar that fell on my shirt. Their customer service was great! The cashier was also very friendly and knowledgeable. I&apos;m not that big of a coffee drinker but the employee was able to get me an order based on what I wanted (something not that sweet with a latte art on top). 

I&apos;d definitely check this place out a lot more if I was from Boston. They have a couple seasonal latte art patterns that switches every now and then. The employee also said that I can also request a pattern and they can see if they can make it. I thought that was super awesome of him to suggest. The barista also apologized for the pattern being a bit faint but I thought it was fine :D"
4,With limited seating and social distancing policies in place Ogawa is great cafe for a afternoon pick me up. They also have small food treats to be enjoyed with coffee. Love the decor with so many plants and greenery.
4,"This review is just based on a 1-time visit (but I&apos;d love to return and try other items on their menu!). I&apos;ll be honest, I was displeased with the seating arrangement inside. The further in you go, there&apos;s a staircase/bleacher-like area with seats. By the windows, you have to step up onto a platformed level where a table sits. It was pretty packed when I came in on a late Sunday afternoon and found two open stools near the front. 

The food: I tried their matcha roll ($7) which was VERY rich in pure, high-grade matcha flavor. I was surprised by this, since it&apos;s nothing comparable to a faux &quot;matcha roll cake&quot; you&apos;d find from a nearby Chinatown bakery (which is most actually green food coloring and zero matcha powder) or a weak (mostly milk) &quot;matcha latte&quot; you&apos;d drink at Starbucks. 

The typical mild grassy flavors are enhanced in the cream here as if you&apos;re tasting a fresh matcha concentrate. I liked how they offset that intensity by including a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the plate, as well as a few tender cubes of Japanese coffee jelly, fresh strawberries, and chocolate and raspberry syrup. 

If you&apos;re a matcha fanatic, Ogawa will satisfy your fill! I saw several people get orders of their quiche + salad which looked tasty too."
4,What a cute little coffee shop. It has bleacher seating. I had a regular iced latte with vanilla syrup and almond milk. It was really tasty. Not too strong. I also tried their cinnamon raisin bagel which was pretty simple but it did have me full.
3,"The ambiance is quaint- I can see why students would come here to study or a convenient location for a quick meeting.

If you go through the reviews and pictures I think they are mainly known for the lattes, especially their matcha lattes. Although I like these my preferred drink at a cafe is either a pour-over or a cold brew- for me, I can really judge the quality of beans and the skill of the barista. 

I ended up getting their cold brew and my friend got latte caramel (Iced). We were both disappointed. The cold brew was super dark- very similar to Starbucks and the latte caramel that my friend had was super water down and he ordered it to go there. 

I would not come back for coffee if I need a fix, however, I wouldn&apos;t mind coming here to hang out with some friends or for a business meeting."
4,"Ogawa Coffee was a comforting delight during the morning gloom in Boston. It&apos;s within a walkable distance from our accommodations, so we decided to stop by here for breakfast. Seating options are limited with a few tables up front, but there is additional seating by the order pick-up area.

When in a Japanese coffee shop, you must try their coffee roasts! I opted for the Kyoto House Blend - black. My partner ordered a Banana Smoothie and we shared the Avocado Toast. Simply delicious - the toast was bigger than my hand and was enough for the two of us."
2,"Based on most of the past reviews I seem to be the only one who has a real problem paying 7 dollars- with small tip almost 8 dollars for a cup of coffee!  Sorry this is outrageous and I felt like a dope paying...but I did. With regards to the coffee, it was really no big deal and the service was lethargic. A similar cup can be had elsewhere for much less. I think the company&apos;s US business plan needs to be revisited. Will not be back."
4,"I was really curious about what kind of cafe this would be before coming in... I wasn&apos;t sure if it was catered more towards the East Asian community, or if it&apos;d be focused on taking something that started in Japan (according to the website, Ogawa started in Kyoto) and sharing it with a wider audience.

From my visit there, it&apos;s certainly more of the latter. It&apos;s still got sundaes and cute latte art, but it&apos;s certainly not limited to that (and my friend and I seemed to be in the minority ordering our bunny/bear lattes). 

The lattes were super adorable and flavorful! You can taste matcha with every sip.

The sundae was a really good mix of things: green tea ice cream (from Toscanini&apos;s), red bean, corn flakes, and green tea mochi. My only disappointment was the size: It was $11 for a pretty small bowl. 

I&apos;d come back again to try their other drinks! I wouldn&apos;t recommend the sundae."
5,"One of my coolest finds during a recent trip to Boston. Ogawa Coffee offers up some really good breakfast options and coffee in a unique setting. It&apos;s somewhat hidden away down a small street near the financial district so look hard. 

Inside you&apos;ll find some cool decor including a couple of tables elevated inside the window (yes you can sit here), some bench/bleacher style seats and even brushes and water colors at the bar to paint while you eat!! 

Everything here is very very fresh and homemade type stuff. The quiche here was the bomb!!!! Fresh, tasty and a great generous size. It came with a delicious salad full of greens and a great vinaigrette dressing. Coffee was also great as was the service and prices. 

No negatives here and a must if you&apos;re in the area!!!!!"
5,"Stopped here on a weekend trip to Boston, and I&apos;m so happy I did! The café is known for their matcha/green tea inspired drinks and food, however I opted for a vanilla latte and breakfast bagel sandwich. Everything tasted wonderful and fresh. Presentation, as you can see, is on point! Baristas are also super friendly. A must see, in Boston!"
5,"This is purely a review of their matcha-flavored yums from a matcha lover: 5/5.

Heavily matcha flavored with its characteristic gentle bitterness tempered but not covered by sweetness. Perfect! 

The matcha cake was particularly delicious, as the matcha flavor in the filling was slightly different than the one in the covering, making it outstandingly matcha without being one-dimensional. 

The matcha ice cream is also always great with red bean and cream and more matcha dustings!"
