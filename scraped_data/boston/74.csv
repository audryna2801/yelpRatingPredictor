5,"What an amazing museum my son surprised me with this journey. 

We visited the Isabella Gardner museum and what a beautiful experience. 

The museum was created by Isabella Gardner and her husband, after the loss from their 2 year old, son that passed from pneumonia and a miscarriage. Isabella was depressed from her loss. Her husband and she travel often and this is when She started collecting most of her art pieces. Most popular art work she collected was Rembrandt. 

The cafe is currently closed due to Covid19, but the lavatories were open and its metered street parking. Must make a reservation. Enjoy."
5,Nice covid outing. I swear I recognize one of the stolen pieces from my grandma&apos;s living room. I released one of my birds into the atrium and he seemed happy. Many bugs and plants to snack on. My only suggestion is that the fountain would be a beautiful spot for mermaids.
5,"Such an amazing place!  Each time I visit I discover something for the first time.  The palace is amazing and I love enjoying the rotating exhibits also.  They are taking such good care of their staff and visitors during the pandemic.  I felt safe, welcomed, and thoroughly enjoyed our visit today!"
5,Unique museum that&apos;s totally worth checking out! Lots of European vibes and the inside garden is something you&apos;d imagine in a movie. There was also an outdoor garden that can&apos;t be missed!
1,Kind of annoyed that the website does not tell you that you can not buy tickets when you arrive. I understand covid restrictions but it would be nice if the website said you must buy the tickets online. $20 Uber ride for nothing...
5,"Beautiful, calm, peaceful museum with a unique collection. I don&apos;t know much about art, but I was very satisfied with my visit. There were numerous rooms with varying art styles and pieces. There was also a beautiful courtyard with lush greenery to view (and if you&apos;re around at the right time, an opera singer to listen to). The museum had multiple levels with rooms ranging in size and extravagance. I throughly enjoyed my visit and would recommend a visit if you&apos;re into art!"
5,"Isabella had money of her own but lived within the ample means of her well-to-do spouse. They used her money to build a fine art collection with Rembrandt to Sargent, European interior design furniture, tapestries and ironwork and collected letters and books. An expansion displays visiting exhibits.

All are displayed as she willed it in an approachable setting. Most or these works of art can be seen up close instead of from a roped off distance.

Your visit will take at least an hour(the good news) and you will be close to the Museum of Fine Art when you leave (more good news if you really like art museums)."
5,"I&apos;ve been here three times now and every time I learn something new about Isabella, the art, the museum. The museum doesn&apos;t seem very big, but there&apos;s so much to explore because the whole palace is a sight to see. It&apos;s not just the paintings, but its the design and architecture of the room. I love it all! 

The staff is also fantastic, they&apos;re all so friendly and helpful. They know so much, you can ask them all sorts of questions and they will very patiently answer them. 

You could spend an hour here, or you could spend 3 hours here. It all depends on how much time you wanna spend looking at the art and really spend time focusing on certain areas in the museum. There&apos;s also a cafe, Cafe G, here in the museum so if you get tired in the middle you can always take a break and grab a cup of coffee before continuing back to see the rest of the museum!"
4,"Do anyone out there know anyone named ISABELLA?? Tell them they can visit a museum BOSTON FOR FREE! That&apos;s right (if a little unfair) people with Capital One accounts OR those named Isabella get in for free! Otherwise is $15. Our college friend raved about this place and advised us to go here, instead of the Kennedy library which I&apos;m sure is great in it&apos;s own right.

A new feature/hallway was added that included Gardner&apos;s personal affects, so I was happy to see that. Each room has laminated placards with maps (East Wall, South Wall etc) that let you know what you are looking at. IT&apos;s better than standing and peering, but I have a terrible sense of direction so that was not always helpful!
Some rooms were cordoned off for capacity reasons, so at times there was a wait. It was a combination of artwork that Gardner collected or her own possessions. 

Then there&apos;s the courtyard: breathtaking from all 3 levels. But of course we are not allowed to traipse on it so we have to take pictures in VERY small openings. It can be a long wait to find a nice spot, between selfies and people running to one end of the courtyard and asking others to take their picture! (really people?)

We didn&apos;t make the 3rd floor, standing/walking was getting to us, so we sat one some of the benches conveniently located. We refreshed with good but pricey wine in the museum cafe&apos;. It was too hot to sit outside.

Note re Mark T&apos;s comment about empty frames: I was stunned to hear of the stolen paintings too, but I don&apos;t think a poster would be adequate. Why pay to see something you can buy in the gift shop? I wonder if they left them up in the hopes they would be recovered?

The museum is more like a look into a private house rather than a rotating exhibit. I would probably go back when visiting Boston again, to check out the 3rd floor and the gift shop."
4,"This is an interesting museum that I visited based on the recommendation of a friend. The coolest thing is that the rooms were all set up by Isabella. I was very glad that we were able to go to the intro talk when we got there which helped to give context to the museum. It was also in an amazing theatre room with a design I&apos;ve never seen before. I really liked the court yard, the living room with the bird, and the tapestry. Really, just so much to take in, but easy to go through in about one or two hours. There was so much to look at, three stories or the museum, plus the newer area. I had a really interesting conversation with one of the docents. Nice visit."
5,"Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum is a hidden gem in Boston. It&apos;s a historic building south of Fenway with a gorgeous indoor courtyard that spans three levels with fountains, plants, etc. In addition, there are several galleries in the new building, many galleries in the old building, a restaurant, reading rooms, theaters, and a gift store. 

It&apos;s $15 to get in as a regular adult, so budget several hours to enjoy the art and sit and relax in the indoor courtyard. If you go on the third Thursday of the month, the museum stays open until 9pm with music, poetry reading, etc. 

There are bathrooms and free lockers to store bags in the basement."
5,"When I told a good friend that I was taking a solo trip to Boston, she said: &quot;You have to go to the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum.&quot; I trust her; so I put it on the itinerary. Because I was going on the recommendation of a trusted friend, I didn&apos;t look into it to much and wasn&apos;t sure what to expect. And OMG - it is AMAZING. 

First of all, it&apos;s something that you have to see for yourself, but the museum is less museum than palace? Isabella Stewart Gardner was a very wealthy art collector in Boston and she created this palace as a place to display the art she collected. And because she loved Italy, she hired an architect to build an Italian-inspired palazzo. That&apos;s really the best I can do to describe it. But it&apos;s beautiful! A gorgeous courtyard. And just a stunning, unique building and place to house art. The Gardners purchased columns, windows, doorways, and more from Italy, which were incorporated into the very structure of the building. I could keep going on, but it&apos;s just best you see it yourself. 

And then there&apos;s the art. Mrs. Gardner brought the first Botticelli painting to America (The Story of Lucretia), and you can see that here. How about some Manet, Matisse, Bellini? Or is Titian more your thing? Sargent? A stained glass window from 13th century France? Raphael? An 18th century Spanish gate? There&apos;s all this and SO MUCH more. 

What so impressed me about this museum was that it wasn&apos;t just the pieces themselves that blew me away. Rather, the way they are displayed made the pieces even more stunning. (For example, the John Singer Sargent painting &quot;El Jaleo,&quot; which is displayed near tiles from Mexico, a Spanish gate, a late 15th century Spanish window, and more. 

The beauty of this museum is almost overwhelming. Actually, it was overwhelming (hence the wine and dessert break in the cafe). I cannot stress enough the uniqueness of this museum. You just have to visit."
5,"One of the best museums I&apos;ve ever been to. Their out of box approach to displaying art, music and her home was incredible. I was left speechless, and that doesn&apos;t happen very often. :-) The museum can be self-guided or you can rent headphones to listen to additional details. It&apos;s a can&apos;t miss stop in Boston.

Tip: If your name is Isabella/Isabelle you get in for free!"
4,"This museum is a gem! It&apos;s very unique. You&apos;ll have to climb stairs to the different exhibits. Not only does it have plenty of art, there is also a courtyard. The courtyard was my favorite. It was stunning."
5,"Beautifully curated, impressive architecture,- so &quot;un-museum &quot; like-  Private- peaceful, accessible, a MUST see in Boston.  Greenhouse indoors, gift shop and cafe (can be long waits but they give you a beeper you can take with you around the museum while you wait).  They provide wheel chairs and walkers that can be used free that go thru many narrow doorways yours would not.  Backpack, diaper bags, purses must be carried on your front chest or hung on your side. Nothing on your back to protect glassless art.  Travel light as you have stairs to climb and narrow areas. (There are lifts for handicap) 
Friendly Volunteers throughout to answer questions."
5,"Love-LY AND ANOTHER beautiful day at the Isabella. 

The girls and I stopped in for a cuppa and sweet and it was awesome! Love MEM tea and wish that I could buy it in the stores"
5,"Especially in white, dreary winter, you can escape the cold and snow here as this place is like a secret oasis of spring when you see the beautiful garden courtyard - very picturesque sitting on the ledges surrounding the courtyard. 

There is a ton of artwork to see in various rooms and each room has info cards for each wall that has a brief summary of the entire room and then names and artists for each painting. Im a lazy reader so I only ready the summary, but those were really interesting and gave me enough context about the styles and feel that Isabella was going for. 

On the top floor, grand foyer I believe you&apos;ll see some frames with no paintings and those were stolen from the museum some time ago. There&apos;s a little book in that room that shows each piece of artwork that was taken which was interesting to read through.

If you have any info on the stolen pieces it a 5 million reward--- get on it detectives!"
4,"The Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum has a fascinating history. If you&apos;re not familiar, Isabella Stewart Gardner was an eccentric and wealthy heiress who built a lavish 15th-century Venetian palace inspired living quarters and museum with an art collection of world importance. The stipulation was that after she died, nothing could be moved or updated or the trustees would have to relinquish the assets to Harvard. Its literally frozen in time.

In 1990 the ISG was suspiciously robbed and became the biggest unsolved art heist in history. Because of ISG&apos;s will stipulations, this art heist can&apos;t be addressed. So empty frames hang blank from the stolen art. I&apos;ve always been fascinated with this entire situation.

I frequent many museums and was disappointed at the lack of accompanying information to the collections. I know they can&apos;t change much - but how about an app? A guide? More explanatory pamphlets? There was a serious lack of educational components. Its not enough for me just to see things - I do value knowing what I&apos;m looking at. This is the greatest private art collection in existence and its pieces deserve more information and dialogue. Please, ISG, if you&apos;re reading this...consider this addition!

If you&apos;re in Boston, I do recommend stopping by. Its very cool to see, and there&apos;s three floors of galleries that surround a garden courtyard that&apos;s exquisite."
5,"I patronized the Museum today to view the exhibition, Botticelli: heroines + heroes, and what an exhibition it &apos;twas!

The Botticelli: Heroines and Hero&apos;s exhibition is located in the Hotsetter Gallery and it combines two pivotal
Paintings by Sandro Botticelli, The story of Lucretia and The Story of Virginia. Also located in the gallery is a comic illustration by award-winning graphic novelist Karl Stevens, which inculcates Gardener&apos;s acquisition of The Story of Lucretia - the first Botticelli painting to enter an American collection. After Gardner died, she eloquently stated in her will that her art collection be on permanent exhibition, &quot;for the education and enjoyment of the public forever.&quot;"
4,"I typically spent my time with family or working and don&apos;t have the opportunity to explore all the history in Boston. 

Although a work trip, I made sure to squeeze in some art as this museum was on my to do list.

If you&apos;re name is Isabella, you automatically get in free! Score! Unfortunately, I couldn&apos;t turn Malisa into Isabella, but whatever!

The museum is beautiful. Isabella&apos;s collection of art is truly amazing. There is so much to see in this compacted space. 

I loved the inner garden. So beautiful and nice to have a clear rooftop to enjoy the greenhouse effect and throughout the winter."
