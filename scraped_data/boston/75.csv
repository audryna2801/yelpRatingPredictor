5,"Service is very fast here! The servers are also friendly and willing to explain the menu (won&apos;t make fun of you for not being able to say the names of the dishes). They do social distance customers and have plenty of area to wait for your food. You can eat outside or take out your food. 

Classic Bifteki: The meat inside this was so flavorful and juicy, I was jealous I didn&apos;t order this meat myself. The feta cheese mix was great and not too spicy. 

Build your own: I chose the pita with pork and tzatziki sauce. The meat was a little dry but very flavorful. I loved the sauce and if you like cucumbers you should try this sauce. It was so refreshing and went well with all the other flavors. Just in case you aren&apos;t aware if you add onions they will be raw, same with the tomato. 

Greco Fries: MY FAVORITE FRIES! These were so flavorful and the feta on top made them great. The fries themselves were crispy and had seasoning but weren&apos;t too salty. The feta added to the top made it feel less greasy than just eating french fries. 100% will be ordering again! 

Yaya&apos;s: My favorite donuts! They are made fresh so eat them quickly after ordering or they will get soggy. The chocolate sauce is so delicious, I wish I could buy a bottle of it! I loved the texture that the oreo topping added to the donut bites. I will definitely order this again when I come back!

Kataifi: These were also very crisp and definitely made fresh! The sauce on top was a thick custard that was only slightly sweet so this is a great option if you don&apos;t like sweet desserts. I loved the pistachio pieces on top because of both the texture and flavor but it mostly tasted of custard."
5,Absolutely amazing! I ordered the lamb gyro with a side of tzatziki and everything was super flavourful and fresh. I love that it feels like an indulgent eat but it is balanced and doesn&apos;t leave you feeling groggy. The newbury street patio is very pleasant.
5,"Greco has been my life savior with having a great vegan option to order in during COVID. Thank you so much!! The staff are so nice, and are working really hard and deserve our support. 

#ThankYouThursday"
5,"Don&apos;t have anything to add that hasn&apos;t been said already, but this place is a must try if you&apos;re living in the Boston area. I strongly recommend the veggie classic, but add spicy feta - delicious. My meat-loving friend had the bifteki, which he said was the softest beef he&apos;d ever had, but after trying my gyro he actually decided he&apos;d just stick with the veggie next time! We also tried the lamb classic, which was very good; the fries, which were a solid pick but definitely get a sauce to go with them; and the butternut squash soup, which was also amazing.

Lastly and maybe most importantly: the loukomas are divine. The blueberry lemon is my all time favorite but I always have trouble picking. Don&apos;t worry though - you&apos;re guaranteed to love them no matter which flavor you get."
3,"What is it with Boston and mediocre mediterranean? Literally every other place serves up the same compostable-bowl nonsense wrapped in a pita-shaped oil sponge.  Like, does Boston get a discount on sad chickpeas?

This is kind of unfair, GreCo is a nice spot with a nice little outdoor seating area (important for these insane times).  But the food is just eh.  It&apos;s Spyce, Dig Inn, Cava all over again.  I give them credit for not shoving everything into a bowl, but the taste is almost exactly the same.

There&apos;s a couple highlights: I thought their spicy feta dip was good, but it was also just a cup full of feta.  Not that I&apos;m complaining.  I also liked their zucchini chips, but, you can&apos;t really go wrong with fried."
5,"As I sat at a table outside on the windy evening and waited for my girlfriend, I decided to sneak a fry from the gyro. &quot;Damn that was good...&quot; I thought to myself. &quot;Please come faster so we can eat this!!&quot;

If you want the best tastebud experience here, go for the gyros. All the ingredients are perfectly balanced and so yummy! The bifteki (beef) is great. For a guy like myself, they don&apos;t fill you all the way, so go for the salads or plates for a bigger portion.

At the moment, dining seems to be all outside but there are plenty of tables where you can usually find space for. Food comes pretty fast and there&apos;s also a water dispenser inside.

One of my favorite Boston spots!"
4,"I&apos;ve heard a lot about this place so I knew I had to try it.

The food was pretty good, but I&apos;m not sure if it lives up to the hype. I had the lamb gyro and it was about $11 after tax. Pretty expensive for a gyro, but it&apos;s Boston.

The gyro itself had a decent amount of lamb meat and the pita was nice and warm. I do wish it had more flavor though. The lamb could have been seasoned better. Also, the lamb had a lot of chewy fat pieces that I had to awkwardly, discreetly spit out while eating. If these two changes were made, I&apos;d give a higher rating for sure. Still, a solid fresh and satisfying lunch."
4,"Great place for Greek food! I ordered the Pork Gyro and Yaya&apos;s. The fries add a nice lemon flavor to the gyro along with the tzatziki sauce and fluffy pita! The donuts were also so yummy and sweet. Overall the food was fresh and good quality. Only downside is that it&apos;s a bit pricey, but still better than other places in Seaport."
4,"Quick, easy, healthy, convenient, and delicious quick service food in the heart of Newburry Street!  PSA- this restaurant is very very tiny with very very limited seating.  I don&apos;t recommend coming here with more than two people, more of a &quot;to-go&quot; restaurant.  However, during the Summer, I imagine more seating will open up on their outside patio.

I ordered the  bowl with french fries, pita, and spicy feta sauce!  It&apos;s a good sized portion at a decent cost.  The spicy feta was good, however next time I will go with the tzatziki... I was looking for something more creamy!  The french fries were my favorite part of the meal!  They were sprinkled with Mediterranean seasoning and cheese, delicious!

I will be coming back here!  The service and food were great!  Looking to try a gyro next time."
4,This is definitely the lunch spot on Newbury. Great upgrade from the Chipotle lifestyle back in DC. The interior is quite clean and minimalist. Love the white toned colors and the bright mood inside. The staff is super friendly and quick on service. Been coming here recently and tried the plate with beef and lamb with fries. The fries are absolutely delicious - crunchy and crisp. The pita bread comes on the side so if you&apos;re a carb hungry monster this is your calling. The protein was pretty standard - definitely had softer elsewhere but still a solid choice. The most reasonable priced lunch on the street.
5,"Holy Zucchini!! Have you ever tried something you never thought of trying... and at the same time blew your mind and made you start questioning your life decisions? These zucchini fries did it for me. Oh my Buddha. Shemomechama.

Lately I have been obsessed with Greek culture- the people, the food, the atmosphere- which brought me here. Gre.co is an authentic fast food joint. Genius concept. A hip little place to eat in or take away. The food is sensational, breathtaking. The Zucchini fries took my breath away! Not only does the food taste great, it&apos;s very reasonably priced. I recommend everything on their menu! 

Someone said this place is as good as the ones in Athens. Well, I guess my next trip is Greece! 

Get the zucchini fries! may you be mind blown."
4,"A bright little restaurant on a lower level of a building on Newbury street awaits you. The interior is simple, bright and amazing how efficient they are with the space. 

Ordered the chicken plate dinner. It comes with a side, choice of meat and sauce. The chicken was soft and juicy and delicious, the vulgar side was amazing as I have never had one that was so tasty and filled of great flavor. Loved the Tzatziki sauce with it and the combination was great.

So glad that I got to try this little gem, the staff made the experience even more pleasant. Loved it and highly recommend it!!"
5,"This place is AUTHENTIC!! Run don&apos;t walk to get yourself a gyro from here! 

The flavor brought me right back to Chios island where I spent this past summer. It was incredible taste. Even the drink options: bottled water from Greece not Poland spring. If you&apos;re feeling creative I would recommend the Mastiha sparking water, it is a chios island staple drink. I couldn&apos;t believe they had it here, made me so happy to see. 

Vegan and vegetarian options, this place could not have been more up my alley. The zucchini cakes in the veggie gyro are sooo flavorful and authentic I could cry. Seriously so delicious. I would come here for lunch and dinner sooo much if I lived in the area. 

Table seats are limited but turnover is pretty quick. They have seating outside as well and even in the cold people were eating outside. The food is that good."
4,"Yummy yummy! The gyros here are delicious but a bit expensive for the portion size. Two gyros run you about 21 dollars. 
I got the classic chicken and my husband got the classic pork and both were very tasty. It was a bit crowded when we went (Monday around 1pm) and the seating options are limited, especially if the weather isn&apos;t nice. The line goes very quickly though so we didn&apos;t wait long to order or get our food.
The restaurant is small and I wouldn&apos;t recommend for a big group if you are looking to sit and eat. It is very much a fast casual Greek place if you are looking for a quick lunch that doesn&apos;t feel like you are overdoing it."
5,"Probably one of the best Greek eateries I&apos;ve ever tried. I was staying near Copley Place so GreCo was easily walkable. Randomly found it on Yelp and I&apos;m so glad I did. The food is simple, but very tasty. I decided to build my own salad, which came with one protein, one sauce, and some pita ($10.50). I chose the Mykonos salad with bifteki (ground beef) and tzaziki (cucumber yogurt sauce), and although it didn&apos;t seem like much, it was delicious. I highly recommend both the protein and the sauce. The balsamic dressing for the salad complemented everything perfectly as well. You can also build your own pita or plate if you don&apos;t want a salad.

It&apos;s small so there&apos;s not much seating, but it&apos;s fast dining. People tend to grab &apos;n go as well. Loved that it&apos;s on Newbury street so you can take a nice stroll after your meal."
5,"My boyfriend and I came here last weekend when it felt like 106 degrees outside. We got a Chicken Gyro Pork Gyro and a side of Fries. Everything tasted delicious! The Gyros were so neatly filled and wrapped. The people were pretty nice. They do have a single bathroom which was nice. Minimal seating with a cute atmosphere that reminded me of being in a stereotypical Greek woman&apos;s kitchen.

I don&apos;t come to Newbury Street often and I&apos;ve have GreCo on my Bookmark list for ages. I&apos;m so glad I was finally able to come. Everything we had so amazing and I look forward to coming back here one I&apos;m in the area next time...preferably when it&apos;s not 96+ degree weather!"
5,"Excellent giros, quick service, food is delicious."
5,"They have 2 locations i know of and tried food from Newberry and Seaport !! Placed an order few days back, the food was amazing. I had a mixed plate, it was enough to share between 3 people !! loving this food will definitely order more !!"
4,"Your insatiable need for Greek food meets a dead end at GreCo. You have options of choosing or building your own gyro, salad or a plate with proteins and veggies. The interesting part is to choose the sauces  and my fav is the spicy feta. 
Must try - zucchini fries with tzatziki sauce. 

This place is also known for their loukoumades or the Greek street doughnut. I have tried the classic so far and it was really good with walnuts , honey and cinnamon.



The indoor seating is available and limited since the place is space like any other regular Newbury grab and go place. Moreover it is beautiful spring weather  and GreCo offers ample outdoor seating. They also have a restroom for customers."
5,"Probably the most authentic Gyro in Boston, I&apos;ve try many gyros from many so called Originals!!! But nothing like Greco.  They make their own meat on so it&apos;s not frozen but in fact layered and place in a slow cooker... Hand cut potatoes not too oily or overcook but fried perfect with a hint of Feta and oregano.... Absolutely tasty"
