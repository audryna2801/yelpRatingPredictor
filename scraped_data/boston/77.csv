5,"WHAT. AN. EXPERIENCE! This place wins the bomb.com award for 2020. There&apos;s still a few weeks left in the year but with holidays and covid numbers I think its safe to call it. I have no idea how it took so long for me to find this gem, but I&apos;ll be a regular from now on. 

Their website says that reservations are highly encouraged so I made a res for my family of 4 for an early dinner (5:30) on a Thursday. About 2 hours before our reservation a host called me to confirm the reservation time, ask if we had any specific seating needs and share covid protocols for the restaurant. We knew that parking on Columbus Ave is hard to find so we arrived a few minutes early and luckily found a spot right in front of the restaurant. 

We were one of the first guests of the evening and got a table within perfect view of the kitchen. Our waitress, Gabby, was amazing. She explained that SRV stands for Serene Republic of Venice and gave us some history and background on the restaurant. She was pretty much a sommelier the way she broke down the wine list for us and she was great about guiding us through the menu. She recommended we try the Arsenal menu, which is a tasting menu with chef recommendations of menu and non-menu items. My wife was on the fence about not selecting her own menu items but Gabby persisted so we decided to go with it. Best decision ever! 

We had too many options to list here but you can see the photos . EVERYTHING was delicious and we left waddling from soo much food. Whatever you do..don&apos;t leave without having the tiramisu. Maybe the best I&apos;ve ever had. 5 stars!"
5,"This is my new favorite restaurant in Boston - I&apos;m obsessed with SRV. I&apos;ve had three amazing experiences here from start to finish. 

SRV is in an unexpected area of the south end, near mass ave. But, they have a huge an impressive space that is naturally inviting and warm from the lighting and exposed brick, to the string lit patio. On warm days the restaurant is open to the air, making this a safe place to go during Covid. 

I love this place so much because their wine list incredible and the staff is passionate and knowledgeable. It&apos;s hard to find a place like this where you can&apos;t go wrong on the wine list. It&apos;s curated to perfection and if you like wine or want to learn more about it, this is a great place to go. 

The food is as creative as it is delicious. Everything on the menu is interesting and far from the basic fair you find at so many Italian restaurants. The menu also changes all the time which makes every visit unique. I&apos;ve never had a bad plate here. 

Five stars from start to finish."
5,"This restaurant has been on my bucket list for quite some time and I am so happy that we finally got to check it out. Hence, it was only for an after dinner drink, but it was still amazing. Because of the Pandemic with the COVID-19, the South End was a ghost town and there was only one other couple sitting at the bar. Plus, it was pretty late too. We ordered an espresso martini for my husband and I had an after dinner drink with Mezcal (can&apos;t remember the name). I liked the espresso martini much better, but the ambience set the tone for a romantic evening and a great way to end the night! I can&apos;t wait to come back here for a full dinner experience, maybe for my bday in May. Fun fact: SRV stands for Serene Republic of Venice :) Your welcome...lol!"
5,"I went to SRV this last week and had a fabulous experience. 

We were in the area and arrived nearly an hour before our reservation and they sat us immediately. The restaurant has great ambiance and felt warm and welcoming. 

Our waitress was funny, helpful, and patient with our little group who had no idea where to start. We ended up doing the tasting menu and which is priced amazingly at $48. You don&apos;t get a set menu but you can tell them dietary restrictions or even things you just don&apos;t like and they&apos;re great at accommodating. I was worried with no set menu that maybe we wouldn&apos;t enjoy the food or have enough but by the end I was begging them to slow down because I was so full! Every dish that came out was unique and thoughtful. This is a great place for an upscale looking/feeling/tasting date night at a reasonable price."
5,"Trivia: What doesn&apos;t SRV actually stand for?

You can scroll to the bottom to find out, but my family and I tried this place during thanksgiving and we had a blast. 

We made reservation on Resy and there are both outdoor patio and indoor options. We chose indoors to be warmer. Overall the service, ambiance just gives me a good vibe and the menu is kinda like Italian tapas and there isn&apos;t a single one we didn&apos;t like. 

For the small tapas, there are two pieces per dish but they can make 3 for 3 people too! The meatballs in particular which also came with bread, the mussels are also great as is the duck liver. The smoked cabbage and beef pasta are also delicious. Mixed with their cocktails, the evening was definitely a blast! 

Highly recommend to come visit if you haven&apos;t been. I know i would be back for sure.

Answer: Serene Republic of Venice!"
3,"Arrived here just a few hours after having ramen but we decided to get the arsenale menu or SRV&apos;s version of a tasting menu.

Rather quickly after ordering the meal you are served all 4 of the chicchetti, or small bites. While they were all tasty the flavors were somewhat one dimension as 3/4 dishes had cheese of some sort. Next you get 3 piatti and these surprisingly my favorite here was the salad. It was fresh, was not drowned in sauce and the pancetta added a nice salty component. The two grani entrees were cooked well but the red sauce was almost similar to something from a supermarket jar. Luckily the octopus saved that dish. Finally you get a bit of ice cream for dessert.

The piatti portions were the star of the show while the grani left something to be desired. I would come back if I were in the area again but probably just come for appetizers and skip the pastas. The pace of the meal was a bit weird as right in the beginning you are served everything in quick session like you were being rushed to hurry and finish your meal but then at the end waiting for the check and someone to take your card away it felt as if we were being ignored."
5,"What a hidden gem for amazing Italian food in the South End! Great ambiance - the restaurant has a really cool rustic vibe on the inside, and the back outdoor enclosed patio with the string lights was ideal for date night. Our meal was very delicious light Italian food that presents a nice change of pace to the heavy pasta from the the North End I&apos;m used to.

For your first visit, I highly recommend the chef&apos;s tasting menu. It was the perfect amount of food, very reasonably priced, and really allowed us to experience the different types of dishes SRV had to offer. It starts with 3-4 of the small bites (or chicchetti) that are really just little tastings of meatballs or olives or another tasty snack. Next there were 3 of the piatti plates which are more medium sized. The Risi e Bisi was a definite standout, everything tasted so fresh! The savory portion of the meal was finished by two of the grani entrees. Both were spectacular. Finally, you get a small taste of dessert to cleanse your palate.

The entire menu is very interesting, all the dishes were nice and light but I still left the restaurant full. The service was also fantastic, I&apos;m sure we&apos;ll be back soon!"
5,"This is delayed post from my visit to SRV three weeks ago...

This is one of the best Italian restaurants in the city and has an apartment homey-feel. The furniture surrounding the place seem straight out of Williams Sonoma. The menu is split into three sections - really small plates, small plates, and pasta. For two, I recommend getting a risotto that is a big enough entree for two people, along with two small plates. We had the risotto, salmon, broccoli, and sorbet for dessert and each were on the mark!

The place is popular but big enough where you can usually get a last-minute reservation and it&apos;s a great way to spend a couple hours."
4,"Went on a Thursday night dinner with two friends. Ordered a few bite sized appetizers, a salty cod salad, and two pastas- the octopus one and a chicken risotto. Everything tasted good to me, and the highlight was definitely the pork croquette. So good that we ordered a second round. Drinks were good too. It&apos;s a fancier place with reasonable price."
4,"It&apos;s white truffle season and the risotto with truffles are dahvine.  A good wine caps the meal.   You can also opt for shavings of truffle to your pasta.  Dude, but you&apos;re dining in SRV,  live like a Venetian or Northern Italian and get the risotto with truffles!!    There is an upcharge for the truffle enhancement but well worth the deliciousness if you&apos;re a fan of white truffle.     As in visits ago, plates are very Venetian -- simple and fresh, undeniably typical of the area yet modernized.   The chef/owners here know what they are doing.   Paired with good wine and the dining experience at SRV turns out to be refined and enjoyable yet not as expensive as Venice. 

 I lived in Venice for 3 summers and this place brings me back.

Service was a bit disjointed this time with empty plates left on our table for a loooooong time.  I hope it gets better.  Meno una stella ."
3,Didn&apos;t live up to the hype. Everything was mediocre or subpar. The pancake was absolutely TRAGIC.
5,"Rare to have no complaints. But all around from the ambiance, to service to food, I can&apos;t complain or find a flaw. Granted it was a Wednesday after a snow storm at the bar but still..

Highly recommend the quail egg w/anchovy. So simple but so good. 

The strozzapreti pasta though is second to none- so fresh, unique and a light but great sauce. 

Combine that with great service (at the bar) and decent prices and I will be back frequently."
5,"An Italian fusion resturant with one of the best drinks and italian food ...for some reason I noticed that there&apos;re a lot of italian resturants and coffee shops in Boston. #3fairbanks was my drink and I loved it. The service was really good, we had a reservation and they were a little late and they ended up giving us drinks for free. I got the beef angeloti ( not so sure of the spelling) but it was amazing. Make sure you get the marinated olives there.
Also make sure you make a reservation a day before."
3,"This was a twist on Italian food that I just can&apos;t appreciate. Serving in tapas style, these dishes we ordered was no where near what I was expecting (4 stars by Yelpers). I personally would not waste your time here if you&apos;re looking to fulfill your Italian food craving. 

Baccala Mantecato: 1/5 the bread was soggy/stale, cod didn&apos;t have a good seasoning to it, overall a disappointment.

Casella&apos;s Prosciutto Speciale: 4/5 I liked the butternut squash and overall composition of the plate. However, the bread was just unsatisfactory.

Stuffed Cabbage: 1/5 a recommendation by the waiter.. I cannot say the same. There was probably 2 quarter of an inch cabbage leaf, barely stuffed with anything. This is just nothing that you would expect. 

Octopus: 3/5 decent choice, but you could get this anywhere for even better taste.

Milanese Risotto: 4.5/5 my favorite dish for the night (&amp; a savior). This risotto reminds me of a pumpkin taste (idk why) but it was delicious. Seems like they are best known for their risotto and this was the only thing worthwhile."
2,"I came here expecting to eat some delicious pasta, squid ink perhaps, but I was disappointed with their food. Had dinner with a group of friends here so we ordered a lot of things on the menu. When looking back, nothing stood out and nothing was very good. 

We made a reservation for 7:30, didn&apos;t get seated till 45 mins later. They said it was because the group of people didn&apos;t leave right after they pay. But as a restaurant, shouldn&apos;t you time your reservations accordingly, people don&apos;t just leave right away. They were at least nice enough to offer us one meatball/person, although a drink would have been nicer. 

I&apos;m not gonna talk about their dishes because nothing was that great. Their cocktails weren&apos;t good either, we had to send one back. 

The service was not good.  One waitress was kind of nice, then switched to this big guy, he was rude- he literally pretended not hearing us, I made an eye contact with him asking for something, he just looked away. 

This place was a disappointment. Their rating on yelp does not match the quality of their food and service."
5,"We did the tasting menu and it was fantastic. Great service. I am pregnant and they made me a delicious blueberry, watermelon lemonade mock tail. Great experience."
5,"Dining area was open. Service was impeccable. Friendly staffs. We opted for the tasting menu. The appetizers were amazing tasty. Almost like one of those gastronomic experience places where they create a variety of flavors using various pureed mixes. I would never have thought Cha Siu and mint go so well together! Presentation of food was spot on. Ambience of the restaurant was nice. Open air floor plan with a patio in the back. Light music playing on the background. Price is $$$ but with the combination of interesting, delicious food with excellent staff, it&apos;s one of the few times I think the price is worth it."
4,"Made a reservations for 2 at 5:15 pm. It took about 10 minutes to find street parking. We decided to try the arsenale tasting menu. 

We got:
Cicchetti
-Salted cod black bread 
-Olive fritte
-Polpette meatballs  
-Octopus  

Piatti 
-Lolla rosa salad
-Smoked sea trout
-Ribeye

Pasta
-Rigatoni with oxtail, carrot, broccolini, pecorino
-Pasta with snails and mint 

Dessert
-Brownie with kumquat and espresso gelato 

The cicchetti were all brought out within 3 minutes, which made us feel rushed. However, the rest of the dishes were timed well. 

The piatti were my favorite, but everything was delicious. Ingredients were fresh and worked well with each other. 

When we ordered, the server asked for any allergies or aversions. I looked over the dinner menu and informed her I didn&apos;t like beets and they made sure no dishes had beets. However, the snail pasta that they served was not listed on the menu. I didn&apos;t enjoy the snail texture or taste. I hope in the future they inform you of the dishes on the tasting menu or provide a list of main ingredients they plan on using for the dishes, especially if something is not on the main menu.

Overall great experience and I would definitely visit again!"
5,"Great spot, excellent outdoor seating, service is very good. Brunch menu is excellent, including scrambled eggs, chicories, mascarpone pears and apples, stuck but, etc. Everything is fantastic."
4,Solid food. Great customer service. Place can get busy and be a bit tight inn space but the food is legit.
