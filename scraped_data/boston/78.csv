5,"I love the Plymouth Corn Chowder here and was looking forward to a bread bowl full of it, but during covid, they have slimmed down their menu. Once it&apos;s back on the menu, I definitely recommend it. We were staying around the corner so I ended up back here the day we left. While I&apos;d had lobster, I didn&apos;t have a lobster roll on this trip and needed to remedy that asap.

Luckily, you can get lobster rolls here at 11am! We got one of each and headed out to the tables outside (all the tables etc from the rotunda have been removed for covid). We got a Maine style and a Connecticut style. I normally go for the ME with mayo served cold, but on this chilly day, the warm butter and hot lobster meat may have made me switch sides.

I got an entire lobster dinner at a nice restaurant nearby for a couple more dollars than the rolls here. Needless to say, these rolls are a little pricey, but they are at least packed to the brim with high quality meat. While visiting, this is a great spot to get your lobster roll fix."
4,"I dropped in for a lunch on a chilly day.

I went with a lobster roll and clam chowder in a bread bowl.

The lobster roll was good. Thick chunks of lobster meat in butter, stuffed into a buttered, toasted roll. It&apos;s just a ton of butter - and left my face/beard smelling mighty buttery afterwards. Solid, but I think one and done for me, I&apos;m not running back here for another.

The chowder was also delicious. I kinda wish I hadn&apos;t gotten the bread bowl. In theory it&apos;s a good idea, but it was so cold out. that the bowl and soup around it was cold by the time I got towards the end of it. A warm cup would have probably been better for my situation.

The prices are a little steep. It&apos;s to be expected. It&apos;s in a touristy area, but the quality of the food was solid.

During Covid, it could get a little cramped in the line, luckily there weren&apos;t a ton of people out. The staff are all wearing masks."
5,"BEST clam chowder soup I&apos;ve ever had!

One of my friends bought this to go and we had the soup the next day in New York. But it still tasted wonderful. Clam chunks are big, creamy, and delicious. They also have a lobster roll and soup in a bread bowl which looked really good. For soup, you can pick different container size. To me, medium size was enough to feed 2 people.

Due to the COVID-19, Quincy market is not so crowded. (You can get the food right away without waiting in line) They do have outdoor tables set up.

*Street parking is hard to find - they do have a big garage next to the building but it was expensive. (around $30 per hour) There is a sign on the street where you can park temporarily to pick up the food."
4,"Can&apos;t come to Boston without either trying some chowda or lobstah!

I came here on Friday night in search of my lobster roll and clam chowder combo but they were closed, so I think their hours during COVID vary from what&apos;s listed on Yelp.  However, I came back the next day and were glad to see that they were open for business.

I ordered the manager&apos;s special which comes with a small clam chowder, lobster roll and a small fountain drink.

The clam chowder was creamy and delicious, perfect for warming you up on a cold day.  I opted to get a hot lobster roll (you can also choose to get it cold) which was equally delicious.  They were very generous with the lobster meat and it was settled on top of a soft buttered bun.

It was also Halloween that day.  The staff was all costumed up and they even added some sweet treats to my meal, which I thought was a fun touch!

Would definitely recommend coming here!"
3,"During our trip to Boston, my bf and I knew we had to get some &quot;authentic&quot; seafood at a stall in Quincy Market. After looking online at some options, he settled on Boston Chowda. While passing through, an employee offered us a sample of chowder and it was then that we knew we&apos;d be back!

The chowder was the best thing about this place. We ordered a bread bowl to share. The soup was absolutely wonderful and everything you&apos;d want from a New England classic, but the bread bowl was unnecessary. It wasn&apos;t good bread; just some processed thing that the workers pulled out of a large cardboard box from behind the counter.

The lobster roll was a waste of money. The roll itself was buttery, garlicky texas toast, topped with thick pieces of lobster meat. We got ours hot, so the lobster was warm and buttery too. There&apos;s truly nothing special about this lobster roll; it just tastes like fish and garlic. Definitely not worth the $20 price tag.

Staff were friendly and we wanted so badly to like this, but you won&apos;t miss out if you skip it on your nice trip to Quincy Market."
5,"I&apos;ve visited Boston twice in the last two years and this is my go to spot as soon as I get downtown! I don&apos;t even look at the other lobster roll vendors in the food hall. The BEST New England Clam Chowda I&apos;ve ever had! So creamy and a good amount of clam chunks! It&apos;s the perfect side item. I&apos;m not the biggest fan of the lobster bisque. It&apos;s good, just not my thing. You can&apos;t go wrong with a cold or hot lobster roll. It&apos;s worth trying both to see what flavors you enjoy the most. The staff is always quick and very friendly. Sometimes they even work out a deal with customers!"
5,"This place did not disappoint!! We came here on a Sunday and there&apos;s already a long line by noon. The clam chowder is the best I&apos;ve ever had, although there&apos;s too many potatoes in it. The warm lobster roll was also perfectly seasoned, buttery, and fresh. Would definitely come back if I ever crave a lobster roll!"
5,"My first time visiting Boston &amp; my first lobster roll! The lobster roll here did not disappoint. $22 for a sandwich is a little pricey, but the lobster roll had a generous portion of fresh delicious lobster. The roll was dipped in butter and spices and came with a lemon wedge. We got the special so we choose the lobster bisque as a side. The lobster bisque had great flavor, chunks of lobster in the soup would have made it even better. Since this is in the middle of the food court, there&apos;s no where really to sit. We just sat on the stairs outside of the food court and had our lunch. The man working was very nice."
3,"The chowder was so good! It came in a meal with the butter lobster roll. I enjoyed the chowda waay more than the roll. Locals probably think it&apos;s so basic, but we don&apos;t have anything like this one in Sonoma. I&apos;m definitely a fan of the marketplace in Faneuil Hall. I think this place wouldn&apos;t be the same without Boston Chowda. Walk and eat or find a place to stand. The market was packed both times I went. 

So let&apos;s talk about that roll though. Lots of lobster pieces stacked on each other stuffed in a bread roll. Lightly buttered and some sort of toasty ness from the texture. It all came together pretty well, but it was extremely dry. I was hoping for the lobster roll to be warm and buttery. Sadly not. It is crazy expensive too. $25 for this meal. Not worth it. Next time I can ditch the lobster roll and cut the cost by two hundred percent."
5,"Hands down best clam chowder I&apos;ve tried. The soup tasted incredibly savory and fresh (because it&apos;s seafood, freshness is key). Came with a packet of oyster crackers.

They were giving out free samples of the clam chowder so if you&apos;re on the fence about getting it, see if you can&apos;t try it first. I know it won&apos;t disappoint ;).

For me, the small at $5.99 was just the right size for a mid-day snack and it&apos;s also pretty affordable. If only I had more room in my stomach, I would have definitely gotten it in a bread bowl, yum!

They also have lobster rolls and various types of seafood pies, although the lobster roll is a little outside of my price range. Regardless, I&apos;ll definitely have to come back and try some of their other menu items."
5,"One of the few food stalls still open in Quincy Market, and so happy it is!! One of the best lobster rolls and clam chowder I&apos;ve ever had!! Rolls are buttery and flavorful, and the soup is warm and comforting. Unfortunately the seating area upstairs is closed, however there are tables and chairs scattered outside in the yard. Watch out for the hungry pigeons looking to steal your lobster rolls :)"
4,"While visiting Boston in a really chilly weather, we were feeling like getting a nice cup of soup. What&apos;s better than soup? Chowder! What&apos;s better than a cup of soup? Chowder in a bread bowl!!! 

You have some good options when you are at Faneuil Hall, and I heard Boston Chowda does really nice bread bowl. So, we decided to get one from there. Also, their lobster roll on the display looked amazing, so we decided to get that too. 

We got the New England Clam Chowda in Bread Bowl. The bread bowl was a nice size, and it was surprisingly good. Chowder was good too, lots of little potatoes. Creamy and comforting, great on a cold day! 

Hot Buttered Lobster Roll is their signature sandwich. It didn&apos;t look like the display, the one on display had maybe twice as much lobster meat in there... Anyways, it was sooo buttery! It still had a nice amount of lobster meat, soft and juicy. However, one of the lobster meat had big shells attached to it, which was annoying... Other than that, it was very tasty! 

It was the perfect lunch for us, exactly what we wanted. The price was affordable too. Nice spot to try some Boston lobster roll and clam chowder!"
4,"We were planning a trip to Faneuil Hall and once I saw that Boston Chowda Company served bread bowls, I was in. We arrived around 10:00 AM right before the huge lunch rush so we were able to order and get served in about 5 minutes. Once you leave with your meal, your best bet is to immediately turn to the right and grab one of the standing tables. It&apos;s less crowded and still easy to enjoy your chowder at. 

My New England clam chowder was really satisfying. It was piping hot and chock full of clams in every bite. The bread bowl was the perfect vessel for every creamy bite. The bread bowl had a nice chew to it and tasted freshly baked.

My boyfriend had the lobster bisque, and while tasty, he didn&apos;t find even the smallest piece of lobster in it. I don&apos;t know if they just purée the lobster into it and that&apos;s why there were no chunks, or maybe he was just unlucky.

Our total for two bread bowls and two fountain sodas was around $25. We were definitely stuffed after, so I would say this is one of the better &quot;bang for your buck&quot; restaurants at Faneuil Hall."
4,"no trip to boston (or the atlantic northeast for that matter) is complete without a cup of new england clam chowdah!  i decided to wait until after i finished the (boston) marathon before treating myself to this bostonian specialty.

hubby ordered a hot buttered maine lobster roll, i ordered a large cup of clam chowder soup, and we chose the 3 cheese macaroni pie to share.  since it was quite late for dinner, there was practically no one here, hence no line, and only a few minutes wait to have our food served warm.  since this vendor is at fanueil hall, you order and sit in the common area with everyone else...the true communal experience!

i was famished, since i&apos;d run nearly 5 hours (not including walk time to/from start/finish area), through the lunch hour, and my last full meal was breakfast, about 12 hrs earlier!  i practically inhaled the chowdah and ate more than my share of the mac &apos;n cheese, but i gotta say, it was absolutely scrumptious and i enjoyed every bite.

some things are worth the wait, and for me, having these classic new england comfort food dishes was definitely worth waiting til my last evening in beantown.  until next time, i will be dreaming about the creamy clam chowdah and cheesy mac pie!"
4,"This was my fist time visiting this specific place and came here specifically for the lobster rolls and and I was not disappointed. 

It is located inside the Faneuil Hall, I have been there in the past but never inside and I heard and seen the reviews and I was glad I tried it. It is on the pricier side but I was out there visiting and wanted to taste the lobster rolls. I also ordered a side of clam chowder, nothing special but still very good and tasty. 

Since the Faneuil Hall is big we found seating on the second floor it was quite and we had some natural sunlight come in thru the big windows which kept us nice and warm. 

There&apos;s plenty of places to try lobsters roll inside the market but I am glad I tried this one in particular. The are fast and good."
1,"From the reviews on Yelp for your restaurants, it appears that when people buy your soups in person they are pretty good, but I am not that person as I live in Florida.  I bought your Gumbo from a seafood company near me and was saving it for a cold evening.  Well, the cold evening finally arrived and I thawed the gumbo looking forward to the shrimp &amp; sausage in the soup.  However, when I poured it into a bowl I didn&apos;t see any shrimp or sausage.  I went through the whole bowl and finally found 2 small chunks of sausage &amp; 2 little tiny shrimp.  The rest of the soup was nothing but rice &amp; soup.  I don&apos;t know where the hell you have eaten gumbo before but you need to go somewhere else.  This is really bad, so bad that I actually took a video showing what I found; too bad you don&apos;t have any way for me to upload it.  Now that I look at your container I see that the #1 ingredient is VEGETABLE STOCK, followed by SHRIMP (NOPE), then RICE (LOTS more rice than shrimp), TOMATO (I saw 2 little red things which might have been tomato skin), then SAUSAGE (again, two little chunk, each the size of the nail on my little finger), then ONION, CELERY, SUNTAN PEPPER (?), OKRA, and FLOUR.  I sincerely looked and didn&apos;t see little or big pieces of any of that stuff. The ingredients closed with a bunch of spices which I doubt because the whole thing was extremely bland.  Don&apos;t you have anyone eating this off of your production line to make sure it actually TASTES LIKE GUMBO?"
4,"Braved thru this bustling place and found this packed eatery.  It&apos;s one of the booths amongst many from side to side down this hall.  Ordered the clam chowder and the crab salad sandwich.  Next had to find a place to sit and enjoy it.  That was a bit tricky as everyone was looking for seats too.  It was like a free for all, whereby as soon as you spotted open seats, you had better rush over and sit down quickly.

The crab salad sandwich had a good amount of crab in it, with some lettuce on a buttered bun.  The clam chowder was not too thin, not too thick, just right in consistency.  It also had a good amount of clams and was very tasty.  What a way to start off our Boston trip, with good food."
5,"We had clam chowder in a bread bun course. They say if the spoon stands up straight in the center off the bowl then it&apos;s good because it&apos;s nice and thick as it should be.
Served hot and fresh for $10.00 it&apos;s a great deal.
There are table a little to the left of Boston Chowda where you can enjoy your meal."
5,They have the best hot buttered lobster rolls and clam chowda in town. Also the staff are helpful and funny. They have fast service.
4,This spot was our first experience trying a hot buttered Maine lobster roll in Boston and it didn&apos;t disappoint! Service was quick with socially distant lines and workers were wearing masks. We enjoyed our first lobster roll (the lobster was warmed up and the bun lightly toasted) alongside a solid cup of New England Clam Chowder!
