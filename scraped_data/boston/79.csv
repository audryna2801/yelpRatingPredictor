5,"I would argue best pizza on the North End. I go back and forth between here and Regina&apos;s. This is a casual stop on Salem street, cash or card here. They make all the pizza fresh throughout the day. I love the pepperoni and ricotta. My wife loves the bbq chicken pizza, also BOMB. Fire. They only serve whole pizzas or slices, and the slices are really half the pizza LOL. Essentially 2 slices you can&apos;t have half as pictured. 
Would 100% recommend. The people that own it and work here are super nice. 
You can sit in here during Covid right now! So that&apos;s a plus."
5,"Quick, convenient, well-priced. I prefer classic cheese but they have all different kinds of options for slices and the slices are pretty large. Thank you for being my go-to during quarantine!"
2,"Unfortunately we were disappointed with Ernestos, the pizza was lacking flavor and  was unimpressive. We did have a speedy delivery, took just under an hour (were staying at a hotel) but we weren&apos;t impressed."
5,"We took the Boston Pizza Tour and this was our first stop. Honestly, it should have been the last because the pizza was a showstopper. They were all good, but Ernesto&apos;s was the group favorite. So much so that we were only in town for a couple days and we went back for seconds. The place is tiny so don&apos;t expect a place to sit at busy times. If you&apos;re doing pizza by the slice they have plenty of options in the case but I stuck with classic pepperoni or cheese. Also, I will say that on the tour they gave us a whole fresh pie for our group vs reheated slices and it was noticeably different. When we all came back for slices, we wished that we got a fresh pie and waited for it. After growing up in Boston, I&apos;m always looking for something that compares now that I&apos;m in SC. If I could replicate the perfect pizza for me to take back home it would be this one for sure."
5,"Such great pizza, small building hard to find but usually small businesses are the best places to eat. The pizza dough was soft and crunchy"
3,The problem was the pizza was not tasty at all and the crust was superthin and wilty. The service and variety make it 3 stars but not impressed by what should have been a super tasty slice. Also their prices have gone up a slice and a can of pepsi (no coke) which I hate $8.53. Won&apos;t be back.
5,Delicious!!! We got an amazing slice (well technically 2 slices) of the sausage ricotta. It was sooo yummy. I love the smoky flavor that the oven brings into the pizza. I can&apos;t wait to go back and try all of the different slices!
5,That Big Mac pizza was out of this world!!! I am a cheese or pepperoni fella but tonight I went off the grid so happy I did wow.
4,"First time trying out Ernestos.  I got a cheese pizza and it was cooked and ready in under 15 minutes.  I always go for a fresh pie when trying out a new place.  I thought the pizza was overall nice.  The crust is nice and crispy, but light and fluffy.  I will say it was a tad on the floppy side.  I feel like something was just missing.  A little more &quot;zing&quot; to the sauce and maybe a touch of salt.  It looked better than it tasted.  Don&apos;t get me wrong! Super solid and I would go back.. it was just lacking a little something to really give me the wow effect!"
4,"I love that Ernesto&apos;s offers reasonably priced pizza by the slice! Now, the $5-7 &quot;slice&quot; I&apos;m talking about is actually about the size of 2 regular sized pieces of pizza...so much so that they actually slice it up into 2 pieces for you (ha!). It&apos;s enough for a decently filling meal. I came at a weird time in the afternoon (around 2pm) and even though it was reheated, it tastes just as fresh as coming out of the oven, and you don&apos;t have to brave the line at Regina&apos;s to get a piece just as delicious."
5,"1st stop in our North End Pizza Tour! The pizza slices here are gigantic !!! Definitely needs to be cut in half we had the bbq slice, sweet sauce and crispy cheese."
4,"I&apos;ve been here twice so far... is it the best pizza I&apos;ve ever had? No. Still, don&apos;t let that distract you from the fact that it&apos;s still darn good, and a great value to boot! Haters gonna hate, but it is downtown Boston, so I think the price is reasonable.

I&apos;ve had to opportunity to try the cheeseburger and  Margherita pizzas.

I will repeat what all most all of the other people have stated: The &quot;slices&quot; or a quarter of a pizza, and a large one at that. At the same time the pizza is thin, so you&apos;re not left feeling bloated or as if you&apos;ve overeaten. Being thin also helps keep the tomato sauce, cheese, and crust somewhat in balance. To be fair, though, I would have preferred a little more cheese and tomato sauce, as is the case with Neapolitan pizza.

A note regarding heft, I found the cornicione (edges) too big relative to the rest of the pizza. Furthermore, they weren&apos;t exciting enough to warrant being eaten almost like a breadstick, and I&apos;m not one of those people who leaves pizza crusts uneaten. An option of dipping sauce would be great! 

Toppings were pretty good! The cheese was solid, and the tomato sauce definitely tasted &quot;real&quot;, and not from a can. With both the Margherita and cheeseburger, the quantity was spot on. The slices were neither weighed down, nor did they experience a dearth of toppings. My gripe, however, is regarding the cheeseburger.

Tomato sauce, especially when it&apos;s real has a fair bit of acidity. Pickles by themselves are fine, but added to a pizza created a very high acid content. My advice is to simplify, and allow fresh ingredients shine on their own: especially onions, lettuce, maybe tomato slices. 

Finally, those dang slices... I&apos;m a guy who likes to mix it up. Allowing actual slices (1/8th instead of 1/4) would allow me to do more of what I love: mixing and matching. On the other hand,they&apos;d lose the title of largest slice, and I don&apos;t want to be the one telling Ernesto&apos;s how to run their shop. A solution would be to bring some friends to come with! Who&apos;s down?

Overall, if you&apos;re looking for piping hot fresh amazing pizza, this may not be your best bet. On the other hand, if you&apos;re looking for something quick, yummy, filling, and a great value, then this is your place. The slices reheat quick, come on down (and take me with you)!"
1,Got sick after eating a slice. It was definitely the pizza that got me sick. I&apos;d skip this place.
1,"How disappointing. 

My favorite place for pizza in the North End or should I say used to be.  Living just 2 blocks away there is a multitude of places to pick when going for pizza in the North End and that&apos;s why I am so disappointed in their lack of empathy for a customer that was screwed by the company they use to deliver my pizzas. Disappointed in their attitude. 

Ordered, confirmed and never delivered. They blame the delivery company and basically insulted us with their condescending attitude and refusal to have a manger answer our call. No manager present which begs me to ask if a serve safe food certificate is on site too? I spoke to the delivery people and they were much nicer and apologetic. Ernestos wouldn&apos;t offer to remake the pizza. 

I&apos;ll let this go because of the pandemic. 1 person is in school online full time, one works for a health care / hospital corporation and both were hungry and looking forward to dinner at 6:30 when the delivery was to occur. When a customer calls and listens to an Ernestos employee, who really could not care about a customer, a customer finds a new place. We used to go twice a week for the last few months and before the pandemic once a week for the last few years.  Disheartening to say the least.

Pizzeria Regina is steps away and now has my business, I hope it gets yours too."
5,"I&apos;m a tough pizza critic normally because I&apos;ve spent a lot of time in NY growing up and I always say nothing compares to NY pizza but Ernesto&apos;s absolutely impressed me. Positively delicious pizza thin yet sturdy body to it with thick tasty crust and the perfect ratio of sauce, cheese, and toppings. Very fair pricing along with big pieces plus they always have fresh slices ready to go at any given moment."
5,"Well worth the trip to the North End. Order to go and go sit in the park to eat.

The Special pizza has just the right veggies and pepperoni. The crust has just the right crisp. Plus they sell pizza by the slice. Would definitely go back!"
4,"Two other patrons around 11:30AM on a Saturday. 

Pros:
-Slices! 
-Some seating

-
Cheese slice ($4.75 for &quot;one&quot; slice, which is actually two)
Crispy (but the crust is doughy) with a sweet sauce. Couldn&apos;t really taste the cheese and a bit on the oilier side, but definitely still good!"
5,"I have to admit, Ernesto&apos;s was really excellent. Friendly service, welcoming mood. OMG, their Shrimp Scampi Pizza was absolutely yummy, such a wonderful dish with magnificent flavors. The staff was very warm and welcoming. We loved Ernesto&apos;s."
5,"I have to admit, Ernesto&apos;s is actually pretty darn cool. Such a great atmosphere. Everything that I have already tried has been really tasty. The staff are so polite and nice, it makes coming here fun. Ernesto&apos;s: Go here, go here now."
4,"Best slice spot in the north end and has been for years. Good service and they&apos;ve been there a while. Good pizzas and individual sized calzones. In 15 years of going here, I have never tried an arancini, and probably won&apos;t. But the pizza is great and worth whatever small line may exist. Or just call it in, tourist."
