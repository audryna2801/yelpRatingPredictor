5,"Georgetown Cupcake continues to be my all time favorite bakery in Boston! I purchased a half dozen box of cupcakes for same day pick up - they&apos;ve updated their policy due to COVID. I ordered in the morning and scheduled for pick up in the afternoon.

As I arrived, the front section is blocked off, leaving just enough space for one person to order. An employee immediately greeted and helped me with my pick up order.

I ordered a custom assortment with the following flavors: 

- Chocolate Ganache
- Mocha Fudge
- Red Velvet
- Salted Caramel
- Chocolate S&apos;more Cheesecake

My favorite flavor was red velvet - the perfect amount of cake and frosting. My least favorite was chocolate s&apos;more cheesecake; it was a bit drying and lacked s&apos;mores flavor."
5,AMAZING!!! I went during valentines weekend and they had the cutest Valentine&apos;s Day themed cupcakes. They were delicious. I was very amazed because I ordered the cupcakes at around 4:50 for 5pm pick up and my box was ready and waiting for me as soon as I entered. They&apos;re being very good with covid because they only allow one person in the store at a time to pick up.
5,"Was craving some cupcakes a day before and decided to walk over to the store the next day. I haven&apos;t been to this store in a while and during this pandemic it&apos;s a whole lot different story. Everything changes especially on how stores treat costumers. It&apos;s not like the normal going in to the stores and ordering anymore. Lines are less and so are the employees. 
When I got there I thoughts I was just going to order normally. But the doors are only open for people who are actually picking up the orders they placed ahead of time. There was a number posted in the door with instructions. So I decided to call them and picked what flavors I wanted from the menu. Some of the flavors are sold out so I just bought the ones that are available. Got a box of 6 cupcakes which I paid like $20. It was ready within 5 mins which wasn&apos;t too bad."
4,"The cupcakes are dynamite.  We got the Georgetown Cupcake&apos;s 2020 Season&apos;s Greetings Dozen which included
3 chocolate cupcakes with vanilla frosting
3 Red Velvet cupcakes with vanilla frosting 
3 Chocolate cupcakes  with whipped chocolate ganache frosting
3 vanilla cupcakes with vanilla frosting, 
All cupcakes were beautifully decorated with fondant decorations and it made a fabulous gift for the holidays. 
The cupcakes are a solid 5 stars and are incredibly enjoyable! Each flavor was my favorite. Directions are spot-on in terms of thawing times to best enjoy these cupcakes.

I was getting this shipped. The only reason I took a star off is the tracking number was not given to me at the time of order. Had to send a separate email to the customer service asking for a tracking number. And they were expected to give it to us end of business day which didn&apos;t happen. Took another email to the customer service to obtain the tracking number. The packaging itself was nicely done. I just hope they can provide the tracking number at the time of order and avoid additional hassle."
3,"I was walking by on a Friday morning and stopped to look at the flavors of the day (posted in the window along with ordering instructions).  I noticed that coconut was a Friday flavor, and since I had a fellow coconut-loving friend coming over that night, I figured two cupcakes were in order.  I called the number posted on the window, placed my order (have your credit card ready) and the box was placed on the counter in a few minutes which was my &quot;signal&quot; to come in for pickup.

Boxed nicely in their pink box, so 5 stars for the presentation but the cupcake itself was a bit dry and lacking in flavor, which was odd.  The frosting was nice - and lots of it, which is always a bonus - but the cake part really could have been a coconut flavor, plain white or something else... we didn&apos;t detect coconut flavor in it."
5,"Thank you Georgetown Cupcake for making my daughters birthday special when I am so far away and cannot be with her! 
Sent these amazing birthday cupcakes to her that were absolutely Amazing she said !!!"
5,"The cupcakes here are so pretty- they are more a piece of art than a bakery item! As of early February, they had beautiful specially decorated cupcakes for Valentines Day! The cupcake itself is smallishly hidden underneath a an oversized cream cheese frosting topping. The cupcake flavor and texture is good- a bit denser than other cupcakes."
5,"Ordered the strawberry cupcake and strawberry chocolate lava cake. 

First time I&apos;ve ever tried a strawberry cupcake and it was fantastic!! Pieces of strawberry baked into the vanilla cupcake topped with a strawberry frosting. I could really taste the strawberry flavor and it wasn&apos;t too sweet. 

Strawberry chocolate lava cake was also good but the chocolate overpowers the strawberry somewhat. Still enjoyable but if you love strawberry the vanilla cupcake is the way to go."
4,"Passed by Georgetown Cupcakes on the way to an early dinner so dropped by to get cupcakes. Due to COVID, all orders are placed online for pickup. It was about 5:30pm and there were quite a few flavors already sold out. We went with key lime and pb&amp;j.

Absolutely loved the pbj one! The key lime was good, but I wouldn&apos;t get it again. I&apos;ve heard good things about their lavender earl grey. Sadly that seems to be a monthly special in April so I will be back then lol.

The cupcakes overall aren&apos;t too sweet. I didn&apos;t feel like I  was getting diabetes like some other places. Is it better than other cupcake places? For Boston, maybe? I didn&apos;t get a chance to try any others. I went to Maine afterwards though and there was a bomb dessert place with what I thought would be a normal chocolate cupcake but no! It blew all of my past cupcake experiences out of the water!"
5,"BEST CUPCAKES EVER!
Covid has turned 2020 into a dumpster fire. But one of the best things to come of this hot mess... I was one of a handful of people in the physical Boston office when a vendor sent us Georgetown cupcakes, which meant I got to try TWO!

Let it be known, I&apos;m a cream cheese frosting kind of girl. And Georgetown makes the MOST AMAZING cream cheese frosting and (no shocker here) they also make an amazing cheesecake &apos;cupcake&apos;. 

Frosting was perfect.  Sweet, but the cream cheese flavor was definitely there. Really it is perfection. 

Now the cake! Wowza! Usually vanilla cake I&apos;m like meh... whatever. Not their vanilla. It is amazing. Dense and moist and flavorful!  

After trying two cupcakes. One cream cheese the other vanilla, I was talking a big cupcake game about how amazing they were. Apparently I was talking A LOT about the cupcakes, as after a really harsh week, the team I work with SURPRISED ME WITH A DOZEN!  I have never been caught so off guard!

Ok. So I&apos;m in heaven now. One tiny disappointment. I wasn&apos;t aware the cupcakes had been delivered (obviously as it was a surprise). They may have been sitting in the heat for an hour or so and it kind of melted them a bit. A few hours or so in the fridge later.... they were still amazing, but not as beautiful as they could have been. I&apos;m working my way through them. We have yet to be disappointed. Every single cake is amazing. 

Georgetown cupcake. YOU ARE AMAZING!"
2,"I used to LOVE their cupcakes. My order today was awful - super stale, cold like fridge - not sure what happened but disappointed to see quality has declined so much."
5,I placed an online order and the process was very smooth. The day I went to pick it up they were very busy with a long line. Even though the wait was long and cold the cupcakes were definitely worth it since they were so delicious. They even included a cute little note since it was a gift for someone. 10/10 for sure!
5,"This place never disappoints me. This is definitely a treat after a long day or a long week. Pretty pricey for a 4-5 bite treat if you ask me, but I get sucked in every time. 

I&apos;ve been coming here for years now and get a box or two for every friend&apos;s birthday and I always get blamed for getting them hooked. 

I would suggest coming in the morning/early afternoon as they run out of flavors pretty quickly. Closer to night time they normally have lines out the door. They have such a large selection to choose from, sometimes it&apos;s overwhelming. But my go to is their red velvet cupcake. Their cream cheese frosting didn&apos;t sound great to me when I first heard of it, but once I had it with the red velvet? WOW! I was literally speechless. There has not been an order I&apos;ve placed where I haven&apos;t gotten at least 2 of them. 

I emailed back and forth with an employee there to place an order of hbd cupcakes for my bf and she offered to write hbd on the cupcakes free of charge, which was really nice! I was able to place the order in advance and just pay for it when I got to the cashier. This way I made sure I had the flavors I wanted even thought I came to pick them up in the evening. They let you look at it and check out the presentation of the customized cupcakes before they box it up for you. 

My boyfriend ended up placing a dozen of cupcakes for me for Valentine&apos;s Day. The packaging was literally beautiful. The only thing is I wish there was an option for him to pick which cupcakes he wanted to include. Too bad I was only able to get 1 red velvet lol.

Not many seats so grab it and put it in a box and save it for when you get home. Definitely savor this bad boy lol... maybe not with people watching you while they are walking in though. Haha."
5,"I absolutely love cupcakes and Georgetown is hands down my favorite cupcake bakery to date. This place has just the right amount of flavor variety -- it&apos;s not too much to overwhelm you, but enough to make you think about which flavors you really want. They have daily specials and rotating seasonal flavors to keep things exciting. It has the perfect frosting to cake ratio, delicious buttercream and cream cheese frosting that isn&apos;t overly sweet, and a nicely moist cake. It seems pricey for a couple of bites, but rust me... it&apos;s worth every single penny!!!

P.S.
Recommend going earlier in the day before they run out of flavors or pre-ordering to avoid the line!"
5,"Coming from the west coast, I&apos;ve always been a fan of Sprinkles Cupcakes however once I moved to Boston, I discovered the gem that is Georgetown. Compared to Sprinkles, I actually find Georgetown to be a little more balanced in regards to the frosting:cake ratio so that&apos;s definitely a plus for me. They have a wide range of flavors and will also offer seasonal/limited edition flavors so keep an eye out for those as well! I&apos;ve actually placed multiple large orders from Georgetown before and had them shipped to another state with every cupcake perfectly intact once it reached its recipient which earned them extra points! They&apos;re great as a gift for a special occasion or as a &quot;treat yourself&quot; moment so I highly recommend giving their cupcakes a try if you haven&apos;t already as it&apos;s one of the best in the area!"
4,"When you walk into this modern bakery, you cannot help but smile. You may be apprehensive at the thought of spending $3.50 for a cupcake. I admit it is a bit expensive. Yet, when you take your first bite out of a red velvet or cookies and cream cupcake, you realize that it&apos;s worth ever penny. From the creamy decadent frosting to the rich moist cake, you quickly fall into a sugar coma and welcome diabetes with arms wide open. You only live once , so make sure you stop by next time you are on Newbury. You will not regret it.

P.S. You should check out their Twitter account and stop by in the morning to get the free cupcake of the day! You&apos;re welcome!"
4,"I find myself here more often than I should be, but the cupcakes here are crazy good. They&apos;re $3+ a pop but some are so decadent that one cupcake can feel like a huge piece of cake. 

I&apos;ve tried several flavors here and some of my faves include the Key Lime and the Cookies and Cream Cheesecake. The cheesecake cupcakes are super good because they have the delicious &quot;crust&quot; on the bottom of the cupcake that you would see on a normal cheesecake. Definitely worth a visit if you&apos;re trying to treat yourself a bit!"
2,"I really wanna give this place four or five stars, but I was really disappointed when I came here.

Pros:
+ Great variety of cupcakes
+ Amazing cupcakes - a little drier on the outside, but they have an amazing molten chocolate center

Cons:
- Limited seating inside
- Cupcakes in bags, napkins, or boxes? What the heck --- At least give plates for cupcakes that people want to eat in doors
- Tables were a mess. Of course they only have two tables in the restaurant. It sucks to get your cupcake &quot;on a napkin&quot; and not be able to eat it indoors because no one bothered cleaning the table.
- Pricey - So, I think I would have been more ok with the price if they tables were clean or if people just weren&apos;t rude about the cupcakes. I don&apos;t think this place is always worth the $4 per cupcake."
5,"Hands down the greatest cupcake I&apos;ve ever had. This location is just off of Boylston Street in Boston in a quieter side street. As soon as you walk in the colorful, mouth watering displays immediately catch your eye and make it hard to resist sampling something!!! 

Ordered a dozen of these to take home, mainly for others to enjoy, but my &apos;Mint Chocolate Fudge&apos; was easily the best cupcake I&apos;ve ever tried. Such beautiful presentation, fresh and fluffy and not overly sweet...it was simply perfection! 

A must try if in the area!"
5,"Amazing cupcakes! My personal favorite is Red Velvet but Key Lime Pie and Unicorn ones are amazing as well.  
Best cupcakes I&apos;ve tried so far and it&apos;s hard to please me with sweet things haha. Recommend"
