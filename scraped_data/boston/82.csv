5,"You MUST come here if you&apos;re visiting Boston. This is one of the coolest restaurants I&apos;ve been to, in terms of the food, the decor, music, and overall vibe.

I ordered the tofu bao, a Sapporo, and the shadowless fries. The tofu bao was sooo good. The tofu was really crispy, the bao was soft and slightly sweet, and there was a sweet and savory sauce and cilantro inside. The shadowless fries were even better, you have to order these if you come. These cheesy fries came with mapo tofu on top and we&apos;re very flavorful and the perfect texture.

The best thing about this place was the atmosphere. The music made it feel as though I was at a cool underground nightclub, the walls were painted with a mural (which I was told is a rotating mural). For covid, they&apos;ve also put up plastic dividers between tables for added safety. I would 100% recommend everyone come try the food here!"
5,Absolutely AMAZING. I had low expectations ordering take out from this restaurant but the food and the staff has exceeded everything! I have ordered take out not knowing it was a bar but the staff was so welcoming and friendly!! Little did I expect bar food to be delicious without being under the influence !! I have taken out my food &amp; arrived at my airbnb 30 mins later and my noodles were so fresh &amp; my chicken was flavorful.. I&apos;ve paired my chicken with jasmine rice and it was heavenly. I will be back to dine in soon!!
5,Came here pre-COVID while on a trip to Boston. I&apos;m generally not a fan of Asian fusion but this place did it right. Cool vibe matched with cool food and cool people. Also got the shojonator burger along with the fries and it was so good!
4,"Cool spot in Boston chinatown. it&apos;s asian fusion, a dark bar vibe. I would recommend sitting away from the bar as it gets pretty loud in that area.

It can get packed so i recommend making a reservation.  Most of the plates are for sharing and the portions are decent.

The menu isnt very big, but they have a few good options. Kimchi fried rice, pork belly dumplings and miso hungry are my recommendations. I wouldn&apos;t order the frieds or the ribs again, they were ok, but not worth ordering again.

It&apos;s a bit on the pricey side, but I find that to be the case with most trendy spots in Boston."
3,"Pros:
- Friendly Staff
- Burger was Good

Cons: 
- Kimchi Fried Rice was Okay
- Chicken Bao was Okay
- Duck Fries to Mushy"
5,"DINNER REVIEW

Came here after an event in their event space upstairs. We had some of the apps and loved them so much that we wanted the full experience. We had to wait 30 minutes or so on a Thursday night but they had pretty fast turnover.

This place is dimly-lit and loud but smells amazing from all the food you&apos;re surrounded by. 

If the idea of Asian Fusion Bar Food sounds good to you (like it does to me), then this is the place for you. I think I could have ordered every single thing on the menu but here is what we got:

Wu-Tang Tiger Style Ribs - fall of the bone, sticky, sweet, and spicy. These are a must-get

Kimchi Fried Rice - can&apos;t go wrong with fried rice and kimchi

Korean Steak Tartar - a delicious tartar with these chewy yet crunchy scallion pancakes to scoop them up with

Grilled Kung Pao Chicken Sandwich - a little difficult to share but it&apos;s stacked high with moist chicken thighs and covered in a fried peanut aioli. Reminds you exactly of kung pao chicken.

The portions are much bigger than your average small plates restaurant so 2 each is more than enough. This place has great value for the quality and quantity of food you get.

I will definitely be back to try more things on the menu."
5,"I have to preface this review with the fact that Asian is my least favorite cuisine. We ended up here because it&apos;s my boyfriend&apos;s favorite, so I figured I could venture outside of my comfort zone a bit, and OMG I&apos;m so glad I did. I&apos;m actually so sad that I don&apos;t live in Boston because I would go here at least every month (maybe more but the $$$). 

I&apos;ll start with the overall atmosphere - it&apos;s super loud. It&apos;s a small space with a lot of people, a cool bar area and loud hip hop music blaring over the speaker. I wouldn&apos;t go here if you&apos;re trying to really get to know somebody! We were seated at a table next to the bar and had some annoying bar patrons standing basically at our table. Next time I&apos;d ask to be a little further away from the bar because it gets very crowded. The high tops have hooks under them to hang jackets or purses, which is so underrated and a great touch. 

We each wanted a cocktail but couldn&apos;t decide, so our server helped us out with some suggestions. I had the Gin Gin Mule and my boyfriend had something that I don&apos;t see on the online menu and can&apos;t remember the name! The Mule was really good - they use homemade ginger beer, which I love. My boyfriend enjoyed his too (sorry for the lack of details). 

This place is small plate/shareable style. Our server recommended 3-4 dishes for the two of us. We started with 3 and ended up ordering a fourth. My thoughts on all 4 below. 

Bulgogi Beef Baos - incredible, 5/5. The beef was tender and the flavor was amazing. The bun was sweet and not too thick that it took away from the meat and toppings. This comes with 2 small baos. 

Pork Belly Dumplings - very good, 4/5. The hoisin sauce was the best part. Dumplings themselves were good and had a nice flavor, the pork was almost mashed up inside, which was great for absorbing the sauce. I was worried because the description says jalape√±os, but it wasn&apos;t spicy at all!

Miso Hungry - 50/5. Literally if you&apos;re only going to eat one thing, make it this. Other reviews described this as an Asian carbonara and they&apos;re spot on. I love Italian food and this is by far the best &quot;carbonara&quot; I&apos;ve ever had. 

Wu-Tang Tiger Style Ribs - 4/5, really good but a little fatty. The sauce on them is super tasty though."
5,"This is a solid 5 star review for Shojo&apos;s menu. I was blown away by Shojo&apos;s play on fusion Asian cuisine. First recommendation of must try is a spin on carbonara called Miso Hungry. This dish is one hell of an umami bomb - ramen noodles, with miso based sauce, and beautiful yolk on top with fresh scallions at every bite. The flavors are bold, and delicious. Second recommendation for fellow foodies out there is their beef tartare with scallion pancakes. The sauce mix on the beef tartare is spectacular! pair them with bites of crunchy, delicious pancake that comes on the side .. It&apos;s so good I almost forgot that its&apos; not seafood. It taste like poke. 

If you have extra room (which is a must), don&apos;t forget to try their Shojunator medium rare burger with perfectly steamed white buns, and shallot based sauce and pickled vegetables. 

The art decor inside is very cool. One thing to point out that can be interesting for some who&apos;s looking for sensory dining experience, Shojo might be that place. There&apos;s not very much lighting in this restaurant which left the experience mostly for your taste buds. I love everything about Shojo. They were voted boston&apos; best three consecutive years. In the heart of Chinatown Boston, this is one hell of a gem you won&apos;t want to miss out on!"
2,"I had fish burger.
First of all food is so small for price.
Secondly the place claims its Asian fusion with Japanese. False. It is very American.
I won&apos;t come back."
4,"In Chinatown a great place for drinks or food. Asian-inspired means there will be a unique twist on it compared to a set Asian restaurant. I&apos;ve been here multiple times and the food is great!

Really like their spicy cocktails. Friendly waitstaff and super quick with your order."
2,"Came here on a Saturday night with a friend around 5:45pm and was seated right away. We ordered the Kimchi Fried Rice, Squashonara and Duck Fat Fries to share, which was more than enough.

While the food was good, the service was not so much. We had to basically chase down our waiter to order food and get our check (and give him our check). Even though we would make eye contact and try to wave him over, he ignored us for at least 10 minutes. I can understand since it got busier since we had sat down but it was still frustrating.

I also want to add that whenever one of the waiters (always a male) came to fill our waters, they would completely lean over us and sometimes brush us in a way that made me incredibly uncomfortable.

Considering the service, I definitely wouldn&apos;t come back"
3,"Came here on a Saturday night past 10pm and it was pretty packed. We ordered the Duck Fat Fries and a cold brew Vodka tea. Both were decent and for a person who does not really drink, the cold Vodka tea was delicious. I just thought the service could have been better. It took way too long for things to come out, it was hard to track down our waiter and overall the restaurant gave a night scene kinda feel which is fine, but usually in those places, service is hard to get and noise is beyond loud."
3,"I stand my ground on the food not being up to par, at least for my standards. But I do appreciate the owner/manager reaching out and trying to make things right. That in itself shows how much these people care for their business and customers, and I can only hope that in time their in house employees (who yes, were absolutely horrid when I dined in) and their food can improve tremendously."
3,"Fun, hip environment to have some Asian fusion tapas, but I wouldn&apos;t say I&apos;m dying to come back. We ordered the kimchi fried rice, bulgogi beef baos, Wu-Tang Tiger Style ribs, and the salt &amp; pepper calamari. My favorite was the kimchi fried rice. The portion was large enough to split among myself and two of my friends. It has a nice spicy flavor and the runny egg yolk makes it even better. The bulgogi beef baos were just okay - the meat was a bit too thick and definitely not tender enough to be actual bulgogi. I also wish there had been some kind of sauce (hoisin, even) to make the dish less dry. I really liked the flavor of the ribs with the crunch of peanuts on top, but the meat was a bit too fatty for my taste. The calamari was nothing special to talk about. 

On a separate note, for drinks, I would recommend the cold tea for two. It&apos;s an oolong tea infused vodka that has a peach flavor and comes in an actual teapot with teacups and everything! It&apos;s a very refreshing drink especially for the summer. 

Overall, I liked my experience but didn&apos;t love it. The portions are bigger than what you would expect from regular tapas, although it is also a bit pricier. I feel like the dishes could be hit or miss, so I would be open to trying more on the menu."
3,"Ordered a lot of dishes and for some reason even though I know I had a few good dishes the only ones that stood out were the bad ones.

The ribs were really salty

The steak tartar was also really salty, maybe they used too much soy sauce but it was not good

Kimchi fired rice was also really salty as well, not a fluke we order two orders to share for the table 

The scallops were really fishy"
4,"This is a fun, hip, asian-fusion place tucked away on Tyler Street in Chinatown. It almost feels out of place sitting amongst the other traditional asian eateries in the area but I guess that makes them unique.  

We came on a Tuesday around 5:30p without reservation and were seated right away at a high-top. It&apos;s a pretty small space with a bar that has a TV playing old kung-fu movies which added a fun twist to the overall vibe. There&apos;s a wall mural of some strange things (monkey bathing on a building?). The music is set intentionally loud, to the point where you have to lean and semi-shout to your partner. It wasn&apos;t so bad that we would leave but it lends to the &quot;club-y/hip&quot; vibe they seem to be going for. 

Beef bulgogi baos-ample amounts of beef..but not the traditional sweet, smoky, tender beef i think of when i think bulgogi. 

Pig Baos-yum! Nice big juicy pieces of pork belly in these. If i&apos;d pick one, I&apos;d go with the pig. 

Duck fat fries-served in a metal basic, these are what you&apos;d expect, nothing more and nothing less. Served with a tasty spicy mayo. 

Korean Steak tartare--salty!! Tasty but there is a LOT of soy sauce in the sesame marinade on the tartare. Combined with the scallion pancakes, it was a huge sodium load (and I like my food well-seasoned). Ate all the pancake but for the first time in my life, couldn&apos;t finish all the tartare (it&apos;s precious stuff!)

Kimchi Fried Rice--Solid fried rice with a fried egg on top. Little crispy bits of rice throughout was a nice touch. 

Service was lovely and my water never reached below halfway."
4,"Is this the best Asian Fusion in Boston? I&apos;d say yes. The decor is dark and can get pretty lively during dinner times but still very clean and I like the tv by the bar with old kung fu movies. I&apos;ve been here several times and like that their menu changes slightly every few months, but they always keep their most popular dishes. I&apos;ve most recently had their bulgolgi bao which was great! Not the best bao I&apos;ve ever had but tasty, medium rare beef, and on a non stale or soggy bun. 

The shadowless fries is a must. It has the classic mapo tofu gravy with beef and tofu topped on fries! Maybe it&apos;s because I&apos;m a sucker for French fries, but mapo tofu and fries work well together.

The Wu-Tang style ribs was good but not great. Nice crispy edge and sweet but not overly sweet sauce. My issue is that the ribs were a little dry. 

The chicken waffles were also amazing. They use the Hong Kong egg waffles as the base. Not nearly as good as in Hong Kong, but still a suitable replacement for the traditional waffle. The chicken was also fried well, very moist on the inside. Not as good as Hash House a Go Go, but still a good replacement for when I&apos;m not in Vegas. 

The tea for two is also a great alcoholic twist on tea served in a pot. 

Lastly, what impressed me the most is that they were able to accommodate my friend&apos;s 10+ allergy list. Apparently, this was the first time she had any sort of Asian food in over a decade. I was very very impressed."
4,"Located in Chinatown and unique compared to the other &quot;traditional&quot; Chinese restaurants around. I grabbed a small table and looked over the menu and decided on the Shojonator and the Greens. I wanted the Duck Fat Fries, but opted to try to be a bit healthier. The place feels like a great place for groups as it&apos;s super energetic and fun. Because of this vibe, it is extremely loud. Almost unbearable. The food though was great. The Shojonator was a great combination of sweet and savory. The bun was the perfect fluffiness and I felt it worked so much better than a regular bun. The greens was actually my favorite of the two because of the unique citrus flavor in addition to the soy-based sauce. It felt light yet substantial. I would recommend this place for Asian fusion flavor. A great place to meet up some friends, grab a bite, grab some beers and enjoy the company."
4,"Kept thinking I wasn&apos;t in Boston&apos;s Chinatown in this cool asian gastropub vibe. Drinks and all the food we tried were great, served hot, fresh ingredients, skilled prep. Very enjoyable meal of these small plates (ample portions):
 
--Pork Belly Dumplings with a sake hoisin sauce, jalape√±o and cilantro--perfectly spicy, well-made dumpling ($15)
--&quot;Monkey Chicken Wings&quot; with sriracha sweet &amp; sour Sauce, lime and garlic, another good choice ($9)
--Sesame charred bok choy with fried shallots, lemon, and soy ($7)
--Char-Grilled shrimp with charred lemon, hot sesame oil, and sea salt ($11)

Service was really efficient, too."
4,"The service here was fine . We grabbed the shojo baos, bulgogi beef bao and far east Baja fish taco.
The shojo baos was basically a pork belly baos. It was underwhelming because the pork belly tasted boiled. The bulgogi bao was a little better in flavor. It had a little touch of Korean BBQ taste. The fish taco were my favorite. It was so full of flavor in every bite. It&apos;s not to bad on the price. Definitely, will be back"
