5,"We came during a late lunch time around 2pm without reservation and we were seated super quickly. In terms of COVID precautions, the restaurant handled everything really well (temperature checks, socially distant dining tables, plastic wrapped utensils). 

I got the sashimi lunch and it was super fresh and the portion was pretty good for lunch time. It was also my friend&apos;s birthday and they gave us a delicious chocolate lava cake!"
5,"I tried Douzo on Jan 20, 2021 evening. The anti-COVID-19 measures were sufficient (i.e. QR menu, inter-table spaces, and temperature checks). We ordered tiger and torch special rolls which were amazing, probably the best rolls I had in Boston. I also had green tea and ginger to complement the rolls and both were satisfactory.

I highly recommend Douzo&apos;s rolls and would like to visit there again as soon as my girlfriend says we can go there again. So far, among the few sushi places I have been in Boston, Douzo is the best!"
5,"We ordered takeout from here a few days ago and all the food was amazing!

Had a variety of sushi rolls and ordered the tamari scallops and the tuna tataki which were delicious!!"
4,"Douzo is a mellow, low lit restaurant that offers a wide selection of seafoods for its sushi and sashimi dishes. High quality sushi with beautiful presentation and lots of colors that show how fresh all the meat is. Many of the special rolls offer up layers of several different seafoods such as the Rainbow roll, which includes shrimp, crab, white fish, tobiko, tuna, and salmon. Though the combination of these meats creates complex and tasteful flavor, it is difficult to enjoy or appreciate the flavor profile of any of the individual seafoods."
4,"Met a friend here for lunch when I was visiting Boston. 

Overall atmosphere was nice and hostess was very kind. The interior design was beautiful and they played &quot;trendy&quot; music.

We got the Lunch Bento Special:
 -Chicken Katsu with sweet potato maki 
 -Salmon Teriyaki with spicy tuna maki

Both were tasty and I definitely recommend!

The only thing I took stars off for were:
-Tables were pretty tight and very close, so you could hear the next tables conversation and it was hard to get into the inner seat. 
- Wait staff was a bit off"
5,"The food here was fantastic - shishito peppers came with a tangy, spicy sauce that paired perfectly. Gyozo were soft and packed with seafood/veggies. And the sushi...oh the sushi. My only regret is that I only got to try two of the rolls on this visit. They were both delicious, with fresh ingredients, lots of flavor, and great texture. The crunchy roll blew me away, I definitely recommend it.

Service was great, very attentive staff. The prices aren&apos;t cheap, but you&apos;ll get what you pay for in great service and quality food."
5,"I came in with my girlfriend for dinner.  The dining room was nicely spaced out and it was very clean inside.  The fish was so fresh, fantastic flavors, beautiful presentations.  Our server and management were great with recommendations.  Thank you for a perfect evening."
4,"We came to celebrate my boyfriend&apos;s birthday. We originally requested to sit at the chef&apos;s counter to do an omakase tasting but it was closed due to COVID regulations which is completely fair. So we decided to order from the a la carte menu from our table instead. Some of our favorite dishes that we tried were the Chef&apos;s Special sushi entree, the uni from Maine, and the seared salmon. We ordered the octopus ceviche which really wasn&apos;t a ceviche style dish but more like an octopus salad. We also ordered the grilled wagyu beef which was smothered in mayo/dressing that ruined the dish. I couldn&apos;t enjoy the flavor of the wagyu beef which was a bit disappointing. I did mention it to our waiter and he appreciated the feedback. In turn, he added additional nigori pieces to our entree to make up for the poorly executed beef. 

Overall, I thought our dining experience was good and we&apos;d go back to try the other dishes there as well."
3,"First of all, this place is not &quot;affordable sushi&quot; as it is advertised and they seem to have a lot of awards for. I had 4 dishes from this place and they all seemed very mediocre. It is open late at night and has a nice ambiance so it&apos;ll do but it can&apos;t be the best sushi in Boston. 

1. Seaweed Salad - 8/10 - not bad but def average. 
2. Torched Salmon with Crabmeat - 8/10 - def the best dish but the crabmeat has way too much mayo so it became very heavy after eating the first one. It comes with two per order 
3. Volcano roll - 6/10 it had scallops on top but again, slathered in a mayo like sauce so you couldn&apos;t taste the scallops
4. Shrimp Shumai (steamed) 7/10 - bland with not much. 

Customer service was good though and they prepared the order fast."
5,"This place was sooooo good! Really exceeded our expectations! The sashimi was so fresh, drinks were good, and our server Leroy was so friendly and attentive. We&apos;ve already made another reservation for Valentine&apos;s day!"
5,Excellent sushi and classy staff. The food tasted amazing but the presentation was even better
5,"Probably some of the best sushi I&apos;ve had!  Anytime I&apos;m in Boston, which is about 3 times a year, I eat here.  The place is easy to get to and just beautiful inside.  The service has always been so friendly and I&apos;ve never waited long.  

The quality of the fresh seafood and veggies is second to none and always amazingly displayed on arrival.  I do enjoy sitting right in front of the sushi bar to watch the masters at work.  Something so calming about watching professionals at their trade.  The taste is always incredible and easily some of the best tasting sushi I&apos;ve eaten."
4,"It&apos;s been an extremely long time since I&apos;ve come here. I&apos;m happy to say I had an excellent dinner tonight and everything I had I was very pleased with. Food and service was fantastic, the waitress was super and checked in on us as well as kept out water glasses filled. She was a doll! I don&apos;t know why it took me so long to come back here for food but glad my friend suggested this place for us to catch up and have dinner. Seriously can&apos;t wait to come back for the tiger roll! Ooh so good!"
5,"Where do I even began with Douzo? Last night I learned that there is a parking garage next to Douzo on 131 Dartmouth Street. After 5:00pm, parking is only $5.00 for three hours of parking. What a steal?! Although this is a pricer sushi restaurant, it&apos;s worth every penny. We arrived for a nice New Years Eve dinner. We ordered the chef&apos;s assorted bites special. The fish was so fresh that you would think it was immediately caught from the sea, prepared with care, and placed on my plate. You have to try the rainbow, crunchy, and spicy scallop rolls too. Everything was delicious per usual. The staff members were all kind and courteous to us. Overall, it was a lovely New Years Eve dinner. Happy New Year everyone!"
5,"I have been coming here since it opened (~15 years ago) and have never once had anything less than a superb meal. The restaurant is surprisingly versatile -- from the convenience of the separate takeout counter to the lunch &quot;boxes&quot; to the amazing and fresh sushi -- but it absolutely nails everything. Recently, I&apos;ve been doing takeout/delivery during covid, and the packaging not only keeps my sushi safe, but also makes me feel safe about the preparation process. The food travels well and has the same outstanding quality. I truly wish they had a loyalty program, because I would join in a heartbeat. Every time I try someplace new for sushi, I end up wishing I had gone to Douzo (now I think I&apos;ve learned my lesson!)."
5,This place is still amazing. Delivery was easy. The sushi rolls were fresh and delicious. I have loved the snow mountain roll for years and it still hits the spot. All the rolls I ordered were good. The chicken katsu was pretty big. Torched salmon was a good app. I ordered this for two and we had plenty of leftovers
4,"I came here for lunch a few days ago. It&apos;s a bit overpriced for what you get so it was unsurprising to see that the majority of people here were businesspeople. 

They have a good diverse menu with many trendy Japanese dishes. There are several upscale options of popular dishes, for example a miso soup with lobster. 

They also offer several lunch deals that at first glance look like a great deal but are lacking what you&apos;d find at other Japanese restaurants. I ordered the bento combo which allows you to pick one maki roll and hot entree. It seemed like a great deal for $14 but it didn&apos;t come with miso soup or rice. I got the chicken katsu, which is significantly less enjoyable without rice.

The food here is decent, with an exciting menu, but don&apos;t come here unless you&apos;re willing to shell out more than you usually would at a Japanese restaurant."
3,"The restaurant has a modern and upscale atmosphere. The menu is nicely laid out with plenty of photos for those of us who enjoy visuals. 
The menu selection was pretty good. I like that they offer a variety of soups.

The wait staff was accommodating and timely. The hostess was meh. My party and I were surprised she didn&apos;t bother to say thanks and bye to us when we departed even though she was not preoccupied. It&apos;s maybe a small thing but I think it&apos;s kind of rude and is a pet peeve of mine when people don&apos;t do their jobs.

The food itself was ok but seemed a bit pricey for what we got. I think the quantity of food was filling but the quality could be better for the price. However, it doesn&apos;t take a business degree to understand they&apos;re in prime real estate so their pricing reflects accordingly. 

Overall the experience was satisfactory so I&apos;d be willing to come back and try other dishes. Maybe there are others menu items that would&apos;ve been better?..."
4,"4 for food, 3 for grumpy waiter, 5 for friendly hostess/phone reservation experience. 

Not very kid friendly and had this lounge like vibe inside but I guess that&apos;s to be expected for sushi.

Vegetarian friend got the noodle dish with tofu and he said it was filling and would get it again.

I got the uni (fresh), chefs selection of sushi which was $35 and very good. The sake (second one down on cold sake list) was superb"
4,First day in Boston. Had to get sushi with Sarah. Overall solid quality - nothing wow factor but I enjoyed the decor and food.
