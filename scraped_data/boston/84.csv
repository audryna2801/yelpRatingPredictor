5,"Love this place. Their food is creative and pricing is extremely reasonable for the sheer amount of food serviced. (Note: they do not skimp on anything: quality, quantity)

Service is fast and wait staff is extremely competent. Highly recommend!

Note: this place rocks during the weekends. Definitely make a reservation as they do offer walk in service but I&apos;ve seen a line outside during peak times."
5,"Had to get the salmon bowl - it had all the good things - salmon belly, salmon, and minced salmon (which I&apos;ve never tried before but was really good) the salmon was so fresh! We also got couple of rolls which were really delicious (I can&apos;t remember the names) one of them had a truffle sauce and the other one had torched salmon. The rolls are huge by the way and were very filling. Will definitely come back here. 

The place is small, clean and they had COVID safety measures in place to make sure dining in was comfortable to all."
5,"Very happy to come across this place. It was freezing cold outside and we wanted to dine in. They have very limited seating, but weren&apos;t so busy that we had to wait for a table. The service was very fast and friendly and the restaurant itself is super clean. I saw them disinfecting between guests and there is hand sanitizer when you come in the door.

Their menu is photo-based and everything looked very delicious - it was hard to choose. We went with Cha Su Bao, Cha Su Soba Noodle Soup, and a Caterpillar Maki.

The bao buns are a great way to start the meal and next time I would try the eel one they have on the menu. They were well done... Light and tasty with a little crunch provided by cucumbers. 

I had never had soba noodles before. They are made from buckwheat and have a brown color and somewhat grittier texture than other Asian noodles I&apos;ve eaten. Overall, I was really happy with the dish. The broth was light, but savory and it was a fairly large serving with the pork, noodles, corn, etc.  - very filling.

The sushi was also excellent. I&apos;m a big fan of eel and had never had this particular roll anywhere before. I would certainly recommend trying it."
5,"Tora&apos;s personally in my TOP 5 restaurants in Boston! 

It&apos;s located in the basement of a building that is right across from Royal Tea!

I have never seen anyone getting disappointed after I took them to Tora! If you want to avoid long lines and people in general, go there during the weekdays afternoons! I always order this salmon rice bowl and yes there is rice underneath it for those who didn&apos;t know, just wanted to clarify that because my friends didn&apos;t know about it! I also always order this sushi with torched salmon, and I&apos;m telling you their salmon is so fresh, fatty, and rich in general so you will not get disappointed! 

Definitely, my favorite salmon place to go!"
5,"Still the place to get pinnacle food quality in a casual dining setting and price. The owner was telling me that they were 1 of 3 restaurants in Boston still importing Bluefin tuna directly from Japan. The quality is still stratospheric as the turnover is strong here. 

And because Patrick indicated that he just receive an order of Bluefin tuna which was resting in the counter, I ordered a Maguro Toro don. 

The various forms of tuna toro and maguro slices, and negitoro offered subtle nuances of velvety warmth and unctuous savory earthiness coaxed into song by vinegared rice and freshly grated genuine wasabi. Added a pair of Saba (mackerel) slices to my bowl and amassive Hamachi Kama grilled perfectly to overkill my meal. Because why not?"
5,"Tora is just as amazing as ever when I visited this past week. It felt as normal as pre-covid, just with more safety measures like protective glass between tables. 

Service is always friendly. The place is tiny but if there is a wait, it is well worth it. 

The fish was incredibly fresh, as usual. The freshest in all of Boston. Everything came out quickly and with attention to detail. I&apos;ll post more photos so you can see what I&apos;m talking about but if you haven&apos;t been to Tora, and you love fresh fish, especially sashimi, you are missing out!"

One of my girlfriends favorite restaurants in Boston! Smaller restaurant with bar seating. There was plexiglass between parties. We had to wait 30min on this Friday night to dine in...it was pretty worth it! Most of the sushi that I have is from AYCE places...so the freshness and quality of this fish blew the other fish out of the water...okay...I&apos;m done...but fr it was good quality fish! Service was good and fast as well!"
5,"I&apos;ve actually never dined in at Tora but have ordered delivery from here a couple times in quarantine. So I can&apos;t say anything about the service or the actual space, but the food is great. It&apos;s the best place for decently priced and super fresh fish. The dons are delicious and I love that there are so many different combinations. Their rolls are also really delicious. It&apos;s slightly more expensive than a random, just okay sushi place, but this is so much better. Highly recommend."
3,"Takoyaki was not good at all, the octopus was so chewy we couldn&apos;t eat it (like chewing a thick piece of gum.) the sushi is okay nothing to write home about. 
The reviews made me believe that I was in for a great meal but it was just okay. Here I go with my high expectations again ‍"
5,"Can&apos;t wait to come here in person one day because my experience with ordering delivery was incredible.

I tried their sake aisuru don. For $21.60 I had high expectations for a bowl of rice with raw fish on top, and I was not disappointed at all! The cuts of salmon sashimi and salmon belly on top were so rich, fatty, and fresh. Probably some of the freshest fish I&apos;ve eaten in a long time. The chopped salmon (not sure what its proper name is) was mixed with the perfect amount of scallions to balance the flavor but not mask the taste of the fish. Even the rice was cooked nicely and seasoned with just enough vinegar. I also appreciated the small details: freshly grated wasabi on top of a shiso leaf and bed of shredded daikon.

For the quality here, the price is completely worth it. I would come here again if I feel like treating myself to really great raw fish!"
5,"Holy cow. Very highly recommend!! Went here on a Tuesday night at 5pm with a friend during COVID. No reservations needed, went in and was immediately seated. She got the Bluefin (Maguro) don and I got the ikura-uni don (sea urchin and salmon roe). Total bill came about $52 ($26 each) no tax and tip included.

AMBIANCE:
Love the minimalist interior decor. The interior is quite spacious given its a basement. Probably can sit around ~16 people at any given moment? Highly recommend snagging a seat right by the sushi bar, you get to see the action!

PROS:
Menu was quite massive! I definitely had choice paralysis since there were SO many seafood don options. I will definitely come back for other options!

My ikura-uni don was SO fresh. So tasty! You can definitely tell that they sourced their ingredients well. Uni was so creamy and matches really well with the brininess of the salmon role. Each bite was like an explosion of flavors in my mouth. Can&apos;t believe I stumbled upon here and I have to come back here for more. 

Service was quick and fast. No complaints here.

OVERALL:
Sublime. You must come here to try this hidden gem for yourself!"
5,"AMAZING sushi place. I had the Sake Aisuru Don (salmon bowl), Udon, and  Pinku Maki Roll. Their fish quality is out of this world. The minced salmon in the bowl has such great seasoning to go with the rice. Even though it can be pricey for some, it&apos;s totally worth it in my opinion. Inside space is limited so there can be a bit of a wait for sit down at busy hours. A lot of people do take out/UberEats. I&apos;ll definitely be coming back for another bowl to try. 5/5 !!"
5,"I went there on Christmas. Was supposed to be a date but was ruined. However, the foods cheer me up (very very FRESH SASHIMI). I ordered two bowls because it was that good! The lady who greet us was very accommodating since we changed the reservations 3 times (changed number of parties and times). But they were still able to accommodate us when we walked in passed our reservation time. 
We even to-go two more dishes for late night because it is THAT GOOD. I&apos;ll return again whenever I visit Boston."
5,"I cannot stress how much I love eating here!! Tora has literally been a staple in my life and my go to celebratory meal  Tried a couple of different items off the menu but I always gravitate back to my all time fave Sake Aisuru Don  Although a bit pricey (they&apos;ve understandably increased their prices since covid), it is 100% worth! For $21.60, you get a bowl of delicious, fresh, high quality salmon 3 ways: sashimi, pork belly, and minced topped over a bed of sushi rice and miso soup. The presentation itself is also extremely inviting. 

Highly encourage those to stop by and to try this place out!"
4,"Thanks to Yelp we found a great Japanese restaurant in the area. It&apos;s located in Chinatown. The restaurant is very small and has hand sanitizer right when you walk in. They also seem to be very efficient on take away/take out orders. There are plexiglass barriers between tables and everyone is wearing a mask. No menus as you can take a picture of the QR code. (I&apos;m still amazed on how it works)

Edamame - as you would expect
Goma Cucumber - Delicious. I could have had another bowl of it
Torched A5 Miyazaki Wagyu ($36) - Not sure it was worth it because the slices were really thin. It definitely wasn&apos;t warm since it&apos;s torched but it had great flavor when you add some salt to it. 
Sake sashimi - Very fresh and melted like butter
Pinku Maki (torched salmon, crab salad, avocado, spicy mayo and unagi sauce) - Delicious 
Spicy Tuna Roll - Wasn&apos;t my favorite
Salmon Avocado Roll - Good

Overall, the food was delicious. Service was great - we were the only ones there, but we saw a lot of orders come in so it&apos;s a popular place. I&apos;d definitely come back and try the other items on the menu."
5,"Located in Chinatown amongst many competing restaurants.  Tora delivers on flavor and freshness. 

The menu is compromised mainly of these bowls of fresh fish.   From salmon to tuna to sea urchin and more.  You order by number and receive a bowl of rice topped with the fish of your choice. 

The particular salmon option i ordered contained salmon, salmon belly and a minced salmon.  While I&apos;m not a huge fan of the minced,  the other two were quite delicious. 

I added a caterpillar roll from their limited maki menu.  I&apos;d say to skip the rolls as this one wasn&apos;t great. 

The focus is the bowl.  Order one and you&apos;ll be all set. 

I&apos;ll be back. Service was so great."
3,"I understand that it&apos;s tough for restaurants during COVID, but my second experience with this restaurant was really disappointing. We ordered the Shirayuki maki and Kuromon don (thinking it would be enough for two people). The flavors were all there for the maki, but I didn&apos;t realize it was going to be so small. For a $20 special roll, it was the size of a spicy tuna roll that you can get anywhere. The don was also not worth its price. The fish was not amazingly fresh like before and the slices are much slimmer now - I could have definitely ordered a Chirashi bowl elsewhere for a better price for the same decent quality. Compared to the first time I went to Tora when I felt like I received what I paid for, this was not the same. On the plus side, the food was ready within 15 minutes even though the person on the phone told me 30.

I&apos;m probably going to give Tora another try once quarantine is over to give it a fair judgment."
1,"I usually leave good reviews, but today, I have to say this is by far the WORST sushi place I&apos;ve ever been to. 
I came with a group of friends and they made us stand outside in the cold for like 20 min even tho there&apos;s plenty of space for us, we understand their necessary precaution of the virus, but it just finest make sense that they made us stand outside for 20 min in freezing cold! 
Then they sit us down, the table was not cleaned or sanitary at all, we can see there&apos;s some kind of sauce left on the table.
Finally the food came, the uni rice bawl was not good, the urchin wasn&apos;t fresh, it tasted bitter and smell fishy, then we tried their recommended dish was the Foie Gras(goose liver sushi), and that was awful as well, the sauce on top was very salty and the liver tasted weird as well. 
But that wasn&apos;t the main reason I wanted to leave an bad review, when we were done with our over priced food, me and my other friend from the group payed together, and the server wasn&apos;t happy with our tips, she said we have to give them at lest 18% EACH rather than the 10% we wrote down that we gave them out of courtesy. She even said they are the best sushi out of Boston. Which is ridiculous and unreasonable to demand a costumer to add tips! 
I would give 0 star if I could, not just how bad and expensive their food was, but the service and attitude of their server and crazy tips was just outrageous! Stay away! There are better places to spend your hard earn money!!!

我平時都係比好評嘅，但係今日食完飯真係好嬲。
首先係啲枱凳，張枱好似冇抹過好邋遢，癡立立嘅。 
然之後就係上餸，點做飯，鵝肝壽司仲有啲壽司。隔離枱同我地差唔多到，已經食得差唔多了，我哋嘅餸仲未上來。
然之後就係食物個新鮮度，個海膽魚子醬飯，魚子醬好生，海膽都唔新鮮有啲臭臭地。個鵝肝壽司係朋友推薦點嘅，都係好生唔新鮮，最主要係個醬料好鹹，掩蓋左鵝肝本應有嘅味道. 總之就係好失望。
最重要嘅係最尾買單果時，我同朋友AA，每人俾咗10%tips，個服務員盡然追住我地話tips未俾夠，話我地每人最少要俾18%，我俾多做10%，佢竟然要我朋友都俾多啲。個服務員仲話佢哋間店係Boston最好食嘅。真系好無語，本來無幾大件事，啲嘢唔好食就算了，價格比平時嘅壽司店貴都算啦，啲服務員竟然咁巴閉。
一句忠告唄嘅各位食友，千祈唔好嚟！唔好食，服務態度差，價格仲貴！"
1,"Shitty food, shitty service. Unreasonable price and force us to give a high amount of tip. Worst place to go. Wouldn&apos;t let me in and made me to stand in the cold outside for 10 minutes while there is plenty of space in the room.
Very disappointed."
5,"Open during Covid (as of July 2020). I visited this joint back in July and they had limited seating, but were open for dine-in with plexiglass between tables and QR code menus, they were serving safely. I got the tuna and salmon don bowl. The fish slices were thick, fresh, and melt-in-your-mouth good! Their menu looked good, I would definitely want to come back and try more fresh fish! Located in Chinatown, can be hard to find because it is in a basement walk-down."
