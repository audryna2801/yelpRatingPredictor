5,"We decided to celebrate Valentine&apos;s Day early to avoid crowds. I&apos;ve always wanted to eat here, but feared they wouldn&apos;t have any plant-based vegan options. Boy was I wrong.

You can make reservations on Open Table or by calling. We did the latter. They fit us in at our desired time without much notice. Note: This restaurant is small and operating at a reduced capacity thanks to the pandemic, so don&apos;t expect to be seated same day/immediately. 

We walked over because parking is not fun in the city. You may want to see if they offer valet. The location is very easy to find on Park in Beacon Hill. You can walk your dinner off in the Common after ;)

We were greeted by the host at the door (I wished I had asked his name). Delightful man who seated us. All in all, we had many staff members helping us, bringing out courses, asking if we needed anything. The service is superb! Professional, friendly, knowledgable, and safe. Tables were well spaced. Staff were all wearing masks. The lighting is intimate. The temperature was cozy on this 12 degree night. So often, establishments are very cold because staff is hot from running around. Diners are cold though. The dining room was perfectly warm.

No. 9 Park is known for their pre-fixe meals. Trust the chef. You won&apos;t regret it. We knew that they could accommodate a vegan diet because we asked when making the reservation. So we let the chef create a completely plant-based four course vegan meal. 

We ordered drinks to start. The cocktail menu is small, but very unique. We ordered Meet Me in Tahiti Iti and the High Society Calypso. These drinks were complex, well balanced, and so unique. Would love to order every drink on that menu!

Rob, our main server, brought us homemade sour dough bread with olive oil and salt. We may or may not have bad two helpings. 

Then the courses came out. See my photos. Chef got really creative. First course was a radicchio salad with citrus, pepitas, golden raisins, olives, and more. Second course was cavalelli pasta with hazelnuts, mushrooms, delicata squash. Third course was roasted vegetables like brussels, carrots, potatoes, and onions. Fourth course was sorbet (lime, lemon, and mandarin). Everything was well portioned, fresh, cooked to perfection, and seasoned perfectly. Delicious! 

This is a truly lovely restaurant with exceptional staff, extensive drink offerings, and sincere staff. We cannot wait to come back!"
5,"Where to begin?. The positives.  Dinner was delicious... We had the Valentine&apos;s day menu... I don&apos;t eat shellfish so they made us a special vegetarian cream soup.  The second I had the risotto my wife pasta with duck.  The third ie the entree was steak... Oh my god delicious.  Dessert was also perfect.  

I had bourbon x 2, my wife the Bordeaux x 2.

The service was quick due to the 90 minute cap... Thanks covid.  But it was delightfully splendid.  Nicholas made the evening wonderful.  The atmosphere was also perfect.  Because of covid and spacing, it made the dining experience that much better..
 We weren&apos;t on top of the table next to us like it usually is in Boston.  The noise level was perfect.  

Now the negative.  The price.  I can&apos;t stop laughing.  It was high and I did, but didn&apos;t see that coming.  My wife and I have eaten all over Boston.  The bill floored me.  This is a place I recommend to eat for a special occasion at least once.  I wouldn&apos;t come here casually.  

It was the perfect evening.  Thank you Nicholas."
5,"Best dinner to kick off our Honeymoon! Our server was very knowledgeable and helpful throughout the ordering process. With his suggestion we decided to A la carte instead of trying the tasting menu. He also recommended a wonderful wine within our price range. 

We started with the Shellfish Platter (half portion without crab cocktail) and it was very fresh and great intro into following dishes. 

Our first courses were the Bluefin Tuna and the Steak Tartare and let me tell ya... we couldn&apos;t pick a favorite out of the two. Both very delicious and all of the flavors on the plate really complimented each other well. 

The mid course selections were the Prune Stuffed Gnocchi (per our servers recommendation) and the Raviolo Al&apos; Uovo. We were told that there was only one Raviolo available due to the time it takes to make them and the popularity, so we felt pretty special to have snagged one. We were accidentally served a portion of the Tagliatelle instead of the Gnocchi but our server made the correction and let us enjoy both dishes without an additional cost. Although all of the dishes were fantastic, we can confidently say that the Raviolo Al&apos; Uovo was our favorite dish from this course. The Gnocchi was delicious but sweeter than we were anticipating. 

Our Entree selections were the Hake and Duet of Rohan Duck. Although the Hake was perfectly cooked, we felt that it left something to be desired. The duck was absolutely delicious, the breast was perfectly cooked and the leg was fall off the bone tender. The duck was our clear favorite in this course. 

Although we were literally about to pop, we decided to try the Chocolate Souffl√© for desert and it was PHENOMENAL! Our server walked us through cutting it and pouring in additional chocolate sauce.  

Overall, we would eat here everyday of our lives if we could. Definitely would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a nice dinner while visiting Boston. Make sure to make a reservation if you are planning to go on a weekend!"
4,"Made dinner reservation ahead of time. Initially did outdoors but it was a really windy day and the road was slanted so we opted for indoors instead. 

Mezcal and tequila cocktail was superb. Great smoky flavor yet so smooth. 

We went with the a la carte menu cause there were specific items that caught our eye.
Beef tartare with the sauce. Excellent flavor and pairs well with the sauce. Potato chips are super crispy. 
Foie gras was done just right. Large piece and comes warm. The pear paired well with the cinnamon cake. 
Prune Gnocchi and foie gras was yummy but I couldn&apos;t really taste the prune itself. 
Tagliatelle was thin yet el dente. One of the top Italian dishes I&apos;ve ever had in the states! Definitely worth a try&apos;s 
Steak was a bit too peppery for my liking and the mashed potato was too salty. 
The duck was solid with the fat and skin but the duck leg was way too over cooked. 

Service was attentive and they did a great job overall despite COVID."
4,"No. 9 Park and Barbara Lynch live up to the reputation and hype that surrounds her iconic, flagship restaurant that sits right off Boston Common.

From the time you walk in the front doors to the final steps you take, No. 9 screams fine dining. The details throughout the restaurant as well as the servers and staging aim to create a very paced and elongated dining experience. The staff attempts to give every person the best experience whether it is a party of 8 or a single individual sitting at the bar, just having a drink. The service was impeccable and never left us feeling neglected, always keeping us updated on the status of our orders throughout the night and always visiting periodically with bread if they thought things were taking too long.

The decor and overall feel and vibe of the place has a very Beacon Hill, traditional Bostonian feel to it. Some people really enjoy that sort of decor while others prefer the trendy, up-and-coming glitz and glamour style that is popping up all over Boston. I think the decor in this instance sets the tone for the dinner and restaurant in a very accurate manner regardless of your preference.  This is how dining and decor in nicer places in France were done, and don&apos;t be fooled by the name or location - this is a VERY traditional, French-inspired menu. 

The twist that Barbara puts on French cuisine is that most of the main dishes and sides are locally sourced and seasonal, which in this day and age doesn&apos;t seem like a big deal but is something that she has become very well known for over the years. That may not make her menu unusual or unique in this day and age, but the details she weaves into the experience and execution is impressive. The seasonal Hake was treated perfectly and was buttery and delicate while having a lot of flavor throughout the dish without overpowering the fish itself. The dessert menu had a lot of interesting takes on classic dishes and I wish we could have tried each of them but I don&apos;t think my stomach would have been able to handle all the rich, sugary offerings they had that evening. 

So, why 4 stars you are probably asking? It simply boils down to preference in this case. The dinner and food was excellent for the French style it was crafted in, however it proved to be a little heavy for my wife and I (which French cuisine happens to typically be). I plan to try some of her other restaurants as this was the first one I wanted to try in order to have a baseline or expectation to set the others against. However, we&apos;ve had more memorable meals at places at a similar or below this point point which robs a star from No. 9 Park in the overall score. 

We were far from disappointed and really enjoyed the entire meal, as this was our night out for Valentine&apos;s Day (but we don&apos;t actually go out on the actual day due to the fixed menus and not being able to experience the whole restaurant or menu. Will we be back? Perhaps at some point, but with a number of other restaurants at a similar price point on our list of places to try, No. 9 did not &quot;WOW&quot; us in a way that will have us rushing back. What they offered was a very consistent and well-executed evening that lacked the highest highs or lows, which I can appreciate for a place that isn&apos;t serving my favorite type of cuisine."
3,"Had the 5-course Dine Out Boston tasting menu ($69) to celebrate my birthday dinner.  Courses included (in order): White Bean Veloute, Faroe Island Salmon, Potato Gnocchi, Confit Giannone Farms Chicken, and Banana*.

BEST COURSE: Potato Gnocchi.  Everything about this was executed perfectly.  Gnocchi were soft pillows, delicious pesto was a pistachio broccoli rabe blend (with the most tender shoots!), mushrooms were succulent and soaking up all the luscious flavor, and hnggh the parmesan they topped it with - major quality.  Amaze. Love.

DECENT: White Bean Veloute was decent too.  Appreciated the two similarly quiet tones of the white bean and sunflower seeds, which were sharply illuminated by the tart vinaigrette cauliflower.  Pomegranate seeds added refreshing sweetness.

OTHER DECENTISH: The Faroe Island Salmon (poached) was a tad overcooked.  The sauce (which was still bomb btw) saved it, giving the full moisture it needed.  On the other hand, the bed of lentils it rested on was cooked perfectly.  I liked the flavor profile of this dish as a whole - seafood-cream-citrus, a &quot;grounding&quot; lentil bed, a delicately bitter chicory leaf.

PLS, NO COURSE: Confit Giannone Farms Chicken was unimaginative - chicken, potato, beans.  While dressed up with nice plating and a trendy poached egg, this bland course was inherently meat and potatoes, and wasn&apos;t even executed well (chicken was tough).

Dessert was average.  We did get a kick out of the vague menu title &quot;Banana&quot; (are they going to serve us that Maurizio Cattelan-inspired piece?)  Dessert was more than a banana on a plate; it was a chocolate cake with a small banana piece and scoop of ice cream.  Thoughtful of them to write &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; on my plate though :3

The quality between dishes was highly variable, and thus three stars.  Consistency at this level (and price point!) is incredibly important - I want to be able to come back, order a la carte, and be confident that I will have an amazing meal.  Gnocchi was 100% five stars.  Experience as a whole? Three."
3,"Got dinner here after attending Shear Madness. Had high hopes for this restaurant so while elements were good, there were also some flubs which felt more disappointing bc of my expectations I think, most notably on the service end. 

Bread service came around while my bf was in the bathroom so I tried to get a piece of bread for him which everyone at my table heard but apparently not the guy serving bread so he took off. My bf then had to flag him down when he got back to request bread and the guy was like second piece? To which my bf responded first and was surprised he didn&apos;t remember he had missed him. Minor quibble. 

Appetizers were my favorite part of the meal. I thought my prune stuffed gnocchi w/ foie gras tasted delicious, and I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever had a stuffed gnocchi before. The bf got the rabbit ravioli which also tasted quite good; it grew on him as he ate it so he liked it more at the end than his initial impression. 

The bf had ordered a glass of wine to come with his entree when it arrived but I held off on ordering mine until after the appetizers were cleared and we were done with our cocktails. Only I ordered a glass then when asked and then when another server came around asking if we wanted any wine, I said I&apos;d already ordered and my bf said he had ordered one at the beginning of the meal (in case they forgot). This will become important later. 

For my entree, I got the poached salmon with artichokes and was unimpressed. The dish seemed small for $40 but not a big deal if it tasted fantastic. It did not. The salmon dish I&apos;ve gotten from Mister Jiu&apos;s in SF was phenomenal and I still talk about it. This dish was forgettable. The bf got the duet of duck. He thought it was ok, mentioned a couple pieces were dry. I did think it was better than my salmon, esp with the pumpkin mole it came with (but the bf isn&apos;t a big fan of pumpkin anyway). My friends got the lamb (bigger than we expected, it was like a mountain of meat) and the bavette steak (possibly the best entree although one does hope a restaurant can do a steak well). We got the chocolate souffl√© for dessert which was good. 

Finished our wine near the end of the entree portion of the meal and while the servers continued to clear plates away after entrees and then dropped off dessert later and so on, at no point did they clear away those empty wine glasses until the meal was over. I was surprised how much seeing the empty wine glasses there for so long bothered me but they did bc they added to the clutter of the table and seemed to highlight a lack of attention to detail. The bf also commented it was a missed opportunity for them to try to sell us another glass of wine (which I don&apos;t think we would have gotten but still).

Then when our bill came, my friend was looking it over and asked whether we got 2 glasses of wine each bc she didn&apos;t remember that but that&apos;s what they charged us. Good thing we make a habit of checking our bills. My bf had been thinking they might charge him for 2 bc they seemed confused about his wine order but he couldn&apos;t understand why they would charge me for 2 bc my ordering had been quite straightforward. We brought it up to our server who had the extra charges removed. But definitely another sign of dropping the ball. Double-check your bills!

The bf thought the restaurant came off as having pretensions of being a fancy high-class place to dine with the prices to match without having the substance to back it up. Probably the best way to describe it haha since when I was talking about our meal afterwards I was more like gosh they charge a lot for not having the service I would expect from a place like this."
4,"This restaurant had great service! We went out to celebrate a big move with a couple of friends and all got the tasting menu. They didn&apos;t have the wine pairing on the menu, and we had somewhat expected it as it was on the website. When we asked, they made something happen for us which was very kind and not necessary at all! Not to mention one of our friends is dairy and soy free. The chef adapted all the plates to honor that; after being frustrated with the allergy options at take-out and dine-in restaurants in the past she stated this was the most enjoyable food while having a dietary restriction. 

My favorite had to be the mushroom risotto - 5 stars for taste! The other courses were awesome, particularly the two fish courses, but we enjoyed all. Surprisingly, the dessert was not the best I&apos;ve had - the pistachio cake was decent but the sorbet was far too sweet and overpowered the delicate flavor of the cake. 

No. 9 Park unfortunately is not made to do outdoor seating during COVID, being on park street&apos;s steep hill facing the Common, which presented a bit of a &quot;dinner and show&quot; aspect with the interesting characters around the area. As well as a very slanted seating arrangement. This is by no fault of the restaurant - they are just trying to make it work during a pandemic and I do not blame them for this. Definitely worth it to go, if you&apos;re comfortable eating inside that would be your best bet; however we had a great time joking about the people having a screaming match in the park and the dozens of motorcyclists that came by every 10 minutes!"
3,"My husband and I visited No.9 Park for an anniversary dinner during Boston Dine Out week, as we&apos;d been wanting to try this restaurant (one of the fancier ones in Boston) for a while but weren&apos;t excited enough by it to go when it wasn&apos;t dine out Boston. We had a great time together and the service was wonderful, but I thought the food was pretty average, especially if we had to have paid full price. I like how inventive my appetizer dish was, but the linguine and my egg/pork dish were simply run of the mill average; I could tell they tried to add inventive concepts, but everything fell a bit flat. Our desert had some nice anniversary writing on it but the chocolate cake itself was, once again, just fine.

Overall not a restaurant I would put on my top date restaurants in Boston, unfortunately. Onto the next Barbara Lynch establishment!"
4,"This was only our 2nd dine-in meal since March. Hubs wanted a tasting menu and No9 came through. We opted for the 7 course option. The prune stuffed gnocchi and foie gras were revelations- some of the best things I&apos;ve ever eaten. The chicken roulade and wagyu were good, but not great. I was becoming stuffed at that point, which may have inhibited my full enjoyment. All portions were so generous! We got dessert to go - rhubarb cheesecake and had it for breakfast, when I was hungry again. They took Covid precautions seriously, as well."
3,"This is such a clusterfuck of a restaurant for somewhere that commands such high prices and such a good reputation. I made a reservation on Opentable as soon as reservations opened for the date I wanted, and the only tables available were either really early or really late. I took the really late one (8:45pm) and called to ask them to let me know if anything opened up earlier. They left me a voice message offering a 5pm slot, but when I called them back to take it they were super accusatory in their tone and choice of words, and they said that this was &quot;very strange&quot; since no one on their team had called me and insinuated that I had made the whole thing up to get what I wanted. Literally they could have just said that the 5pm table got taken and I would have been fine with it, but they had to go that route and fight me on it.

I also requested the &quot;main dining room&quot; when I made the reservation but we were seated in a small room off to the side, and when I pointed this out to the host, he said, &quot;That&apos;s interesting because many of our customers consider that room the main dining room. I was like, &quot;Intuitively, when you walk in, which room is more &apos;main?&apos;&quot; Obviously the bigger one... Clearly these people have never been taught that the customer is always right.

The bread (which costs money) was cold, the sourdough was chewy in a bad way, and the dinner rolls were way too oily and salty. My boyfriend bakes better bread than that. 

The oysters are also not plump enough. 

The food is also consistently way too salty. I told them this when they asked how my food was, but they didn&apos;t do anything to rectify it.

The only decent things were the scallops (the scallops only, not even the sauteed vegetables that came with them, which were overly salty) and the customized dessert they made me. I had a bite of my mother&apos;s pistachio dessert, and it tasted like and had the consistency of straight butter. Her lamb was also tough and not good at all.

They were however very accommodating of my FODMAP intolerance, but that&apos;s to be expected of a restaurant of this caliber. It doesn&apos;t score them any extra points. They also gave me a free dessert because we were celebrating a graduation. Otherwise I&apos;d have given them two stars.

We spent a bit over $600 after tip for seven people."
3,"I&apos;ve been waiting to try a Barbara Lynch restaurant for years. Finally visiting Boston and got my chance.  Full disclosure:  it was Covid time.  That said, I&apos;m not a fan.  Although the service was absolutely excellent, the food was underwhelming.  I don&apos;t want to be harsh, so I&apos;ll leave it at that.  Maybe try her other spot Menton.  That&apos;s probably better.   Sadly, 9 Park disappointed."
4,"My cousin suggested we try this place per recommendation of her coworker. We came on a Friday night and I enjoyed the dimmed atmosphere. I don&apos;t typically care for French food but I find myself always trying to give it a try. They served bread from a big basket periodically which was cool but the bread did not satisfy my tastebuds. I ordered the poached faroe Island salmon and east coast oysters. I didn&apos;t really enjoy the salmon but the east coast oysters were a hit, they were really fresh and I would definitely go back just for oysters. My cousin ordered the Foie gras and it was amazing. This was the first time I tried foie gras that I actually liked. I would definitely revisit this place and order more adventurously."
4,"The place is next to the Mass state house. The size is on the smaller side (limited space and low ceiling unlike most Beacon Hill townhouses). 

Service was very attentive, I said my baby is a little allergic to cow milk, the waiter (sorry I forgot the name) told me that most cuisine we ordered was made heavily with diary/cream and might raise a red flag. I acknowledged and baby did get a little allergy.

From the food perspective, we tried Dine out Boston menu. It is good but not great. Entries were probably the best. The main courses had some homemade impression, the potato gnocchi with mushroom tasted a little salty for me, and the gnocchi itself tasted very similar to the one I made from Blue Apron.


Dessert was not delicate, more like the dessert sold in the supermarket."
4,"A cozy but upscale bar and restaurant, directly across the street from the state house. The bar has like 6-8 stools and the bartenders are friendly. The bathroom is small and clean. The food is good. Michelin level dining. Dress is business casual and higher. I wouldn&apos;t recommend for family and kids."
3,"We went to the restaurant on a Wednesday night to try out their Dine Out Boston Week 3 course meal for $38. We had made a reservation for 8:00 PM but we still had to wait for about 15 minutes to be seated. It has a nice ambience and a pretty decent view of the Boston Commons. 

For appetizers we ordered fried brussel sprouts and white bean veloute. The brussel sprouts had a mice charred flavor to it and the honey ricotta sauce was a nice addition as well. The white bean veloute was also really good and was almost like a cauliflower soup. They also served their house made rosemary focaccia and sourdough bread with butter along with the appetizers. The focaccia did not have any rosemary flavor to it but was still good. The sourdough was good as well. 

For entrees we ordered potato gnocchi and confit chicken leg. The potato gnocchi was really good and light. The mushrooms served with the gnocchi were perfectly cooked and had a nice buttery flavor to it. The confit chicken was amazing! The chicken was so tender that it didn&apos;t even need a knife to cut through it. The chicken skin was perfectly crispy. The mashed potatoes served with the confit had a smooth and buttery texture along with some string beans. They went really well with the chicken. All in all a very satisfying experience with the entrees. 

For the desserts we went with what they called &quot;banana&quot; and &quot;honey&quot;. Banana was just a banana cheese cake type thing with almond butter and espresso cookie crumble. The honey was a cinnamon roll with sweet yogurt and sesame. Both the desserts were really disappointing and lacked any kind of flavor to it. They were just basic and nothing special. 

Overall a decent experience but really expensive if you chose to go with the ala carte menu."
4,"Prune stuffed gnocchi topped with Foie, it was my purpose and first visit to this well established restaurant in Beacon Hill.

We thoroughly enjoyed our entire meal, although the signature dish was not the highlight. Coyingly sweet, dessert like in nature, with no respite in providing a savory element. Well, it was a disappointment.

Everything else we ordered was amazing, with gorgeous presentation and flavors that magically popped!

The staff was top notch, second to none. Pleasant, knowledgeable and hospitable."
4,"Celebrated Festivus 2019 at No. 9 Park and had a wonderful evening.  Other than the beautiful night with great friends, the highlight of the evening was definitely the staff of No. 9 Park.  Their courteous, professional, and helpful attitudes and approach toward the service industry was spectacular.

Starting the evening at the small bar at the left after you enter, our bartender was attentive and enjoyed showing off his artistic methods.  

We were seated in one of the small rooms which was perfect for our conversation and laughter.  As mentioned, the wait staff was excellent and very knowledgeable about the menu, including wine pairings.  Dinner was very good with highlights including the Duck, the chicken, and the salmon.  

We didn&apos;t leave room for dessert, but the choices were tempting including the chocolate souffl√© as well as the assorted sorbets and ice creams. 

FOr that special occasion or just to enjoy a nice meal with a view of the State House and Boston Common lights, I recommend No. 9 Park.  Enjoy; we did!"
5,"I was excited to come to No. 9 Park with a colleague on a business trip. The dining room is nice and not overdone, with views of Boston Commons (which is nice on a Sunday when there aren&apos;t sketchy people hovering around the park, haha).

We started with a bread selection of poppy seed and smoked foccacia. I wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the smoked bread, which was kind of peaty and earthy, but the poppy seed bread was lovely--especially with the butter and salt. As is usual with a Barbara Lynch restaurant, No. 9 has a good wine program that spans a variety of geographies. I at first tried a volcanic rock wine (2014 La Solana Listan Negro Cordon Trenzado from Spain) that I didn&apos;t love because it was more peaty than I prefer. I switched to the 2014 Bobcat Cuv√©e Syrah) wine that was more fruit forward and smooth, and I loved it.

I enjoyed the duet of duck--which means a combo of duck confit and duck leg--was good overall. The confit was fine and the leg was better, with a perfectly crispy skin. But oddly enough, the tomatoes were the star of the dish for me as they were bursting with flavor and really added body to the dish. Add the wine to that and tr√©s magnifique!

Service throughout the evening was pleasant and helpful. This was a 4.25-4.5 for me overall, only because none of the dishes blew me away for this standard of restaurant, but I am rounding up due to service."
3,"I went to No. 9 Park years ago and remember loving it.  When family was coming up this past weekend, we decided to come to No 9 Park for a celebratory dinner.  It took us a very long time to get our drinks served once we ordered them but once we received them, we all enjoyed them. 
 I had a great whiskey sour.  We chose the a la carte menu since we all have very different dietary restrictions and it would be easier that way. This menu changes pretty frequently but for our appetizers we got the scallop crudo, the mushroom salad, the prune stuffed gnocchi, and the cavatelli with corn.  EHHH.. for the price point and for Barbara Lynch&apos;s flag ship restaurant I was expecting to be blown away.  I was not.  The scallop was a bit fishy, the mushrooms with poached egg lacked ANY flavor.  I honestly could have made it better.  Both pastas were good, especially the signature prune stuffed gnocchi and I did not have any complaints about theme.  For my main meal I got Hake with a farro salad.  The fish was cooked perfectly.  Farro salad was good.  This was my favorite part of the entire meal.  My father ordered the steak and did not receive part of the sides with it oddly and by the time it came out he had already finished his meal.  My mother and husband got the duck.  They both thought it was fine but once again, nothing amazing for the price point.  For dessert I got the pumpkin souffle and honestly it was pretty terrible.  Didn&apos;t even finish it and I love dessert :(  Overall, I don&apos;t think any of us would go back here.  While we are all Barbara Lynch fans, I think we will stick to her more casual restaurants where the quality and price points are better."
