5,"Drove past a few times in a Lyft and was able to come on a weekend day. 
They open around 10am so keep that in mind. 
Also, they are enforcing social distancing through the whole tour, there is sanitizer in several spots, available for customer use. 
The staff providing the tours are in full costume, according to the times, which I found to be so interesting!! They speak the part too lol
Very thorough and interactive tour, be ready to throw some tea overboard! 
Very interesting Boston history, and it&apos;s a must see if you&apos;re in town with a mentality to not just have fun, but learn too."
5,"I wish I could give it more than 5 stars! This was the highlight of my Boston experience. Even during Covid-19, you are able to interact with probably 7-10 different re-enactors throughout your tour, at your own pace as you visit two different ships, throw &quot;tea&quot; into the harbor, peruse maps, articles, etc., visit a small one-room museum with a short video, and then end up in the tea room with a free cup of tea to enjoy looking out at the harbor. I definitely recommend the tea tasting for $4, to try all 5 types of tea that were disposed of here at the time. And sit on the outdoor deck for a gorgeous view!! Thank you to the amazing, knowledgeable re-enactors who make this experience what it is. 100% worth the entry price!!"
5,"Thought this tour was great! Went first week of September (during COVID) so I think things were a bit different than normal, though admittedly this is my first time doing this tour so don&apos;t have much to compare to. We went on a Friday at around 1pm. There was no wait and was $30 each. We were told this would be a self guided tour, but it was anything but. The second we walked in they had characters in costume giving us all the history. For each section of the tour/museum there was a different character giving us information and walking us through the history. They were excellent and genuinely seemed to be enjoying their jobs, staying in character most of them time (except when we asked present day related questions). 

What we really enjoyed was that for the first half we were the ONLY people there, so we avoided all crowds and got to take our time with everything and take pictures without a million tourists in the background. By the time we got to the second half of the tour, there were 3-4 different small groups of people, which was still way less than typical tourist attractions.

Free cup of tea at the end of the tour was a plus! We hung out on the outer deck area for about 2 hours after the tour, first to drink our tea and then to enjoy a few beers each. It was wonderful, private, had nice patriotic sounding background music, overlooked all of the waterfront and boats/bridges, and was overall a really relaxing end to the tour. Would highly recommend even during COVID times because of the smaller crowds and essentially private tour you get due to not having a lot of visitors 

Just something to note, you don&apos;t actually throw real tea into the water, it&apos;s a fake box tied to a rope that can be pulled back in for the next person to throw. Not a big deal at all, it&apos;s still fun to do, but just so you&apos;re aware since I wasn&apos;t before doing the tour."
4,"So, unfortunately we arrived about 5 min after the last tour of the day. That being said, we were allowed access to walk through the public - non guided tour (pay area). This took us down below to an area where they had some snacks as well as some drinks. Really cool, one wall was all discounted stuff. At the place where you pay for these items you can add on a tea sampling from the next room.

In this room they have 5 of the teas that were drank during this time period. Each tea had a different &apos;class&apos; that it was primarily consumed by. Kind of funny, they kept a bucket near by so you could dump any of the ones you didn&apos;t like. Full disclosure we did dump a couple of them ... it may surprise you which ones though. You&apos;ll have to try for yourself if you want more info. 

Then when you departed here it took you through the gift shop where they had ... you guessed it ... tea for sale. Along with clothing and historical items. Some kind of cool parchment paper type constitutions and things like that.

Overall it was fun, wish we had got there sooner for the tour though, maybe next time."
5,"Second time in Boston and time to do some touristy  things, so I took to Yelp and found this attraction by river walk. It was just an hour, so I bought a ticket. 

I didn&apos;t think I&apos;d like it as much as I did; however, it was informative and delightful. The role playing was exceptional and entertaining with the ability to draw the audience in quite easily. 

There are three main parts of the tour and each holds your attention from exploring the boat, to tossing the tea over, to watching famous speeches from Bostonian historical figures in interactive picture frames (think Harry Potter). 

Tip: grab you a tea sampler ticket and taste all the five &quot;types&quot; of teas that were dumped into the harbor back in Dec 16, 1773. 

Excellent way to spend some time in one of my favorite cities in the US."
5,"A wonderful informative and theatrical show. They start by giving you the history of the tea and the tax issue in a room. Then they move you out to the boat where you learn more and throw the tea off the ship. 

Finally, you&apos;re taken inside to watch interesting videos to learn more and be entertainment.

The actors here really shine here, with excellent acting skills."
4,"You know, there&apos;s something about one of those national monument-type shops/experiences that is special, particularly when it evokes a bit of American history. I&apos;m a pretty patriotic person, so when I was in Boston I knew it&apos;d be worth it to take a short Uber ride downtown to see this place (which I found on Yelp). I&apos;m glad I went. If you&apos;re in Boston and looking for a nice gift shop + a tour of a slice of history, stop in here."
5,"I did not know what to expect for a tour that was touted as being able to throw tea overboard. As a fan of history and the revolutionary war throwing tea got me. The tour is about an hour. At first I was surposed at the cost of the tour, a little over $100 for four of us. We only had to wait about 15 minutes until the next tour. 

We wandered in the gift shop. They of course had a large selection of tea cups and pots as well as teas. There was your typical touristy stuff as well. There was a small section of books. I was hoping to see a larger selection. FYI for a very large selection of books head to Fort Ticonderoga. 

They had us wait in a meeting room before the tour began as we were all participants in the meeting of the sons of liberty prior to the dumping of the tea. They handed out cards with the names of the participants and their background. They also have us a feather to help disguise us. We get to keep the feather. There were two guides that provided the background on the meeting leading up to the tour of the ship or really a boat. It&apos;s not that large

The narration continued on the boat. The guides were informative and funny. We then progressed to an interactive scene inside. Next we progressed to a movie about the beginning of the American Revolution, Concord and Lexington. The movie as about 12 minutes and you could sit or stand. It was well done and the audio  portion of the rifles firing very loud. 

I highly recommend this tour. I would do it again when I am in Boston."
4,"Bring a pivotal park of US history to life and experience the Boston Tea Party first hand with a neat reenactment of this historical event.

Pros:
-period costumes
-role playing with cards (all guests play the part of an actual Boston/Tea Party person, a couple with 1-2 line speaking parts)
-interesting and educational
-Everyone gets the opportunity to throw tea overboard (fake crates of tea tied to ropes)
-learn about history and events surrounding Boston Tea Party
-climb onboard a period boat
-sample different teas after the tour (additional costs)
-sample cakes, cookies and other small snacks after the tour (additional costs)
-play some period era games on the multiple indoor and outdoor tables on the second floor of the museum after the tour while you eat and drink tea
-walking distance to downtown Boston, approx 10min

Cons:
-Seemed a little on the expensive side: ~$100 for family of 4. no veterans discount, only active military
-no private parking lot, so you have to park in one of the nearby lots, which is probably true of most downtown Boston area activities

Other:
-tour is 1.25 hrs"
5,"If you get to know me even a little bit, you quickly realize I am a big history nerd. Always have been and always will be one. I get excited to visit historical places, I love reading history. I actually have said many times I feel like I was born in the wrong era. I just loving immersing myself in the past. This is why Boston Tea Party Ships and Museum was so much fun for me to go to and was one of my favorite stops in my New England vacation.

Essentially the entire place is one large historical re-enactment of the meeting to plan out the Boston Tea Party, the actual re-enactment of the party itself, and an explanation of its aftermath. You are given a part to play, and there are professional actors/actresses there to rile up and help you really get into the experience. It was fun to get onto a recreation of one of the ships (they have recreated two of the three ships that were carrying to tea to Boston and will be in the process of creating the third) and &quot;raid the ship&quot; and &quot;throw the tea overboard&quot;. It&apos;s corny, yes. But I just had a lot of fun. Also the actress playing the part was cute so she could have told me to throw myself into the harbor, ok well maybe not that far.

The gift shop is really nice, spent quite a bit in there. Plenty of tea to buy... including what I bought for a friend of mine back in Miami. I got her one which had on the box some kind of flowers in a pink background on it. The significance was that one solitary box to tea was saved from the tea party. This tea was a hidden by one of the raiders through the war. I guess after it was used, the box became a keepsake for the family and thru the years it changed and was used by the family. At one point they painted on side of it with those flowers. So it was a cute little souvenir to bring back to someone, don&apos;t you think? Also got a cute tea spoon to give along with it. 

It was fun! And I am so glad I came!"
4,What an awesome experience. The museum set and actors take you back in time as a Bostonian at the brink of the revolutionary war. Very fun and interactive.  You&apos;re able to throw the tea off the boat. Plenty of photo opportunities and an excellent dive into our history.
5,"If you want to feel what it was like when the actual Boston Tea Party occurred, you&apos;re gonna have to keep picturing it in your head because that&apos;s the past. But this place does a pretty good job on the history to the artifacts to the employees dressed up and playing a role. Plus you can dump tea into the harbor &quot;sorta&quot; ;) it was interactive and knowledgeable"
5,"Such a fun addition to my weekend trip to Boston. The actors were splendid and did a fabulous job at incorporating the audience as part of show without feeling forced. I learned and participated as much as I wanted (I threw over a box of tea), and learned about the history of the Boston Tea Party. I quite enjoyed the moving paintings - That was really nicely done. I recommend this as a short hour stop in your visit to Boston."
5,"This was a fantastic tour! 
I was leery at first but figured I&apos;m already on the hook to pay $38 for parking so what the heck! And I&apos;m glad I did. The tour guides are essentially actors playing the roles, and they were very good! There were also three recorded pieces, all good, but especially clever were paintings of King George and John Adams coming to life and having a debate. 
To cap it off, the five teas that were thrown into the harbor were all available to drink. Now, you do have to pay for the cup ($5?) and you don&apos;t actually have to go on the tour to buy the cup, but without having been on the tour I wouldn&apos;t have enjoyed the teas. 

Huzzah!"
4,"Stopped here for the first time while on a weekend trip for a Patriot game. I didnt really know what to expect but it was a fun tour! 

It was relatively cheesy but overall a good time and very educational. Starts with a &quot;town-hall&quot; type meeting to show what the experience was like, followed by a tour of the ship and plenty chances to take photos throwing the tea into the harbor. Ended with a movie about how the Boston Tea Party affected the Revolutionary war. 

They dropped us off in the souvenir room/tea room where you could do a tea tasting for $4. I am not a tea person, but after talking with the staff about the different teas I was able to find one that wasn&apos;t bad. If you are into history or looking for a fun family tour to kill an hour this would be good for you!"
4,"This was actually a very fun tour to see. Very educational. it was raining and we were looking for something indoors to do while it was raining and this fit the bill. Yes we all touched on this in history growing up, but hearing it again in more detail as an adult is far more ideal. It is a little pricey, maybe they have discounts for children or for seniors etc or maybe they might have some kind of discounts on Groupon, I didn&apos;t check, but it was a fun worthwhile tour. A lot of interaction with the people doing the tour a lot of walking and then at the end there is a gift shop that sells teas and snacks and meals excetera there was a lot of good teas there, you buy a cup and then you can have as much tea as you want. 
The tour itself is pricey, and then the gift shop and the tea purchase is extra, so if you&apos;re on a budget you might look to see if there any deals you can get prior to doing this tour."
5,"Have you ever wondered about all that tea that was thrown in the Boston Harbor and what it was all about? Or maybe, you read all about the incident in your high school/middle school books about this crazy historical event that could be compared to our modern day Kardashian gossip. Well, I mean it probably would be more on the likes of 9/11 if we wanted to compare that, but that was 18 years ago... Damn, I&apos;m old.

I digress. The Boston Tea Party Ships &amp; Museum (BTPSM) is pretty much an all around knowledge center all about the Boston Tea Party incident that happened so long ago. And better yet, if you walk around this place there&apos;s a tasting area where you get to drink tea that they threw overboard. Well, not exactly the same tea, but what types of tea that was thrown overboard. It&apos;s not old or fished out of the harbor.

If you decide that you want a whole entire experience of this place, you can purchase a fully dressed up historian explaining to you the monumental incident that early morning in 1776. I also believe you would get a small tour of walking around on the ship as well. I didn&apos;t go for that so, we just walked around the gift shop and tried out their tea in another building that&apos;s connected with a walking bridge.

Like true English, if you want pastries or sweets to go along with your unlimited sips of tea, they also offer it. I don&apos;t have a sweet tooth, but they all looked pretty good though. After a while, I got tired of drinking all of tea, that I pretty much grew up with (all the teas came from China...) that was the end of our experience here. 

If you have kids, or want to teach them about the day when people threw away old, molded Chinese tea in to the sea, this place is perfect for that. I would definitely recommend to those who are history buffs as well, but just don&apos;t outshine the employees here. They take their jobs seriously! Enjoy!"
4,Cool place with several souvenirs. They sell bricks of tea here. Just like when they did the trading with China. Never seen that. They also have all those nifty refrigerator magnets I like.
4,"This was one of the coolest memorabilia shops my son has ever been. They have replicas of US Constitution, all types of silly costumes and a plethora of assorted memorabilia associated with the American revolution."
5,"I loved this experience. I balked at the price when I first heard it, but I would pay it again right now. It was well worth the money, and we all had a good time. 

The tour is too fun. They assign you a new identity, dress in period clothes, and speak as if they were in the times. Getting to get of the ship was a hoot, but getting to go below deck was even better. 

After that there is a museum, a short film, a tea house withy board games and a patisserie, then a gift shop. It was definitely one of the favorite things off this trip!"
