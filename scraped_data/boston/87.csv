5,"Truly the best place to fall in love with nature 
Each walking path is a different from conifers, bonsai garden and more 
Bird watching paradise"
5,"Must not miss this place if you are in JP  or anywhere near the orange line. Beautiful grounds all year round. They have a new app, sounds like it is educational so you can do more than just wonder what all the trees are. 
It&apos;s very open, so the main paved road is easy for social distancing amidst covid. But strongly encourage the trails.

Please don&apos;t climb on the trees in the arboretum. Verboten."
5,The beauty &amp;  serenity of the Arboretum brings a sense of peace when you visit  We have been going there for decades. First when I was a child with my parents for a Sunday stroll  Then with my husband &amp; our children. Now with my grandkids.  It has been a lifesaver during this pandemic. A place to stretch your legs with a good brisk walk on its many paths &amp; take in the beautiful trees &amp; shrubs while in bloom.   A must visit if you haven&apos;t been there during Lilac season
5,Love this place since I was a kid and still due just be careful of the wild life and at night...
5,Beautiful but I don&apos;t want you to know. I would love to keep this place all to myself. Cannot wait to go back in the summer!
5,"A picture is worth a thousand words and there are so many pictures posted of the arboretum (fun fact, it&apos;s owned by Harvard U) by so many unique Yelpers. There&apos;s nothing that I can say that should make you fall in love with the arboretum. If you get the chance, then you need to come there and breathe the experience yourself... fall in love with the arboretum for yourself!"
5,"Favorite green space in Boston by far! I&apos;ve gone during the summer and spring months and it&apos;s always beautiful. I haven&apos;t been in the fall yet but I&apos;d imagine it&apos;s gorgeous. 

It&apos;s also very easy to follow any social/physical distance regulations while at the arboretum. There&apos;s always plenty of space to pop a squat with friends or significant others if you&apos;re looking to just hang and enjoy the space. 

If it is open and you&apos;re able, I&apos;d recommend checking out the Bonsai collection further towards the back. In my opinion it&apos;s one of the best parts of the arboretum."
4,I didn&apos;t know it myself but this huge park complex is a network of 10 city parks in Boston connected by water channels and park paths. Here are a variety of trees and shrub species from around the globe with each specimen accompanied by a detailed description. The park can be explored in 2 ways. By following the usual route or away from the paved paths. This is just a wonderful place from which you do not want to go anywhere and take million pictures.
5,Great place to go for a walk. Really pretty and peaceful. Lots of different walkways and trails
5,"Such a beautiful place and another addition to the Emerald necklace of Boston. Designed by famed park wizard Olmstead this is another true masterpiece. I love the central hills with look outs all over the park. There is plenty of signage throughout the park detailing locations, programs, and special plantings and trees. I was especially impressed with the world wide expedition program bringing plants from around the world to basically see how they do. Super cool! The views of downtown Boston from the taller hills were exceptional and progides a wonderful quiet space to rest and contemplate. The trails and roads were very well maintained and the plantings and trees were beautiful. This is a treasure of a park and Bostonians and visitors alike should enjoy this wonderful place!"
5,"Love it, have my entire life.  Probably a hidden gem for transplants and those who have never lived or spent quality time in this section of the city.  Frankly, I hope it stays that way."
5,"Birds chirping in the  am the suns  up,fresh air,walk of life â€¼my childhood backyard and training ground"
4,Great spot for walks throughout the day. Parking can be quite difficult. Plan ahead on finding parking on main Street. Recommend side streets as they are less known and may have more parking available.
5,"A beautiful place to walk around, get some quiet time and be left alone in boston. On a warm day you will see everybody and they mama here but you can come and do your own thing as you all awkwardly avoid eye contact. A nice place to catch up, go on a small hike for those who aren&apos;t trying to be super active, or even a nice walk with some ice cream after a date. 

Cute place for photoshoots as well! 

There are also a ton of trees here that i learned about which i really enjoyed. Take your girlfriend, kids, or self here and enjoy the peace! A staple in boston."
5,"Ugh! Love this place! It&apos;s gorgeous year around ... great anytime of day, but really looking forward to summer when all the trees and flowers are blooming!!"
5,One of our favorite places in the city to walk our dogs and sit in the sun. Lovely in spring and fall.
5,"Did a beautiful walk here for several miles.  If you are looking for something to do while in the Boston area, this is a nice walk."
5,"This is a beautiful place to walk around or even jog. I have come here to take photos because the scenery is absolutely beautiful. If you&apos;re looking for a good place to take photos then the arboretum is a good place to go. 

I also love that as you&apos;re walking through the arboretum , you can learn more about the trees and flowers. It&apos;s great if you want to learn more about the history of the plants there as well just take photos and enjoy the scenery. They do guided tours if people are interested."
4,Great place for a walk... dog friendly and well maintained. Paved paths or a walk in the woods. Great place to bring the kids.
5,"This is an amazing outdoor spot--I live in JP and it always amazes me that this little (but not that little!) oasis is in the midst of the city. Beautiful during Lilac season, rose season, rhododendron season, spots to lay out, smell the flowers, bird watch, pond watch, hike in the trees, learn about different plants, bike around, run--it&apos;s just a wonderful spot. Highly recommended."
