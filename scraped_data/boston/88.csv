5,"Wow wow wow was this place delicious! Both oat milk latte and custom made bagel were so good. The coffee milk was frothed very well and the bagel was big, filling, flavorful, fresh, and warm. Our cashier, Sophia, was super friendly and helpful. She was very patient with me changing my order last minute and taking some time to decide--much appreciated. Sophia was truly lovely! She also seemed very passionate about the place and being in the coffee realm. 
There are a lot of food choices. You can make you&apos;re own yummy breakfast sandwich or choose from their lunch menu with many healthy options. I was really pleased with what they offer. However, I did notice there were no bakery items, not sure if they sold out or if it&apos;s a sanitary measure.
The place was a bit crowded and we were asked to wait outside for our orders. They did nicely pack out bagels and brought them out to us--a nice gesture. They brought our coffee out earlier which was cool because then we had them while we briefly waited. Parking is very difficult since almost all the streets around are resident permit only. There is no dining due to COVID-19, though I believe they normally do from what I could see in the back.
For an oat milk latte, mocha latte, and two bagels we paid around $25."
5,Stopped here this morning for a toasted everything bagel with lox and all the fixings. Ordering and paying ahead of time was easy and our takeout bag was waiting for us when we arrived. We stopped at a nearby park to eat outside. Perfect Saturday breakfast. We will be back!
3,"I recently moved into the area and was excited to try out the local coffee shops as I am an avid coffee drinker. The hazelnut latte and pain au chocolat I ordered were tasty, but unfortunately, like i&apos;ve noticed a couple of other reviewers mention, the service was less than satisfactory and very off-putting. 

When I asked if they had outdoor seating (which based off pictures they do and has been open during covid) I was met with a rude response which included &quot;That&apos;s why there&apos;s a massive barricade.&quot; Not only was it likely clear I was a new customer who wouldn&apos;t know you can&apos;t access the outdoor seating from inside the shop, but it was also very condescending. 

I also heard the same barista mock an online order who had mistakenly ordered a bagel they were out of. When calling the customer, the barista rudely remarked &quot;the ones I just said&quot; after the customer presumably asked for the available options. When the call ended the barista continued the mockery by saying to her coworker &quot;She said &apos;Thank you for calling me,&apos; like uhhh.... what was i supposed to do?&quot; to which both girls laughed and were easily overheard by the line of people waiting for the orders.

All in all, my order was satisfying (though I don&apos;t understand why they couldn&apos;t warm my pastry - a personal big pet peeve for me at cafes), but the service put a really large dent in the whole experience. I may be back for study space when their seating opens, but not because they&apos;ve left a great impression on me. 

It&apos;s really easy to be kind and welcoming."
5,"Love the location, company logo, and the inside of this place! Their small little bagels are also very solid. I did a deep-dive review on them if you want to watch!

3,Got a Cortado and thought the taste of it was definitely on the bitter side. Might try these guys again for a flavored espresso drink to see how that goes.
4,"We stopped here to get a cup of coffee and breakfast and everything was delicious. I got an almond latte and the coffee was solid. They have a good selection of pastries and breakfast/lunch items.

There is seating inside and outside in the back. The back is cute and there are trees that provide shade.

Great place to hang out and read a book."
5,"Wonderful place to work. The staff is nice (I asked them to taste my croissant and it made a world of difference). The almond croissant is so buttery and flaky, and dense in the middle (with a nice layer of almond paste). The WiFi though was a bit slow. But otherwise a relaxing cafe to stay for hours"
4,"This is such a cute coffee shop with massive windows overlooking a gorgeous South End street. In non-COVID times, I would spend hours here reading and enjoying the atmosphere. I ordered an americano which was 4/5. The espresso was pretty average but I would come back in the future."
5,"Very much enjoyed Render Coffee. The menu is extensive, I was overwhelmed with the choices. Absolutely great menu... Americano was my favorite without a doubt. Service was good and everyone working here was extremely nice and hospitable. I recommend it."
3,"Something&apos;s changed in the past year since I first had Render. On my first Boston trip, I was obsessed with their malted cold brew and Potato/egg/rosemary breakfast bagel. 

Since moving to the area, I&apos;ve had time to come study here every few weeks. And honestly, I&apos;m not impressed. The cold brew is just as bitter and..not smooth. Tastes similar to Starbucks which is just bad coffee. The malted version tastes no better. The last time I came I had a Chai Latte which tasted just like milk with a light peppering of spice. No thank you. If I wanted to spend $5 on an overpriced drink, I&apos;ll go somewhere where it tastes good. 

The upside to this place is the ample study space. Lots of outlets, lots of tables."
5,"Hazelnut latte was very nutty, I fell in love with every sip and there cold brew was fantasticccc. Definitely recommending to my west coast family."
5,Some of the best coffee in Boston! Just delivered to my roommate her lightly sweetened vanilla iced latte and she said &quot;that is the most perfectly sweetened vanilla iced latte I&apos;ve ever had... this barista literally made the perfect iced latte.&quot; It&apos;s not too overly sweet but the flavor is perfect. Highly recommend. And the shop is cute for when we can ever sit inside at places again.
5,"Really cute coffee shop in the back bay (: 

I&apos;m not local to Boston and was only in town for a conference, but I found this place on Yelp.  Their delicious malt iced coffee is what attracted me to this place because it showed that they have unique drink options.  

I got there at around 8am on a Saturday, there were already a few people in the store but it wasn&apos;t too busy.  However, during the half hour I spent there a steady flow of people came in and out of the shop, many staying, many obviously returning customers.  It was so obvious that the workers formed close relationships with the local patrons and that many people frequently visited the coffee shop as part of their daily routine.  

I ended up getting an Americano because I wasn&apos;t feeling a sweet drink, and they were happy to help me customize my order.  There are also plenty of food options.  There is outdoor and indoor seating including some indoor seating in a very pretty enclosed patio.  

If I lived in the back bay, this would definitely be my go to coffee shop"
3,"Update:

I&apos;ve been a regular for about 6 years now and as another reviewer pointed out, some recent changes haven&apos;t been very positive. Most of the new staff at this location are grumpy on a good day, and straight-up rude on a bad day. One in particular has turned me away twice when I&apos;ve come in for coffee 15-20 minutes before closing. Needless to say I wasn&apos;t happy about that, but said absolutely nothing to them on either occasion. That hasn&apos;t stopped them from going out of their way to make sub-par drinks for me as a result. You can see how the drink in my photo compares to everyone else&apos;s. It&apos;s about 50% bitter foam. I&apos;m not happy paying $5 for that."
5,Render is a south end staple. The best coffee in the south end. I&apos;ve lived here for 8 years. Breakfast is super good. And the wraps are big and great for lunch. Also the people are good humans. Great spot. Great people.
5,"I decided to go to this place because I heard great reviews about their specialize drinks. I decided to get their hazelnut latte. It features a house made syrup, so I knew that I wouldn&apos;t be able to get the same drink anywhere else. No I&apos;m not a big fan of coffee to preface, however I really enjoyed this drink. You can really taste hazelnut in almost every step you take. So if you&apos;re not a big fan of hazelnut then definitely do it or did this drink ha ha! I really love that they have a lot of Sweet and savory options, so you&apos;ll be able to have a full breakfast at render coffee. It&apos;s a pretty spacious area. There&apos;s a couple of seats in the front of the shop, and then there&apos;s additional seating in the back. It seems like there was a lot of noise when I went because it was mid afternoon. But I think if you have headphones in you can get a lot of work done definitely."
2,"I happened to pass by, and I love finding new shops to frequent. The customer service and the coffee however were a bit of a letdown. 
We walked in and headed towards the counter, no friendly welcome or even a smile. Throughout the ordering process, I felt like I was inconveniencing them almost lol. For most places I wouldn&apos;t mind, but from a local coffee shop I&apos;d expect more warmth and friendliness. 

But the biggest letdown for me was the coffee. I ordered a cold brew, and my girlfriend got an americano. Cold brew is one of my go-tos when I want a smoother and sweeter drink, and what I got from Render wasn&apos;f that. It just tasted off, and I honestly didn&apos;t want to drink anymore of it after two sips. 
And the americano, it was okay, pretty average but not exceptional."
3,They take a long time to prepare food items. They have three staff members. So it&apos;s not like they&apos;re overwhelmed. They&apos;re mainly making coffee drinks from walk in customers. There are a few online pick ups maybe once every five minutes or so. But it takes them over 20 minutes to make a sandwich. Plus none of the staff are personable.
4,"A nice place to relax and work on your laptop. Free wi-fi, but I believe you have a limit of up to two hours. Makes sense--they have a decent amount of space, but they&apos;re still a small/medium-sized coffee shop and can&apos;t have everyone camping out here all at once. The bathroom was clean, though there&apos;s often a line.

I ordered a ham and cheese croissant, a large black coffee, and an orange juice. I enjoyed their coffee more than the orange juice, though I tend to be picky with my OJ as a Florida native--besides, most people come to coffee shops for coffee, anyways. The croissant was nice and flaky, perfect for a hearty snack.

If you need to plug in your device, there aren&apos;t too many outlets."
5,"For fun I taste test as many lattes at various cafes in the city.  Render is one of the few who know how to make a Latte correctly.

I had a great pour today.

If you are a coffee snob like me then render is your coffee house.

BTW, the barista was very courteous and I enjoyed her kindness."
