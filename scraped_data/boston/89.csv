5,"After visiting the North End for decades, even after relocating to Los Angeles, we tripped over this Italian treat. Thanks to the well-spaced line of customers patiently waiting in the cold, we figured this was something to get in on. They are not the quickest, so if you&apos;re looking for Subway-style service, well, go to Subway.

The shop: It&apos;s a clean and well-organized, though narrow space. Two people worked to complete orders of sandwiches and fresh-sliced meats and cheeses. Two others went back and forth, restocking and checking customers at the register. Tons of other items are up for sale, from snacks to Italian/European beverages, to fresh-made pasta. Customers kept to no more than 4 people in the deli area. 

The food: The Italian sub and the Italian Tri-Tip sub were beyond our expectations. They were heaven on fresh bread. The tri-tip was tender, moist and perfectly seasoned. As you bit into it and made your way to the back of the roll, you hit the hots and veggies that perfectly balanced the meal (yes, this sub was more than just a sandwich). The Italian sub with cold cuts was flavorful and fresh. Stacked with meats and veggies, every bite was as delicious as the first. 

The service: The two men that were preparing were direct and short, but not impolite. They had a job to do. They did it right and they moved on. The two women that were at the register and restocking were constantly busy and clearly able to balance all the other tasks that needed to be maintained in order to keep this place running in tip top shape.

Overall: If you&apos;re into sandwiches or hot subs, or if you just want to fresh sliced meats and cheeses, this place is a great spot to hit. It&apos;s just outside of the main hustle and bustle of the North End, but not too far off. The narrow alley accommodates a single car, making it perfect to eat in the middle of the street without masks while allowing others to safely walk by (it&apos;s the little things). I would, and definitely will, go back on my next visit to Boston."
4,"Wow! The sandwiches are outstanding at Monica&apos;s. The bread was in a category of it&apos;s own.i ordered 3x Italian subs and 1x chicken cutlet at $15 bucks a pop totaling $60. 

Again, the sub was outstanding and even better the next day. I see why Monica&apos;s is known to the the best in the city!

My only complaint was the customer service while putting in the order."
5,"What&apos;s there left to say about Monica&apos;s? Everything they do is high quality. Amazing deli selection. Handcrafted subs. Solid beer selection. 

My favs are the Italian and chicken parm. 

Just don&apos;t be so intimated when you&apos;re in line. I dunno what it is. But people get overwhelmed and clam up when they get inside this place. It&apos;s ok to ask them questions and stuff. Lol."
5,I was visiting family and we were looking to grab some lunch on our way home. I couldn&apos;t say no when they asked if I wanted &quot;the best sandwiches in this part of town.&quot; I got the chicken cutlet sandwich and it was so yummy. Sandwiches are all about the bread but their balsamic is what gave the sandwich its unique kick!
5,"I&apos;ll keep this review simple: absolutely delicious and fresh Italian meats, cheeses and salads in the North End. If you&apos;re looking for the best deli ingredients to put on a sub, the sandwiches here are truly heavenly. The staff is quick and just really good at what they do, which makes this a super popular spot with the locals.

The cappicola and provolone special is the closest thing to a Primanti Brothers sandwich I can get in Boston, so I have to come here often. If you&apos;re in the North End, you&apos;ve got to check it out!"
4,"This place  is it ..Italian cold cut sub forget about.... best of best  Freshes is the key here everything is top quality from the bread ,oil veggies  A.k.a. tomato &amp; Red onion.. i&apos;m not sure but 24 hour Italian bakery next-door May have something to do freshens Of the Italian roll---the meat melt in your mouth mortadella, Prosciutto, and little bit This and .....Makes this the best of  North end....

5,"Excellent Italian deli on Salem St. cooking delicious fresh sandwiches all day long!
The Italian is the best in Boston and I&apos;m saying there&apos;s a lot of excellent places , but Monica&apos;s is the a step above them. 
Homemade rolls and fresh sliced meats with delicious veggies and cheese is how they keep it fresh and delicious!
Great service and nice little selection of wines, cheeses, and fresh pastas. 
If you haven&apos;t been here then you have to go!
Two thumbs up!"
5,"Ok people.....this is why you visit Boston!....
I mean, yes, the history....yes, business obligation....but, the real reason???....
I&apos;m convinced it is all for the food!  The Italian Sub hubby and I just shared has COMPLETELY ruined any other sandwich I will ever eat...which is super sad, because I live about 2500 miles away from Boston, but gives me a super good reason to return!
Ok, the bread!  Super light, gorgeous semolina bottomed, but just hefty enough to hold all of the goods.  The prosciutto,mortadella,salumi,provalone.....all real deal.  Suprised at how paper thin it was sliced, flavor for miles, and not at all salty.  Fresh crisp romaine, red onion, oil and balsamic, tomato and.....the hot gardinere!  Sublime!
Hubby and I are happy!"
4,"This was pre covid and I was at the airport when ppl watching and strolling was fun! We had lots of time to kill , so we were hunting for a good place to eat, we saw this had good reviews, we ordered the bruschetta, pizza, and their pasta! It was a little too much for 3 people, the pizza was amazing, the cheese was melting in the mouth, one of the best ever, the bruschetta was pretty nice too, the pasta was good but nothing extraordinary, for an airport exp, I must say it kept me entertained quite a bit"
4,"It&apos;s no surprise why people flock to Monica&apos;s Mercato to appease their sandwich cravings. With its crusty bread and prominent balsamic notes, the Italian steak tip sub that I tried was a definite winner. It also came with provolone, lettuce, tomato, onion, and a bunch of pickles. The small size cost $13 but was more than enough to keep me satiated throughout the day. Would love to try their classic Italian sub next time I&apos;m back!"
5,"We&apos;ve visited Boston once to twice per year for the past three years. Monica&apos;s is always consistently good. From the original review:

Just so good. Seriously. A real little Italian deli in an area that can be uber-touristy. On our first visit, we got subs and wine. Fantastic subs. Excellent quality, and very generous portions. The mediums here are bigger than larges at most other places. And the prices are exceedingly good, especially given the location. Would happily eat subs from here on a very regular basis if we lived in the area.

The place also has freshly made Italian dishes, such as little lasagnas. You must be lucky enough, however, to visit soon after a special is put out for sale, because once the batch is gone, it is gone, and that happens very quickly.

An important tip. Some of the best things we&apos;ve had here haven&apos;t appeared to be for sale. For instance, I was looking in the deli case, and saw in the very back, mostly wrapped in paper, what appeared to be a ham. Obviously not on display for sale. (Turned out to be a component of one of the types of subs.) But I asked the guy behind the counter if I could get a half pound, and he sliced it for me without a problem. Just about the best ham we&apos;ve ever eaten. Another example. Taleggio is my favorite Italian cheese, but there was none in the case. I asked, and lo and behold, there was some Taleggio behind the counter. And not the fresh, mild Taleggio, but aged Taleggio, all stinky and creamy. Yum. So, don&apos;t be afraid to ask or point out. 

There is a small but good selection of wine, in a range of prices. Whether you buy the $10 bottle or the $50 bottle, it will be molto tasty. (That&apos;s a sophisticated oenophile term.)

BTW, this is a deli, not a restaurant. Nowhere to sit."
5,"This place was recommended to be via a group of sandwich aficionados (which I also consider myself to be) on the internet. After seeing a picture of their perfect Italian sando, I had to give it a try.

The place is impeccably clean and charming and full of lots of little food items and things to look at while you&apos;re waiting on your food. The guy behind the counter was friendly, and I had my sandwich quickly.

All the elements of the perfect sandwich were there: moist but not falling apart, perfectly baked bread, proper construction and order of ingredients, and the best combo of sweet, tangy and fresh flavors. They also pile on the thinly sliced meats, and honestly it was the best Italian sandwich I&apos;ve ever had."
5,"The absolute best sandwiches in the North End, and perhaps in Boston. They are huge, filling, and really high quality and delicious.

Downside? It&apos;s historically been a very long line, which is slow because they are cutting everything to order (good), but also because they are making food for the restaurant across the street (not so good).

But I think it&apos;s well worth the wait. Highly recommend the Chicken Parm, Steak Tip, the Meatbull, their feature special, and pretty much everything else!

Edit: Review is for the food only. Not the service, speed, or the ownership."
5,"Great subs! Interesting selection of meats. I ordered the steak tip grinder, but it was covered in barbecue sauce. It was tasty just not what I expected. I guess I should read the menu closer. There was about six in our party everyone else loved what they got. Super friendly staff. Super busy on a Sunday."
5,"I have been trying to duplicate this sandwich at home. I suck.  Mine taste like sunway so let&apos;s be real they slice the meat right I front of you. Super thin. That&apos;s the key. And the flavor of the meat is perfect not to salty. The provolone sliced thin as well but they don&apos;t skimp. The balsamic glaze with the olive oil and hots. Oh man I can&apos;t wait.  I got a large one for me and my honey and 2 small to take home to California for my boys. He begged me.  He said &quot;mom , just mail it&quot;this kid.  I need to figure out what @the hots&quot;are what brand ect. So maybe I can try to improve on my California version of my favorite North End sandwich. Love this place. Will go everytime I&apos;m in Boston."
5,"I don&apos;t know who Monica is but she makes some amazing sandwiches. It is located on one of the main streets of North End, otherwise known as little Italy and there&apos;s usually a line out of the door. You can smell their fresh bread and steak being cooked while you stand outside and enjoy the views of Salem st. It&apos;s very a authentic area with a ton of history so you can walk around It&apos;s a small spot so only a few people can stand inside and order at a time but they slice all of their meat fresh and bake any sausages, steak or chicken Parmesan right on the spot so it&apos;s more than worth it. They usually have a special of the day which is amazing and so worth it. Last time we went we had the sausage and pepper sandwich, the Italian sub and a steak tip salad with so many fresh grilled vegetables they did not disappoint. The move is to take whatever you get there and walk over to the rose kennedy greenway and have a nice picnic it is a must try spot."
3,"Love this place! All of it is made from scratch and you can taste it. Amazing soups as well. The Italian beef sandwich is beyond words. The meat is shaved, the au jus is delicious, and the pickled veggies on top gives it a nice punch. I would highly recommend eating here. It&apos;s clean, friendly, and feels like a true family run business. My friend recommended it and it did not disappoint for a little sandwich outing for my lil brothers birthday. Definitely one of the best Italian deli spots in the city"
5,This place is amazing! Best sub I have ever had. The meat and cheeses were shaved for every order and the prices were reasonable. Definitely a great place to go and get an incredible sub.
4,"An amazing tasty Sandwich shop in Bostons Italian North End. I went to Monica&apos;s Mercato because of the rave reviews. And as well a the boast of have the &quot;Best Italian Sub&quot; in the North End.

Well My Wife went in for I&apos;m in a wheelchair and sadly Monica&apos;s Mercato is not wheelchair accessible. But that&apos;s Old School Boston for you not a problem as long as you have someone with you that walks.

So my my wife goes in and orders 1 large Italian Sub &amp; 1 1 large Chicken Pharm. Sub. roughly 20 mins. later she come out and we tucked in to the to Sub Sandwiches.

They where oh so yummy. We both thought the Italian Sub was high quality, fresh &amp; delicious. To me being Italian myself and have had scores of Italian Subs in my life. As for the &quot;Best Italian Sub&quot; in the North End.

I would have to give is a maybe, until I try Bostons other Italian Subs in the North End. The Sub for me was very salty &amp; a bit dry. I enjoyed the fresh Roll &amp; homemade cured meats they put on the Sub. 

We enjoyed the Chicken Pharm. Sub. more. 2 Large Subs her were $13 each. Very large above average Subs I would absolutely come here again. Try it for yourself"
1,This place has AWFUL service. I ordered 3 sandwiches which they told me would be done in 20 minutes. After 45 minutes they were still not ready. I told them I neeed the sandwiches asap because I had a train to catch and they told me they were currently making them and it would only be 5 minutes. After another 10 minutes I had to leave WITHOUT any sandwiches WHICH I PAID FOR because I had to catch my train. They didn&apos;t even start making the order even after I told them I was going to be late!! Complete rip off and waste of money. So rude and so disappointing. I&apos;m in awe at the lack of customer service.
