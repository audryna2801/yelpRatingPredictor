5,"Stopped by for lunch on a weekday. Walked in with no wait. 
Amazing pastas! Large portions. Especially loved calamari and mussels. Cozy place and now has COVID shields up."
5,"Be sure to make a reservation way ahead of time!!! 

I was excited to try Carmelina&apos;s after hearing so many friends rave about it on their trip to Boston. Located in North End, there&apos;s a good amount of outdoor and limited indoor seating. It was soo busy even at 9pm on a Saturday. 

To start, we had the fried calamari to share. I had the spaghetti with little neck clams in tomato sauce and my bf had the fettuccini carmelina. Both came out in the serving size of a whole ass pan. Serving sizes are huge, we probably could&apos;ve gotten away with sharing one pasta dish. The spaghetti with clams had such good tomato and white wine flavor and the fettuccini tasted like all the seafood that was mixed in. 

The service was fast and the food came out in an ok time. The exploding little neck clams and carbonara also sounded really yummy, I&apos;d come back just to try it lol. Carmelina&apos;s was definitely a highlight to our trip and a reason to come back though!!"
5,Absolutely worth the hype!  Everything was perfect. The pasta was fresh and delicious.  Covid safety precautions were completely in place.  Service was top notch.  Place is small and it&apos;s always packed so plan ahead.
5,"This is my third time coming here &amp; definitely my favorite Italian restaurant in the North End.  If you plan to come on any weekend I highly recommend reserving as far as you can in advance.

For appetizers, I always get the Ahi Tuna Arrabbiata (so amazing).  For the main entrees my favorite so far is the Penne Gorgonzola (such a unique flavor that is pretty much unbeatable).  The Sunday Macaroni is a good option but in my opinion the dish is not very memorable as the meat is a hit or miss.

Carmelina&apos;s as a restaurant doesn&apos;t offer dessert but there are plenty of places around in the North End to get dessert (ex. Mike&apos;s Pastry is right across the street for one).

Would definitely recommend- looking forward to trying some more of their options!"
5,"I have been to Carmelina&apos;s three times now and the reason why I do t have any photos to share if that my stomach actually eats first here, leaving my phone dry. 

To be honest, this place has enough views to justify why it is one of the best Italian restaurants in North End and Boston so I don&apos;t think I need to say more. However you slice it, from ambiance, service to food portion/quality/price. The combination is just unbeatable. 

If you are still reading this, don&apos;t, and go make a reservation because you will have a fantastic experience."
5,"100% will always come here every time I&apos;m in Boston. Reservations are made through Yelp, and highly recommended, due to size of resturant. This past summer and fall, they had outdoor dining. Our two dishes attached were AMAZING. Cannot think of one thing wrong with them. I&apos;ve also had the meatballs as an appetizer, and the gnocchi which is also AMAZING!! 
Cash or card. Lots of wine choices, Italian based. Other cocktails and beer available. 
Nicer, but still casual atmosphere, no need for a sports coat or anything. 
Only issue I would say is sometimes their are only 2 servers, so it makes service a bit slower when the place is full up. 
10/10 recommend"
3,"So this is how fresh gnocchi taste like.. yes I am not an expert in gnocchi so I don&apos;t have anything to compare it to. The texture was doughy and quite thick, delicious sauce, but we just couldn&apos;t finish it..

The mushroom appetizer was great, if you&apos;re a fan of goat cheese, which my friends are so they enjoyed it a lot more than I did.

The crazy Alfredo was my personal favorite. Though the pasta was quite thick, the flavors were on point, or I should say, most familiar with.

I wish I could give it another star if I could acquaint myself with these dishes more but I couldn&apos;t. Pls don&apos;t mind my review if these dishes are what you&apos;re used to, as to what they&apos;re supposed to be. Don&apos;t let my inexperience sway you from trying.."
5,"This was the first restaurant we ate at once we landed in Boston.  We already knew that we had to have reservations beforehand, because of the long wait time and how small this place is.  We had reservations at 3:00 and were seated pretty much at that time.  Ordered some drinks, ordered our food right away, because it was already past lunch.

I&apos;ve had some amazing Italian dishes from all over this country and abroad, but I have to say that these dishes go right on top of our list as all time best!

We ordered the Carbonara and a dish called Crazy Fettuccine.  Both dishes were just flat out amazing!  Hands down probably the best Carbonara I have ever eaten.  They pasta was perfectly cooked, al dente and the flavor was perfect as well.  There was so much food, each dish could be shared and still get you full.  We had to take leftovers back to the hotel and that is what I ate later on that night.  They Crazy Fettuccine was also on point.  It had chicken, and other stuff I can&apos;t think of right now, but no matter, just take my word for it, it was amazing!  It does come with a light heat to it, but that just makes the dish shine.

If you are ever in Boston, make reservations and enjoy some of the best authentic Italian food in Boston."
5,"Carmelina&apos;s, bookmarked by me, almost two weeks before we actually came here (like a veritable psychopath), turned out to be one of my favorite dinners of the year. We were seated outside, and while it was a typical Late-October chilly night in Boston, the propane heaters provided all the warmth we needed. Our courteous host also came outside to point the heater directly at our table, fearing that the weather may be a bit cold for us. 

As for the food, I took one look at the most popular item on yelp and ordered the Crazy Alfredo. Because I&apos;m not a fan of spicy food, i was initially apprehensive about the spicy alfredo sauce, but it wasn&apos;t bad at all, and actually provided a very complimentary, unique kick to the fettuccine. As with all authentic Italian dishes, the portion of chicken and sausage was very generous and I managed to finish it all (patting myself on the back at the end) I feel comfortable in saying this was the best Italian Food I&apos;ve ever had and I will keep yelp updated for sure, when I find something better."
5,"This is f-ing amazing. The pesce pistachio, gnocchi and carbonara are all amazing. Special shout out to the fish dish. Boy that was good. 
Welcome bread is great. We may have asked for more of that ;)
Visited during Covid time, the place is well safeguarded with Plastic separators, nicely spaced."
5,"I had the fettuccini carmelina, and it was one of the best Italian dishes that I&apos;ve ever had. The pasta and sauce were done to perfection, and there were plenty of scallops, chicken, sausage, and more. The portion was also extremely filling-- I would say that I am a big eater and I had left overs. For the north end it is fair priced.

The restaurant was flung only outdoor seating and all of the staff were taking proper safety precautions."
5,"There aren&apos;t words to describe how amazingly good this place was. Location location location, Carmelinas is located in the awesome old North Boston on a busy street with some outdoor seating available as well. I love the ambience of this place and the attitude, they know they&apos;re great and they proved it. The food was divine and easily the best I had while in Boston. I had the crazy Alfredo and it was just beyond delicious and easily some of the best pasta and Italian cooking I&apos;ve ever had. They are on the Yelp top 100 list for a good reason and they don&apos;t disappoint even a bit. They are a little tough to actually get into due to their small size and COVID causing issues for everybody so make sure to call ahead for a reservation or even takeout if possible. So delicious, I can&apos;t wait to come back to this must visit restaurant!"
5,"WOW! WOW! WOW! Carmelina&apos;s was amazing. We stopped by for dinner on a Friday night with two friends that were visiting the area. One happened to be from Italy, so I was a little nervous to say the least because I wanted the experience to be authentic and as a non-Italian I took a leaf and boy did it pay off. This place is certified great Italian food and for everyone wondering the staff and owner all speak Italian. 

All the seating was outside and the tables were cleaned and it was cozy but felt safe. They served warm fresh out the oven bread out the oven with a bit of oil, it was lovely and I could eat this all day. We started off with 2 bottles of wine, the fried calamari and caprese appetizer. Both were great and I would recommend - a bit on the lighter side but great options.

For the main meals, we got the Gnocchi al Forno, Spaghetti with Littleneck Clams, Sunday Macaroni and Tonno con Pesto Siciliano. Each dish was crafted  to perfection and everyone left full and satisfied. Out of all the dishes I would say portion wise the Sunday Macaroni and the Clams were the biggest. But, whatever you chose I&apos;m sure you will be happy. 

While they don&apos;t have dessert on the menu, Mike&apos;s Pastry&apos;s is right next door and a good spot for dessert after."
5,"After seeing this place on the Yelp 100 list, I had to try it out
And I&apos;m glad I did

The place is quite small and you will need a reservation. That said, it is very worth it

I got the crazy alfredo and really loved the balance of the sauce, the thickness of the noodles

For sure a must try if you haven&apos;t explored the North End or you are looking for a good date night"
5,"My friend had done some research before our trip to Boston and Carmelina&apos;s was high on her list of must-visit restaurants. I don&apos;t actually remember if we had a reservation, but I remember waiting out in the cold for about an hour or so for the food. 

We were seated after a decent one-hour wait. It was impossible to wait inside because of the limited amount of space. I remember thinking the tables next to us were very close to us, and I had to scooch very carefully otherwise my purse would knock someone over. The waitress we had was very nice and took our orders promptly. We decided to order more than we could eat because we had waited for a while. And we managed to finish everything that we ordered. The clams were so good I wanted to ask for extra bread so I can dip it into the sauce and then wipe the plate clean. All the dishes were exploding with flavor, which went very well with a glass of white wine or bubbly. I highly recommend coming here, I loved the bustling atmosphere, and i didn&apos;t feel uncomfortable being seated so close to other tables, it actually was quite a friendly feel. And when you are done with the meal, simply walk across the street to get some cannoli!"
2,"Crazy Alfredo was delicious but the mozz sticks were soggy and not tasty (plus cost $14). Also, I asked them to sub out red meat for the crazy Alfredo and they did not. I asked them for silverware and the welcome bread, neither were included. I had to find a way to eat it in a hotel with no service. Really disappointed."
3,"Expectations were far too high prior to coming. For the appetizer, we ordered Exploding Little Neck Clams and they were not cleaned properly (soooo much sand). The amount of sand in the clams were REPULSIVE. From that point on, I was already nervous to eat the shellfish from my Frutti Di Mare entree. Didn&apos;t know it automatically comes with capellini (thought it would be linguine). Would recommend substituting for a different pasta. Wasn&apos;t a fan of this dish! 

Would recommend ordering:
Bellini
Crazy Alfredo"
4,"I&apos;m super impressed with this place! Plenty of outdoor seating during COVID times, the staff was attentive, and the food/drinks are delicious!

I ordered the crazy alfredo which I thought was so good!! The sauce was amazing and the pasta was cooked perfectly. My boyfriend had the sunday macaroni which was also very good, but a little too heavy for my preference.

Huge portions so make sure to come hungry!"
4,"My true rating would be a 4.5!

Ive attempted to get a reservation at Carmelina&apos;s for the longest time but I was finally able to do it! I made the reservation through yelp and we were seated on their patio. The patio was really cute but the umbrellas could not cover all the tables. My seat/table, which were only partially covered, got extremely hot. The table was a metal table and I genuinely felt like I was getting burnt every time I accidentally touched it. But table/umbrella choice aside, the overall experience was great! Our server was attentive even though we were in the far end of the patio. 

My friend and I both ended up ordering the Gnocchi al forno so this review is just for the gnocchi. It was very good! The gnocchi was both chewy and firm (a little more firm that I would have liked). The portion was very generous that I had plenty of leftovers to take home. I wish the mozzarella was melted a little more to allow bigger cheese pull. The tomato sauce was very flavorful and the fresh basil was a cherry on top! I did notice a little pool of oil that maybe have come from the mozzarella.

So if you do not want a really heavy meal, I highly suggest the gnocchi from Carmelina&apos;s."
5,"My taste buds were in heaven after I finally experienced the magical experience that is Carmelina&apos;s. I&apos;ve had this place on my list pretty much since I moved to the city and even with all the hype from my friends, I was still pleasantly surprised with how much I enjoyed every aspect of my meal. I love writing 5-star reviews and this place definitely earned it.

We started by ordering a bottle of the Montepulciano, the mussels and the garlic shrimp served in a pan. The sauces on our seafood were divine, I could have licked the garlic sauce right out of the pan. Very fresh and full of flavor. For our main entrees, we devoured the Penne Gorganzola and the Chicken Parm. The gorganzola sauce is rich and creamy without too strong of the cheese taste. It&apos;s fantastic. The chicken parm is definitely one of the best I&apos;ve ever had the pleasure of trying - the meat was super tender and cooked perfectly. Given that everything we ordered turned out exceptional, I&apos;d try anything on the menu.

The ambiance was ideal, the outdoor seating is serene while still being able to take in the views of the North End. Out waiter Cesar was great, he gave awesome recommendations and was super attentive. I&apos;m very much looking forward to my next visit!"
