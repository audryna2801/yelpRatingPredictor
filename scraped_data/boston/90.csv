5,"This is a review for dinner outdoors on July 25, 2020. 

The City has allowed Orinoco to put tables in a beautiful gated (but public) garden behind the restaurant.  I had no idea this small garden/park was even there, but it&apos;s cooler temperature-wise than out on the street, and wonderful in every way. 

The service, as always, is great. The food, as always, is also very good, possibly the best value around when you consider the prices. I had the tuna for dinner and the cider-soaked ribs as an appetizer. All I can say is, order those ribs -- you&apos;ll be very happy (the ribs can also be ordered as an entree). 

Is Orinoco&apos;s hidden garden the best relatively unknown gem in Boston? Possibly. I hope the City allows them to keep serving there, post-pandemic."
5,"To start off we had to get these cheesy tuequeños which is filled with guyanese cheese &amp; wrapped in a flakey dough The cheese was super good, kind of like mozzarella, but not quite as salty and the dough added a perfect hint of sweetness! Next we had the Arepa Jardinera which is a vegetarian option filled with guyanese cheese, guasacaca (which is like an avocado spread, not similar to the Dominican sauce) and sweet plantain! The dough of the arepa could&apos;ve had a little more flavor but the fillings definitely made up for it For entrees we had the Adobo Smoked Churrasco AND WOW when I tell y&apos;all this is one of the best steak I&apos;ve ever had- Big steakhouses might have some competition! super juicy, super tender, and I think what made it even better was the panela-red wine glaze on top which was sweet but not too overpowering. We also had the Cordero Tradicional which is their lamb chomp dish. It&apos;s topped off with a pistachio, panela &amp; plantain crust and as a sauce on the side they used a mint mojo, much more earthy taste than steak if that&apos;s what you&apos;re looking for but just as good! If you ever find yourself in that part of town, you won&apos;t regret stepping in!"
4,"Nice Latin food with a great family/restaurant history behind it.
The food goes way beyond just arepas.

My favorite here are the plaintains stuffed with halloumi cheese.
There are a couple of tables inside but luckily their presence in a small corner allows them to put dining tables outside.
The patio has a pretty eating area as well.

Customer service isn&apos;t enthusiastic but they are nice"
3,"Empanada trio sampler was very good. The Carne asada and cheese one were my favorite. Service was good. Neat hidden location with a nice interior ambiance. They have 2 other locations. Arepas were a bit cold to where the cheese wasn&apos;t melted and the guacamole cold cooling it even more. The plantein could&apos;ve been a little softer to my taste. My mother&apos;s Venezuelan and makes better arepas than this. &apos;It aint like mama fixed it.&apos; 
Bathrooms were clean. $36 for 3 of us with waters."
5,"The prices, quality and taste were superb. I highly recommend Orinoco for a night out or to order in."
5,"Haven&apos;t had better latin food in the Boston area until now. Orinoco did everything absolutely right for me. Went here for brunch recently, but I came across this place for the first time during a food tour of the Southend. They&apos;re bacon wrapped dates and sweet plantains will leave your mouth watering for more. 

The eggs and arepas were both on point! The beans were probably more flavored than I would have expected and the shredded pork did not disappoint. I also would recommend their red sangria. 5 stars and a must do in the Southend. 

I think this is a great place for dinner, lunch, and brunch. Basically all of the above! The seating area on the inside is a bit small, but on a Sunday afternoon they aren&apos;t too crowded. Also, the SoWa market is like a 16 minute walk from the restaurant so if you&apos;re looking to make a day out of this you&apos;d definitely have options."
5,"Yum!

Came here for lunch with 5 of my coworkers and we were well fed. Two of us got salads, and the rest got sandwiches that came With  plantain chips. 

I got the remolacha con cabré salad, and it was SO good! That and an appetizer left me satisfied. (The tequenos are delish!)

From from my coworkers said, the sandwiches were AMAZING. Can&apos;t wait to try one. 

If you work  in the area, it&apos;s a great place for lunch."
3,"This restaurant was always bookmarked in my yelp account and I finally had the chance to go on a Thursday night. My boyfriend and I got there at 7:30 and it was not that busy... there were will like 5 tables available inside. We were seated right away and they gave us water + menu right away. After looking at the menu, we were ready but no one came over to take our order until 10 minutes later.

Our arepa came out fast and it was really good. Then our beef empanadas and parrilla caraquena came out a while later. The empanadas were good but the parrilla dish was way too salty so we ordered a side of rice and beans with it. We had to ask our waiter two times before we got it because he forgot... on top of that, we asked our waiter two times for more water because the food was super salty and no one came with water so we drank our own waters from our bag. 

Overall, the service was really bad that night even though it wasn&apos;t busy... and the entree was too salty. I really wanted to like this place..."
4,I was feeling hungry at work so I ordered their Costillitas (ribs served with tostones) via Uber Eats. It was awesome and the food was a generous portion for a cheap price! I&apos;ll definitely order from them again and try them out in person when they allow dine in again. The to-go boxes came sealed with a tamper-seal which I thought was a nice touch.
4,"Pretty darn good. Ordered the Parilla Caraquena sampler platter on a dark, rainy night.

Definitely hit the spot. The seasoned strip steak was tender, the chicken, guasacaca and chorizo were flavorful, and the hot sauce was incredible. Just kept pouring it on even though it made me sweat up a storm.

Great spot to celebrate an occasion for sure."
5,The best random discovery for authentic Venezuelan food. Good arrives quickly. Great customer service. We both ordered sides of yucca and didn&apos;t finish it. The portion size are huge I just only wish there was more plantains. But overall the experience was a good one.
4,"Fantastic authentic Venezuelan food in a really cute part of the South End. Most brunch items are under $10 and everyone around you is speaking Spanish. It&apos;s the perfect place to unwind for a weekend brunch.

I ordered the empanadas, which came as 4 with a bed of greens. Really fluffy and well-prepared and perfectly portioned.

Service was a little slow but extremely friendly. Very much feels like a family spot."
5,"This is a local south end favorite. They opened up more outdoor dining space in the cute garden behind the building. Lined with bistro lights and super romantic -- def worth checking out while it&apos;s still warm enough. On our last visit, my flat iron steak was a bit underdone and they were super easy going about cooking it more and even brought us more truffle fries when it came back out. Service is always exceptional here."
4,"This was my first time trying Caribbean/Venezuelan food, and boy was I missing out this entire time! Everything was so flavorful and the portions were generous. Also the prices are great; everything is under $10 except for the principales (main dishes).

I came with a friend at around noon on a Friday so they had just opened for lunch. There was plenty of seating when we got there but it quickly filled up as I was eating. It&apos;s always a good sign to me when restaurants fill up during peak lunch and dinner hours.

Overall I would recommend this place. I definitely want to come back to try some other things on the menu!"
4,"Advertised as a Caribbean/Venezuelan place but this restaurant is definitely more Venezuelan than Caribbean. We came on a Friday night as a party of two without a reservation and were seated immediately, though the place filled up later. 
The servers were friendly and efficient, and we had no complaints about service. 
I expected little in the way of food, but our meal was fantastic. Both the vegetarian arepas and empanada starter were delicious and cooked well with good flavors and just the right amount in serving size. My husband&apos;s meat dish was bursting with flavor too, and all components of the dish complemented one another. 
Ambience is simple and no frills. 
Recommend for a casual dinner, and would frequent this place if I lived in Boston."
4,"Always a solid spot for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. All the food is delicious and the service is super friendly. 

I had to send my churrasco (steak) back on my last visit. I felt so bad doing this but I had ordered my meat medium rare and what I got was well done. My friend also ordered the same thing and had the same problem. When our food was brought back to us, the meat was still a medium well but less dry and more edible than the first time. The flavors were all there and everything else that night was fantastic. Throughout this whole fiasco, our waiter was more than accommodating."
5,"Orinoco has been a neighborhood staple of the South End for at least the 5 years I&apos;ve lived here. Authentic, delicious Venezuelan food, with the traditional staples, and some more creative dishes.  

No need for reservations on most weekdays, which combined with the reasonably priced fare, delicious food, and excellent service has made Orinoco my favorite local spot."
5,"Great place for dinner. The menu is interesting with great choices. The prices are very fair. And the food is delicious. 

Came in right when it opened at night. Was promptly server and waiter was great. Ordered the lamb chops and asado negro. The lamb chops were amazing. Get them medium well. The asado negro was good for the price. The sauce on it is exciting and adds a lot, the fried plantains were great. 

Overall I highly recommend the place for a dinner out if in the area."
5,"Lived near this place for a few years and when it was ever a doubt for food, we went to Orinoco.   Beautiful restaurant located in a nice quiet neighborhood in the South End.

The staff here are excellent and they treat you like family.

Generous portions, quality food &amp; ingredients, no shortage of flavor.

If you&apos;re a fan of comfort food that&apos;ll fill you up...Pabellón Criollo all day!

Oh yeah - get their hot sauce too, which they sell in bottles."
5,"NOT to be confused with El Centro. Came here after a good 20 minutes of whippin around the area in a Honda Odyssey trying to find parking. Worth it. Ordered a few arepas they were dank. The &quot;mozzarella&quot; in them was p tasty but also my hands smelled like pork for hours after eating this delicious meal. 
As the Bostonians say, muy delicioso. ‍"
