5,"Went for my birthday, lovely place. Truly a &quot;hole-in-the-wall&quot; that is a hidden gem, right in the shadow of Beacon Hill. Great food, great service, and very well-thought-out dining experience for pandemic dining. A new place (to me) that is on the rotation of fine dining in Boston."
5,"This is Boston&apos;s most hidden secret in my opinion.  We&apos;ve been here many times And the food, the atmosphere, and the service never disappoints.  We&apos;ve had the entire menu and I can&apos;t pick a favorite.  I can&apos;t wait until covid19 lifts so we can come back.  I recommend making dinner reservations as it is a gem, but seating is limited.  It has a very romantic ambience, but can get loud during busy.

24July2020: wife and I came here.  Requests outdoor, but it was empty so we sat indoors because we love the ambience.  Went with the garlic soup, carne and tiramisu and my wife had the pasta app, carne, and truffles.  The food is always delicious and the price is excellent value.  We were celebrating so we splurged on a bottle of wine.  Danny, our server was incredible.  So polite, and made our dining experience memorable.  This was our.. I don&apos;t know we&apos;ve been here so many times and will keep coming back.  If I could give this place 10 stars, I would.

Thank you!"
5,"Grotto is one of my favorite restaurants in Boston.  The food is fabulous, the cocktails awesome. The staff delightful.  My favorite part is the very city budget friendly prix fixe menu.  Allows me and all my companions to try a variety of fare.  I really want to go to brunch to try the burger, maybe my next trip, since that is my personal go to at many other places.

The only knock on the place is the bathroom, single stall and a little worse for the wear.  But if that is the worst I can say, I would take it any day over beautiful facades with less than stellar food and drink."
5,"I picked this place for our 1st date night in Boston. My wife &amp; I loved it! The food, the ambiance, &amp; service were A1!"
5,"Came here last Friday for dinner with the bf. On the basement level, this Beacon Hill spot feels romantic yet hole-in-the-wall and serves up a delicious range of Italian specialties. 

Service was above and beyond. Upon arrival, a staff member took our coats. Plus, our waiter checked up on us frequently. 

We originally came here for their 3 courses for $38 deal (recommended by our cooking class instructor), but ended up opting for entrees. I got the Fra Diavolo which was spicy, tomatoey, had perfectly al dente pasta, and was topped with a moderate portion of steamed lobster. My bf got the Carne (beef tenderloin) which came more rare than expected (but delicious). It came with grilled asparagus and irresistibly garlicky creamy risotto. It&apos;s hard to believe that each of our meals was in the $26-28 range! We finished off the night with a capucinno and small latte.

Grotto nails it. Come here if you&apos;re looking for a fine dining experience that feels authentic and unpretentious."
3,"The interior is a lot nicer than it&apos;s exterior.  Perfect romantic date spot with nice classical/jazz music and candle lit lighting.  However, I expected the food to be a whole lot better.  

To start, we had the Calamari.  We expected fried calamari, but it ended up being grilled.  SO much better.  My friends and I were very pleasantly surprised and scraped the sauce clean.  5/5 recommend for appetizers.

Bolognese:  4/5.  Not bad.  The best pasta dish we had on the table.  The meat tasted really gamey -- maybe they didn&apos;t use the freshest ingredients?  Pretty mediocre.

Gnudi: 3/5.  My friend enjoyed it but it wasn&apos;t anything special or great.

Scampi: 3/5.  Very fishy tasting.  It was so fishy that it left a bad taste in my mouth for a while after small bites. They&apos;re pretty generous with the shrimp though.

All in all, the servings are large and the ambiance is nice.  Not in my top picks for Italian restaurants."
5,"Went to Grotto last night for Dine Out Boston. Place is very small and intimate so you probably will need a reservation to go here.

We had an 8:45 reservation and I was running late but my boyfriend got there about 10 mins early and they sat him down.

DJ was one of our waiters and he was very pleasant and constantly checked on us. They were other waiters that checked on us as well so the staff is very attentive.

I ordered the crab ravioli for the starter and that was so good! It has small pieces of asparagus that was cooked just the way I like it. Amazing flavors. 

For my main dish, I got the shrimp scampi. It was a hefty serving! Great flavors as well. Definitely took the rest home lol

Dessert was the Panna Cotta which was decent .. really sweet in my opinion. 

My boyfriend had the calamari, veal and melted chocolate cake and he enjoyed his meal! 

I will definitely come back here for a meal - completely satisfied with my experience."
5,"Really enjoyable dine out Boston experience here at Grotto. Came with a friend for lunch and had their 2 course menu for $20. Their regular menu, however, is not too expensive and I believe they do offer a price fixe menu regularly. 
Ambiance is nice, a break from the construction and other happenings right outside the door. The restaurant is down a set of stairs from the sidewalk, so is easy to miss. 
I ordered the ensalata mare- white bean paste, grilled calamari, arugula, and lemon vinaigrette- and it was delicious. My friend had the cavatelle as her appetizer- ricotta pasta, sausage, peas, mushrooms, and pancetta in a cream sauce- which was also great. 
For our mains, I ordered the gnocchi and she ordered the risotto. The gnocchi was prepared with short ribs, mushrooms, and Gorgonzola and was so so delicious. The risotto was huge, the majority of it went into a to-go container (it is a much more excessive amount after eating another pasta dish).
I would definitely return to grotto, especially considering that it is still reasonable outside of the deal given by dine out Boston."
5,Booked a large group dinner here for a professional meeting. Everything was delicious and this small place managed our group very well. Very tasty pasts dishes and great cozy atmosphere.
5,"My boyfriend and I decided to spend our 5 year anniversary here at Grotto and we were not disappointed in the very least. We decided to do the $44 3 course option and it was VERY filling. I&apos;m actually quite disappointed that I didn&apos;t have enough room in my stomach to eat every plate clean.

I started off with the fonduta which was absolutely delicious. I loved every bite of the portobello mushroom with the tender steak. My boyfriend enjoyed the duck confit with crispy Brussels sprouts. Everything was paired beautifully.

My entree was carne which is a steak with risotto and asparagus. I was so full from the appetizer that I could barely finish this dish. However, the risotto has excellent flavor. Extreme compliments to the chef. I could taste the wine and the texture of the rice was impeccable. The steak was a perfect medium rare and the asparagus still had a nice crunch to it. The only thing I did not like was the red wine sauce. It tasted very sweet with notes of bitterness. I believe it didn&apos;t accompany the dish well but regardless, the dish was amazing.

My boyfriends entree was veal saltimbocca. The veal was cooked very well with crispy prosciutto. The polenta was nicely cooked and paired well with the sauce on his entree. Again, we were both too full from our appetizer to finish our entree!

Next came dessert and I got the chocolat√©. The cake was very rich and dense, but it was perfect for me. It was still warm and the vanilla ice cream was delicious. My boyfriend got the panna cotta which was light and delicate. The lemon flavor really shines and it was a good dessert to end with such heavy dishes.

Overall, Grotto is a perfect restaurant for a date night. The ambiance is romantic and although the restaurant is small, their flavors are big and bold. Would love to come again to try their other dishes!"
1,"I am beyond upset with this restaurant seeing as it used to be one of my favorites. Called and made a reservation for 8:30, knowing that they close at 10:00 as advertised. &quot;MARY&quot; made the reservation for me over the phone, I arrive at 8:32 and MARY REFUSES to seat me saying they were closed. HOW/WHAT/WHY?! I then see staff and kitchen cleaning up to close to get out early, since there were was only one table in the restaurant who was finishing up. This is BEYOND unacceptable customer service, especially when you have patrons that are trying to support a small business AND GIVE YOU MONEY. Also, who closes at 8:30 on a Saturday night in July?! Until Grotto gets new management, spend your money in The North End."
4,"Went with a friend for dinner last night. It was my 2nd time at this small, underground restaurant. I initially found out about it because I looked up romantic restaurants in Boston to go to with my boo. So far, I&apos;ve been to Grotto with a vendor and a female friend. Lol! 

I&apos;ve made reservations online both times, but they have been unnecessary. Both times have been at 5 or 5:30 on a weeknight and there&apos;s been 1 other party there when I&apos;ve arrived. I&apos;m sure it gets busier later on and on the weekends.

First of all - the drinks here are dynamite! I don&apos;t remember what I had the first time I was here, but last night, I ordered an old fashioned that they make with Bully Boy and it was soooo good. My friend is doing dry January and she was like &quot;Uh... I smell your old fashioned and I want it so bad&quot;. haha. Too bad for you! I savored that bad boy. If my friend was drinking and didn&apos;t have to catch a bus back to NH, I would have had another one. I don&apos;t know who is back there making drinks (there is no bar area in the front), but they do an amazing job.

There are 2 prix fixe dinner options with appetizer, entree and dessert. It&apos;s  $36 for a pasta entree or $42 for a meat entree. I can&apos;t eat that much food, so my friend and I shared the mussels appetizer and got our own a la carte entrees. The mussels were good. $10 for a serving that could have been a bit bigger. For my entree, I got the lobster fra diavolo. I love me some lobster and some spicy red sauce. The pasta was very fresh and the lobster was good. Downside was that a chunk of the lobster had shell in it, so - tried as I might to separate the lobster from shell in my mouth, I ultimately had to spit it out and waste a chunk of lobster meat. No bueno.

My friend got the gnocchi and she loved it. She gulped it down and had to wait for me to finish my pasta! I wish they let people split the prix fixe. If we could have shared the appetizer and dessert parts and then I had my own entree, that would have been perfect, but there&apos;s a line on the menu that says no sharing. I didn&apos;t want to be that person who tries to get away with some nonsense, so we wen&apos;t without dessert.

The vibe is definitely on the romantic side. The restaurant is tiny and underground, it was quiet and they played soft jazz. Lights were low - food was good, drinks were strong. It&apos;s all anyone needs to get their booty on. Next time, maybe I&apos;ll actually bring my other half!"
4,"Yep, Grotto is located at or beneath street level at Bowdoin Street, which is not far from the Capitol Dome and the State House. It&apos;s fancy Italian which is really great for lunch. Oops.

They have a nice lunch menu with set prices for one or two courses. Three of us at the table landed on the bolognaise for lunch, which was a delicious choice. It didn&apos;t look like much because it was served on a huge dish but the pasta already tossed with sauce turned out to be a very good portion. Rich, meaty, garlicky and delicious, I nabbed the last piece of bread from the basket to scoop up the little bit of sauce that was left. Delicious.

It&apos;s not a very big restaurant - maybe a dozen tables of two- and four-tops - but they do a fine lunch and I&apos;d bet, a better dinner."
3,"My boyfriend and I wanted a nice, romantic dinner during our stay in Boston. We picked Grotto because of its high reviews and quaint atmosphere, and it seemed like a perfect date spot. We arrived and found that the restaurant is dramatically smaller than it appears in photos, which makes for an intimate atmosphere, particularly if a loud couple is sitting adjacent to you -- a couple we were practically on top of. In addition, every conversation seemed to echo around the room, so if you&apos;re looking for a comfortable atmosphere, it&apos;s not here. We asked to move to a different table due to the fact that we on top of another couple talking at the top of their lungs. After we moved and got situated, we opted for the prix fixe menu (appetizer, entr√©e, dessert). After we gave our waitress the order, she must have disappeared into a portal in the back room, as she was gone for a long period of time. To say that the service in this restaurant is slow is like saying the Pacific Ocean is big. Accurate but also a gross understatement. A glacier could recede, melt, form a river that stretches to Boston, flood the restaurant, and that would have been faster than refilling our water glasses.

The food, itself, was ... average. It wasn&apos;t bad, but it wasn&apos;t great. I ordered the appetizer with the bruschetta, the shrimp scampi, and the pana cotta dessert. My boyfriend got the calamari, spaghetti and meatballs, and melted chocolate cake. The restaurant brought out a dish of olive oil and bread to start after some centuries had passed since we made our initial order. There must have been a mixup in the kitchen because the bread we were served was essentially room temperature Wonderbread with an Italian moustache. Olive Garden would have been vastly superior. The rest of the meal was eh. 

When we finally got our check, we noticed immediately that we were charged the price of each item ordered as opposed to a prix fixe price. The couple next to us also experienced the same issue and was charged for wine they never received. When the same waitress returned with a new check for them, they discovered that it had not been remediated at all! We&apos;re very disappointed because for the cost of the meal, we did not get what we paid for ...

Dining at Grotto is an experience in patience."
5,"Amazing food!! Perfect date night. Cocktails were excellent. We both had the prixe fix and every dish was delicious. Portions were big enough to have leftovers. Service was great. If you&apos;re in the mood for italian in an intimate setting, this is the spot. Highly recommend."
5,Food was delicious! Definitely have to get the cavatele I think that&apos;s how you spell it and short rib gnocchi yum!
4,"Intimate restaurant with Italian comfort food.

I would&apos;ve probably never found Grotto but someone gave me a gift card so my husband and I tried it out. I made a reservation for a Saturday night around 5:30pm. We came inside and there was only one other couple dining at the time. The music was at a perfect volume and despite the cold air outside, it was cozy at our small booth table. 

We chose the prix fixe menu for $35: an appetizer, entree, and dessert. I chose the carozza to start: a lightly breaded and seared piece of fresh buffalo mozzarella, wilted spinach, and a tomato sauce. The cheese was perfectly fresh and savory and the spinach cooked just the right amount.

For the pasta, I got the gnocchi with short ribs. Man, oh man. This was the epitome of comfort food, ideal for a cold winter night. Then, to finish, I chose the panna cotta with lemon and raspberry. 

Overall, it was a delicious meal but nothing blew me away so I&apos;ll stick to four stars. The service was friendly and timely. This is a nice spot for a special occasion or quiet night out."
3,"The food was really good(except the dessert).  The service was OK.  We ordered a bottle of wine.  Not an expensive bottle( not many are on their list).  The waiter brought two glasses over, one was VERY dirty.  I tried to ask him NOT to pour my taste into it but he did any way.  Then when I refused to drink out of it he grabbed  another glass and basically made me feel like I should apologize for the inconvenience.  Appetizers and entrees were delicious.  The Cavetelli is worth the visit!  My dessert, the panacotta tasted like it had been in a refrigerator for a week.  I took one nite and was done.  The server didn&apos;t even notice.  We have been here a few times, not sure I would recommend going back, except that cavatelli........"
5,"I&apos;m not even trying to be dramatic here- this was the best meal I&apos;ve had in a really long time. 

From the second you walk down the steps and into the cozy dining room you feel right at home. The atmosphere is cozy and romantic but you could also come here with a group of girlfriends to have a girls night out. 

They have a priced-fixed menu (or you can order a la carte) but the three course meal is definitely the way to go. For a very reasonable cost you get a first course, entree, and a desert. I started with the garlic soup and regardless if you are kissing anyone that night or not just try it. It&apos;s amazing and nothing else will ever compare to that delicious soup. I personally got the short rib gnocchi and would rate it a solid 10/10 but other at my table got the lobster pasta and the chicken parm and were raving as well. 

I only tried the warm chocolate cake for desert but just take my word for it and get it. You won&apos;t be disappointed. 

By the end of the meal you would think we hadn&apos;t eaten in days because every plate was licked clean. You need to come here."
1,"I&apos;ve been here before and had pleasant meals, but it has been a few years. I went back last week and something had clearly gone terribly wrong:

I ordered the bolognese pasta and thought my first bite tasted... odd. I took a few more bites and discovered what the odd flavor was when I bit into something hard, a shrimp shell. Somehow shrimp had gotten dumped in the meat sauce, and it was making the dish taste like some sort of appallingly ill-advised gumbo. Yikes. (Imagine if I had a seafood allergy!)

The other dishes my girlfriend and I ordered were not so spectacularly mis-made, but the food was in some cases stale, and in other cases bland. 

It&apos;s a pity; Grotto used to be a nice restaurant, and maybe they just had an off day, but that meal was too bad to give it another chance."
