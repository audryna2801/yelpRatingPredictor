5,"I had a one of a long COVID birthday at Oleana with the best roommates anyone could wish for! They managed to trick me and get me out of the house to enjoy this delicious dinner. We basically tried 85% percent of the menu without a doubt and I don&apos;t have a single complaints. To start I told our waitress that it was really cold and she was SO sweet that she brought us two heaters to stay warm.

We had most of the warm plates on the menu. Sultans delight had tangy tamarind flavor that blended well with the meat. The Maine scallops had just the right consistency and were accompanied by a little bit of rice, which tasted almost like paella (seafood rice). The warmed hummus are a must try, we had two order another round because they were too good to share. The fateh was a crunchy explosion of flavors. The pancakes had a tasty pickled salad with citrus. The falafel had a beet cream that is also a must try. The lamb gyro and lamb braised lamb chops were both cooked to perfection. The lamb was well flavored and cooked just as it should be. 

My favorite dessert was the Baked Alaska. Unfortunately by the time we got to dessert I had eaten WAY too much and it was hard to enjoy the rest of the sweets. Overall experience is five stars, food was on delicious , service was on point, and I had a great birthday!"
5,"This was quite simply one of the best meals of my life. I can&apos;t wait to come back.

Highlights:
Spinach falafel
Whipped feta
Cauliflower with farro
Topik
Fatteh
Baked Alaska

The large plate of lemon chicken was good- but the mezze plates were the true stars. The service was wonderful from the lovely hostess to everyone who helped us, it felt very Covid safe with common sense practices.

New favorite spot."
5,"This is a classic Cambridge &apos;go to&apos; restaurant with interesting dishes, spices, flavors and presentations.
They maintain their very high  standard service and the highest level of food  they give. Moreover, they seem pretty serious about the pandemic and are very careful.

Our server was attentive yet giving us the right amount of space for us to feel comfortable. Food is made to perfection, and great flavor. Highly recommended"
4,"We had a lovely evening on the outdoor patio during covid times. The service was great, the food was delicious, we were warm enough with the heat lamps on the patio in freezing (literally 32 degree) weather.

Food-wise:
- lamb and chickpea cassoulet: this was delicious! Very flavorful! A sizable portion at only $26 for a main. The meatballs were my favorite part of this dish.
- delicata squash meze with baked cheese: this arrived last at our table and we were already full but I wish I could&apos;ve fit more of this one. Very hearty, perfectly wintery.
- whipped feta with peppers: great spices and flavor. Small dish but a great palate-pleaser!
- quail kebob: this is small but I enjoyed it! The crispy rice and the barberry tartness add value to a tasty bite!
- fatteh: Meh. Not bad, not noteworthy though. I&apos;d skip this one.
- baked Alaska: so creative and tasty. It was coconut ice cream with a passion fruit caramel sauce! I&apos;d order this again and again!

Wine-wise:
- we started with the Grenache blend which was nice &amp; easy on its own..but completely overpowered by the fun / strong flavors of all the dishes. 
- we transitioned to the Mandilari and we&apos;re really glad we did. More full-bodied, more spice. 


The only off-putting piece of the whole experience was that we were charged an automatic 20% &quot;house tax&quot; - which they didn&apos;t say in any voiceover, it didn&apos;t say on the menu, and it wasn&apos;t mentioned on their website. We would&apos;ve paid a 20% tip anyway (maybe more because the food and service were great) but this left a bad taste in our mouths. And we didn&apos;t leave any additional tip as a result. 

Overall - I&apos;d recommend Oleana. The food is delicious. It&apos;s an expensive meal for sure ($200 for two people including the house tax and four glasses of wine), but we thought it was worth it!"
5,Amazing experience for start to finish. The quality shows in the presentation and layers of flavors.
5,"TLDR: great for a date 

Came here with some friends and had a great time. Yeah the back patio is moody and beautiful with great space heaters but the food is amazing. It&apos;s a tapas style that is expensive but everything tastes amazing and has its own unique taste. Definitely one of my favorite places in Boston."
5,"One of the best restaurants in Boston. In fact, it&apos;s in my top five - alongside Celeste, Pammys, O Ya, and Metropolis, and B&amp;G...not bad company to keep in my humble opinion! (Though that makes a top six so I guess I struggle with counting...)

COVID has few bright spots but it&apos;s allowed me to revisit so many old favorites now that there&apos;s reservations available. And Oleana is one of the brightest spots of these times. 

Outdoor space is a straight up oasis. There&apos;s counters and table seats. The counter isn&apos;t the most comfortable but in these times there&apos;s no need to linger and hold them back from turning tables so it works. 

Service is always gracious and attentive and helpful without being overbearing. They strike the perfect balance. And our waitress provided stellar recommendations to boot. 

And the food. My goodness, the foooooood. 
Deviled eggs: think fancy tuna salad in an egg. Solid. 
Topik: sounds weird, tastes amaaaaaaazing. 
Fatteh: my favorite thing here...the summer squash in the dish was incredible 
Spinach falafel: some of the best falafel I&apos;ve had
Striped bass shish: NOM. Delicious nuggets of fish perfectly grilled and seasoned 
Quail kebob: the hubs favorite thing here...two little bites of joy. So good 

To add to the experience, the wine list is fantastic. 

I would recommend Oleana to any/everyone. Go...and soon. You won&apos;t be disappointed."
5,Came here on a Monday night and just wow. The food was very good. Great atmosphere. Highly recommend.
5,"Absolutely amazing experience. I felt safe dining on the patio and the staff was very considerate. I especially enjoyed the quail, never had it before and it&apos;s perfectly cooked and well-seasoned. The dessert was also fun to eat. Love the different textures in baked Alaska and the passion fruit purée. Great for date nights or for special occasions"
1,"I was very put off by the service here. I got the strong feeling from the hostess that certain people are not welcome at this restaurant. I was made to wait outside in below-freezing weather well past my reservation, even as other parties walked in and were welcomed immediately.

I would recommend to anyone interested in eating at Oleana that you be careful what name you make your reservation under."
5,"Oleana is one of my very favorite restaurants in all of Boston/Cambridge. Whenever we&apos;re stumped for a restaurant, my husband suggests Oleana, to which I always reply, &quot;YES! Oleana! Perfect idea!&quot; It&apos;s one of our favorite spots to bring out of town guests, especially vegetarians. It&apos;s also a go-to for birthdays, anniversaries, or any day. The experience feels special but very low key and unpretentious. 

Hands down, the best outdoor dining in the city is Oleana&apos;s secret garden. I love coming here in the summers and don&apos;t even mind the wait for a table since you can usually sit outside with a drink while you wait. It&apos;s truly beautiful and magical. 

And... the food. Oleana is so spectacular that it&apos;s hard to describe. Yes, Mediterranean, but it&apos;s really not like any other Mediterranean I&apos;ve ever had. Everything on the menu is so delicious. I try to eat mostly a plant-based diet, but always bend the rules for Sultan&apos;s Delight. Since everything else on the menu is too amazing to choose from, we often go with a tasting menu (which is also available in vegetarian). The other can&apos;t-miss is the whipped feta. I&apos;m hopeful that we can dine on the patio (they&apos;re taking outdoor reservations now, which is new for covid) or try take out for my birthday during this strange summer."
4,"I had been meaning to try Oleana for a birthday or anniversary celebration for a couple of years but never planned ahead enough to get a reservation. You really need to plan four weeks in advance if you want a weekend reservation, maybe not quite as far out during the week. Recently, we finally actually visited Oleana for dinner while my in laws were visiting. We were a group of five and shared a number of small plates and a few desserts. We were very pleased with our experience at Oleana. There are a number of nice restaurants in the Cambridge area for a fancy dinner, but Oleana with its Mediterranean-inspired fine dining is definitely unique and a great option for something a bit different. 

When we arrived, the free parking for Oleana customers was the first thing we appreciated. When we went inside, our table is ready and we were seated right away. The dining area was cozy and pleasant, and the staff were very helpful in terms of recommending what and how much to order. With five people, we were able to try a lot of the small plates on the menu, and everything was delicious. We would definitely recommend this place for a nice night out. They also have a vegetarian dinner option with a chef&apos;s choice assortment of small plates, although we chose to just select our own from the menu."
5,"I&apos;m so happy I finally was able to come here!  Oleana is the real deal.  I loved it!  Our table wasn&apos;t ready when we arrived at the restaurant, however, we went to the bar and sipped on some wine to pass the time.  The restaurant is very warm and homey with Mediterranean inspired decoration.   it appeared the restaurant guests were locals in the area.  Our waiter was very friendly and offered suggestions of her favorite menu items 

I came for a date night and suggest ordering small plates for your meal .  We were pretty hungry so we ordered 5 plates, not including dessert (the more the merrier right?!).  We ordered strictly off of the hot meze section of the menu and got the honey nut squash,spinach falafel, fateh, mini butternut dolma, and lamejun.  For dessert we had the chocolate marquise!  Here is a breakdown of our favorite items.

Lamejun- my favorite dish of the night! This was like a mini Mediterranean pizza of goodness! The lamb and sauce on top paired perfectly together! 

Mini butternut dolma- WOW! The lamb in this dish was amazing.  It was so tender and was easy enough to cut with a fork.  The goat cheese on top hit the spot!

Chocolate marquise- who would&apos;ve thought pear sorbet paired well with chocolate? Not me but it was delicious!  The spiced pecan katif offered a nice crunch!"
4,"Being from NYC, I can&apos;t say I&apos;m starved for good Mediterranean / Greek / Israeli places, so I wasn&apos;t too keen on visiting one when out of town, but Oleana&apos;s reviews and acclaim got me to bite on my second night in Boston.  

The restaurant&apos;s theme/design has a sort of Asian feel to it, stone walls, pillow-cushioned seats and seatbacks, pretty neat. There&apos;s also a rather large outdoor space with plenty of greenery/foliage, continuing the exotic feel of the place.

I arrived about 35 mins early for an 8pm reservation, but was told they&apos;d be able to seat me shortly and was led to the back/outside area, where there was an area in the back with a couple tables/couches for people to sit, order a drink, etc.

They have a very respectable craft beer list, so I ordered a tasty brew while I waited. It was generally a pleasant time, people watching and sipping a Lord Hobo Hazy Boomsauce (yum)...though I basically did that until a little bit after the time of my reservation, which was a little annoying (particularly because of the contrary impression, see &quot;seated shortly&quot;). Oh well, I was eventually seated and things improved drastically from there.

After eventually being seated, I was promptly asked for a drink early (finished the &apos;Hobo) and given some AMAZING za&apos;atar-dusted bread (looooove that stuff...like crack). Now the hard part was deciding what to get! I know the spinach falafel is a popular choice...but I feel like I can get good falafel locally (NYC), so I bypassed that and eventually settled on the Sultan&apos;s Delight and the Lamb and Summer Squash Roulade.

Sultan&apos;s Delight (Tamarind Beef, Smokey Eggplant Purée, Pinenuts). The beef was sooo tender, and the smokiness of the eggplant puree was amazing! The dish looks simple but there&apos;s a lot of complimentary deliciousness going on here!

Lamb and Summer Squash Roulade (with Tomato Brown Butter, GOAT CHEESE (!!!), and Fig) - this was so good! The tender, succulent lamb with the deliciously creamy and tangy roulade...I practically licked my plate clean (no pieces of that za&apos;atar table bread was spared)! Yum! 

The food was superb as was the service once seated. The rough start may have just been a hiccup, so I&apos;d definite give Oleana another go next time I&apos;m in town."
3,"For the price point, for the hype that it has, for the quality of the food that I expected, I think this place was okay.

The ambiance was cozy with dim lights and intimate setting. Be sure to make a reservation because it gets full. The staff was friendly and quick to seat us, the waitress was attentive, cleared our plates and filled our water.

Food was good, but again at the price point and the hype, it is not a place I would write home about. We had the whipped feta which had some interesting spices, fried mussels, lamb dolma, a scallop large plate and a baked Alaska for dinner. 

The best things were lamb dolma and the vegetables of the scallop dish. The lamb dolma was stuffed inside a sweet potato! Great mix of flavors with a yogurt and sweet potato puree sauce. The scallops were nicely seasoned, but weren&apos;t that interesting, the brussels sprouts and cauliflower in the dish were awesome. 

Baked Alaska is HUGE and I ate it like a savage: only the outside torched skin and the ice cream inside. I left a giant cloud of meringue. It is a dollop of ice cream inside a GIANT meringue, which looks cool, but unless you love meringue, it was too much.

Again, this place has good food. I have no complaints. It just didn&apos;t blow me away when competing with other restaurants at this price point."
5,"What more can I add that hasn&apos;t already been said? Came here for our anniversary - great food, drinks, and ambiance, COVID-conscious and friendly service. Quail kebab and mushroom kibbeh not to be missed."
3,"More like 3.5, although the score varies depending on what you order and your preference. 

A cozy, trendy middle eastern restaurant that pushes the wine heavy and offers a hit and miss menu that frustrates and delights. The fatteh is a beautiful construction of a dish. The layout looks like it could be a modernist house for an insect! The textured are well thought out, as there&apos;s three different types of crunch. The yogurt has a lovely tang that ties everything together. Every bite felt like a chamber orchestra in my mouth. Definitely make sure to get this.

The spinach falafel was good, but not as amazing as everything else. If anything, this would be something id eat for a healthy lunch. As a vegan, this will strike your heart as hearty, nutritional, earthy vibes. I would have dialed the cumin down by one notch, but thats just me.

The lamb tortellini is delicious. Each tortellini feels like a small package, specially wrapped under the Christmas tree. The flavor of the lamb shines like a pattern from a boat surrounded by a lake of labneh. The labneh itself comes off like pimento cheese sauce but in a good way. The mint oil adds a brushstroke of freshness while further anchoring the oil profile of the dish, although it never gets overwhelming. I&apos;m glad they dont serve it piping hot, but it does get lukewarm fairly quick.

The Quail kebobs were quite underwhelming for being the last item of my meal. I expected this to be small, but I wasn&apos;t expecting it to taste like chicken breast covered in a nutty parmesan pesto crust. Out of all the dishes, this one fell flat like a middle schooler&apos;s voice breaking halfway through the final note of his cadenza. 

The birds nest dessert was not as good as other bird&apos;s nests Ive had at other places. It felt like everything was its own separate part, rather than a total sum. The cheese board like layout of some of the ingredients feel compartmentalized, as well as incomplete as a &quot;nest of a bird&quot;. The redeeming factor is everything was solid in how it tasted. No cheap chocolate, no flat flavors. The honeycomb is candy and not real honeycomb, but I honestly didn&apos;t mind since it was more about texture (and I didn&apos;t want a sugar rush as I was already full). 

Im really glad I didn&apos;t order the Sultan&apos;s delight prix fixe option. I have a feeling I would have scored this place much more harshly than I am now. Granted, I didn&apos;t eat every item on the menu. I think overall it&apos;s a hit or miss experience. If I lived in the neighborhood, perhaps I would be able to fully explore the menu, but alas I don&apos;t live in Boston. This would not be my first choice or recommendation to come here if you have a limited stay in Boston, but for locals, Id say its still worth going to. Just make sure you do plenty of research ahead of time."
5,"Oleana is worth the hype. Every last bit of it. Oh my gosh, I&apos;m OBSESSED!!! Everything on their menu is delicious, the service is always incredible, and it&apos;s my favorite restaurant in Cambridge...actually, in all of Massachusetts. It&apos;s AMAZING! Like blow your mind out of this world, INCREDIBLE!!!

The flavors are always on point and every dish is well-executed and features an array of colors, textures, and flavors. The dishes are beautiful, and so so so delicious! Just go and order a bunch of things off the Meze menu. You won&apos;t be disappointed. The staff is also super friendly and eager to help with the suggestions! It&apos;s pricey, but treat yourself because Oleana is worth it! 

Pro tip: they hold two tables open for walk-ins. If you go right when they open, you&apos;ll be able to snag one of them without a wait!"
5,"We had an absolutely amazing dining experience at Oleana tonight! We did have to wait a bit for our 7 pm reservation, but it was worth it. The menu has a mix of small and large plates, so we ended up getting one large plate (lemon chicken) and several small plates. My favorite small plates were the quail, falafel and the olives. We also got the z&apos;atar bread on its own and it was delicious! The restaurant is taking a lot of precautions for the pandemic, including offering outdoor seating and requiring masks. Highly recommend this dinner gem!"
4,"This is Dana&apos;s favorite place, so I&apos;ll give &apos;em an extra star from her. 

Nice folks
Only one thing was phenomenal 
A few things were totally forgettable"
