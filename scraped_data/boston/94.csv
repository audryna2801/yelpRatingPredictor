5,"I love Brown Sugar Cafe. The food is delicious, the staff is very friendly and their pricing is reasonable. Great portion sizes- always have enough takeout to save for later. Definitely a returning customer"
5,"The Pad Thai, is incredible, it automatically puts me in a good mood and there delivery is very fast. Definitely recommend"
5,"I had not eaten at Brown Sugar Cafe in several years but had remembered really enjoying their food. I have been ordering take out or delivery&apos; from other Thai restaurants a bit closer to me since COVID but decided to try having food delivered from here. I got pad Thai, shrimp scampi and mango with sticky sweet rice for desert. The food came even sooner than they had estimated (30 minutes instead of 45-60) the delivery gentleman wore gloves and best of all the food was delicious and hot ( except the desert which was quite good but a little pricey). This will definitely be my go to Thai restaurant from now on, can&apos;t wait to try other dishes on the menu!!! Stay healthy every one and wear masks!!!"
4,"Bear in mind I ordered pretty late (8:30 pm) and ordered through the restaurant directly. I ordered the chicken satay, pad see you, and spring rolls. The service was awesome, received food quickly. 

The chicken satay was amazing. Zero complaints, absolutely fantastic. Had the perfect grilled taste, and reheats super well (I bought a bit too much! There are 4 skewers per serving.) For all of the food, the portions were pretty good, so that&apos;s awesome. 

Spring rolls were okay and their sauce was good, but the meat was quite dry--did they use ground meat? I&apos;m not a spring roll snob but the texture was strange. The pad see you was pretty tasteless--almost no sauce on there. I fried it with soy sauce in my own pan and it was fine. 

Next time I&apos;ll stick with just the chicken."
4,"One of my favorite Thai places! Really yummy yellow curry. I&apos;m usually not a fan of sweet dishes, but this is just the right amount, and not overwhelming at all. I love getting a bunch of different dishes and splitting with others family style. 

The service is friendly, and the restaurant atmosphere is unique, definitely a great place to go with friends or family, or even a casual lunch. The outside is super misleading. It looks tiny, but it&apos;s surprisingly spacious inside. Would definitely recommend!"
1,"I would give negative ratings if I could. 

The food was horrible. We tried Pad Thai, Vegetarian Red Curry and Fried Rice and they were all equally bad. 

The curry was super watery, the fried rice and pad thai were not at all spicy like we ordered and tasted weird. 

Would not recommend this place to anyone if they are thai food lovers like I am. 

We threw everything out because we just couldn&apos;t eat it more than couple of spoons."
4,Beautiful decor nice presentation of dishes but I think the new hole in the wall Thai joints that are becoming the norm one up these more traditional stalwarts in the Boston Thai restaurant scene. The dishes seem a little tamed but still good still nothing made me catch whiplash like wow this is crazy good so maybe they need to update there recipes to make them more Thai so to speak like these new hile in the wall spots. The American palate is more accepting of these trends towards &quot;authentic&quot; ethnic dining. Still a very nice dinner was had. Excellent service and spotless location bathrooms and all.
5,"This place is the best!!!! I used to work over in Brookline and Brown Sugar Cafe is the go to spot for Thai food. The basil fried rice, pad thai, scallion pancakes, all of the curry, mango sticky rice dessert and Thai coffee are all phenomenal. Whenever I feel a taste of nostalgia I order from here. The staff are all so friendly, it is a great spot to go to for lunch or dinner with out of towners and it is even better that it is a little bit outside the city on Comm Ave. It feels like every locals hidden secret. I find myself introducing it to all my friends who come visit. With so many bars nearby across the street and in Brookline and Brighton it is so accessible. There is another location outside of Boston as well and I have met people all over who know of Brown Sugar and rave about it. They do have affordable lunch options too. You won&apos;t regret it."
1,"Extremely disappointing service. Made a delivery order and on top of the really rude manager on the telephone taking our order, the delivery man was rude too because he was angry we didn&apos;t give him a bigger tip. He also wore no gloves or mask during the exchange, which should be mandatory at this time. 

The food was cold when it was delivered even though we&apos;re right down the street from the restaurant. The biggest insult I can&apos;t get over is the LARGE Tom Yum soup we ordered. It came in a large container and half full... I&apos;ve never seen a restaurant casually try to pass this off. 

When I called in and spoke to the manager again he refused to change the cost of the soup. He said he didn&apos;t know how to change the price on the machine (even being a manager) and the best he could do is bring more broth in half an hour. We already were hesitant to order because of COVID-19 concerns as well as how uncomfortable the delivery driver made us we declined so we paid more for less. 

I love Thai food so we wanted to try something new but after this experience and the restaurant taking no attempts to correct the problem properly I would NOT recommend this place to anyone. The food was not worth the hassle. Very bland!"
5,"Right off the bat, the service was incredible. Even with a party of 12, the food began arriving to our table in just about 10 minutes (and we ordered about 10 dishes). My favorites were the tom yum soup, the pork red curry (which is great over rice), and the dish with raw shrimp (I forget what it&apos;s called). 

Every dish was extremely flavorful and has a great amount of spice. Some of my friends were sweating. 

The desserts are also fantastic - fried ice cream, bua loy, strawberry cheesecake - everything was the perfect level of sweetness. Perfect place for small or large groups, just make sure you put a reservation down. Definitely coming back!"
3,"Came here on a Friday night at 7PM and was told that it was a 2-hour wait. Seeing that there were only two-parties ahead of us, we&apos;re unsure of why we were given a 2-hour wait estimate. They don&apos;t take down phone numbers, so we stuck around the area. Within 30 minutes, we were seated. No stress, but the individual taking down names might need a refresher on how to come up with estimate wait times. 

For a party of 3, we ordered the Tom Yum Goong, yellow curry with tofu, Moo Grob Pad Ped -$15.95 (Crispy pork rind with Thai spices and herbs), and Yum Plar Dook Fu -$17.95 (Thai style crispy and puffy catfish meat on romaine lettuce, served with shredded mango, red onions, and lemongrass in spicy lime dressing). 

Service: Not great. Throughout the meal, I felt rushed as the wait staff kept coming to our table to clear one plate here and there. It was close to 8 by the time we were finishing up dinner and there was no longer a wait. I&apos;m not sure why there seems to be a need to clear out our plates one by one. 

Food: Every place makes the tom yum goong differently. This place is definitely on the sweeter end and the soup was filled with different mushrooms and one shrimp. The yellow curry with tofu was delicious and paired perfectly with rice. (BTW: all entrees do not come with rice, so you&apos;ll have to order it on the side). The Moo Grob Pad Pad flavor was on point, definitely on the spicy end! The pork rind pieces were a bit touch in the beginning. Let it soak in the sauce longer and it&apos;ll tender up. I would not recommend ordering the Yum Plar Dook Fu. First of all, I was expecting to taste catfish in the crispy and puffy catfish meat as stated on the menu. However, when the dish arrived, it just felt like crispy panko on top of the salad. Sure, the dressing to the salad was tasteful. But where&apos;s the fish that we paid $17.95 for?!

The food here is good. I would definitely come back and try their other dishes. (And secretly hope that wait times are closer to accurate estimates)."
5,I love love love the friend ice cream from here. The best I&apos;ve ever had. I promise. I&apos;m not even a big ice cream person but this is a must try when you are in the area. Take my word for it.
5,This is insane! Portions are massive and delicious! Come back to try everything on the menu! The Siamese twins is served in an actual pineapple! Crab Rangoon is life changing.
3,"Hot lunch on a cold day.
Dirty snow and sour soup.   One a mess, one a balm. 
So yes, get the tom yum soup.

We had pad thai and tofu green curry.
The pad thai, properly served with crisp raw sprouts, set aside to be mixed  fresh into the noodles. Excellent.

The green curry, spiced

Very good. 
Get it"
5,"I love Thai food and Brown Sugar Cafe is a must go to spot! I usually get their Pad Thai and it&apos;s so tasty. They have a huge menu to choose from. 

There&apos;s street parking in the front, which can be tricky to find but there&apos;s a street in the back behind Star Market where sometimes you can snag a spot and it&apos;s like a 5 minute walk to the restaurant."
5,"My review of Brown Sugar Cafe of 5 years ago stands still firm today. This team of people is just the best and we like them so much. We had a lovely dinner outside and it remains our favorite restaurant, full stop."
4,"Brown Sugar Cafe you are truly terrific, I had a spectacular experience here today. Excellent service, nice atmosphere. Outstanding menu and great Soft Shell Crab. Staff is very courteous and will certainly help you with anything. Definitely stop by if you can!"
5,"From the name, I had no idea what to expect.   The result was an excellent Thai food experience.  The place is located on Commonwealth Ave, very close to Star Market and many other eateries.   There seems to be something new there every time I look.   It&apos;s also right down the street from a host of other restaurants, including Hot Pot, Dumplings, Korean, Chinese, etc.

There are so many choices in the area.   I&apos;d say Brown Sugar Cafe is a must!

The GF took had recommended it, and we decided to go one night.  She ordered a crazy flaming dish that they lit up at the table.   I&apos;m sure it was mainly for show, but was pretty cool to see.  Obviously all eyes were on this who procedure.  It was quite cool.

PROS:   Excellent food.  Great interior.  I really loved the Country Pad Thai.  It was spicy and delicious.

We finished the meal with fried ice cream, at my GF&apos;s request.  It was so tasty.   

CONS:  Parking because of where it&apos;s located.

OVERALL:  loved the Thai food here.  We will return."
2,I worked at BU for 2.5 years and was always curious about this place - I finally tried it last month before a comedy show. Thai food is usually delicious but their dishes were underwhelming and nontraditional. I&apos;ve never had such bland Pad Thai or spring rolls before - it was like they were afraid to season their food. The only thing I enjoyed was the crab rangoons but you can&apos;t really mess up cream cheese. Beer selection was meh. Service was average. There are better Thai places in the area - I would pass on this place.
1,Racist owner who doesn&apos;t observe proper COVID prevention measures. The owner and another staff had their masks down to their CHIN while HANDLING DELIVERY ORDERS. She only took Asian people&apos;s temperature and allowed 4 white people (2 parties of 2 respectively in different time) to enter the restaurant smoothly without taking temps. Consider thrice before going to this place.
