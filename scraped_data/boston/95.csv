5,"Great brunch / breakfast! Definitely make a reservation, especially for weekend. Dining available inside. 

A bit strict about COVID--drinks are served in takeaway cups, bottled water is served instead of tap, table service isn&apos;t great. However, the food makes up for it. 

I&apos;ve had the French toast several times. Best French toast of my life. Highly recommend with caramelized bananas or fresh fruit topping. My roommates have been pleased with their waffle/pancakes in the past, but jealous of my French toast. 

Omelets are great and generously filled. 

Get coffee somewhere else! It&apos;s not great."
5,"Caf√© luna has pretty good brunch food! I went for something savory (lobster tacos) and they stuff their tacos with meat!! They also have thick tortillas so it doesn&apos;t rip easily when you pick up the tacos. It came with a little bit of guacamole but I wish I had more. The lobster taco is a must 

My roommates ordered fresh toast and that was also AMAZING. Super fluffy! I might need to order some for myself next time. My roommate liked the fact that you can order a full order or half order.

They also have a variety of coffee drinks!! The lavender latte is my favorite but the dirty chai was also really good. But I wanted to give the barista a shout out for their service in getting me freshly made coffee. I ordered pick up and they started making the coffee only after I arrived. I preferred that because the coffee was still tasty and warm by the time I got home. Also whoever wrote on the cups has super nice handwriting. I really appreciated the writing on the cup and the effort that went into it looking nice! Thank you! Had a great New Years breakfast and feeling like I&apos;m starting 2021 right"
5,"Wow!Wow! Wow!! Came for brunch to celebrate our girls birthdays. Made reservations online a week prior. Once there we were seated right away- with stringent Covid protocol In place. We ordered lattes- mine had oat milk- being a couple of latte snobs let me just say one of the best I&apos;ve ever had. The place was quaint and on street parking easy to find , even with a recent snow storm keeping many spots unavailable. The gentleman who seated us explained the expansive menu and gushed about the chef ( his wife of over 30 years) My daughter stated- that&apos;s the kind of husband
I want- one who brags on me when I&apos;m not even around to hear. I ordered the kitchen sink, came with choice of waffle or French toAst ( I got toast) corn beef hash bacon and eggs. There were many variations to it to choose. Large portions and yummy! Two others both ordered the corn beef hash Benedict and lastly one ordered the spinach tomato Benedict. The girls also ordered a side of the waffles ( which our waiter graciously added a candle and kiss to to help celebrate) we started meal with the biscuits ( added lemon curd) we all left full and super happy with everything we had. We can&apos;t wait to go back - simply over the top in every aspect. Thank you for helping us celebrate-"
5,"This is a long overdue review but this is hands down my favorite brunch place ever! There isn&apos;t a single thing I&apos;ve tried here that I don&apos;t like. Even with reservations, this place is always super packed - and for good reason! Granted, I&apos;ve only been here a handful of times (because I never wake up in time for weekend brunch, whoops) but clearly this is a big hit for a lot of other people too.

You can&apos;t go wrong with any of the eggs benedicts here. Seriously, they&apos;re some of the best I&apos;ve ever had! French toast is also another great option although can be the slightest bit too sweet (for me). I&apos;m usually a savory over sweets for brunch kinda gal but I need to call out the Mexican churro french toast. This must be what Heaven is like and what dreams are made of - ugh, simply delicious! They also had this apple cider mimosa in the Fall that my friend and I loved. Not sure if it&apos;s still available but would highly recommend that over the normal orange mimosa.

TLDR: Food and drinks are amazing, the wait may be long but it is worth it, and make reservations if you can!"
5,"There&apos;s not much around this area but this restaurant is pretty popular. Our reservation was made for a group of 3 at 2pm on Saturday. It was busier than I expected it to be for a brunch place in the afternoon. We had to wait a few extra minutes after 2pm for a table to clear, but it wasn&apos;t a big deal. The staff was super sweet - they kept apologizing when the wait took longer than expected and asked if we wanted to wait inside instead. We also made conversation with one of the workers and he was so friendly. The staff all seem close with each other, exuding an overall positive atmosphere. 

I highly recommend making a reservation before going because it&apos;s usually packed. They have outdoor seating with heaters, but it&apos;s so cold these days and I&apos;m not sure how helpful the heaters are. The place started to clear out around 3pm, which makes sense since they close at 4pm. 

My friends and I ordered the Country Biscuit Breakfast Slider, the House Specialty Corned Beef Hash, and the Pulled Chicken &amp; Sweet Potato Hash. All orders came with a side of home fries, fruit, or salad. We chose home fries - they were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. They currently charge $1 for bottled water. 

For my pulled chicken &amp; sweet potato hash, the waiter asked what type of cheese I wanted on the hash, but I didn&apos;t know I would be charged an extra $1 for that... based on the way he asked me, I assumed it came with cheese. Other than that, I really enjoyed the dish. It was full of flavor and was actually a lot more filling than I thought it would be. 

If you&apos;re looking for something sweet and holiday-themed, they currently have a seasonal Gingerbread French Toast on their menu.

I really enjoyed my experience here, and would come back to try out their other dishes! It&apos;s a little on the pricier side but their food is great quality."
5,I really enjoyed brunch here. It has been challenging to find restaurants that are still staying true to their good flavors and holding on to their standards. I went in for brunch on my birthday and was pleased with the food and service. Everything that we ordered tasted delicious. Our waitress was really good about answering questions and made recommendations. Everything was reasonably priced. At a time where safety is a priority they took measures to ensure safety for all the guests and staff. Enforced social distancing guidelines at all times. All together a nice atmosphere and experience. The perfect start to my birthday in this terribly snowy stormy day today. I&apos;ll definitely go back.
5,"Cafe Luna offers the most AMAZING plant-based options of any normal brunch restaurant around! I love their Tofu and Meatless Sausage combo, as well as their sweet potato and veggie burger swap options for almost all their main dishes. Their Roasted Vegetable Bowls are also second to none. I love them as a breakfast side or tucked into one of their delicious omelettes. The assortment&apos;s pretty oily, so I usually give them a napkin pat, but otherwise perfectly cooked and seasoned.If you&apos;re vegetarian or vegan, make sure to give Cafe Luna a try. I can&apos;t wait for spring so I can sit outside and enjoy them again!"
5,"Their lemon ricotta pancakes live up to the hype. So good. Fluffy, light pancakes.

They have outdoor and indoor seating - we reserved a spot for outdoors and they don&apos;t seat you until everyone has arrived. Would definitely make a reservation for brunch as this is a popular spot. 

We also ordered the biscuits. The honey butter on top was so delicious. I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s because we were quite hungry but the warm biscuits really hit the spot. And the food came out in a timely fashion. I tried a bite of their pumpkin French toast and wow, it is definitely a sweet breakfast. The pancakes had just the right amount of sweetness in comparison. Not too sweet."
5,"Great place, the lobster eggs benedict was amazing, so was the French toast. The owner is really nice and walks around the cafe talking to everyone and making sure everyone is happy. Be sure to call ahead cuz their always busy!"
4,"Tuesday morning, this restaurant was one of the available brunch spots with outdoor seating. No wait for a table of two as we beat the lunchtime rush.

Large selection of breakfast items to choose from. Decided on the Black Bean + Chipotle Chicken Omelette ($16). A triple egg omelet stuffed with plenty of chicken and beans. Definitely filling, so lucky I opted for the side fruit option instead of fries. To drink had one of their canned beers ($9).

Service here is super attentive and clean tables thoroughly. A bit on the expensive side, but worth going at least once"
3,"I&apos;ve only been to Boston a few times, but I can definitively say that i haven&apos;t been blown away by the breakfast options here and Cafe Luna only reinforces that notion. We came here on a weekday and missed out on the scrumptious-looking Benedict but I was reasonably confident the country biscuit sliders would be just as good. 

The first few bites were adequate enough, but my second slider, had some egg shells in the scrambled eggs, which obviously is inexcusable. I&apos;m a pretty generous restaurant-goer and I perfectly understand the occasional mistake, but even prior to that the meal was merely serviceable and additional mis-step rules Cafe Luna out of any brunch visits in the years to come."
4,"I am glad I finally got to try Cafe Luna! It is usually so busy and the wait is so long that I never got to try. But it was so easy to make a reservation through resy! 

They currently offer both indoor and outdoor dining, the tables are sanitized, and the servers are doing well in terms of covid precautions. I really liked that they are saving paper by using a QR code for the menu.

My friend and I both got the lemon-ricotta pancakes, their most iconic dish! I also got an iced americano which was $4.00, pretty expensive for an eh coffee (a little watered down). The lemon ricotta pancakes were really good! It&apos;s not really a fluffy pancake but it still melts in your mouth. We got maple syrup on the side but it was unnecessary because the pancake and the toppings were already perfectly sweet. I really liked the how the flavors went so well together. I dont have the biggest sweet tooth so I hate how pancakes can be extremely decadent but this one was light and fresh without it being sickly sweet. The only downside was that my pancakes were lowkey burnt, which is not something I want from a $16 pancake."
4,"I cannot even begin to tell you how much I missed brunch during the pandemic! As soon we as discovered we were able to dine here outdoors during Phase 2 of reopening, we quickly made the reservation. 

At the moment, they are taking reservations on Resy. If you call directly, you are placed on a waitlist. I think this is only temporary until the governor gives us more updates in the following weeks. Current hours are 9am-4pm, 5 or 6 tables available. You are allotted 1.5hrs I believe? We stayed for roughly that long. 

They are taking all the precautions as mandated. I recommend arriving as closest to the time of your reservation as possible. Otherwise, you may be awkwardly standing around waiting for your table to be ready. Masks are required throughout, with the exception of patrons eating and drinking. We saw staff properly disinfecting the tables. As soon as you are seated, the waiter places a slip on your table with a QR barcode. You must have a QR app reader on your mobile device to scan and view the menu. This is also how you pay your tab at the end. 

Everything went smoothly. Our waiter was friendly and attentive. He made our morning when he said, of course you can order a pitcher of mimosa. &apos;Cause this is how we brunch every time lol.

Overall, no complaints. We were very much content with our choices. We left fully satisfied and satiated. Who knew lemon and ricotta go so well on moist, light and fluffy pancakes. And the vegan burger eggs benny, so yummy.  Great flavors in the vegan burger patty. Would get these dishes again. I only wished my appetite wasn&apos;t so small. I wanted to sample other items, but knew I couldn&apos;t. My love for food just does not match my appetite whatsoever! =("
5,"The Carmelized Pear and Pecan French Toast!!!


It&apos;s amazing in every way! It&apos;s sweet and perfectly crisp. It&apos;s amazing how they maintain some crispness even though they are drizzled in syrup. The pears provide a delicious balance and the flavor all together was one I did not expect. 

I&apos;m so so glad we found this place!"
5,"This is the best brunch spot I&apos;ve been to. This place is always packed on weekend, so reserve ahead or you have to wait 30 minutes. Because of COVID, they&apos;ve increased their outdoor seating and it&apos;s properly spaced apart so it&apos;s definitely safe to eat. 

The whole team works really well from hosting to seating to ordering to timeliness to cleanliness to friendliness, I can&apos;t say anything bad about this place.

This is all even before the food. I mean what more to say, I wanted to try everything on the menu from Benedict&apos;s to omelettes to pancakes and French toasts, special plates, just everything is good. The latte are amazing as well, I highly recommend the London fog latte the aroma and taste (bitter sweet fragrance) delights the day. 

Don&apos;t miss out on this place!"
5,"I just have to say This is the best brunch in Boston proper I have had. Been there multiple times because my girlfriends and I love this place and it never disappoints!!

OMG OMG get the lemon ricotta pancakes for the table / they are the best and so absolutely delicious!! I mean share these because you will also want to order other items.  For the traditional brunch folks - get the kitchen sink as it gives you all you need and huge portions. For those of you who love Benedicts - well that isn&apos;t me but EVERYONE around us loved them so I give it a 5/5. You can also ask to &quot; make your own omelet which I have done and it&apos;s awesome!!

No matter what to order it&apos;s just so fabulous so indulge and enjoy!!"
5,Great brunch spot! The restaurant had a busy atmosphere while maintaining COVID safety and service was excellent. The lobster breakfast tacos were great - big portion of lobster meat!
5,"French toast is out of this world!!
Adhered to Covid restrictions well.
Excellent service! Excellent food. Incredibly accommodating (we wanted to switch seats and they easily accommodated when available).
Truly enjoyed this place."
4,"*covid review*

Eggs benedict with corned beef hash were great. I didn&apos;t use any condiments and thought the seasoning was perfect just eating it as is, not salty but not bland.

I wish I could give Cafe Luna five stars because I do think the food here is great but my friend who ordered the french toast special requested the pecans on the side rather than on top (as it was described on the menu) so that I could try it with my nut allergy. The waitress was very hesitant about the request as it was a special on the menu but she agreed to ask. A man came back to ask about the allergy like they would actually do anything about the request but immediately told us that it&apos;s not possible because the pecans were already mixed in to the dish. That turned out to be false and it was indeed just sprinkled on top like the menu said. So I&apos;m not sure why they were being difficult about putting the pecans on the side of making it seem like they would even consider the request when it was clear that they were pretty avid about keeping it as is."
5,"Ordered the Belgian waffles with fruit. This place was very friendly and busy on a Sunday morning, but felt very safe since we were outside and distanced well. 

Waffles were uber fluffy, and went well with the generous amount of fruit. 

Very fun place to go with lots of great food options. Will be coming back!"
