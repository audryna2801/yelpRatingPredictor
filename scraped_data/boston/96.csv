5,"I was badly craving for some Banofee Pie and dint feel like making it for just two people. 

This was the only place where I could find the Banofee Pie and went to pick it up right away. 

Provided curbside pickup through Toast App and the pie was amazing. Just the right amount of sweetness - you can just keep eating and eating - it was that good. 

Haven&apos;t tried their sticky toffee pudding yet but looking forward to it."
5,"Delicious food, still the same quality as pre-covid times. Sticky toffee pudding is our number one recommendation. We&apos;ve loved all the pasties we&apos;ve tried: peppered steak, tikka masala, and cauliflower vindaloo. Get the peppercorn brandy cream sauce with your pasty. The Banoffee pie is terrific as well. Ideal comfort food for when the cold weather sets in. Lots of vegetarian options too."
5,"They&apos;re open! They&apos;re open again! Their schedule is limited, so call ahead, but they are available for dine in and pick up. Btw, their frozen pasties are just the bee&apos;s knee. They reheat super well. One thing of note: they&apos;ve changed their menu, so no more veggie vindaloo!"
5,"I&apos;ve been meaning to try this restaurant for a long time now, and I&apos;m so glad I went.  The food was phenomenal, and they had so many good options to choose from.  Didn&apos;t try any of the drinks this time, but looked like they had some creative options.

My boyfriend and I split the Bangers and Mash as well as the Pilgrim, and they were both so good in their own ways.  I think I liked the Bangers and Mash a little more because of the unique wine sauce that came with it.  If I were to go again, I&apos;d definitely try some of the other options because they all sounded so so appetizing.  Speaking of appetizers, I&apos;m not normally a fan of tomato soup, but we got it since my boyfriend likes it and it was AMAZING (a definite win!).  

The Chocolate Bread &amp; Butter Pudding was SO GOOD, and if I wasn&apos;t so full from all the food I definitely would have tried others on the dessert menu.

To conclude, 11/10 would come again!"
5,"They are back and better than ever!
I had dinner here last week with my friend and it was to die for! 
I&apos;m sorry, but when you see the owner carefully rolling out the dough and making your amazing pasty fresh to order, why wouldn&apos;t you throw your money at them? Exactly.
That being said, my Cajun chicken pasty was beyond delicious, like it always is. The chipotle cream for dipping is the cherry on top. My friend&apos;s meatball pasty was incredible as well! 
The cocktails are are fantastic as well. I can&apos;t urge you enough to give this place a try, if you haven&apos;t already. 
During mega tough times like this, these businesses need our patronage more than ever."
5,"This place was recommended to me and my boyfriend by my Uber driver. He brought it up 3 times while giving recommendations. He was really passionate about it, so I knew we had to give it a shot. Well, he was right. 

This place is outstanding. I&apos;m told it&apos;s usually packed but the two times we went it was quiet. It was at opening and during very bad weather and this definitely worked in our favor. We got to sit at the window both times and enjoy the snowfall. 

Atmosphere: it&apos;s a smaller establishment, but very cozy. Great decor and really sets the tone for the experience. 

Service: service both times was excellent. Two different girls that gave equally great service. Friendly, accommodating, and quick. 

Food: oh my goodness. It&apos;s incredible. The pasties. First time having something like this and I&apos;m desperately trying to find something similar to where I live. No hope. This place is just a gem. It&apos;s total comfort food. The original was our favorite. I can&apos;t even explain it. It&apos;s like a Sunday roast dinner made into the most delicious pastry sandwich. Just mouthwatering. Fries were really good too and the dessert was unique and very tasty. This place also started my obsession with banana bread bear. 

Price: doesn&apos;t matter. It&apos;s worth it. 

Don&apos;t skip this place. We rarely ever eat at the same place twice while traveling but we knew we had to go back before our flight. It&apos;s the best restaurant we ate at during our trip to Boston. You won&apos;t regret it."
5,"I am salivating just thinking of their Reuben pasty. We grabbed a bunch of their &quot;parbaked&quot; pasties to freeze and reheat, and they reheat AMAZINGLY well. These things are delicious!!!! They send home ample amounts of sauce for each flavor and if you follow their instructions, cooking them at home is just as delicious as eating them there. Strong recommendation for the Reuben as #1 choice but everything else I&apos;ve tasted there is a close second."
4,"There&apos;s quite a few reviews touting the soups at Cornish Pasty.

Now I get it...

Cause I got myself a cup $6.95 of their Mushroom, Walnut &amp; Spinach Soup, and it was yummy.  And with the thick slice of soft bread spread with softened butter dipped in - oh, yeah!

Ironically, the name did nothing to entice me - I&apos;m not much into mushroom, nor walnuts, but here indeed is a case of something being more than the sum of its parts.

Tip: if you take it to go or have leftovers, the nuts soften up in the soup over time.  So best to eat this one up on site.  $3 more for a bowl size portion.

***

Sometimes you want to be healthy without being too much so, and so for times like that, Cornish Pasty offers the Broccoli and Cauliflower Mornay $8.95 Broccoli and cauliflower baked in homemade cheese sauce topped with herbed bread crumbs and melted cheddar cheese.  The vegetables were still nicely firm beneath the cheesiness.  However, it wasn&apos;t the most flavorful of vegetable dishes.  Perhaps a cheesy bechamel sauce would enrobe the vegetables with added flavor.

***

Turns out a cup their rich cream of Leek, Potato, &amp; Stilton soup $6.95 accompanied by their thick cut soft homebaked daily bread sufficed for my summer time lunch.  Yup, the heat sucked some of the appetite out of me.  Too bad it didn&apos;t suck out some of the fat along with it though...

It was thick and creamy, though not smooth given the graininess lent by the liquified spud.  With stilton being known as a blue cheese, I was surprised that the cheese flavor did not overwhelm.  Perhaps they used the less well known white stilton?  Or they used the blue with a restrained hand?  Either way, it was a nice soup, though I currently prefer their Mushroom, Walnut &amp; Spinach Soup of the two.

***

And last but not least, their thick and creamy Cream of Tomato Soup with Croutons $6.95 (cup), which was topped with a scattering of crisp seasoned bread cubes.  While not the most ambrosial in my personal history of tomato soups, it was quite a good one.

***

On this visit I came to realize that they don&apos;t open till noon.  Just fyi."

When you take a step into Cornish Pasty, you feel like you are taking a step into a pub in England with the long wooden bar, dim lights, and the ornate wooden booths. I immediately felt warm and welcomed here and was instantly excited for the meal. I vaguely remember them talking about pasties in Harry Potter so that brought back some childhood memories as well.

The thing to get here, as the name of the restaurant would suggest, is a cornish pasty (which is similar to a calzone or a hand pie). However, to start, my girlfriend and I shared the Parliament wings which were both sweet and spicy and definitely had a lingering spice that necessitated me calling the waiter over for more water. These chicken wings were a nice start.

I was between so many of the different pasties but given that I hadn&apos;t had Indian food in so long and because the Brits are known for good Indian food, I went for the Chicken Tikka Masala Pasty. The pasty comes cut in half and filled with chunks for chicken and potatoes. The mint-yogurt sauce is a perfect companion as the chicken breast is slightly on the dry side (chicken thighs would be a bit moister). 

We also got a side of oven fries which you could tell were cut fresh and were some of the better fries I&apos;ve had in the city.

All this food was on the cheaper side (Pasties under $16) so it&apos;s a great place to have a unique dining experience in Boston but it won&apos;t break the bank."
4,"A solid 4 stars... actually 4 1/2 

I have been craving for a particular dessert I used to have all the time in London- namely, the banofee pie. Much to my surprise, I found this place after a quick Yelp (ah good ol&apos; Yelp!) 

So one Saturday evening, after strolling Newbury Street and the Pru, I decided to stop by and indulge my sweet tooth. 

Well, while here I might as well try the Pasty too! 

First of all, to my surprise this is a very nice looking pub (rather than the takeaway pasty places all over London). And they have quite an extensive menu for a pub, including many types of pasties (even vegan), soups and salad. I was only interested in a pasty and of course my dessert, so I narrowed down my choices to the Cottage Pie and the Chicken Vindaloo. I went with the Cottage Pie as the waiter&apos;s description of a &quot;burger with a pie crust&quot; was too tempting. It tastes mainly of ground beef, mash potatoes, and cheese. Yummy!! The beef was on the bland side for me, but a healthy smother of the wine sauce took care of things nicely! 

Now... the banoffee pie... the reason for my visit!

Well, I was a bit underwhelmed there to be honest. It tasted mostly of the whipped cream and the very crunchy crust. I didn&apos;t really taste the caramel / banana combo I so missed. But it was still a damn fine dessert! And with a generous portion so it can be easily split. Good thing too, because it&apos;s quite pricey for dessert!

Overall, this place is a little pricey for what you get. But hey, it won&apos;t stop me from coming back! 

Also I didn&apos;t indulge but the drinks menu looked to be befitting of a British pub too!"
5,"I had a great time here yesterday. I came with a friend who is vegan, and she had a wonderful array of options to choose from (even a dessert). I also tried the oven chips for the first time. These are oven baked French fries with your choice of topping. Also, the drink menu is great because it has a visual diagram of each cocktail you can order."
5,"Check this place out if you&apos;re looking for: 
- Quality, hot, filling meals in a variety of tempting flavor schemes, all fantastically prepared. 
- Friendly staff full of fun stories and great recommendations on local activities
- Extensive cocktail and beer menu for sampling
- Diverse soundtrack playing a mix of throwback and fresh tunes
- Historic photos on the walls of Cornish mining society
- A welcoming bar where you can watch the pasties being prepared, and chat with staff and other visitors
- Clean, comfortable restroom"
5,"Review:  
Wow what a great British type of meal!  Highly recommend this place!  The pasty&apos;s are what they&apos;re known for (kind of reminded me of an empanada) but it was so good!!  Very tasteful and filling!  You can even see them making the bread for the pasty&apos;s.  Courtesy of Yelp got a free order of oven chips.  The sticky toffee pudding w/ice cream topped off the entire meal.  

Customer Service:
There is limited seating so we had to wait a little.  Our waitress was very friendly and professional.  She offered us water while we had to wait and took care of us as we finally got a table.  Amazing service!  

Ordered: oven chips, the oggie (steak, potato, onion, &amp; rutabaga), the pilgrim  (chicken, sweet potato, onion, homemade stuffing), spicy asiago chicken, sticky toffee pudding"
5,"What&apos;s British for &quot;comfort food?&quot; This will do nicely. Earlier in the year, I was in Phoenix where I walked past the Cornish Pasty there way too many times without stopping in, so as soon as someone suggested dinner here, I was glad to say yes!  I&apos;m kind of glad I didn&apos;t actually step into the one in Phoenix first because, based on pictures I&apos;ve seen, that one is more like a restaurant, and this one is more like a pub, which feels much more authentic. Likewise, I was really loving the music playing when I arrived, having to do searches to discover I was listening to groups unfamiliar to me, first the British band The Temples, then the Australian band King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard. Switching to 80s R&amp;B after that was okay - at least some of it was by Prince - but I also felt somewhat redeemed as my exit was timed with a Hall &amp; Oates song (couldn&apos;t you play the other stuff all evening???). 

While I really liked the selection of beers, I often sample any old fashioned on the drink menu, so here I tried their Infused Old Fashioned, in which the infusions are vanilla, chamomile, and honey. While at first taste I thought it was weak, upon standing after the end of my meal, I can claim it was most assuredly not.

Oh right... there&apos;s pasties to be eaten. We went with more traditional pot pie types, namely the Chicken Pot Pie and the Pilgrim.  But really, I would have been satisfied with anything on the menu... I wonder if you can order a flight of pasties? Bonus points for seeing chunks of chicken in the gravy as I poured it over mine. All in all, it was a very satisfying experience, one that bears repeating."
5,"I was walking back home from work with no intention of stopping anywhere to eat. Came across Cornish Pasty Co. looked at the menu and decided to try it out. I&apos;ve never had pasties before, and let me tell you I was blown away. I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala pasty and it was soooo good. I am riding a food high right now and I&apos;m in such a good mood. If I could give this place more than 5 stars I would. Definitely recommend"
5,Best pasty in town. Secret back bay hot spot with some of the best tomato soup in New England. Veggie and Vegan friendly. Seasonal menu and everything is mad from scratch each day. Check Instagram for weekly specials
5,"I thought Cornish Pasty would be good -- like solid, British-ish fare. I didn&apos;t realize it would be FUN.

First, the food. For ~$15, you get a massive pasty (think a large hand pie) stuffed to the brim with taters, peas and carrots, and meat (or vegetarian/vegan filling) of your choosing. The lamb was rich and meaty and the cottage pie was delectable as well. On the side, you get a beautiful dipping gravy: I basically licked the little tin of red wine gravy clean. And the pie crust was heavenly -- fatty and flakey without being heavy, dry, or oily.

They have a strong drink selection and the sticky toffee pudding dessert was excellent as well -- it comes in a piping hot cauldron with a really generous side of vanilla ice cream, one of the few times where I feel like there is enough ice cream to carb ratio. Plus, not having the ice cream right on the hot toffee pudding helps you eat it leisurely! Particularly nice since the toffee pudding gets a little crusty along the side of the cauldron, in the most delicious, crunchy, smokey way.

But what I really enjoyed about this place was its vibe. We sat at the bar and enjoyed a great view of the kitchen, where the guy was making pasties literally in front of us. The restaurant is poorly-lit in that British, dark-paneled wood way. The staff is super friendly without being intrusive, and thoroughly Bostonian. I&apos;ll definitely be back, and soon!"
5,"An updated review just to remind everyone how incredible this place truly is - I had the pleasure of stopping in and enjoying the Cornish Pasty on a recent trip back to Boston. I was in town for a conference and my first stop (literally, I landed at the airport, got in a Lyft, and made my way straight over) was the Cornish Pasty for dinner. The place was comfortably full so I snagged a solo seat at the bar. They now have a full bar serving beer, wine, and cocktails (when they first opened, they were waiting for their license to sell alcohol). 

The food, the customer service, and the ambiance are like a fine wine ... they&apos;ve aged beautifully. It had been over a year since my last visit, when I last lived in Boston, and I was thrilled to see that although the menu has developed and expanded, it hasn&apos;t lost any of its charm. And they are still under the excellent ownership and exemplary customer service leadership of Brandon and Michael. 

But to the food - the amazing flavors are all still there. The &quot;stick to your bones&quot; potato and leek soup with homemade bread was just as amazing as I remembered it. And the pasty (Shepherds Pie for this visit) was bold and bursting with incredible flavor, cooked to perfection and served with the perfectly balanced red wine gravy. And to top it all off - my favorite dessert ever - banoffee pie, topped with freshly sliced bananas. They have a pasty for every palette. 

I tried my hardest to convince Michael and Brandon to abandon the cold and snow of New England and open up a Cornish Pasty in Sacramento. No such luck. So for now, I&apos;ll have to daydream of the next time I can enjoy the wonderful food at Cornish Pasty."
5,Awesome place that offers something a little different around Boston. Glad that they&apos;re still able to provide great service during COVID.
4,"I&apos;ve come here a few times now and the food has been great consistently!

They are most known for their &quot;pasties&quot;. I didn&apos;t know what a pasty was until I ate one here, and that was the reason I came - to try something new. A pasty,  IMO, is like a baked empanada. The similarities are that the crust has a crunchy texture with a filling inside. However, a pasty is much bigger and more like a meal than an appetizer. The crust is also more flaky while the filling is moist. We&apos;ve tried a few of the pasties - the spicy asiago chicken and the veggie portobello. But my favorite is the chicken tikka masala - so yummy. 

The menu is diverse. Apart from various pasties, they have salads, sides, wings, desserts, etc. However, a pasty itself is so large that it doesn&apos;t leave room for much else. For example, each dessert is almost 10 bucks, just imagine the portion size. And I don&apos;t like to waste food. I wish they had half sizes for their menu items, it would make it easier to order more.

Customer service is great. Servers have always been warm and friendly and also helpful in giving suggestions. The first time we came here, it took a looooong time for the pasties to be ready, like 40-45 minutes. But the next few times, it&apos;s been much quicker so I believe they&apos;ve gotten better over time.

Other stuff: The restaurant has a pub like feel to it, a little dark, limited seating. Metered parking is available on the street. 

If you&apos;ve never had a pasty, this is the place to be. After you&apos;ve eaten your full, you can walk it off by taking a stroll across the Harvard bridge while observing the beautiful sights along the Charles River!"
