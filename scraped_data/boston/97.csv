5,"My absolute favorite place for hot chocolate in Boston!! I&apos;ve been to both the Back Bay and Cambridge locations numerous times. The dark hot chocolate is a MUST try. I usually get a small because it is so rich and creamy that you don&apos;t need a bigger size. I&apos;ve also tried their cakes which are delicious and super cute. 

Note that seating is closed due to COVID, but their drinks and desserts are super convenient for to-go orders. Also they sell chocolates and hot chocolate mixes!"
5,"Visited L.A. Burdick to get some hot chocolate on a chilly day and they take really great safety precautions and enforce social distancing rules really well. Made my quick time there feel pretty safe! I also got to try the Milk Hot Chocolate - it&apos;s A LOT sweeter than the dark hot chocolate, and I felt like it&apos;s a bit thinner in consistency compared to the dark version. Still prefer the dark hot chocolate, but both are great by hot chocolate standards!"
5,"Fine, they deserve five stars even though the door keeper lady chastised me for not wearing my mask over my nose when my glasses completely fogged over and I tried to read the menu. Ok, moving on. This was the National Hot Chocolate Day and I was gonna have one hot beverage on the frigid Boston day. And I did and it was lovely. Had Madagascar hot chocolate. It was rich and creamy and very sweet and thick."
4,"I love coming here especially during the winter!!!

Hot coco and sweets is always the perfect pick me up on any day. 

I will say their hot coco is SO smooth and decadent. A warning would be their mocha was VERY caffeinated that I did feel sick after drinking it. I usually drink coffee everyday but this was extremely strong, so just be aware of what time of day you&apos;re drinking this!

They have chocolates you can purchase and also hot coco too.  There are also various chocolate cakes you can order along with cookies as well. Their prices are a little big on the expensive side, but it is a nice experience and they never disappoint. 

Coming here after dinner is the perfect way to end the night :)"
5,"L.A. Burdick never disappoints when it comes to hot chocolate. I&apos;ll certainly purchase their actual chocolates from time to time, but the thing I&apos;d definitely go out of my way to get is that hot cocoa. It&apos;s ridiculous: rich and decadent, but not cavity-causing sweet. I&apos;m a broke college student, so take it from me -- it&apos;s worth it. 

Sometimes a line, sometimes quiet, but always friendly staff and a clean environment. Lovely little storefront caught my eye while out on a stroll; So happy that I popped in."
5,Love this cafe. Staff was very friendly and explained all the chocolates choices with detail. Unfortunately we didn&apos;t make it in time to dine in but we got our goodies to go. Coconut cake was delicious and the passion fruit was different. Small everyday assortment boxes of 9 handmade chocolates was just enough with a soy cappuccino and double espresso. Perfect end to a early Valentine&apos;s dinner in Boston.
4,"A classic must try if you are visiting Boston (or a local like me who has never tried it)! This place is bougie chocolate central. They LITERALLY have single origin hot chocolate (mine was from Madagascar!). The hot chocolate is thick and rich and truly unlike anything you&apos;ve ever tasted. Honestly, it is so rich it is probably something you don&apos;t need to go back to again, but it is must try! My rec would be to get some hot chocolate from Burdick&apos;s and then go for a crisp walk down commonwealth ave with the lights in the winter!"
4,"Even though there was a line out the door, but we felt everyone tried to keep their distance and even inside was not overly crowded while waiting. The staff were all masked up and contactless payment. We got a few pastries, Earl Grey mousse, mocha cake and Burdick. All were delicious. The Burdick dark hot chocolate was perfect on a chilly night."
5,"Chocolate-walnut cookies....enough said! Possibly the best chocolate chip cookie I&apos;ve ever had!!! 

The chocolate chips are huuuuge chocolate chunks and the cookies is soft yet crispy on the outside.

Haven&apos;t had much else here, but the cookies were fantastic, and I&apos;ll definitely be back to try other items!"
5,Very interesting shop. They have really great hot chocolate which is very very rich. The shop also has a selection of chocolates for gifting and they are always impeccably packed and wrapped. It&apos;s great for if you need a gift in a pinch!
5,"We took one of the duck boat tours earlier in the day and the person giving the tour mentioned this place so we decided to check it out. We walked through a couple of the parks nearby and since the sun was going down it seemed only fitting to grab something hot to drink. There wasn&apos;t a line which was nice and everyone inside the shop was wearing a mask and abiding by covid regulations. We ordered our hot chocolates, mine a dark hot choc with whipped cream &amp; a milk hot choc for my friend. They came in 2 sizes, lg and small &amp; the lids were very tight. Nothing worse than a leaky lid! It was a cute shop &amp; the staff was very friendly. The shop is also located in a busy area filled with restaurants, shops and festive houses so it&apos;s nice to grab something sweet and take a walk around the neighborhood!"
5,"I&apos;m in love. We came in on a cold rainy day, and this was the perfect stop to hide from the gloom. It&apos;s on a side street off Boylston, but you can&apos;t miss it! There&apos;s often a small line out the door, and the shop is in a small cute cottage looking building. 

I&apos;ve had the Earl Grey Blueberry and it was amazing! Perfectly light and fluffy. But this review is all about their hot cocoa! The tastiest, richest hot chocolate ever. I&apos;ve had the white, milk, and a dark one and they&apos;re all delicious in their own way. The milk is my personal favorite since it has just enough sweetness for me. But honestly, even the white one wasn&apos;t as overly sweet as i expected. 

Definitely a place to check out if you&apos;re in the area!"
5,"It was my last night in Boston and my friend said this had the best hot chocolate. It was the nicest richest hot Choco I have ever had.

I got the dark chocolate and it was very filling. Grabbed some gifts as well from here.

It is a cute spot to catch up with a friend or a date even. It makes you feel like you are in a cute Parisian coffee shop.

I really wanted the cup with the writing next time ! :)"
5,"Lovely chocolate treats and beverages. The team working was so sweet. Just note sit down dining was available up until 11am. I missed that memo when I was looking this place up, but you can take your treats to a park bench in Copley Square, Comm Ave Mall, or The Commons! Which is exactly what we did :)"
3,"The cafe is cute and welcoming. Great location as it is right off Boylston street in Copley. 

Keep in mind that L.A. Burdick consist of more dark chocolate rather than milk or white chocolate (I generally enjoy milk chocolate). I decided to give it a try due to the appealing signature assortment boxes. I purchased a small box and it came in 14 pieces including their iconic signature chocolate mouse. 

The packaging was very nice. Each piece of chocolate is separated into it&apos;s own wrapper, packaged in a wooden box, tied with a ribbon and stamped with gold wax.

Very difficult to find parking as it is off a busy street. I would recommend taking public transportation as it is walkable from the station."
4,This hot chocolate is something special - literally tastes like melted chocolate in beverage form! Highly recommend.
4,"I didn&apos;t have the hot chocolate that seems to be most popular, but still really enjoyed the cake. I had the passion fruit mousse cake alongside a camomile tea. The beautiful cake was also yummy and the chocolate and passion fruit was a nice combo. It was what I was looking for and just hit the spot as an after-dinner treat alongside a warm tea.

As some have mentioned, the tea menu on the large overhead menu is not accurate so they have a more limited/slightly different selection.

The boyfriend had the mocha cake which he really liked with an earl grey tea. Neither cake is very sweet, which I like, and instead have a richer chocolate flavor. 

The reason for knocking off a star was their customer service. The man who helped us at the counter was not very friendly and I had to ask and remind the staff a few times to have the water pitcher refilled. Maybe get two pitchers? It was emptied in minutes since a lot of patrons sit inside."
4,"The hot chocolate at LA Burdick lives up to the legend!

It is creamy, chocolatey, and thick. I&apos;ve come here after many Christmas festivities and it is everything I dreamed of to make my Hallmark holiday moment. The building is also the cozy and warm place you imagine curling up and sipping your holiday beverages.

My only complaint is the seating and lines. The lines are regularly long and the seating is sparse. I&apos;ve always had to compete to snag a seat. It&apos;s also unclear whether you leave plates on your table or take them to the counter. That creates an added confusion to what is and isn&apos;t open since some tables are covered with used mugs and crumble filled plates. 

I think LA Burdick is the best way to warm you up after a busy day of Christmas shopping."
4,"My favorite part of LA Burdicks is that it looks like a chalet in the middle of Back Bay! I&apos;ve been here on several occasions. Great place to meet up with friends and feel like you&apos;re away from the hustle and bustle of back bay. They do have a retail section inside, which does disrupt some of the cafe vibes. 

It is very pricy, but really great quality for the price. Their hot chocolate is a little too rich for me, but everything else is great! I recently got one of their cakes, which was incredible. They have a great tea selection. I would be interested to try some of their espresso based drinks because I think they&apos;d be incredible too. The staff are always very nice and helpful at answering questions. Their attention to detail is off the charts."
5,"This place is AMAZING! For chocolate lovers, this is heaven on earth! I literally wanted to buy everything because it looked and smelled so good I could just live off chocolate.  My friends and I ordered different cakes to try and OMG it was delicious! I could eat all of them at once if I had to.  The taste of chocolate is so rich and pure.  No regrets! 
This place rules!!"
