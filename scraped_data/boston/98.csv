5,"I was recently very pleasantly surprised with a gift order from this store, as my friend wanted to keep me occupied during the pandemic. I got 6 books in the first shipment, along with postcards and bookmarks. I appreciated their handwritten notes like indicting what would be shipped separately. 

I had also been there in person once for a special event they hosted in their dining area upstairs. They played Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse and even had cute drink menus to tie into the event. 

This shop has really great customer service!"
5,"It&apos;s a well-known secret in Boston that Trident Bookstore has a really good brunch menu.

Unfortunately, due to COVID, there&apos;s no sit-down dining, but we always stop by for a quick breakfast burrito when we&apos;re in the area. Their salsa is really tangy and fresh too!"
4,"Such a cute restaurant and friendly staff! The kale quinoa bowl was delicious. Eggs cooked to perfection and the garbanzo beans were a great add. Very healthy and filling. 
Got a small americano and my only complaint is the original cup came with lipstick stains on it and that got me worried because of the pandemic. However, the waiter was friendly and replaced it for me instantly. Besides that, would still recommend!"
5,"Such a great vibe inside and love their collection of books! Also it&apos;s so cool that the cafe blends in so well with the rest of the store.
I did a full review on their bagels (cause that&apos;s what I do) so feel free to check it out.

1,"This restaurant does not give the same care in attention to detail to their online orders that they do in person. I have now ordered here twice and both times Trident has failed to deliver me the correct food I have ordered. 
DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ORDERING FROM HERE ONLINE!!!!"
5,"Great as always. One of my favorite spots in all of Boston. We ordered a couple coffee drinks, some egg dishes, and a sandwich, and were very pleased. The latte and fried eggs were especially good. 
The interior is so cute and the book selection is wonderful. 10/10 recommend!!"
2,"Really yummy food! Trident earns these two stars for its delicious, diverse selection and its cute bookstore ambiance. They lose the other three for poor service and overpriced small plates. I&apos;ve visited a few times and have experienced more than one mess-up, including non-vegan options for vegan diners and wrong dishes altogether. The servers weren&apos;t super friendly or attentive, especially for the price. Overall, Trident offers an over-rated experience; their cozy bookstore location held 90% of its appeal, so I would recommend patronizing other local breakfast joints (Veggie Galaxy, Friendly Toast, and Brookline Lunch are all great!) until in-person dining returns."
3,"Food 2. Atmosphere 3.5, location 4"
4,"It&apos;s easy to try and compartmentalize Trident to your favorite part of it:

As a cafe, the food rises above typical bookstore fare with full breakfasts, hearty sandwiches, real ingredient smoothies, BEER and more. Foodies would call Trident a really strong restaurant that also sells books and things.

As a book and things vendors, I mean, yeah, this is the core of their business: stocking everything hipster want to read, a number of level two woke titles, as well as the mass pubs ideal for parents or Secret Santa trades. Don&apos;t ignore the strong tchotchke and trinket goodies on the table running spine through the first floor - lots of quirk for gift givers.

As an event space, Trident holds a number of readings and signings on the second floor, permitting a separate audience to maintain ambiance uninterrupted by casual shoppers. The layout is beneficial to introspective or emotional works that would be outright ruined if broken by a bro yelling, &quot;Aw dude, they got Stassi&apos;s Basic Bitch book. Harharhar.&quot;

I mean, they do have it, but still..."
5,"I will always have a soft spot in my heart for Trident. When I was a teen and on my first time coming into Boston w/ my friends and no adults (before this, I&apos;d only come in to Boston w/ my parents to visit my aunt &amp; uncle or go to the theater) my friends and I went to the Trident Cafe and I felt all cool and grown up drinking a cappuccino. Flash to now, I&apos;m in my 40s, and I still come here. I love the bookstore as they have a great selection of books, cards, notebooks and other fun items. The cafe is great too--awesome breakfast and coffee drinks, especially. This is a must stop on Newbury St. if you&apos;re in the area. Support local businesses like Trident!"
5,"One of my fav indie bookstores in Boston. Excellent bookstore &amp; cafe with two stories of books and interesting knick knacks, if you happen to need to buy a gift for a coworker. My favorite thing about Trident is the large rotating selection of discount books - they&apos;re not obscure titles but recent hardback titles. Whenever I&apos;m in Back Bay I like to visit and see what they have on sale - on my most recent visit I picked up a new hardcover copy of Ronan Farrow&apos;s Catch and Kill for $8. Amazing! I have had their food a handful of times and it did not disappoint. You can get a beyond burger and house made cold pressed juice. Definitely recommend this place!"
3,"The atmosphere is great -books and breakfast such a perfect concept- but the food was very below average. The eggs I I was served were cold and the bacon tasted like it was microwaved - very chewy with tons of fat. The breakfast was pretty expensive for subpar food. It&apos;s all contact-less ordering right now which is a wonderful concept but limited service ie waiting to ask for salt/pepper, utensils etc. I think it&apos;s a great place to shop but not a wonderful place to eat."
4,"Trident has a super cute concept that is clearly very popular, as evidenced by the bustling crowds in the bookstore and café even at 3 pm on a Monday. My group of four went to the café for a late snack/lunch and enjoyed sharing three dishes!

We tried the eggs benedict, French toast stuffed with lemon ricotta, and prosciutto &amp; brie sandwich. Our waitress was really nice and accommodated our request to cut the sandwich into four pieces, and she also offered to bring out plates so we could share. The food was good; the French toast was pleasantly plush, and the sandwich was balanced and came with satisfying ridged potato chips. When broken open, the eggs were not as runny as expected. I&apos;m not the best judge of traditional breakfast foods as I don&apos;t eat them too often/tend to prefer to eat a lot of desserts on the less sweet side, but my friends felt that the French toast was lacking in filling and could&apos;ve used whipped cream.

The store is a fun place to browse with a variety of books and trinkets, although it can be difficult to access items in the narrow aisles. If even two people stop to talk, as often occurs, the entire section becomes inaccessible.

Still, I would recommend Trident as a fun place to grab a bite and spend time with friends! The café has plenty of tables and seats and is a good place to have a chat, and wandering through the store is quite fun."
3,"Review is strictly for the gift shop and book store. I feel complete when I walk into a bookstore and see many items geared toward the enjoyment of reading. The #blinddatewithabook wall selection is just that sort of thing and thrilled me to see it.  Great selection of greeting cards... I mean the nice ones on good card stock with creative expressions and artwork.

I didn&apos;t eat here but the vibe was Hella trendy in here and the music was nice to wander around to. Customer service was ok.

4,"First of all, Trident is a BOOKSTORE that sells alcohol and delicious meals. What else do you really need in life?

They don&apos;t take reservations on the weekend, so expect a wait. Luckily, you can peruse the bookstore in the meantime. 

We went for brunch, but take note that they have events, ranging from speed dating to trivia, most weeknights. 

We ordered a bunch of different items. The best was the eggs Benedict. Perfectly cooked, and you could actually cut through the English muffin. 

On the other hand, you should AVOID the huevos rancheros. I&apos;m really surprised because I&apos;ve been impressed with everything I&apos;ve eaten during multiple visits, until seeing that dish. As you can see in the picture, this is two tortillas, with very limited toppings, and an egg on top. There is a bit of salsa on the side, but it&apos;s really disappointing. 

Basically, definitely go to Trident and order anything except the huevos rancheros and you&apos;ll have an awesome time!"
5,"I just had to update my review after I went and had breakfast at Trident this morning. I had the savory eggs and cheddar bowl with bacon and rice and tomato and onion and it was delicious! Their ordering system is great, too. You just sit down and scan the QR code at your table. Then you order and pay using your phone, and they bring your food to you. Great for social distancing during COVID. 
I plan to come back when I have more time, eat, and buy a book as well."
4,"Trident is such a cute, cool and unique place and quite a popular one too. Its a bookstore, a coffee shop, a restaurant, trivia night venue and so much more! We&apos;ve been there a few times (pre Covid of course), most recent being a few times in February for trivia nights plus dinner. We went on Valentine&apos;s day and ordered the baja chicken sandwich which was delicious and a side of sweet potato fries and those were great too. Veggie tacos were good. Trivia host was great and had all these novel trivia rounds and questions. Interestingly he announced that night that the following weekend would be his last one hosting Trivia at Trident after ten plus years (!!) because he was going to run his arcade business which he co-owned and was opening a second location. And that his last night at Trident would be a big blowout. 

So of course we showed up the following weekend, good thing we got there a bit early because the place was packed! Lots of loyal fans indeed! This time the theme was his 5 favorite movies - RoboCop, Blade Runner, Alien, Buckaroo Banzai, Brazil. We actually did pretty well and surprise surprise won 3rd place!! The food we ordered was a turkey burger which came with a cranberry mayo and fries and the french dip roast beef sandwich with au jus. Food was good.

They do have an extensive menu and I&apos;ve always thought about going there for brunch. Maybe someday! But they are doing take-out and delivery so that may be an option in the near future to support them during these times. 

Everyone, please support local businesses, a lot of them are struggling and need your support."
4,"I adore this place! It&apos;s funny because I&apos;ve walked by Trident a million times and each time I&apos;ve made a mental note to check it out, but never did until recently - total mistake on my part, I&apos;ve been 
missing out on such a neighborhood gem! It seems that there is usually a little bit of a wait for the cafe, but it tends to move fast and there is a lot of seating. The menu is huge! I really appreciated their wide selection of food options, despite being the 
most indecisive person ever when it comes to ordering. The atmosphere is lively, but not overwhelmingly loud. Everyone enjoyed their meals and afterwards we walked around the shop. They have a lot of discounted books and fun gift ideas for folks. I&apos;m really glad I finally checked this place out! 

I definitely recommend Trident if you&apos;re looking for a local bookstore or a place to grab a bite!"
5,"Excellent place for multiple things. Very good breakfast for a day you want to fill up and enjoy yourself. Great place to drink coffee and chill. And it&apos;s a great book store with cool funky knick knacks and goo-ga&apos;s (like a wool cap with built in rechargeable LED light for about $13!!!).

I loved my egg sandwich for breakfast. Also loved the corned beef hash I shared with my wife. I order that a lot and this was one of best versions I&apos;ve had.

My son&apos;s chocolate chip pancakes were also excellent. Good flavor, good texture, just the right amount of chocolate.

Returned to same place, had another good breakfast. Eggs Benedict - good, not great; Hollandaise was a bit bland, but eggs cooked (medium at my request), just perfect. Potatoes were good, but I like them even more browned (even though I did request  extra-crispy). Nonetheless, very enjoyable - I will return."
5,"Boston eats are almost infinite and this place has a nice atmosphere. If you in the mood for coffee, read a book or have a full brunch. Great location ! The food was great and the staff was attentive. Great coffee"
