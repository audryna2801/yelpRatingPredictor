5,"Gather is my favorite type of restaurant. Open kitchen, aesthetically pleasing decor, outdoor patio out back, darker, and a small menu. I was confident that anything I ordered would be great. I wanted to order the Whipped Ricotta but the Corn Fritters were seasonal so I ordered those and will get the ricotta on the next visit. I also ordered the burger and while it&apos;s not a show stopping burger like let&apos;s say Kumas it was unbelievable! The brioche bun, burger was cooked to perfection, the white cheddar, the bacon, the caramelized onions, and aioli. It was perfect. Can&apos;t wait to return. 

And that&apos;s all I have to say about that.

5,"I&apos;ve frequented Gather for quite some time now but have to say less often after I moved out of the neighborhood. Despite that the staff seemed to remember me whenever I&apos;d come in and their food was always up to the high standards I&apos;m used to. The cocktail selection is pretty great as well, making it difficult to pick just one.
Tonight, I decided to try their family style dinner take out and I was truly blown away, from the portions, display, and value for the price. I cannot praise this place enough and I&apos;m so happy to see they&apos;re still pushing through these uncertain times. After the feast we just had I&apos;m sure we will be ordering the other set menus, I&apos;m eyeing the Saturday selection next."
5,"We ordered takeout during the coronavirus period. We got the family style takeout option. It is $50 total and feeds a family of 4-5. 

It included fancy versions of potato salad, Mac and cheese, pulled pork shoulder, and jalapeño corn bread. The potato salad was very good: garlicky with bacon and aioli (no mayo).

Mac and cheese was also good. Not too saucy. Included several kinds of cheese. 

It also included pulled pork shoulder and jalapeño corn bread. Both were tasty. 

The portion was very big and worth the price. The meat was the smallest portion so if you are dying for a ton of meat, it wouldn&apos;t be a best fit (but the meat portion size was good). We would order it again. 

It also came with two surprise cookies that weren&apos;t listed in the website menu"
5,"Honestly Gather is a hidden gem and I wanted to keep it that way, but I decided to share my gem with the world.

Gather is one of the few restaurants that still offers great food and great service! They&apos;ve found the balance that many restaurants struggle to find. I love Gather, because you know always are going to great meal at an affordable price!

The family dinners are honestly the best! I&apos;m sure they won&apos;t mind if you passed it off as your own cooking, but BEWARE the dinner is so good, your family will expect those amazing cook skills every night! So make sure you commit, they have a family dinner every night of the week for you.

The food is so great! Not bland or over spiced! The chef knows is balance and flavors. Also, it says like a home cooked meal!

The wine selection is great! I love a wine list that has you experience different regions and try something new!


Honestly, do yourself a favor and go to Gather. They won&apos;t let you down!"
4,"This food and the service here are amazing! Highly recommend that you make this place happen, if you can.  Our group of 4 basically ordered the entire menu and they were all delicious. Each dish was perfect.  

The drink menu is also really good to. Each person around the table got something different and loved them all. 

Great spot. Great back patio.  Awesome meal."
5,"One of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. Staff is great. The chilled corn bisque was one of my favorites. I&apos;ve also had their Brussels sprouts, halibut, rock shrimp gnocchi, uovo ravioli, cheesecake, the apple doughnuts, and summer pea malfadine. I&apos;d pass on the ravioli as it was so rich and buttery to the point you felt all the fat after one bite. The summer pea malfadine was bland. The apple doughnuts were too rich and the vanilla ice cream they paired it with tasted like Breyers. Other than that, everything was great and all the dishes were well portioned for the price."
5,"Definitely one of our favorite restaurants in Chicago, My husband and I We went to Gather to celebrate my birthday last night (we actually got engaged here two years ago) we had an amazing time we love their food, ambiance, service, EVERYTHING since the moment we walked in the host was super nice and friendly we got there early and she make us feel welcome immediately, our server Nathan was super nice, very knowledgeable, friendly and attentive! And the food was EXCEPTIONAL!
Definitely love this place!!!"
4,"Another wish list item as I have heard amazing things and I live in the neighborhood. Came here for dinner at 7:15pm on a Thursday with my parents. The place is small, dimly lit, and loud. They also have a back patio outside. We were seated next to the window in the front right next to the door. Luckily not a lot of people came through and didn&apos;t bother us while we were eating. 

I had an Old Fashioned, which was good. We ordered the whipped ricotta as an appetizer and split the pork chop and spaghetti. The whipped ricotta was the best! The baguette was warm and toasty. The ricotta was very flavorful and sweet due to the honey. I am not a big fan of pork chops as they are usually dry, but Gather enlightened my taste buds. The pork chop was very good as it was juicy and all of the toppings made it very flavorful and sweet. But it wasn&apos;t that tender, which pork chops usually are and I needed a sharper knife. The spaghetti was solid as well. 

The only negative was our waiter. When we first arrived, our waiter didn&apos;t really welcome us and we had to ask if we could order drinks. Our waiter was very soft spoken and hard to hear and never came back to check in with us. The hostess and staff were courteous and professional. Prices aren&apos;t bad and the portion sizes were good. Gather is known for brunch so I will have to try it next time. Overall, the food was very good and I would recommend giving Gather a try!"
5,Best meal we&apos;ve had in a long time. Cocktail was delicious. We agreed the Brussels sprouts were best we&apos;ve ever had. Also had the flavorful mushroom gnocchi and perfect seared scallops. The staff was very attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. Will definitely be back to see what else exceeds our expectations!!
3,"I wish I could give this cute restaurant more stars but unfortunately I didn&apos;t have the best experience. We had 3-4 different servers and never saw the same person more then twice if that so I think there were some communication issues. I orders an Irish coffee which is on their alcoholic beverage list, it tasted like rubbing alcohol in my opinion. Thankfully they took it back but it took a really long time for them to come check on us so when they switched it out for normal coffee I barely got to drink half a cup ($4) by the time we paid our bill. Then i ordered over medium eggs and got them over hard, I informed the server (another new server) and she just said oh and walked away. So that was a little upsetting since they were inedible and I ordered them on the side so it was an extra charge. 

There are lots of positives about this place. I just think I unfortunately had a bad experience. The restaurant is cute, actually very spacious, didn&apos;t seem to have a crazy wait for a Sunday brunch hour, and all the servers were friendly. I ordered the French toast that had cinnamon apples on it. Wow it was AMAZING!! We also ordered bacon (which they aren&apos;t joking about it being a pile) but it was paper bacon which isn&apos;t my favorite. I prefer thick juicy bacon. My friend had mimosas that she loved &amp; something which shrimp that looked really good. She loved her experience here. They definitely didn&apos;t rush us but would&apos;ve preferred the service been slightly faster (just what I&apos;m used to) but if you&apos;re here to lounge this is a good place. The coffee had the most bold smell. It woke you up just sitting on the table which I LOVED! 

Overall this is a cute place with a fun menu to check out. Just be aware you may have multiple servers and need to speak up for yourself."
5,I&apos;m so glad this place is still open!! I got a couple deliveries since Covid. The food is the same as when ordering and eating there!! Thank you for continuing of going above and beyond.
4,"I think I finally got it. .. Gather excels at brunch. Previously I only came in for dinner and didn&apos;t understand the hype. After trying brunch I can see the 5 star potential. Aside from the server taking forever to take our order, brunch was perfect.

We sat at the chefs counter and watched as they skillfully navigated the tiny kitchen. Three chefs worked as a unit each knowing their role. It&apos;s clear they have great rapport. I observed several instances where they helped each other prepare and plate.

Flapjacks were buttery and airy, house cured bacon was delicious without being oversalted and the Roasted Pork Shoulder Skillet was umptious. Brunch was so impressive I plan to give dinner another try in the very near future."
5,"My boyfriend and I had a late dinner at Gather on Saturday night and it was a wonderful experience! We arrived a little bit early for our reservation, but the hosts directed us to the cocktail takeout window on the restaurant next door so we could grab a drink while we waited out front. We sipped on some really yummy cocktails served by super friendly staff, and when the time came for our reservation the hostess checked our temperatures before leading us through the dining room to the back patio. The patio was well spaced and the decor was so dreamy! We were given an envelope with a card detailing the steps they have taken to ensure guest safety and the steps that they ask us to take to do the same. We were provided with hand sanitizer and alcohol wipes for our phones.

Angelique was our server and was a total sweetheart and amazing server. We had the whipped ricotta with clover honey and balsamic for our appetizer. We split a bottle of Sangiovese red wine, my boyfriend had the halibut and I had the burger, and all our food was fantastic and fresh. Angelique was really knowledgeable about the menu and made sure our water and wine glasses were never empty. 

The prices are also really reasonable if you&apos;re looking for a nice night out without breaking the bank. We ordered a $60 bottle of wine, but before that the meal was about $60 for the appetizer and two entrees. 

I would encourage anyone looking to eat here to make a reservation, but overall I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a romantic night out!"
4,"We visited Gather for an early Valentine&apos;s Day dinner. Right away, the decor of the restaurant hits you - this is a classier place, without being off-putting. 

We were also pleasantly surprised at the very fair prices and variety of vegetarian options. Even items that are listed with meat (the ravioli) can be customized. 

The food was very good and unique. We tried and split half a dozen items, from a great apple/almond butter salad, to spaghetti squash and mango glazed cauliflower. Everything was very fresh, very good. 

Two immediate knocks were:
1) This place is oddly quite loud. It&apos;s hard to have a conversation without speaking loudly. And because you&apos;re sitting close to your neighbors, this can be a challenge. 

2) Service is prompt, but not attentive. We received food quickly, but were never asked about refilling wine glasses, water wasn&apos;t replenished with any promptness, and it did take a lot of time to take our order, ask
about dessert, etc."
4,"Dined here with friends. The food was yummy. They can modify a surprising amount of menu items to be gluten free. A lot of items contain dairy so to modify for gluten and dairy free would really throw off the substance/portions of the menu offering. 

The noise level was louder than anticipated. When we arrived there was only one other table seated and we were seated right next to them so I felt like we were competing in who could talk louder just hear each other."
5,"The best service - and food - I&apos;ve had in this pandemic. Gather went above and beyond to make their guests feel welcomed and happy. 

I made a reservation for the dining room by accident, and called ahead of time to request outdoor. Sarah was very helpful over the phone and suggested that my guest and I arrive early. We did, and the front of house staff was kind enough to move things around to accommodate my request.

Upon being seated by the host, Emily, we were given a welcome packet with hand sanitizer,  phone antibacterial wipes and a welcome letter - how clever! The patio is beautiful, romantic and intimate. It smells fresh and is kept warm during a breezy, chilly night. 

Our waiter Nathan was prompt in greeting us and delivering our delicious drinks (one of the best Old Fashioneds I&apos;ve ever had). Our food arrived quickly, and the busser was on top of changing out our plates and silverware between courses.

We shared the Half Chicken, Cured Salmon board, Brussels Sprouts &amp; Gnocchi -- all wonderful and highly recommended."
3,"I came here for brunch over the weekend after wanting to try this place out for a long time.  We had to wait a while for a table; at least an hour.  We had a group of 3 so I understand seating 3 is harder than 2 but there were tables of 6 that sat empty the entire time we were waiting which just seemed illogical to have a group of 3 people ready to eat/pay wait over an hour just our of sheer hope that 6 people will walk in.  We could have eaten, paid and been gone in the time we waited staring at an empty table that never was filled.

They also might want to consider a polite time limit on meals if they want to acquire new customers and increase revenue.  We saw a group sit and sip drinks only during the entire hour wait after they clearly had been done eating for a while.  

The food was good, nice solid portions and all dishes seemed to have a unique spin on them.  I&apos;d come back but probably not for brunch; would recommend coming in slightly off hours so you don&apos;t have to wait too long."
5,"Snuck in here for the Whipped Ricotta and a few cocktails. Service was quick, knowledgeable and friendly. Food was good, per usual and the drinks were tasty! 
Defiantly recommend!!"
5,"We ordered both our Christmas and New Year&apos;s meal (a la carte) from Gather. Service and communication were extremely attentive and thoughtful. The food was delicious and well prepared for takeout. Portion size was generous, and flavors were well balanced. We were happy and satisfied, and will be back soon!"
4,"Let me start by saying that the food was exquisite. We share 3 dishes:
1. Crispy Brussel Sprouts - toasted pistachio, parmagiano, miso vinaigrette, bonito flake
2. Cured Salmon - fried egg, cucumber créme fraîche, crispy shallot, grilled sourdough
3. Seared Cod - creole shrimp, escarole + ginger salad, celery root purée, crunchy black-eyed peas, semolina cake
My tastebuds were surprised and joyful at the freshness,  delicate , and yet flavorful morsels on each bite. 
The service was over eagerly attentive. I am from BA and we enjoy the European style - attend to us and we will let you know when we need you. 
I felt rushed. I ordered a whiskey cocktail, which was excellent, served over one piece of clear ice which prevents watering down, and did not have time to enjoy it as the food came immediately after. BTW, I order the same cocktail after our meal to have time to savior it.  The place gets loud quickly, we had a good table next to the window which gave us some insulation. My husband was somewhat disappointed at the atmosphere, I thought it was fun,  and that he has a hard time understanding the server who describes our dishes."
