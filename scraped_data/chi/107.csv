5,"I love this place so much. Everyone knows about the beautiful and delicious military latte but you haven&apos;t lived until you&apos;ve had the black camo latte (hojicha tea, a green tea roasted over charcoal, as the base + espresso). It&apos;s nutty and smoky but not at all in an overbearing way. They enforce social distancing with stickers on the ground when waiting in line and they are not allowing inside seating at the moment. I&apos;ve just always loved the vibe here and the service is always friendly and professional. 

Don&apos;t skip out on those doughnuts from Doughnut Vault!"
5,"I love coming to Sawada for their lattes, and it can also be a great place to sit and get work done when covid restrictions aren&apos;t in place. In addition to standard (and delicious) espresso drinks, they have great matcha lattes. The military latte (matcha with espresso) and black camo latte (hojicha aka roasted matcha) are probably the stars, and bring something different to the standard coffees in west loop. I often end up getting a doughnut too, since it&apos;s an easier way to get doughnut vault donuts without waiting in line, and they&apos;re just so cakey and glazed and delicious. They&apos;re still open despite the quarantine, so it&apos;s definitely worth stopping by for some great coffee"
5,My favorite coffee place in Chicago! Love their cold brew Tokyo style and I&apos;m so happy they started doing carryout during covid.
5,"My favorite coffee in the city. 

If you haven&apos;t  tried the Military latte, PLEASE DO. 
They have many different types of coffee and everything is really spectacular. The coffee flavors really comes to life when served hot vs. cold. 

It can be 100 degrees out and I&apos;ll still enjoy my military latte hot. Give it a try!!"
5,"Found this place while searching through Yelp (and later recommended by friends) and was suckered by the instagrammable latte art that everyone posted.

When we arrived, everyone was nicely socially distanced, and the inside was pretty barren, which in my mind, just means sanitary! What does exist of the decor is some pretty hipster skateboarding pieces, which I liked.

Upon seeing the menu, I had no idea what anything was. Since this place seemed so cool, I didn&apos;t want to seem like a n00b. Although embarrassed, I mustered up the courage to ask what everything was. Ryan happily explained the ENTIRE menu to us. 

I ended up choosing the signature drink - military latte and was not disappointed. I hadn&apos;t thought to mix matcha with latte before but glad I did! I recommend everyone check this place out if they&apos;re in the area."
5,Some of the most unique drinks in the city! Definitely worth checking out if you are able to. The military latte and black camo latte are both classics. I recommend the military latte for the matcha lovers and the black camo latte for the coffee lovers (also has a faint chocolate taste plus match for a really unique blend). Recently tried the high five mocha which was very tasty and just sweet enough. I really liked it but just enjoy the flavors of the military latte and black camo latte moreso. Also LOVE their chai latte- very spicy and flavorful and an awesome option if you&apos;re looking for a tea.
4,"Chicago has many great coffeeshops and Sawada is definitely worth a visit, especially if you like matcha. Their signature matcha drink is perfect to warm up with in the cold Windy City. The ambiance is cool and makes for a nice spot to stop in and take a break while trekking through the city. Doesn&apos;t get a 5/5 from me due to the relatively limited menu, but I absolutely recommend this spot to any coffee or coffeeshop enthusiast"
5,"So happy to be back! I&apos;ve missed you, Almond Milk Military Latte! 

They have a small selection of Doughnut Vault donuts if you need something to go with your latte."
5,"I didn&apos;t understand why Sawada Coffee was such a must visit when in Chicago but I understood shortly after we got up to the register to order. It wasn&apos;t until after I drank my military latte that I researched Sawada, who was actually the first Asian world champion latte artist in 2008.  

You can also get your military latte with CBD! We decided to skip out on it this time. The mixture of green tea and espresso is surprisingly complementary. Add in that vanilla syrup and cocoa powder and it&apos;s a delightful combination. And the COLORS! Super insta! I couldn&apos;t even count the number of DSLRs I saw pulled out for taking latte art photos. 

Sawada is definitely a must for your coffee and instagram needs."
4,"Great coffee and atmosphere.
  They sell Donut Vault donuts but only cake type, not yeast type."
5,"Whenever i go or take friends, sawada never disappoints. I&apos;ve had their iced military latte and iced chai tea latte. Both are solid, but if you&apos;re going for something diff would def go with the military latte. I usually ask for oat milk to make the military latte lighter"
5,"Sawada is such an underrated coffee shop. They always have quality foods and drinks. They have donuts from doughnut vault which are amazing donuts. The matcha and coffee drinks are strong, taste great, and not watered down at all. You really can&apos;t go wrong with any drink. I like their camo and military lattes, with my preference being the black camo latte because it contains houjicha which makes the drink smoother in my opinion. But really, you can&apos;t go wrong. Sawada is amazing and you must go try it."
5,"Such a great place but such a small building. It has a great rustic and industrial vibe and every drink here is great, so it&apos;s easy to see why it&apos;s so popular. The drinks are so pretty you don&apos;t even want to touch them. Every time I&apos;ve gone the line is out the door and there&apos;s never any seating."
4,"Why is this place always so packed! I love it though, their coffee is delicious. A small coffee shop that shares it&apos;s space with Green Street Meats thank goodness for that, otherwise there would be no seating for the coffee drinkers. It&apos;s hip and the spot to be apparently. 

Their decor is pretty, there&apos;s a ping pong table and a pinball machine but it&apos;s always crowded so you can&apos;t do much with them. 

Thank you Hiroshi Sawada for bringing Sawada to Chicago."
5,"Lurve lurve lurve the coffee and the venue.

I tried the High Five mocha - which includes a hint of Japanese pepper - and it was indeed a delicious mocha that had a welcome &quot;kick&quot; to it. As for the space, it&apos;s a beautiful, gigantic, high-ceilinged, pub-like venue that has lots of communal benches that are shared with Green Street Smoked Meats.

So whether you&apos;re a laptop loiterer, conversationalist, or simply want some good food (or booze, even?) with some quality coffee, this is a fantastic choice. Thanks Yelpers for an excellent find!"
4,"I ordered the military matcha with oat milk.
For those who really like the Starbucks matcha drinks because you can&apos;t taste the bitterness, this drink is probably not for you. But if you do enjoy the earthy taste, then I highly recommend this drink! I was slightly taken aback by the taste, bc many American cafes (that I&apos;ve been to) try to mask the bitterness of matcha, usually by putting less power or more simply syrup. What I really enjoyed about this drink was, 1 it wasn&apos;t overly sweet and in a way, allowed me to focus on the taste. This drink also has a shot of espresso which is plus. Matcha alone doesn&apos;t give me enough caffeine to function. The espresso shot taste light compared to the matcha."
5,"Came here on a Saturday morning with my boyfriend to grab some coffee to start our day. There was already a line out the door but it wasn&apos;t too long before it was our turn so they try to get it moving pretty fast. We got the top two favorites which were the military latte and black camo latte + matcha and chocolate donuts. The lattes were so good; perfectly sweetened to my liking. The donuts were a bit more on the sweeter end, but my boyfriend loved them so didn&apos;t mind finishing mine and his."
3,"Came here during a visit to Chicago and had the black camo latte (hojicha tea, a green tea roasted over charcoal, as the base + espresso) with macadamia nut milk. It was overwhelmingly strong, as the roasted tea was concentrated and felt even more concentrated due to the roasted nature. That plus the espresso made it even higher in caffeine, which is good if you are a fan of it! However, it made me shaky and the taste overall was too potent for me. I also thought it was on the pricy side, especially for the size of the drink."
3,"Just an average coffee place - see my review below:

Coffee: I got a medium cappuccino, and it wasn&apos;t bad! Admittedly it wasn&apos;t anything to write home about, but it definitely was not bad. It was easy enough to drink, and at times even quite enjoyable on the rainy day I went here :) 

Setting: I can only describe my feelings towards the setting as &quot;confused.&quot; I&apos;m pretty sure this place shares some space with another restaurant, so unlike a lot of quiet and quaint coffee shops in Chicago, this one felt more like a sports bar. Loud, dark, kinda cramped seating, and not somewhere I&apos;d see myself sitting to try to do work. 

Service: Great - my barista was very kind. I didn&apos;t have any questions I needed answered or anything, but she was friendly, welcoming, and didn&apos;t push me to order too quickly. 

Price: Paid $4.85 for a medium cappuccino... That&apos;s not ~crazy~ for Chicago, but it certainly isn&apos;t a drink I&apos;d make a daily habit. Personally I think that&apos;s overpriced, but I&apos;ll let you try it to form your own opinions. 

I personally don&apos;t think I&apos;d go out of my way to go here, but it&apos;s not a bad option if you are close by."
5,"One of the best cups of coffee in Chicago. 

Hiroshi Sawada is a serious caffeine king and his namesake coffee shop is roasting more than the competition. Third wave beans, creative latte art, there&apos;s an urban rusticity inside Sawada that perfectly houses the spirit of Hiroshi. Mr Sawada was the Free Pour Latte Art World Champion in 2008 so expect to see some steamed milk with style. Whether you&apos;re looking for a double shot or a long drip, you&apos;ll find deliciousness in every sip. Oh, and doughnuts."
