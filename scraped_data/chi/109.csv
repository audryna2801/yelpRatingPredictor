5,"I absolutely love this place. I&apos;ve been here on numerous occasions and the staff is always a delight. The service is quick (I&apos;ve ordered calling ahead and as a walk-in) and I&apos;ve never waited too long. I&apos;ve had the following from their menu:

Burrito - Crunch&amp;Fire
Burrito - Soft Shell Crab
Bulgogi Fries - Bulgoki

I highly recommend the crunch and fire anything, it&apos;s DELICIOUSNESS!"

*In my yelpions: I might be a little obsessed with this place. But hear me out, if you are into sushi, love the freshness of sashimi, and looking for a place with fresh ingredients and healthy eat, you will love this place too. En Hankkore 2.0 may not have the largest menu, but, good thing are always coming in simple. My favorite are their savory bowl, which is raw salmon and tuna marinated with yuzu soy sauce, with the side of guacamole and 6 other vegetables, with your choice of either white rice or purple rice(always choose purple rice, way healthier and better texture), and finished off with spicy Mayo and onion maple sauce. With each bowl, the flavor, the quality of the food and the quantity, it was just perfect  

Fries are always great, pretty much the least healthy options in here . However, as for the texture, is nice and round, sort of reminds me of Arby&apos;s fries. But more flavorful as the marinate Korean beef were place right on top of the crunchy fries."
5,Update: Came back for take-out. The order was prepared quickly and accurately. Enjoyed my salmon wafu bowl across the street at Wicker Park for a picnic. Also had a side of kimchi. The serving size is a bit small for $2 but is very fermented and packs a punch
5,"Been coming here since it opened!!! BEST poke bowl around. HUGE portion for the price (compared to a sushi restaurant) and it&apos;s so fresh and complex. A+
Sushi burrito is my go-to. Think about a giant sushi roll, you can hold and eat like a burrito. Fun! (And again, the size and price is a way better deal than a sushi joint). A+
Ok...Sushi Taco. Quite possible the best thing you&apos;ll ever eat. The crunchy shell of the taco is comprised of a fried, tempura battered seaweed sheet and topped with fresh fish and spicy, creamy sauces. You&apos;ll need at least 2 of them. A++
Nice, friendly staff. Quick service. Clean restaurant. Great window &amp; location for people watching. I love when they play K-Pop music, but sometimes it&apos;s just Top 40, over-sexualized chipmunks singing about being worth more than they&apos;re treated."
5,"The sushi burritos and bulgogi fries have been my go to order during the past year! The value is amazing, knowing that regular sushi rolls are usually the same price or more but the burritos are so much larger. Highly recommend both the crunch and fire and friend sushi burritos. Bulgogi fries are great for sharing as a side. It comes with a ton of well-seasoned meat and this tasty sriracha mayo sauce."
5,"I am OBSESSED with this place - I&apos;ve always wanted to try a sushi burrito and this place didn&apos;t disappoint! Highly recommend and I know I&apos;ll order from them again. 

I ordered the Crunch &amp; Fire burrito (spicy tuna + tempura shrimp + rice + veggies) as well as the Bulgogi Fries. I really enjoyed both, and would recommend both! The fries were crisp and seasoned to perfection, although it was the beef and the sauces on top that really sealed the deal for me. Also, the burrito is a great size and doesn&apos;t fall apart when you unwrap it which I really appreciated. It is a little on the spicy side, so beware if you aren&apos;t into that. 

I ordered delivery, and it was a seamless process! Everything in the order was prefect and prompt. As a note, it seems like right now they are operating on a reduced menu since some of the things I originally saw on their website weren&apos;t available for delivery when I ordered. It didn&apos;t bother me since I still got exactly what I wanted, but just something to keep in mind when ordering delivery. Would highly recommend."
5,"En hakkomo 
It is currently only open for take out or delivery. If you get it on caviar you can select more options. We just ended up calling in and placing an order since we were already in the neighborhood for an afternoon walk. 

Spider-Man tacos 
Delicious! I honestly didn&apos;t think the tocos would be that great but I was wrong. The tacos were churchy but full of flavor and was topped with a large fried crab. There was not an overpowering of rice which I was expecting all the flavors blended in perfectly. 


Crunch fire taco 
This was amazing too. This was topped with a large fried shrimp. The shrimp was thick and not heavily battered which was better in my opinion."
5,This place is phenomenal. I&apos;ve had some sushiritto cravings and am always SO satisfied after my meal here. The fish is so fresh and the ingredients are bursting with flavor. I cannot stress how wonderful it is to have this restaurant in the neighborhood! You pre-pay when you order and can pick up the food in less than 10 minutes. No in-store dining but I prefer it that way anyway!
5,The spicy tuna poke bowl was delicious and was a large portion! The staff was very nice.
5,Eat here all the time. Love their poke bowels. Always delicious and fresh. Never any issues ordering online or picking up.
5,"two salmon wafu tacos and the kimchi or bulgogi fries are always my go-to order!

the shell of the taco is fried seaweed/nori and it is truly the best idea ever. yes, each taco is a whopping $6 but they stuff it with a lot of salmon so i think it&apos;s worth it! 

i&apos;ve had the crunch and fire burrito and it was super soggy. i&apos;m guessing it was due to the delivery but it completely turned me off from future burrito orders so i&apos;ll stick to what i know."
5,"Before the pandemic, my fiance and I used to come here all the time for sushi burritos! It&apos;s in such a great location so we&apos;d be able to go shopping in Wicker Park and then grab a lite bite. If I hadn&apos;t moved, I&apos;d be coming to En Hakkore 2.0 all the time!"
4,"Excellent quick meals. The poke bowls have fresh ingredients.  The burritos have lightly toasted rice on the outside, yum!  Kim chi fries are a fun snack! 

Place your order and prepay.  They&apos;ll bring your food order to the table.   Self seating and self service for cups of water, plastic utensils and sauces of your choice!  Tip is optional. Tables and booth style seating.  

Everything is delicious and fresh."
5,"Amazing tasting, delicious yet very affordable Korean-Mexican fusion cuisine! A must-try!

Food:
Bulgogi Kimchi fries - 5/5 - fabulous combination - definitely superior to any cheese fries or bacon cheese fries
Soft shell crab taco - 5/5 - crunchy, savory deliciousness. Love it!
Unagi lover taco - 5/5 - sweet succulent eel in a crunchy rice taco. Love it!
Shrimp tempura taco - 5/5 - excellent fusion flavor over top of the crunchy shrimp tempura
Bibimbap burrito - 5/5 - delicious fusion flavor
Soft shell crab burrito -5/5 - excellent crunchy savory and spicy 
Unagi lover burrito - 3.75/5 - even though I love unagi/eel, the presence of three soft items (eel, egg &amp; avocado) did not synch or vibe well, instead throwing off the balance of textures


Ambience:
Modern contemporary vibe, fast casual dine-in

Service:
Fast, but not warm customer service. Cashier at the ordering podium needs to learn how to smile more. She has resting bitch face but can be nice when the customer makes an effort???"
5,"My partner and I have already placed two delivery orders during the shelter-in-place orders. We&apos;ve been ordering takeout about once a week,  so you know if we&apos;re repeating an order it&apos;s gotta be good!

We love the fire and fire crunch burritos. Great ingredients and the burritos are really well constructed. Not as messy as you&apos;d think. Fair warning, though, that the fire burrito gets really spicy when you&apos;re hitting the end of it. At first you think &quot;oh, spicy, so tasty!&quot; and then your lips are on fire while finishing your last bites. We&apos;ve also had the bulgogi burrito -- we liked it but much preferred the sushi burritos. Go for the bulgogi fries instead! Super tasty though they don&apos;t transport amazingly well (what fried do?).

At the price point, $10 or $11 for a burrito, you&apos;re basically getting 2-3  sushi rolls. It&apos;s a great deal. Highly recommend checking En Hakkore 2.0 out! Great takeout option for sure!"
5,We love their shrimp tempura taco and the crunchy rolls!! 100 % recommended to stop there if you are in the Wicker Park area.
5,"This place was amazing!!! All the seafood was so incredibly fresh  and the flavor combinations were creative and well done. I tried the friend burrito, savory taco, and shrimp tempura taco. Everything was great. The taco shells were made from seaweed and tasted better than corn or flour tortillas. The insides were equally as great and the sauces complimented everything so well. The burrito was also wrapped with seaweed and had perfectly balanced and fresh fillings. I would give this place a 10/5 if I could. I cannot recommend this place enough. They may have ruined sushi for me forever. I&apos;ll always want it in taco or burrito form now on!!!"
5,"This was my second time here, and I wanted to bring my husband to try his first sushi burrito while we were visiting Chicago. 

It was just as delicious this time. You order at the front when you get here and they bring you it. I had the Crunch and Fire sushi burrito, and my husband had the Soft Shell Crab sushi burrito. Both were really tasty!! 

The ambiance is nice and the service was quick. Perfect for lunch. I&apos;m definitely a fan!"
5,"This place is probably my favorite &quot;poke&quot; place in Chicago. It&apos;s a unique kind of poke bowl with a Korean twist and I love it! The bowls are creative yet SUPER TASTY! Every time I go here I go for the crunch poke bowl which is shrimp tempura as the main meat or the crunch + fire (spicy salmon). Either way, all the bowls are yummy! 
As for the tacos, the shells were so creative. The outside was seaweed shaped as a taco that was fried? Not sure how they made it but it was crunchy and delicious. I had the soft shell taco and the unagi taco. Both were 10/10. Definitely a go-to if you&apos;re in the city!"
5,"My friend and I decided to meet up in Wicker Park area for some food and decided to go to this Asian fusion place. I have to say I am very happy with En Hakkore 2.0. 

It wasn&apos;t busy when came in on a Monday night; but there was a group of eight people right smack in the middle so feel free to bring big groups here! We ordered upfront and the wait was not too long. 

We ordered the Fire, Shoyu Ahi Tuna, Salmon Wafu, and Savory Tacos. All tasted great. Though a bit pricy for a taco, $6-7 is reasonable, considering the ingredients that come with each. Since the shell is seaweed tempura, it was very easy to cut in half and share. We also ordered bulgogi kimchi fries; these were delightful. 

Overall, I think this is a good place for people who like to share food like me and my friend do. The customer service wasn&apos;t bad but they did forget to tell us we have to get our own drinks from the refrigerator in the back. Not a big deal. I don&apos;t think this place has dessert, but there are a few places nearby if you want to end with something sweet. Also, there is an arcade bar nearby... just saying...

Ambience: Chill
Noise Level: low to medium
Parking: Street
Seating: small to large groups ok"
