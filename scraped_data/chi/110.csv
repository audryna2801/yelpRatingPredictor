5,"We really liked this place. We ordered two bahn mi which were very big. The lemongrass tofu is the kind of tofu that tastes meaty. I would have thought it was neat. They didn&apos;t come with mayo, which is our preference. We also ordered the pho which was flavorful. Finally, we ordered the shrimp spring rolls which are very big. 

The restaurant also has cools with lots of desserts and other takeout items ."
5,"Amazing crusty bread with fresh ingredients! Can&apos;t go wrong when you pick up a bahn mi here. I personally liked the bbq pork sandwich, thought it had the best flavor."
5,This place is awesome and I&apos;m really missing it since it&apos;s been closed due to COVID. The lemongrass tofu is superb but is also well known and tends to sell out.
5,"Excellent sandwiches.  Located on Lawrence, in what I would consider Logan Square, this spot is unassuming, but packs a punch.

The amount of meat is pretty generous.  I had the BBQ pork last week and it had excellent flavor.  The bread was very fresh and nice and crusty."
4,"We always come here for a fresh bread when we have cravings for Bhan mi sandwiches. We love to make them fresh at home and this place is perfect for bread. 
You can tell by the line that they are busy. 
Here you can find refreshments, we always have something new, something recommended by the owner. Place is small and line is moving very fast so dont be fooled to leave. Stay in theat line and whatever you choose here I am shure you will enjoy!"
4,"Bahnmi are big and the chicken lemongrass is a favorite.  Their spring rolls are gigantic and the peanut sauce is really good.  Priciest bahn mi around but they are a little larger.  Price though tends to make me venture a little farther to try different places.

Not the cleanest looking place...must admit I&apos;m a little nervous of what I may see if I peeked around into the food preparation area.  No seating so good to-go place.

Sealed Boba tea, smoothies though priced higher than other places but not to the point where you feel ripped off.

Prices have definitely gone up here but I&apos;ll stop by and splurge.  2 sandwiches 2 smoothies tend to run around 28 to 30."
5,Chicago classic at this point! Can&apos;t go wrong with the #1. Grab a shrimp roll while you&apos;re there too.
5,"We randomly stopped to get a coffee and egg roll. We will definitely be back!!! 

The warm pork egg rolls were $1 75 and packed with flavor...decent sized also! We had 2 Vietnamese coffees around $5.50 each. They were good but it was my first...a bit sweet for me.

The sandwiches and spring rolls looked insanely good!!! 

Clean, friendly and fast service, affordable and large variety. A great stop!!"
4,"Easily one of the best Bahn Mi&apos;s in Chicago. If you wanna gamble on the Sardine Bahn Mi you will not be disappointed, I promise you that."
5,"In a crowded day you&apos;ll find everybody order one thing in common and it&apos;s their mango smoothie. it is so good you&apos;ll be hooked on it. Honestly I know this is Banh Mi shop, but this needs to be said, they have the best smoothie in Chicago.

In terms of their sandwiches they are pretty good, nothing wrong. They have a wall full of desserts mostly Ch√®. Just grab a sandwich and a smoothie you will have no regrets.

Also their cooked butchery is really good. Try to get their roasted pork when it is fresh"
5,"The buttery mini baguette is everything, I usually order one or two just to munch on. Their sandwiches are hands down better than Ba Le, the bread will win you over!"
5,"Amazing Thai sandwiches on incredible fresh baked fluffy french bread. Lemongrass pork or chicken is on point. Get their early enough and grab the rolls in the cooler. Prepare to be amazed. 
A neighborhood gem."
3,I originally wrote this review seven years ago I have since changed my mind about this restaurant. The food is still great but I have to knock down my rating because they have almost doubled their prices in seven years (not an exaggeration!) I used to be able to feed my entire family there-I can no longer afford to and I make more money than I did back then.
5,This place is amazing!! Vegetarian options held down! Pho is really good to! Thank you!!!
5,"The pricing is pretty good and the banh mi is even better. Thankfully for me, I can walk here in less than 10 minutes. When weather is tolerable, I will try to come at least once a week."
5,"A few months ago, I was introduced to Nhu Lan at a party. A mutual friend brought in a couple of subs for our small brunch potluck. After trying one, I was compelled to ask my friend, &quot;Where did you get this amazing sandwich from?&quot; He then told me it&apos;s actually a Vietnamese sub called a Banh Mi. It was from there that my love and addiction for Banh Mi had spawned. 

I have since visited Nhu Lan 3 times and the #2 roast pork is amazing. Make sure to order it with the pate. The textures and flavor profile from this particular sandwich are robust and cohesive. The magic starts with their freshly made in house sub rolls which are given a healthy slather of pate. Generous heaps of slow roasted pork meat are then piled with a mix of cilantro, cucumber, pickled radishes, carrots, spices, and sliced jalapeno for good measure. In summary, it&apos;s heaven on a roll. 

My only suggestion is to come early in the day and pre-order sandwiches if you can. I&apos;ve learned items on the menu run out quickly. On my last visit, I arrived later in the afternoon and I found myself having to order second picks because all of my first choices were sold out. Don&apos;t let that happen to you. 

The space is small and limited to seat 8-10 at best. It&apos;s really more of a grab and go establishment. 

Metered parking in the neighborhood is a bit of a challenge (as this section of street is business heavy) so if possible, try to come during off peak times."
5,"The bread here is unreal. Lots of great food options in this area of Lawrence, but this is my favorite, and the price is great!"
4,"When I was a kid a hoagie sandwich consisted of bread, indifferent lettuce, and every single cold cut meat known to mankind. And mayonnaise. I know. Now that I am grown and educated and wise I eat things like a Nhu Lan ginger tofu bahn mi. And vegan fish sauce. I know."
4,"Did you know that Nhu Lan makes the bread for a lot of places that make banh mi sandwiches in the Chicago area? Now you do!

This location is a small spot where you can get your very own banh mi fix or even sit down for a bowl of pho. Space is limited to three tables, so this is more of a to go place. I came here for the banh mi, but I became a fan of their pho. I didn&apos;t even take a picture. I just plain lost myself in that bowl.

They also serve different desserts and fruit drinks too, and they&apos;re made with fresh fruit. I saw them even go out for a banana run because they ran out while I was there!"

Likes
- #4 was better than #5. The bread was fresh and not hard. The sandwich could use a little more meat. 
- tons of premade self-serve vietnamese desserts in the fridge, some had labels
- we saw someone order freezes

Dislikes
- I&apos;ve had better sandwiches and for cheaper. These averaged $6-7 
- Only 2-3 tables so take out is better"
