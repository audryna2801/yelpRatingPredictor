5,"Wow, Just wow. I am in love with this place and everything they have to offer. Their pocket filled donuts are to die for! My boyfriend and I split the biscoff pocket and the lemon custard dilled donuts. Both were a 10/10, but my favorite was the biscoff pocket donut. There is cookie butter in the middle and I am a huge fan of filled donuts. We also got the small white powdered donut which was good but nothing to rave about.. just a basic donut and wasn&apos;t disappointed. The coffee was a great addition to the donuts along with the really cute ambiance that this place has to offer. I plan on coming back soon to try more donuts and leave more reviews!! This is the location that I went to, but I did walk in to other location and they all seemed just as adorable and delicious. I don&apos;t think you can go wrong with any location on Stan&apos;s."
5,"No, I didn&apos;t go to Illinois. Better: I recently heard about a website called Goldbelly where you can pay waaaaaay more than a product is worth add a taste of gold in your belly. Feeling travel deprived courtesy of COVID, I went for it. Yes, the variety pack of 12 donut cookies I ordered were way overpriced (about $4.20 ea.), but it was quite tasty. 

They were more cookie than donut (shaped like a donut but tastes like a chewy cookie), but they were quite good indeed! I&apos;m not sure how often I will splurge like this, but if any of you want to drop some gold into your belly (they had a 4 pack of cheesesteaks that looked good at a meager $25 ea. That also looked delicious), give Goldbelly.com. You might walk away poor, but you won&apos;t walk away disappointed!"
5,"The donuts were AMAZING! Even with the quarantine and all the social distancing stuff...Stan&apos;s was great. I got a Boston Creme, which came with a free glazed cake donut. I also had a Chocolate Lightening. All were awesome. The glazed cake donut was hot, soft, and delicious. The Boston Creme wasn&apos;t super dense, the chocolate frosting on top was thick and gooey, but not too sweet, and the filling was a perfect balance and hearty and sweet. Definitely will check Stan&apos;s out again."
5,"As always, I had a wonderful experience at this Stans. No matter what time of day you come, they always have every flavor fresh and available for purchase. 
Now, with that being said, it definitely makes it a lot harder to pick just one. So, I didn&apos;t, I got half a dozen. 
I selected the Nutella pocket, red velvet, blueberry glazed, chocolate glazed, toffee, and regular glazed. I&apos;d be lying if I said I didn&apos;t try them all!! Each and everyone of them were unique and delicious. 
My top two pick would need to be the toffee and the Nutella pocket. My least favorite was the blueberry- not much taste, just extremely sweet!! 

It&apos;s hard to say I&apos;d like to try them all, when I&apos;ll be reordering 2/6 on my next trip!!"
4,"There are so many things I miss about pre pandemic, including the simple act of standing in line chatting with a friend at a busy donut shop surrounded by people doing the same thing on a beautiful morning. Seeing smiles and politely saying &quot;after you&quot; as there&apos;s someone ready to order before you and you don&apos;t want to hold the line up. The buzz of people gathered and laughter in the air. The smiles of the staff, and having to lean in toward them to place your order to ensure they can hear you. 
The old fashioned donuts here are super yummy and although an LA chain they fit well into Chicago. 
Not as good as Doughnut Vault, tied with Do-Rite"
5,"12/08/20 - 2 days ago I stopped by at this Stan&apos;s Donuts shop and ordered 2 double chocolate old fashioned donuts.  You can imagine my disappointment when I got home and realized I had gotten the wrong donuts.  I called in and asked to speak to Daisy the manager.  She told me I could come in and they would replace the donuts.  I live in Forest Glen which is 7.6 miles away so I wasn&apos;t about to drive back just for that.  

Daisy told me that I could come in whenever I was in the area and they would replace them w/the correct donuts free of charge.  Well Thank You Daisy I was in the area this morning so I stopped in and picked up my donuts.

You might think I&apos;m crazy but this is the best dam donut I ever ate."
5,"delicious doughnuts, some of the fluffiest and perfectly made dough-parts of doighnuts ive ever had. also u get a free *glazed* doughnut when u get the app so definitely do that"
5,"I ordered 12 of their best donut box through Goldbelly. It was $60, so was a bit expensive for me. But the donut was excellent. It came ready to eat. Shipped at 6 in the morning and delivered at 12pm on my door step. Cherry old fashioned was my favorite, followed by Lemon Pistachio old fashioned and red velvet."
5,Pretty good donuts! I had 2 old fashioned and they had a nice crunch to them. Also had a custard filled donut and I&apos;d easily wait it was the best costard I&apos;ve had in a donut. Plenty of choices in there for all to enjoy and the staff is super nice!
5,"Stan&apos;s the man! Such a wide variety of high quality donuts, great customer service and the ability to order online and via app. It&apos;s been a crappy year, but Stan&apos;s definitely helps put a smile on my face. My favorites are the crullers and old fashioned donuts, with the occasional &apos;fancier&apos; (AKA filled) donut thrown in there (e.g., Biscoff filled). 

Have been here 3 times since I moved to Chicago in March and will continue to return--within reason of course, I am watching my girlish figure, after all. ;-)"
2,I was fairly disappointed by this locations selection and donut quality compared to other Stans that I&apos;ve been to. I did come later in the day but there was literally only 2 options of donut flavors left. I just got the vanilla cake donut and was fairly disappointed by it. It was dry and harder than I remember their donuts used to be.
5,"came here for a free donut. if you sign up on their app you get a free glazed one. I love their chocolate sprinkled donuts so i thought i would really like a plain yeast one, but it was just okay. tasted like something you could buy from jewel. still, this is my favorite donut place in the nation and highly recommend their chocolate sprinkle (worth the extra $1). the chocolate is a little bitter and the sprinkles add a nice pop of sweetness. the yeast donut is pillowy and chewy."
4,"Stan is the Man!

My first Donut shop since becoming a Chicago resident has led me to Stan&apos;s Donuts.

Lemon Pistachio Old Fashioned
Biscoff Pocket

I don&apos;t know if I just noticed Pistachio flavored Donuts or if its a Chicago thing, but these were really flavorful. The nuttiness with the very slight zest made this an enjoyable Donut. The dough had a nice density to it. The Biscoff Pocket is what definitely is going to make me come back and try their other &quot;Pockets.&quot; So full of Biscoff flavor but not at all overbearing. The dough is very soft too making it for a pillow like texture.

Another great Donut shop in Chicago! I wonder what makes the bread tastes so good over here compared to California?"
3,"I got a dozen of these cookies donut things as a gift.  We had 6 varieties to try.  Out of the 6 I only really liked 2 of them. My wife felt the same way. Fortunately 1 of the 2 she liked was different from 1 of the 2 I liked.

The cookies looked nice. I don&apos;t know if I would be in a rush to go back."
3,Stopped in here on a Sunday afternoon and was surprised they still had so many donut options. Ordered a vanilla cake donut with sprinkles and a blueberry old fashioned. Both were great and didn&apos;t taste old or like they were made early and had been sitting for the day. Would definitely go back and try more favors.
4,"Great way to start off the morning in chi-town. Very popular donut spot. 

Street parking only. Terrible place to find parking, limited spots and always full.

Busy on a Sunday morning. Inside was crowded. 

Large selection of donuts. A bit on the pricey side.

Pistachio Old Fashioned - $2.79 - My two favorite things combined, pistachios and old fashioned donuts. Great combo, great donut.

Sprinkles - $1.99 - How I like my sprinkle donut, cakey not fluffy."
5,"Sooooo good! Order the pumpkin vegan donut and you will not regret it. Delicious for all foodies, vegan and non vegan alike. 

Should have ordered more."
5,"This is a must visit place if you&apos;re in Wicker Park. Delicious variety of donuts and their old fashioned donuts are out of this world!! We got cherry and blueberry and WOW. The cherry tasted like a moist cherry pop tart and the blueberry donut was moist, fresh and delicious. Super busy spot filled with locales and tourists alike so get there early if you want your pick at the variety."
5,"Uuuuhhhhhhhhh, need I say more? As a full fledged educated donut lover I approve of this shop.  Options galore and the taste is spectacular, strongly recommend, I grabbed several and loved them all equally.  A good size as well, not too big or too small.  They also had a vegan donut option, holllller to all my vegans, you too can enjoy this experience.

I can tell this place probably gets crazy packed at times, but in addition to donuts they did have other options such as a variety of bagels (I cannot speak to the taste of these).  They also had variety of coffee selection to choose from.  Those this place looks like it caters more for the &quot;to-go&quot; customer there is a small area of seating for those who want to enjoy a quick bite of donut in the shop."
5,"This is the closest one I believe to the ORD airport. If you&apos;re on the Blue Line. Correct me if I&apos;m wrong. I stopped by here which I learned from my coworker since he makes sure to stop by and get off Damen to grab a box to go. That way you still have it fresh to the airport.

Make sure you get there when they open or earlier in the day because you&apos;ll end up getting the crappy or not so fun flavors by end of the day: i.e. today - the only ones left are the regular chocolate cake donut with sprinkles, cinnamon sugar donut, Chocolate caramel pillow, maple bacon donut, you get the picture.

My favorite there is the double chocolate old fashioned, red velvet (of course), peanut butter Nutella pocket, and Boston Cream Pie. When I&apos;m not into sweets, I&apos;d opt for the pretzel bagel and have a dollop of peanut butter on the side. They give generous servings of that without any charge. Also, they have this croissant donut called Le Stan&apos;s or something and it has this custard filling that will haunt you for days."
