5,"I&apos;ve eaten at Homeslice a while back, and finally returned for some takeout this weekend! 

Their space is absolutely beautiful. The back patio is incredible with benches, group seating, and the infamous swing. My sister and I came for lunch on a weekday a few years ago and enjoyed drinks and the whole space to ourselves. I&apos;m dying to actually eat there again in the future! 

In terms of takeout, hubby and I loved it! The pizza options are endless, and thus overwhelming. When deciding what to order, we continually found ourselves liking the majority of toppings on a pizza we selected, and then wishing one topping on the list wasn&apos;t there, but we just decided to order as is to get the full experience, and I&apos;m glad we did! They pick toppings perfectly and everything just tastes great together! It carried well all the way home, and it also reheated great the next day. 

The area is crowded since it&apos;s right by DePaul, but parking isn&apos;t too awful, and it&apos;s usually free on the side streets. Definitely a repeat visit for us!"
5,"I am so glad Homeslice has been able to stay open throughout COVID. We have gone multiple times for brunch, drinks, and dinner and it might be our favorite place in Lincoln Park. 

The pizzas I&apos;ve tried have been good, but what I&apos;ve really loved has to be their brunch options! It&apos;s not a huge menu but everything I&apos;ve tried has been delicious (breakfast pizza, wake n bacon breakfast sandwich, and the duh burrito). 

Have had many of their drinks which are very delicious, very strong, and very well priced. Personal favorite is the pamarita. When we go for drinks we always bring a deck of cards and we always have an amazing time. 

They also get bonus points for friendly service, ridiculously instagrammable decor, and the cozy, kitschy patio."
5,"We ordered through DoorDash (ASAP delivery) for an early Saturday night dinner ~5PM. This was my first time having Homeslice. We had heard good things from co-workers and locals and it did not disappoint! 

Delivery was estimated for 6:10-6:20 PM, but the food arrived a little before 6 PM. We don&apos;t live very far from Homeslice, so everything arrived still warm and no reheating was needed even though it was icy cold outside. 

We ordered the Homie Stix and the 14&quot; Bennett&apos;s Beauty. The food is perfect for sharing. 

Homie Stix ($15) - This looks like a hybrid of cheesy bread and a medium sized pizza. This is a mash-up their two most popular items: Mozzarella Stix and jalapeño Homies. The bread stix are topped with cream cheese, mozzarella, provolone, cheddar, bacon, jalapeños, diced romas, and parsley. The menu says it&apos;s served with a side of BBQ ranch, but you could have told me it was their house Thousand Island and I would have believed you. The sauce is hard to describe, but it provides a cooling relief when you pair it with the spiciness from the jalapeños. All of the toppings tasted fresh and portion size of the stix and sauce was good for the price. 

14&quot; Bennett&apos;s Beauty ($26) - The pizza names are very unintuitive for me, so I spent a lot of time reading all of the descriptions and toppings. This pizza comes with pepperoni, Italian sausage, mushrooms, mozzarella, provolone &amp; marinara! We went with the House Crust which came super thin, it was great! The toppings are well distributed and there were no giant pockets of naked crust. 

All in all, would recommend this place for takeaway/ delivery for some easy delicious food to share!"
4,"Update:

The owner reached out, and made the moment right. As a customer, it means a lot when someone at the location reaches out and apologizes on the restaurants behalf. My boyfriend and I will be giving this place another shot with friends and hopefully have a much better experience and enjoying some amazing food again."
5,"This place is dope. The layout is super cool and just a really fun vibe. They did a nice job of spacing the tables out so you are actually pretty far away from everyone. Points to homeslice for being super clean and spaced out. Food was out of this world. HIGHLY recommend the goat cheese dip. Pizza was cooked perfectly. I like a bit of a thicker, gooier crust which they had. Drinks are fun and not too expensive. Waitress was incredibly friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive. Great spot to grab food or hang out in a group. Highly recommend!"
4,"My fiancée have been in a pizza mood recently, and after just having Happy Camper pizza, we wanted to try delivery from another place so we decided on Homeslice. Little did we know they&apos;re sister restaurants and the food/menus are almost identical! Joke was on us 

I ended up unintentionally ordering the exact same pizza from Homeslice as I did Happy Camper (Clay Bacon at Homeslice and Rich at Happy Camper) and my fiancée ended up ordering the mozzarella breadsticks (so at least we got to try one new thing!)

Personally I felt like the pizza was better at Happy Camper due to the smaller chicken pieces and crispier bacon pieces which is why Happy Camper got a higher rating from me. I didn&apos;t try the mozzarella breadsticks, but my fiancée assured me they were very tasty. They come with a lot of marinara sauce on the side. 

When all is said and done, Homeslice is still a great pizza place and worth trying, but their menu is slightly more limited than Happy Camper&apos;s."
4,"I&apos;ve been to Homeslice a few times while living in Chicago. I would say it&apos;s probably the most millennial place of all time- neon signs, cute decor, string lights, and big table seating areas for groups of friends. I&apos;d totally recommend this spot 100% for the ambience and the drinks, even the prices, but for the pizza, I dock it a star. The pizzas sound better than they taste IMO, but take this opinion w/ a grain of salt because I&apos;m not the biggest pizza fan ;) The only weird thing is that both times I ate pizza at the Homeslice chain, I felt nauseous afterwards, not sure why! Just wanted to name that in case. Otherwise, go for the drinks and the super fun atmosphere!"
5,"If we could get a Spotify Year Wrapped of delivery orders from 2020, Homeslice would absolutely be my #1. There is a pizza on this menu for every craving. You want meat? Get the Knife and Forkner. You were thinking wings or maybe tacos for dinner? Hot for Horn and Mr. Sanchez have got your back. Maybe you pigged out all week and really just wanted veggies tonight. Hughes Delight is basically a salad (and also my favorite pizza on the menu). As a non-red meat eater, I truly appreciate the extensive list of vegetarian and chicken pizzas here, and they really are all delicious!! We have not had any issues with wrong orders or late delivery so far, so we keep coming back!! 

If you&apos;re a dine-in kinda person, the patio here is super fun and has great vibes. I love that they expanded a lot for COVID. The drinks are great as well and servers are always on point. This is the place to go for good pizza and good times!"
4,"Good pizza, but very proud of it too. A carafe of house wine (2 glasses) and a medium pizza is $55 with 20% tip.  Too much competition or a $26 medium thin crust pizza that is 6 slices. Love the decor and atmosphere so if money is not a problem for you check it out."
4,"I&apos;ve had this carry out more times than I care to admit and it has been delicious each time. One 14&quot; is plenty for two people but if you&apos;re wanting to try multiple types I&apos;d recommend two of the smaller pizzas and then you&apos;ll have some leftovers. 
Personal favorites: Special K (one of their most popular), Bennet&apos;s Beauty (traditional-ish pep + some extras), or Miller White if you&apos;re liking for a white sauce or veggie option. 
Pros: delicious pizza, well packaged so the pizza isn&apos;t destroyed when you get it, quick delivery, awesome variety of flavors
Cons: nothing to see here!
If you&apos;re debating between this and happy camper, I&apos;d definitely choose this for carry our"
2,Great location and name but I don&apos;t love the pizza. Maybe too much garlic? They did  put a lot pepperoni on it. I didn&apos;t like how they had an automatic 20% tip when you get ready to pay. They had us waiting awhile to get our pick up even though it was ready. They mixed up our name. It was almost 50 bucks for a personal pizza and 14 inch. I won&apos;t eat pizza here again.
5,"My fiance and I came here on the 4th of July. I have been wanting to try this place for years, and finally said, Let&apos;s go! Due to the pandemic, we were seated outside so I didn&apos;t get the chance to see the inside of the venue, but from what I saw it looks pretty dope. 
We order the goat cheese and marinara with toast and the jalapeno homies for appetizers. Both were incredibly good. My fiance and I both got small pizzas, which was 4 slices per pizza. My fiance got the BMZ and I got a customized Big Teve. Both pizzas were absolutely delicious!!! They were very generous with the feta and put huge chunks of garlic on my pizza, which is a huge plus!
Overall, our experience here was very positive. We will definitely be ordering from here again."
4,"Have pizza (and wings) and drinks on a fake grass &quot;backyard&quot; sitting in lawn chairs as the L train passes overhead - nothing trendier and Chicago than that!

pizza was excellent, drinks were strong, atmosphere was SO hip...deserved 5 stars but had to take a star away because the wife was very uncomfortable in just lawn chairs with no cushion. And their servers were not as super friendly as other places. Still a great spot!!!"
5,"This spot is made to look like a giant log cabin and has all the feels for a good night out with friends. The pizza options are crazy and literally unlimited. I went with The Lucille which is chicken, pesto, sundried tomatoes, and olives. Everything is made fresh and the smells of fresh baking pizza and ingredients is almost something you&apos;d pay for itself! You also have the option to build your own pizza and can choose from the endless options they put on their other creations. There is also ample opportunity for great photos.... but if you love pizza- why are you reading this and not here?!?!?"
4,"This pizza bar is beautiful! I love the lights they have inside and outside in their patio seating areas. It feels like their seating is all indoor and the restaurant is very spacious. 
I came with two friends and we all were not from Chicago, so this was a nice place to meet, hangout, and check out the nice décor. We decided to order anything but pizza. I ordered the Sesame Soy Salad ($12) and added Chicken (+$2) with Romaine Lettuce and no red peppers. It was a huge salad, very filling and tasty. I really liked the Sesame Soy dressing.
My friend ordered the Sheffield Salad ($12) which looked similar to my salad, but had different ingredients.
My other friend ordered the Hawaiian Sliders ($9) that came with 3 small sandwiches. I bet it was tasty with the Hawaiian rolls they used.
Our server Matt was really cool and friendly. He was very helpful on certain items on the menu and recommended certain foods we may like. He came around often to check on us. It did get busier while we were there, so it took a bit longer for us to get our checks. However, the service was overall great. 
The downside is that it is hard to tell who is a server since everyone is wearing casual clothing. The only way we can tell was if they had an apron on or gloves. Also, I had a terrible experience with one of the servers who was in the bathroom with me. She was slim, had black short hair to her shoulders, and very pale looking. So, I was washing my hands and mouth and the girl was standing behind me waiting for me to finish with the sink. I can tell she was keeping her distance which is good since it&apos;s the COVID-19 era. So when I was finished I moved towards the door, with my back to her, away from the sink so she could wash her hands. She then starts to say &quot;You need your mask on&quot; multiple times in a hostile way and I apologized and quickly wiped my mouth dry and put my mask back on. I did not like the way she said that and she could of told me in a better/nicer way, without the attitude. I understand that COVID-19 is very serious in Chicago. But if you&apos;re out in public, especially working in the restaurant/service industry, please be a bit nicer and professional to how we treat others. That incident sort of ruin my experience after that, which was why I gave 4 out of 5 stars. But overall, the service I had with Matt was great."
5,"So excited to be able to find a place with seating for covid and reservable tables. Found parking easily right next to the restaurant. We were seated on the street but when I went in to use the restroom I could see there was an open patio inside. Such a cool place to check out. Wanted to immediately make plans to come back on a weekend. Plus! They welcome dogs!

The pizza was phenomenal!! Totally New York style! We got the plain pepperoni and the carnitas pizza. So delicious. And innovative. And the service was so friendly. I felt so happy here. I totally plan on coming back. Makes me wish I lived in the city again."
4,"Awesome pizza but the outdoor patio was not very warm. But also, what do you expect in Chicago winter"
5,"Wow this was my favorite place ever. First, the place was all decked out with cool decor and signs. Super instagrammable and fun. Second, the food was so so so delicious. Started out with the burrata as an appetizer and it was really good. Ordered some drinks that were on the cheaper side and also got two pizzas. It was extremely filling we ended up taking some home with us. Third, our waitress was so sweet. Overall my experience here was amazing i loved it and will definitely be back again!"
4,"I really enjoyed my time here and one of the precautions they take is they take your temperature before seating you. They have outdoor dining and it was on a great day, 70s. This was my first time and wasn&apos;t sure what to order and our waitress recommended the canteen-a-Rita ($14) because it was a double marg basically. I&apos;m really glad she recommended because it was really good and I felt like I got a good deal with it. I got a small pizza and it was pretty big! I got the Big Meaty Ziser and I loved how it had a lot of meat and veggies overall. I like it when there&apos;s a lot of toppings on pizza. A small came with four slices and with a drink, it definitely fills you up. If you want some good pizza and a drink, I highly recommend Homeslice as if the place to go! My friend and I really enjoyed our time here and I&apos;m looking forward to coming back again!"
5,"After receiving countless amounts of recommendations from friends, I definitely understand the hype of Homeslice. We came here for lunch on a Friday and it wasn&apos;t as packed as I had anticipated. We were seated outside in the back patio which was just beautifully decorated with a slight retro theme, but got to walk through the inside of the restaurant which also had a great vibe. The venue was great and I recommend coming just to check it out, as long as the red line trains passing by don&apos;t bother you!

I highly recommend getting the burrata to start. The flavors combined with the sweet balsamic glaze and fruit were delicious. The drinks menus were quite extensive with many fun cocktails to try, most being around $10. As for the pizzas we weren&apos;t sure which sizes to order  but we ended up getting two small pizzas for the two of us, which was enough to fill us for lunch and have leftovers to bring home. The special-K and (I forgot the second za but it was delicious) were amazing - you probably couldn&apos;t go wrong with any of the pizzas they offer, and I&apos;m definitely coming back to try more."
