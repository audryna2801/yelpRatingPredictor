5,"Menus have changed! They don&apos;t have a lot of the intricate cocktails or appetizers that might have been a reason for going so definitely check if they brought back some of those classics before booking. Everyone is socially distanced, and you must wear a mask when your server comes to your table. We basically tried 1 of everything except for the mushroom soup and a few other drinks but everything was amazing! Felt safe, well taken care of, and had our drinks explained to us. 20% gratuity is automatically included, and your deposit goes toward the bill so it helps &quot;alleviate&quot; the big tab after! Would highly recommend this place as an experience for cocktail lovers who want to support Grant Achatz. Is it WORTH it, probably not, but it&apos;s something I&apos;m happy I did and experienced."
5,This review is for the Office (speakeasy downstairs). Taking reservations now during the pandemic which is convenient. The vibe is very vintage without being too stuffy. Giant menu of a large range of drinks. Great drinks that are definitely pricey but very refined. The servers are very knowledgeable and help cater to the notes you want in the drinks. Truffle popcorn was to die for. Only regret was the time limit on reservations during the pandemic as I could hang out here for a good while.
5,"The cocktails are amazing here and the service is even better. We like to order the cocktails a la carte.


The truffle explosion is the bomb dot com. Lol literally would order multiples of these if they weren&apos;t soo dam expensive."
4,"The Aviary is a simple yet chic cocktail bar with outstanding service and not so simple cocktails. Be sure to make a reservation well in advance and (if you choose the cocktail tasting) have at least 3 hours to carve out of your evening to sit back, relax, and enjoy the progression of innovative alcoholic beverages that ignite all of your senses. 

Make this a pit stop before dinner, a nightcap spot, or an event all on its own. Worth"
5,"This place is great! You need to come here!

I took my girlfriend here for her birthday and got the 7 course meal and drink option. Let&apos;s just say, she kept talking about how good this place was the next few days.

You are not only paying for proper, delicious, and well made drinks/food, but you also get the &quot;show&quot; factor with each drink. One used a slingshot to open the drink, another was some type of siphon, and another got richer in flavor the longer you let it sit/marinate. The food pairings were some of the best I have ever had (typically when you have food pairings at other restaurants, its always some type of meat and wine or cheese and wine or peanuts and bud light haha). The food and drinks went sooooo well together that we were almost in awe of how good it was

I highly recommend this place! And if you really want to make it a nice date, do what we did, and get the 7 course meal/drink (you wont regret it)"
3,"There is SO much hype over the Aviary so I was super excited to snag a reservation and go. It was pretty easy to do so as everything was through Tock. There&apos;s like 5 restaurants all operating on the same corner, so it was a little confusing to check in, but not too bad.

The decor is weird, not my taste - but no biggie. Our table was cool and facing into the kitchen so we got to see how some of the drinks were made. 

Pros: the drinks were super cool, super instagrammable, and very different. We did the 6 course meal, and my favorite tasting ones were the jasmine cocktail in the teacup, and also the slushie one. The most fun one was definitely the ice cube that you got to break.

Cons: service felt really rushed. We had like 3 cocktail rounds on our tiny ass table at once. Our server also wasn&apos;t super friendly and didn&apos;t seem to like engaging in conversations about the drinks or the restaurant itself. For the amount of money I&apos;m paying, and the excitement I have about the place, I expected more of a convo and introductions to the cocktails.

All in all, I would prooooobbbaaabably come back to check out the Office and order drinks a la carte, but there&apos;s so many other awesome places to check out that this definitely wouldn&apos;t be priority. Also, I was wasted by the end of the meal and couldn&apos;t finish any of my drinks - it doesn&apos;t help that I had 2 cocktails before showing up (do not recommend)."
4,"So, I&apos;ve been to The Aviary years before and I was there mostly for the spectacle. I was there for the Gram before the Gram existed and so I let it go and I didn&apos;t even a write a review for it, apparently. 

My most recent visit, not only had me take pictures but I definitely have an appreciation of cocktails. I&apos;m a fan of an Old Fashioned so I was recommended an In the Rocks, just off of what I wanted

What I didn&apos;t realize was that I had this drink before, because I wanted the &apos;slingshot&apos; drink then without care for what was in it. Now that I kind of do, it was made/mixed? I have no idea how they do it, well but it&apos;s definitely show focused, because while the ice sphere made the drink cold, it did eventually just kind of melt down and watered it down quickly."
1,"Really? The host at the corner or Fulton and Morgan is full of it. I already have reservations for tomorrow and paid in full. I went to see the place and wanted to check it out. 
He said there were no openings. Even for the place downstairs called The Office

I was canceling my reservation. But surprise!, I learned that you can&apos;t! It&apos;s like buying a ticket that if you don&apos;t go to the event you can&apos;t get your money back. 

I made it to my reservation with no desire to be here. By the way: no napkins? I feel like i am at a resort in Jamaica with fancy cocktails all sweet with nothing special with presentation. Also the attitude of servers is ridiculous.  

They can keep this place. I am taking a pass with that behavior. In my book experiencing a restaurant is not only the quality of the food/drinks but also the service and the feeling of being welcomed. 

There are a lot of other places in the area with much better attitude. Sorry guys. Good luck!"
4,"Looking for all the bells and whistles with your cocktail?  Then the Aviary is the place for you!
 
We stopped by for a nightcap and were greeted with a welcome drink: tequila with some infused spices.  What a great way to warm up from the cold outside!

So this is how it works: the more to the left the little bird is on the menu, the more elaborate the drink is.  We decided on loaded to the gunwalls and grouch until coffee.  Fabulous presentation, but the drinks weren&apos;t my favorite.  I wish we had more time to try some others, as it was difficult to narrow it down  to begin with!

What I really enjoyed was the complimentary birthday drink.  It was a chocolate chip cookie infused cognac.  Yummy!  

Service was outstanding.  A great experience!"
5,"Aviary has always been at the top of my list for favorite cocktail bars. I always take visiting guests here so that they can get an introduction to how serious Chicago is about cocktailing. There is a pomp and circumstance to the atmosphere. People tend to dress formal or business casual when they come out here. There is adequate lighting, but not so much as to drown out the theatrics of many of the drinks that come to your table -- yes, there may be fireworks involved, but I don&apos;t want to spoil too much for you.

The service here is top notch, in general. The servers are well-educated on the spirits that are used in the drinks, and will always give you a brief explanation of what you are about to enjoy.

Don&apos;t be scared away by the sticker price on the drinks ($22-$30), the price is well worth it -- trust me. I would rather drink a $24 cocktail at the Aviary than 2 x $12 cocktail at another bar in West Loop. You will find that the craftsmanship of the cocktails here is unparalleled, the complexity and synthesis of their recipes are a spectacle, and despite the heavy pours, you cannot taste much of the alcohol at all. In fact, you will feel pretty tanked after several drinks, and wonder how you arrived at such a stunning conclusion to your evening. It is all in good fun. The alcohol is top notch, you will unlikely be hung over the next morning.

Make sure you also try some of the small bites/tapas. The truffle bombs are a must-try, at least your first time there. If you ever want to go all-out, book the chef&apos;s table for a great experience on a special occasion such as a birthday. I highly recommend it, because you get to sit and watch the intricate preparations that go into each drink. It is truly a wonderful show for anyone who enjoys culinary arts.

There are cute little easter egg secrets to this bar, such as the birds flying next to each menu item are an indicator of how whimsical the drink is. I&apos;ll start you there, you can figure out the rest.

Aviary, this review is my love letter to you."
5,"We came here for my husband&apos;s birthday as he has heard so many good things about the Aviary regarding their fancy and creative cocktails. I was a bit worried as I do not drink alcohol any more, but gladly found out they can accommodate people with non-alcoholic diet. 

When we stepped into the restaurant, first thing we noticed was that the ambiance was cozy, romantic, and welcoming. Then we saw the fence separating the kitchen and the main dining area. To be honest, the bird cage design of the kitchen was a bit weird at a first glance, but kinda cool. As we were being directed to our seat, I just realized our table was inside the cage, which gave us a much better view of the entire kitchen - it feels like we were watching some edible experiments while enjoying food and drinks.

As far as the actual food and drinks go, everything we got was sublime! The alcoholic drinks had a strong boozy smell to it: some even smelled like rubbing alcohol. Definitely need to keep hydrated. All my non-alcoholic drinks were super delicious, even the ones with strong ginger taste and cherry flavor. We also got to see some fancy tools that were used to prepare the alcohol. Food was nicely presented and tasted amazing. It also matched with the drink very well. Our favorite might be the &quot;Explosion,&quot; which was ravioli filled with black truffle. It was something we never had, and didn&apos;t expect it to taste that good just by looking at it - guess I should never judge anything by its appearance lol. 

The entire experience has been filled with surprises, entertainment, and deliciousness. Our friends recommended &quot;the Office&quot; as they can make cocktails upon request, so it looks like we will be back very soon."
1,"Would not recommend-- don&apos;t believe the hype. 

We had a reservation for 9:45 and decided to order the Pre Fixe (for $65 dollars, you get three drinks from the menu). Our waitress told us they were unable to accommodate this part of the menu because last call is at 10:30 and restaurant closes at 11. Why allow a 9:45 reservation if you cannot accommodate your own menu? Doesn&apos;t make sense. We were told we should have planned and let the hostess know when setting up our reservation we wanted the Pre Fixe. The menu isn&apos;t listed on the website, so you cannot prepare what you want to order. We also tried calling 4 times the day of our reservation and they don&apos;t answer calls. Waitstaff didn&apos;t seem to care when we explained this. They could not be bothered. 

Also-- a $28 drink was served in this plastic cup. I thought this was supposed to be a high class experience? Next time I want drinks served in this kind of a cup, I&apos;ll swing over to a college bar and pay $3. A total rip off on this one. Picture attached. 

Overall, it was a serious bummer. My friend was using a $150 giftcard for my birthday to take me out here and we were really let down by the overall experience."
4,"I was invited here for a birthday celebration. He had to book two months in advance and pay a $30 deposit per person.

We all got about 2 cocktails and shared the edamame, crispy pork skin and fried green tomatoes. My favorite was the fried green tomatoes and experience wise the pork skin was interesting. The dip it came with was so tasty!

The drink menu rates it by experience, I would say it&apos;s up to interpretation for what is an experience. A few are two drinks (main drink and sidecar) you mix yourself.

We got the Wizard staff (not anything unique or cool and very sugary).

Drinks I would recommend: 
-grouch until coffee: so yummy and warm and a cute experience
-westward expansion: really good like a hot tea and liquor"
5,"We had an amazing experience at The Aviary for their creativity and innovative cocktails.

Thank you for a wonderful experience.  We enjoyed the unique flavors, cocktails, and amazing service."
4,"The Aviary is a fun date night spot or a fancy place to go with a group of friends if you&apos;re wanting to splurge a bit.

Reservations are necessary! I made mine a month in advance after hearing about its popularity. 

We decided to go with the three drink prix fixe menu. This is where you choose from a group of drinks per level. You start with a smooth drink then work your way up. 

Honestly, we LOVED our first round of drinks. Second was pretty tasty too. It was a little bit more difficult for me because it seemed like there was a TON to drink (the flask for one person). The last drink which our server said was the smoothest/easiest, was the most difficult one to try to enjoy. My friend CANNOT handle the taste of alcohol, so she ended up giving hers to the table next to us. The guy at the table next to us ordered the same drink and was STRUGGLING trying to finish it too! It was a whiskey drink where you add drops of Smokey flavor to it to enhance the taste. I took a couple sips, but it was difficult for me too since I never order whiskey to sip on. I ordered the truffle popcorn so that it could help us try to chase our last drink and because after all the other drinks, we were wanting something salty to munch on. We loved the popcorn! 

Next time I come here, I would suggest just going in and ordering drinks. The three drink prix fixe was a little too much for us, especially since we didn&apos;t really DRINK the third round. Or hopefully they add a couple drinks to the third prix fixe level for those who do not enjoy the taste of straight up alcohol."
5,"THIS PLACE IS WORTH THE HYPE AND SO MUCH MORE!!!! The cocktails are delicious, and the presentation of them are so unique. It is like going to a bar + show at the same time haha

3 course &quot;omakase&quot; style cocktail is $65. (a bit pricy~) but they really put in all the effort into each cocktail. this is like no other bar i have been to. every drink has been so thoughtfully made. 

a few favorite drinks
+ Branding Iron (off menu drink where they give you an actual coaster to keep that has been freshly branded)
+ Circle Drink (HUGE!) flavor changes and pours at least 3-4 drinks. So much #value
+ Westward Expansion delicious &quot;hot totty&quot; drink with super cool presentation 
+ In the Rocks (whiskey / tequila built into a circle of ice), use sling show to &quot;crack open the drink

a few favorite snacks
so normally bar snacks are meh right? but aviary does it right!!!!
+ truffle popcorn (what is not to love about this?!!?!)
+ Chicharrón (so good, probably one of the best i&apos;ve ever had!)

I&apos;m definitely going to be coming back, it was such a fun and unique experience and the drinks are to die for!"
5,"You know that cool bar your friends always talk about? The one with the fancy drinks, the cool ambiance, the in crowd? Remember how you wistfully reminisce on the drinks that you sipped on? 

Well the Aviary is one of those bars, but at a upper stratosphere. The drinks are inventive and strong, the ambiance is sexy and smooth, and the crowd is undoubtedly having a wonderful time. 

I reserved a tasting for my best friend and I, since this place tends to get booked up very quickly. 

Once we reached the bar, we were asked to wait outside until the table had been prepared, and once we were let in we were treated to a very cool bar, with aviary-themed decor...note the cage-like wall separating the bar/kitchen from the rest of the room.

As part of the 3-course tasting, we were given several small appetizers, and could choose three drinks from the menu. Please note that the further away the little bird graphic is from a drink, the more outlandish the &quot;show&quot; or presentation of the actual drink.

My three choices included an inventive margarita, an infusion drink (using a porthole infuser), and a smoke-dropper whiskey drink. I honestly don&apos;t want to describe the drinks too much, since I feel like the best fun comes from the experience itself. On the other hand I can totally describe the food pairing. We were served incredible hush puppies (tasted like spicy crabcakes without the crab), salad with duck, vegetable chips (similar to chinese style prawn crackers), and some of the most incredible popcorn I&apos;ve ever had. The overall snacks were ideal for the drinks, especially since they were so darn strong. 

If you think three drinks is nothing (and also a small shot &quot;amuse bouche&quot;), you haven&apos;t had these...crazy strong for cocktails, and I&apos;m not sure how those who do the five course tasting don&apos;t just awkwardly stumble out. 

I did buy the cocktail recipe book, which is GORGEOUS. Would I ever use it? Probably not, but it looks great on my bar. 

A lovely experience, and one that I would expect from a member of the Alinea group."
5,"Craft cocktails to die for. If you&apos;ve chosen this as your destination for the night -- you know what you&apos;re in for. Intricate craft cocktails that stimulate your senses and imagination. 

My friend and I stopped here on a whim, which of course we had to stand by in the waiting area outside for over an hour at the chance a table for two might be available. It was well worth the wait. Once inside we tried every cocktail and appetizer we could until we were satisfied.

We were seated at a table right next to the cage separating the kitchen from the rest of the restaurant. It was entertaining to watch the cocktails be prepared and the effort and attention to detail that goes into each drink. Honestly watching the cocktails be prepared was almost as enjoyable as drinking the cocktails themselves.

Great place to stop on a special night out -- reservations highly recommended, but if you don&apos;t mind waiting and risking the chance you may not be sat at all, there is room out on the patio. 10/10 would try this place again!"
5,"The Aviary was INSTANTLY a favorite for me. I love the seating and atmosphere -- perfect for a date or any occasion that calls for relaxed, intimate conversation. 

They have a 3-course cocktail tasting (!!!) and their food is excellent (I tried the duck porridge). So many claps.... Definitely come here."
4,"The drinks at The Aviary are PHENOMENAL and unlike any other bar-lounge I&apos;ve been to. They are inventive, creative and absolutely delicious. The flavors dance in harmony. I am such a fan of their drinks. I can&apos;t remember the names well, but we had the Loaded to the Gunwalls (I think that&apos;s the name) (they smoke the cup on the spot, though they didn&apos;t do a superb job this time because the drink wasn&apos;t very smoky at all), L.A.M.B (delicious, and the idea is that the mezcal steeps in the various flavoring as time goes on so you sip a little, steep, sip more, steep, etc. - my fave drink so far) and a tropical-y drink that I can&apos;t remember the name off oops. The drinks were great!!

Now, the food... the food is insanely delicious, but the portions are tiny compared to the price. One octopus ball is $9, albeit delicious. The steak was $35ish but was 4oz and the size of my thumb. It wasn&apos;t &quot;steak&quot; in the usual sense that you&apos;d think... like a big piece of meat. Def not lol. The crispy pork skin is superb and my fave appetizer. It&apos;s so so well seasoned. 

Lastly, the ambiance... it&apos;s on the first floor and just like a standard lounge with different spots to sit. Def not like the NYC location where you&apos;re at the top of the Mandarin Oriental hotel. No views. Also, def get a reservation in advance because spots are uber tight and not flexible. You&apos;re slotted for a limited time and basically are kicked out if you&apos;re past your time haha. So it&apos;s def for the drinks imo and not a spot to just relax and lounge at."
