*In my yelpions: The Crepe shop is definitely on my Definitely Return Coffee Shop list for many reasons. First,their menu are never too big. With 5 savory crepes, 6 sweet crepes and 5 coffee options, which makes your decision a lot easier . Two, whether you are going for a cup of joe, and by all mean, not just any ordinary joe. Since I am a huge fans of florals, so that makes the Cardamom Rose latte my favorite in the menu. I love how the flower flavor balance so well with the espresso: rich texture with hints of rose tone after each sip. Ahhhhh ~

Just like the name &quot;The crepe shop&quot;, it would be very rude of me not to talk about their crepes. Per my ordered , I got the Matcha Made In Heaven with pistachio and strawberry. I really like how strong and rich the match flavor is, however,my thought is sometimes is good to stick with the basic, then go wild after you know what you are getting yourself into. So with my next visit, I would go back and get the basic flavor so I can truly tasted the flavor itself. 

And did I mention how Instagram worthy the coffee shop is ? With the wide spreading dining space and modern wall decorations , and a rocking chair literally right next to the big window, just get your camera ready!"
5,"My friend and I ate here last month. I was excited after seeing the super good reviews. 

Ambiance: Cute shop with plants and a lot of natural light. Tables were far apart and the staff wore masks. Hand sanitizer was available, too. 

Food: I ordered the Honey Truffle crepe and Citrus Flower latte. The crepe was so good. Anything with truffle is tasty and the honey was a nice touch. The latte was good but didn&apos;t notice anything special. My friend had the Biscoff crepe with strawberries and cold brew. She ate something before this brunch and said the crepe was the perfect-sized dessert. 

I would definitely come back here for the truffle crepe again and to try the other items on the menu."
5,"I went here for patio seating as part of the dine in broadway (they close off the street to allow for additional seating for restaurants). 

I forgot HOW GOOD this place was! I couldn&apos;t believe I hadn&apos;t given them 5 stars before! I got the turkey spinach (again... how could I resist) and my fianc√© got the ham and cheese. He also got a mole mocha which was unique as well."
5,"I ordered via DoorDash and the crepes came perfectly packaged.  I ordered the strawberry Nutella crepe and my boyfriend got the berry cheesecake crepe. OMG this was delicious. I could eat a strawberry Nutella crepe all day every day. 

I absolutely will be ordering from here again. These were some of the best crepes I&apos;ve ever had."
5,"Food:
The crepes were amazing!  We got the Nutella crepe with bananas and strawberries and the ham and cheese crepe.  Both were delicious and stuffed throughout!  Usually when I&apos;ve had crepes there are tons of areas that are just dough, but these were fully filled with all of the yummy toppings.  We can&apos;t wait to come back and try out more of the items on their menu!

Coffee:
I got the vanilla bean latte which was delightful.  Not too sweet and sugary but just the right amount of flavor.  

Ambience: 
This is a very cute shop that is very bright and cheerful.  We loved all the plants and natural light coming from the ceiling.  They also had some of the bags of coffee beans on the walls as decor which was a very nice touch.  

We will definitely be coming back here again!"
5,This is one of the most beautifully decorated crepe shop with delicious crepes! The vanilla latte is quite authentically flavored. The vintage typewriter is a unique touch to the interior decor!
5,"Such an atmospheric place! My husband and I went there three times in two weeks and will go again soon. Our all time favorite is Lox Crepe and their original lattes. Last time they brought us one extra sweet crepe for dad&apos;s birthday. Thanks on that, you guys rule!"
5,"Favorite place in lakeview. The crepes are delicious. I always take anyone that comes to visit me to the crepe shop. 
Staff and owners are super friendly. 
They coffee is unreal. If not the best coffee I&apos;ve had in Chicago then a close second."
5,"I had the great opportunity to try this awesome place! The decor looks like a Parisian island with tropical leaves on a few accent walls,  planters that line the opposite wall, wicker basket light covers and chair, tall tropical plants around the room, tiled barista counter, and white marble with gray swirl table tops.  On each table are small salt and pepper shakers, gold/coppery prism, and a small plant. Very cozy and relaxing!

 You place your order at the barista counter, pay, and then you are given a pager. You can then pick your table and relax until the page goes off. Your drink and food are waiting for you at the sea foam color counter. 

Drink: Mocha New Belgium. Made with espresso, Belgium chocolate, bourbon vanilla, and coconut cream. The baristas made a funny joke about people ordering hot coffee on a super hot day. Tasted refreshing and not overly sweet. 

Crepe: Honey Truffle Crepe. Made with Fontina cheese, truffle oil, arugula, candied pecans, and drizzled with honey.  Candied pecans and arugula are also placed on top. All the flavors complimented each other, which gave you a nice sweet, savory, and slightly peppery from the arugula flavors. 

Both the crepe and espresso were excellent. I think this is one of my new favorite spots!"
3,I loooooved the Ham &amp; cheese crepe. Would have been better with the overeasy egg added. My boyfriend had the berry cheesecake crepe &amp; it was way too sweet. I also had the Nutella strawberry crepe and it definitely needs some type of whipped cream as a topping to bring the flavors together.
5,"I am in heaven! I love truffle anything, though I don&apos;t have it often. I saw the word truffle on the menu when I came across this crepe spot on yelp and knew I had to The honey truffle crepe was so fantastic - I told my husband if I&apos;m ever missing look for me at this place first! I was unsure what to expect and was a little surprised to see it was on the savory list of crapes. It was actually a great combo of savory with the cheese but also sweet with the honey and pecans (or was it walnuts? Delicious wherever it was). Some reviews said that they were overwhelmed by the flavor. I did not have that experience but then again my husband and in
also shared the wild berry cheesecake crepe (which also was amazing) at the same time and that might have influenced things (though I really wish I hadn&apos;t had to share the truffle one at all with him ) .

It was a very welcoming atmosphere as well - it was COVID era when we went in and there was decent spacing between the tables and staff wore masks at all times, and customers as well any time they were not sitting down. The staff was super friendly as well. I can&apos;t wait to go back!"
5,"I think they created the Crepe Shop for my blood pressure to drop. The space is filled with greenery and nice lighting. If I lived a little bit closer, it&apos;s be my go to for breakfast every week.
A friend and I met, she got the turkey and I got the honey truffle. She really enjoyed hers and mine was awesome! I love how as I ate more towards the middle, I got more and more flavor. Then at the center, the toppings are heavy and make the last bites of crepe uber savory.

The staff is very kind, there&apos;s a single restroom in the back with funny signs, and all in all it was a great place!"
5,"I cam here for the first time on a chilly Chicago Sunday morning and the place was full, all tables taken.

One of the owner&apos;s (who took our order) asked us to please wait patiently as the tables turned over. We were seated at a clean table within 5 minutes and our food and coffees were promptly delivered thereafter. 

The food and coffee was amazing (see photos). We got the Berry Cheesecake Crepe, Nutella Crepe, Honey Truffle Crepe, cold brew and a latte (I can&apos;t remember what type it was, orange something I think). The Nutella crepe with bananas inside was crispy and delicIous. The Berry Cheesecake crepe was a nice balance of sweetness and tart  cheesecakey flavor and the Honey Truffle Crepe was delcious cheesy goodness with a balance between the truffle and honey flavors. 

I went up to order a second round of coffees and the owner/server was again apologetic for us having to initially wait!!!!

I will be coming back here. These guys are a local run shop who clearly take a lot of pride in their shop, the food and the service that they provide their customers!!!"
5,"Amazing crepes and a nice modern setting! The space is open and airy and I really like the plants everywhere. The crepes are delicious and they were larger than I thought they would be, which is nice. 

We were torn between sweet and savory crepes so we decided to get one of each haha. For the savory option we got the Ham and Cheese crepe and for the sweet option we got the Nutella crepe with strawberries. These crepes were so good and I&apos;m glad we got both options! I&apos;d recommend getting these although I&apos;m sure any of the crepes here would be great. I&apos;d love to come back again and try some other crepes."
5,"COVID REVIEW
Crepe shop is very cute and clean. Staff wears masks and customers are required also. They have outside seating, but I ordered to go. 

Staff is incredibly nice and recommended Wild Berry Cheesecake crepe. It was delicious. The berry jam is made in house and it is probably what makes the dish so worth it. 

Small menu, but they have perfected their limited items."
5,"It&apos;s because of places like The Crepe Shop that make me fall in love with Lakeview. As soon as you sink into their couch - you immediately feel cool. Just by being here (See pics and video review). 

All this before you your teeth cuts into thier crepes. Once you cross that line you&apos;ll put up with the parking tickets causes parking here is a b_ _ ch.  As for the crepes please see my previous reviews. I stand by them. 

I have a video review which you can find on YouTube by searching &quot;Ernie eats the crepe shop&quot; or this link https://youtu.be/hF-ayIMEBYs"
5,"Great find, good selection of sweet &amp; savory crepes. Indoor &amp; outdoor seating available 
Hot &amp; cold selection of flavored coffees &amp; lattes 
Had the Nutella with Strawberry crepe, was delish 
Friendly staff"
4,"So I&apos;ve been here twice so far, the first time ordering the cheese crepe and the next ordering the honey truffle one. The honey truffle one is incredible, I would highly recommend! 

I wouldn&apos;t go so far to say they&apos;re making authentic French cr√™pes but wonderful nonetheless. They have sweet and savory options. It is a small shop with 10-15ppl seating, a lovely crepe spot in Lincoln Park to bring your loved one or a date you&apos;re trying to impress when you can&apos;t make the crepes yourself."
5,"I can see why The Crepe Shop gets such good reviews. Beautiful modern space, friendly customer service and fantastic crepes. Oh, and really good coffee too. 

The Nutella and Honey Truffle crepes were both really good. I&apos;d order them both again. The arugula in the truffle really makes the dish."
5,"I came here right before all the restaurants closed down due to the pandemic. One of my friends was craving crepes and enlisted me to find a good crepe place. I&apos;m so happy that we ended up checking this crepe shop out because it was absolutely delicious! Having had traditional French crepes in France, my standards were pretty high. My boyfriend and I shared the ham/cheese and the butter/sugar and both were amazing. So simple but very tasty and definitely satisfied my sweet and savory cravings. We also got a few lattes that were also very well made. 

Some of our friends got the honey truffle which they said was amazing the first few bites but the taste became overwhelming after a while. If you want to try this, I would definitely recommend sharing it and also getting something a little milder! 

I would like to also mention (for all my fellow instagrammers out there) that this place was so adorable and so picture worthy. Everyone was super nice and friendly and overall just a great place to have a nice easy meal (or dessert)!"
