5,"The best old school Italian in the city.  I take out of town guests here for the Chicago experience.  I ve never had a bad dish here, the pastas are great &amp; the ingredients top notch.  The ambiance is fun &amp; lively &amp; the drinks are good &amp; strong.  Get the tiramisu &amp; a shot of sambuca for dessert, trust me."
5,"I told my friend I was craving Italian food and he suggested I try La Scarola. He told me to it was worth the drive even to go pick it up....and they did not disappoint. I ordered to go (due to Covid) and everything considered they were extremely professional and wore the proper PPE in handling your payments and food. (You could see inside from the window).


I ordered Shrimp Armani appetizer and Rigatoni Mandera entree. Both were fresh, and stayed hot the 25 minute drive home and when I finally sat down to eat...OMG IT WAS DELICIOUS!!!! I would definitely recommend going here for a taste of authentic italian cuisine! When the world settles down I would love to try dining in!"
5,"We took out dinner from here tonight via Dwell Social and the food was the best we&apos;ve had of any cuisine since lockdown started. Pasta Faggiolr and minestrone soup both 10. Lasagna a 10. Spaghetti and meatballs a 10. 

Can&apos;t wait to dine here in person. Soon, I hope."
5,"This place is a Chicago staple.  I absolutely love the vibe, it&apos;s old school Chicago italian food.  There are pictures of the owner with famous people all over the walls.

And the food does not disappoint!  I think they are known for their veal chop.  It&apos;s fried, served over potatoes, and bigger than your head.  It&apos;s really tasty, but honestly, what stole the show for me was the linguine and clams.  I don&apos;t usually order linguine and clams, but my cousin does and recommended it, and I won&apos;t come back here without ordering it.  If you are ok eating loads of garlic goodness, I highly recommend this dish.

I would also recommend the antipasta, you can&apos;t go wrong there, and really any of the other pasta dishes.  They have all been terrific."
4,"My first experience was tonight and I say first because there will be more to follow. We enjoyed our food so much !
the service was just as impeccable as the food !

The flavors , every taste bud was happy. I suffered with lack of taste since COVID in October and I was delighted I could taste every flavor and texture. The grilled shrimp, potatoes, calamari....

Amazing and thank you for a delightful experience!"
5,"Was torn between 4 and 5 stars but ended up with 5 because we liked the staff so much. Came for the first time this weekend and the grilled octopus special , the shrimp vodka sauce pasta were incredible . I got the veal gabe, which I liked but didn&apos;t love . I would try a different veal as it was SO fried and the veal was so thin, I would&apos;ve probably gotten something else had I known. Either way, experience was great and the owner gave us a free round of drinks and dessert for moving tables for him.

Also, huge portions . Can&apos;t wait to go back !"
5,"I have been wanting to try this Italian gem ever since I could remember. When I picture a Chicago Italian original, THIS restaurant is it. It&apos;s warm and cozy, family-owned, and successful for good reason. Celebrities from far and wide have ventured here, evidenced by the numerous pictures on the wall to show the vast history of this place. Once you experience the service and top-notch food, you realize why.

The service will make you feel like you&apos;re dining at home, but with even better food and wine. All of the servers are so friendly and accommodating. The penne alla vodka and broccoli salad are a must. The specials are a must - seriously special for a reason! I&apos;ve tried the octopus, bruschetta, an amazing breaded chicken (forgot the name), and much more - all amazing. My mouth waters just thinking of the food and excellent flavors. 

Even though I left without being able to breathe from all the pasta I consumed, I went back within a week because how could you not crave this home-cooked Italian food during a cold winter? Armando (the owner) even has his own cook book - I would buy it but I&apos;m not even gonna try to replicate the exquisite flavors and sauces and instead will just go to the restaurant! Support this local business- the La Scarola family puts their heart and soul into your meal and will make your experience more than worth it!"
5,"Always a classic. Family style Italian restaurant with that warm hospitality, generous portions, and DELICIOUS food. 

My go to always is:
Penne Ala Vodka
Grilled Calamari
Tiramisu

You wont regret it."
4,"Delicious hole In the wall highly recommend but definitely need reservations in advance as it gets very crowded on the weekends. We ordered calamari, bruschetta and I got the penne Ã  la vodka it was delicious but just really heavy and then I&apos;ll come with a lot of shrimp the wine was very expensive $60 a bottle."
5,"My Italian coworker SWEARS by this place! Says it is hands down the best family Italian place in the city. Obviously I made him take me and I had him order the best things on the menu apps through dessert. We walked in without a reservation for 6 on a busy night. My coworker was shaking hands, touchin shoulders, exchanging friendly shoves with employees and other patrons (still don&apos;t know if they really knew each other). So inviting and they sat us right away.

It felt like we ordered everything on the menu. My salmon was stuuuuupid good. Mouth watering. Those who got the clam linguini were licking their fingers raving about it. Cannoli&apos;s were huge! Wow the servers were soooo nice like family! Smilin smilin smilin

Richards Bar is right next door and we sat at a tables that adjourns the wall with Richards. LOL you could smell the cigarette smoke through the walls. Brought me back to 2005 when I would go to dinner with my grandma in the smokers section. Not their fault."
5,"Really, really good Italian place in the River West area! I came here on 12/2/19 with my father and stepmother for supper. They are in town and craving good Italian. I thought they would love the food, ambiance and Chicago vibe here. 

Okay down to the basics...this place is really good and VERY popular. I wound highly suggest making reservations. We came here on a Tuesday night and there was a 45-60 minute wait. We had reservations and were seated promptly. There is very limited street parking, but valet is available for $10. The valet is fast and efficient. 

Now to the food...man oh man is it good.  I could use a bunch of different adjectives to describe it, but GREAT is probably the word best used. We started with the grilled octopus and grilled calamari! The grilled octopus is one of the best appetizers I have had in a really long time! The calamari was on point as well. 

For main dishes we had the eggplant Parmesan, the  pasta special ( named after guy sitting a few tables away and picture on wall, and the chicken Florentine! Everything was simply great. Add in a very solid wine list and your in business. 

We will definitely be coming back here!"
5,"This place, though well known, feels like a hidden gem of Chicago. We showed up for our 7pm reservation and they were running behind, so were told to go next door to Richard&apos;s, the divey-est of dive bars featuring tin ceilings and a juke box. If you&apos;re a smoker, Richard&apos;s is your spot - smoking is allowed inside, and many patrons jump at the chance to participate (so asthmatics, maybe pick a different pre-dinner drink spot). The drinks were cheap and we enjoyed them as we listened to the hum of the jukebox and conversations of passers by. 

When our table was ready about 30 minutes later, we were led into a dimly-lit room that was filled with as many small tables as the space would allow. It was fantastic. The environment has a unique energy about it - the room was loud, filled with the sound of many different dinner time conversations, but somehow also incredibly intimate. The staff was attentive and knowledgeable, and the food - I&apos;m still dreaming about the Penne alla Vodka I ordered (I modified it a bit to remove the shrimp and added peas!). Being there felt special, like I had been let in on a family secret. I am counting down the days until I can return. Definitely an experience you need to have at least once!"
4,"My uncle who grew up in Chicago recommended this place as it&apos;s his favorite restaurant so my parents and I came for dinner while visiting Chicago.

Most things I&apos;ve read on Yelp for this place before coming here was accurate. Called in a reservation and wasn&apos;t sure if they actually heard my reservation right because it was abrupt. 

We were seated at the nicer part of the restaurant probably because we had a reservation. People without reservations probably get seated in the crowded part of the restaurant.

Shared the calamari with my parents. It was good. Got the vodka penne and it came with shrimp, asparagus, and mushrooms. It was a lot of food. I liked the vodka penne but i liked my dad&apos;s pasta Lorenzo more. That was good. There were many leftovers to take home among my family. I could have shared the plate with another person and still wouldn&apos;t be sure if we&apos;d finish. And i could eat a lot."
1,"Came from out of town and only here for one day to visit this spot. Called 10 mins in advance and was told I didn&apos;t need a reservation. Once I arrived, I all the sudden needed one for a party of two. Waste of my time, waste of the money I spent in the uber. The guy who I spoke to at the door was super condescending and rude. Don&apos;t come here. Call in advance and be super clear about reservations!"
5,"We had an excellent dinner here and were able to obtain reservations on the same day. Their Shrimp Armani was tasty in a very mild spicy sauce with succulent large sweet shrimps. The Sinatra Pasta special was delicious with a good amount of scallops, shallots, shrimp and mussels. I loved their Chicken Vesuvio - the chicken breast was juicy and moist in a garlic cream sauce with green peas/roasted potato slices. Service was excellent and friendly. They also have outdoor tables with heaters."
5,"Best best best best best BESSSSSST place for Italian food! 
I ordered the Pene pasta vodka with meat balls and omggg it was sooo delicious! HIGE serving size btw, 
Not only the food is great, but the customer service was awesome! The waiters came constantly to fill my glass and asked if I needed anything or had questions with the menu. The staff is GREAT!!! Had an awesome evening thanks to great service this restaurant provided. I will definitely keep coming here many many many more times!"
3,"When you first walk in, you smell that sweet garlicky scent...as any authentic Italian place should. For a rainy, cold Wednesday night, this place was PACKED!

A group of us got the escarole and beans. I was not a fan.  Escarole was a little over cooked and was too mushy for my taste. I think I like escarole better raw.

We also got the calamari, which was perfectly batter. It was light, but still mainly that crunch one would expect from a fried calamari. 

I was really excited to try the grilled octopus after seeing a picture from yelp. I love anything with a good char on it. It was nicely charred while still maintaining a tender texture to the bite.

The penne ala vodka with shrimp came out on this huge plate. I honestly did not think the portions were THAT big.  Italians don&apos;t mess around with their portions. The sauce was creamy and rich. It was thick enough to coat the penne. The shrimp was a little over cooked and got tough on a few of them. The addition of asparagus and mushroom gave it that earthy and fresh bite. The dish was a tad salty for me. Everything also felt one note. The al dente penne, the soft mushroom and the soft asparagus. I felt like it need something to kick it up a notch or two. 

I also tried my friends linguine and clams. VERY garlic forward. Again, I felt like it was salty too. I cleansed my palette before I ate anything else, but I don&apos;t think it helped.

I Def wanna go back and try the eggplant Parmesan though."
5,"This place has a wonderfully cozy atmosphere, but this is not to be mistaken with a quiet evening. It was sort of like being at a large family gathering where everyone in the room was laughing through good stories, food, and wine.

The staff here made us feel like family - so polite and welcoming, and constantly checking on us to make sure our evening was going smoothly. Even the owner came around at one point to make sure we were having a good time, and gave our table a free round of drinks.

The food was wonderful, but overall the experience was just the best. We will definitely be back!"
5,"The most amazing, authentic Italian food! The owner and the staff are simply wonderful!"
5,"Best Italian food in the city. We got the octopus and penne a la vodka. Both were amazing. 

Service was spectacular. We ate in the patio and did takeout as well. Will definitely be coming back"
