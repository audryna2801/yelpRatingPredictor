5,"I am in LOVE. Antique Taco, don&apos;t ever change. 

I ordered delivery through DoorDash, full well expecting that the food would not be in its prime. But if this was not its prime, then what does the fresh version taste like?! The chips are not too thin and not too thick but fried and salted flawlessly. The creamed elote was creamy, spicy perfection with both tapatio and tajin. But the best part? The homemade tortillas for the tacos. They were on par with those I&apos;ve had from a true, Mexican home and I&apos;m downright obsessed. 

I&apos;ve had more than my fair share of Mexican food, having married into a Mexican family and lived in Los Angeles. And Antique Taco is Mexican food perfection I thought only existed in my head. There&apos;s not even a hint of &quot;too trendy&quot; or &quot;over hyped here.&quot; It&apos;s an elevated authentic, and I can&apos;t wait to order more on the menu. You can&apos;t go wrong with this spot."
5,"Ordered takeout through DoorDash and loved my meal! I ordered the elote, carnitas taco, and steak taco. All were delicious! Honestly a top notch option if you want to get tacos in Chicago. I&apos;ve also been here in person previously - great patio area to sit down in warmer weather! I&apos;m not sure what their winter modifications are."
5,"I always liked this place. I think they have better tacos than another trendy taco place nearby that often gets more hype. Anyway; because of COVID-19 I&apos;ve been WFH and going to the antique taco takeout window more frequently. Margaritas to go, tacos to go, or you can eat at their new expanded outdoor seating. They even have small Standing tables for 2; for if you just wanna hang for snacks &amp; margaritas. I just polished off the taco Tuesday special. Abuelita&apos;s pop tart is also amazing. It&apos;s a pastry with delicious warm chocolate pouring out of it and it comes with delicious cinnamon ice cream. Love this place."
4,"The tacos were good but overall a bit pricey for me. I&apos;d be happy to eat Antique Taco again though. 

We did delivery during covid. Everything was neatly transported and I&apos;m glad they threw in some salsa as well. 

We started with a tortilla soup which was just ok. I wouldn&apos;t get it again. It was a bit bland and was crying out for some chicken or something more. I was glad to have the cheese and tortilla chips sent separately. 

We also started with some elote which wasn&apos;t quite elote. It was tasty but it was technically like creamed corn with elote seasoning. Definitely not quite what was expected.
I did like the roasted salsa quite a bit though. Oddly it was like a hint of creme was added to this as well. 

Not a wide variety of tacos, the classic options, all done right. The pork was the best, most heavily seasoned. I would definitely go for this again. The chicken was a bit average but spicier than expected which was nice."
4,"I&apos;ve been here twice, but the most recent time I was most impressed. I got the fried chicken burrito, and it was so good! They definitely don&apos;t try and be authentic, but the flavors were all there. I like how they added some greens to contrast everything else that was fried. The burrito was also a better price point than the tacos. I don&apos;t remember which tacos I had gotten the time before. I remember liking them, but I don&apos;t remember exactly what was in them.

They have a window where you can order outside, which is nice for warm summer days and covid precautions. I&apos;ve never seen what the place looks like on the inside because I&apos;m pretty sure it&apos;s been closed since I discovered the place."
4,"I&apos;ve heard great things about Antique Taco, so when the craving for tacos hit, I knew I had just the spot!

A Sunday afternoon delivery order was fast, food was warm, and everything was packaged well. I ordered three tacos (pictured) and my boyfriend got the Fried Chicken Burrito. We had to order the Creamed Elote after hearing rave reviews, too! Glad we ordered it becuase it was my favorite part of the meal. 

With tacos priced between $4.95-5.50, there are definitely cheaper options out there, but the interesting flavor combos at Antique Taco and quality of ingredients seem to warrant the price. However, I was so disappointed in my Grilled Steak Taco. The meat was SO dry and chewy, it hurt my jaw to chew through a bite. There weren&apos;t many other flavors or textures on the steak taco so I dumped my salsa on to salvage the priciest taco in my order. Maybe it was an off day for steak? The Pork Carnitas and Sweet and Spicy Chicken tacos were good, Pork being my favorite.

I&apos;d be willing to give Antique Taco another shot with a few order modifications. That Creamed Elote was just too good to forget!"
4,Pretty good! Not the best tacos in the world or anything but it did the job. I had the garlic shrimp tacos and the filling and sauce was really good. Good proportions. Horchata was also on point!!
4,"The truly intriguing and astounding blend of flavors and fixings in the tacos. Genuinely fast assistance, if there is no long queue. However, the costs are only a decent piece higher than the estimation of the food, regardless of whether it is if a higher caliber."
5,"OMFG, best steak tacos I&apos;ve ever had, and I spent 20 plus years in Southern California. Beats Big Star by a long shot. Huge tacos, that include onions, what I believe was arugula, and a side of hot sauce that is the perfect amount of heat. Two and I was full!"
4,"I had visited antique taco years and years ago on a date and remembered not really liking it. But now I&apos;m wondering if it was just the date?? Cuz I gave this place a second chance the other night (on my own) and it was great! 

First of all, service was awesome. The girl working the counter was spreading good vibes and good recs too - she told me about their special taco of the day and I was sold. It was delicious. I also gobbled down their pork carnitas taco (so flavorful!). 

I had no problem finding a spot at a communal table but this place isn&apos;t that big so I could imagine that maybe being a problem during peak hours. Atmosphere overall is chill/casual/cool. Fits in perfectly with the wicker park neighborhood."
3,"COVID stuff -
I came here in mid-June, early evening and they had limited outdoor seating spots. Usually, you pick up from the little takeout window on the inner street (it&apos;s easy to stand and eat honestly). Also, servers had masks on and were pretty on point with sanitizing the benches. 

Food - 
I had the Garlic shrimp, pork carnitas, some steak, and the sweet &amp; spicy chicken tacos (I shared...obviously!). As far as I remember, pork one was delicious, the chicken one was my least favorite, shrimp and steak were equally good.  I could see they worked to incorporate different elements in the tacos with the sauces, toppings, and such. So, all in all, pretty good.

Service was good too. Overall, pleased!"
4,"The pork carnitas taco here is amazing. The guac and chips (albeit very expensive) are amazing. The shrimp taco is amazing - especially love the fried kale with it. The mushroom taco is bland. The crispy fish taco is disgusting.

I still love this place, though, because the pork carnitas is spectacular and I can never get enough.

Not a lot of seating, but we can usually find a place to sit. Line isn&apos;t ever too long, and food comes out pretty quickly. Love the cute interior, staff is super friendly, and not too expensive!!"
3,"Until prices are reasonable I will not come back.
12 bucks for a burrito, give me a break! Just plain ridiculous . El Faro will get you 2 burritos at that price,"
4,"One of my favorite taco joints! They have margaritas by the pitcher, and have a pretty wide range of food options to choose from. Due to COVID, we had to sit outside with pretty limited number of tables in a small sidewalk. The workers wore masks, but we noticed that the tables weren&apos;t being cleaned after each customer. They did have small bar tops where you could stand and eat if you&apos;re looking to just grab a quick bite. Overall, great food experience but not so much COVID-considerate. Definitely would come back once things settle back down."
4,"Not sure what their takeout would have been before but they&apos;ve perfected it at this point! I ordered DoorDash delivery and it was one of the most solid deliveries I&apos;ve ever received. Everything was very fresh, very hot--very cold in the case of my horchata milkshake, which was packaged in a little container to be either eaten with a spoon or decanted into a glass of my own, which was perfect. The food is great, though not necessarily the flavors you expect when you think tacos. The creamed elote was great, I loved the garlic shrimp tacos--those tortillas!--and the horchata milkshake was incredible. It was small for how much it costs but frankly it was still worth it. Everything&apos;s a little on the pricy side but for a very reliable at-home treat, this is great."
5,I love their tacos here! Their guacamole is also a win! Our family often suggests this place:)
4,"This location can be easy to miss if you&apos;re going down Milwaukee but luckily there&apos;s parking on the side street adjacent to it.  Have come before and really enjoyed their tacos.  A little more than what you&apos;d expect to pay but their fish tacos are definitely worth the premium

Today I had the horchata milkshake I&apos;ve wanted to try for a while and it did not disappoint.  It wasn&apos;t overly sweet and great.  The inside is a great space and good for groups or if you want a cafe alternative."
3,"So there&apos;s this thing, called a pandemic , and it&apos;s like hurting all restaurants and stuff, as I&apos;m quite sure you already know. As a desperate ploy to leave our domicile, we decided to pickup tacos curbside. Sigh, it&apos;s become somewhat clear that most restaurants aren&apos;t necessarily great at curbside foodstuffs. Antique taco joined the ranks of restaurants having a hard time keeping quality up at this point in time. Also, it&apos;s hard to eat outside, say in a park,  if you have longer hair and the wind is blowing. So that&apos;s a little know fact. Yeah, so, sigh, I shall revisit antique taco when restaurants reopen, to give them another shot but &apos;&apos;twas not so good. Let me see if I can find a photo for ye."
5,"This place has new and interesting interpretations of classic tacos. I ordered two for outdoor dining, and thought both; the garlic shrimp and the potato and poblano, were delicious. The shrimp taco was packed with perfectly cooked, tasty morsels, and I really liked the elote style cauliflower accompaniment. The fried kale topper (the best way to eat kale, really) was a nice touch. The potato and poblano also worked for me, and the chipotle cream was the ideal spice level. Two tacos was the perfect amount for me, although my husband said he could have gone for three. I will return often and give the rest of the menu a try."
5,So good! The fried chicken burrito was the best! Tried some of my friends&apos; tacos as well and all of their food is really flavorful
