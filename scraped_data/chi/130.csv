5,"This restaurant is located in a great spot by downtown Chicago. They were open for dine-in seating and did a pretty good job following covid protocols. Our server was great and very friendly! I enjoyed our experience more because of service.

We ordered two cocktails to start: the Fernet sangria and Mosca&apos;s mule. Loved both of them! They were both complex in flavor and a bit different than your typical mule or sangria. I would definitely order the Mosca&apos;s mule again.

The two main entrees were fantastic as well. The chicken was perfectly cooked, still juicy in the middle. It was accompanied by a delicious lemon butter sauce. I also thought the potatoes were well done too (not too soft or hard). The ravioli was fantastic and the one I would order again. Crispy pieces of prosciutto on top really made this dish a showstopper."
5,"My first indoor dining experience in almost a year! And such a great, safe one. I went on a Tuesday night so the place was pretty empty. The bartender was so nice, and made me a sweet Negroni that I absolutely loved!!! We got the Italian salad, Buratta and the chicken piccata pasta. In almost 30 minutes we wiped everything clean! Such great homey food, not too heavy, portions were exactly right, and flavourful. I&apos;d recommend this place for some good Italian on a snowy day."
5,"Really hit the spot for a premium takeout

Tiramisu - 5/5. Incredible. Spongy texture is wondeful with the heavy marscapone. Perfect amount of coffee. Sweet finish. 

Di Stefano Burrata - 5/5. Wonderful bite all together. The sundried tomatoes were umami bombs. The pesto is surprisingly subtle.

Baked Burrata Lasagna - 4.5/5. Really rich and delicious with so much cheese and great sauce. Is a bit one note towards the end with lack of much texture variation. 

Double Chocolate Cake - 4/5. Quite dark but my wife really liked"
4,"Made reservations for 8:45 and we were seated right away, Chicago is only at 25% capacity so you will need to make reservations! 

The ambiance inside the place is very nice, the staff was great &amp; some were even double masked. Tables were spaced out and very clean. 

We had the tuscan cheese bread to start, it was very cheesy and garlicky, but i wish there was more of the tomato sauce to dip it in, there was a small serving provided. My bf ordered the minestrone soup, it was pretty tasty especially since I don&apos;t really care for vegetable soup. For our entrees we ordered the chicken parmigiana and the lasagna, both were very very good. Nice size portions, hot &amp; fresh. I&apos;m pretty sure the spaghetti and the lasagna noodles were freshly made in house. 

This is a nice place for date night or a family dinner, not too overly priced compared to other places in the area. Would definitely recommend."
5,"Hubby and I walked from Lincoln Park to Il Porcellino on a lovely summer evening while visiting Chicago. The service from the host to the waitstaff was absolute perfection from start to finish. They called us by name, welcomed us so warmly, and gave us a free sample of one of their appetizers when we asked what it tasted like. How sweet is that? Seriously. The waiter was attentive yet not intrusive at all. Everything was perfectly cooked and delectable, and we never felt rushed. 

I&apos;m not sure I&apos;ve had better customer service AND better food than that. Coupled with our adventures before and after our visit here, Il Porcelino made a wonderful day even more special. 

It was one of those evenings I&apos;ll never forget."
5,"Came here on Valentines Day for the first time and had a great experience! The staff was friendly, beautiful ambiance and the food was delicious. I&apos;ve had eggplant parm at many different places but this was one of the best! I&apos;ll definitely be back"
4,"I had great service, wine, and fresh pasta. Not much more I could ask for (except for more vodka sauce!) 
Definitely recommend the brussels sprouts."
4,The lasagna was pretty good. I&apos;m not sure if I would have it again since the sauce was so thin. Overall our waiter and the environment was nice
4,"Overall it was a good dinner. The stuffed mushroom appetizer was good but could&apos;ve been a bit warmer. I ordered the barrata lasagna which was a giant serving but very good and a nice classic sauce. I had the spumoni ice cream for dessert because I can never turn down anything pistachio flavored. I thought it would be a bit fancier than it was especially given the area. But it was good. 

And that&apos;s all I have to say about that.

2,"I ordered the chicken piccata for delivery through caviar tonight and it was delicious. However, halfway through eating I found a piece of red meat in the spinach.  I&apos;ve included photos of it, looks like it could be a piece of some steak? Either way, this could be super dangerous! some of my family members keep kosher and if they had accidentally taken a bite it could have made them extremely sick."
3,"I wish I could say better things about this restaurant-mashup experiment, but in truth it&apos;s just contributing to bizzaro-world IMO! I&apos;ll be generous with three stars in the hopes things improve with time.

While I am so happy something is finally open after the covid lockdown and riots rampant damage to this former vibrant neighborhood of the City, it&apos;s just these three time-tested and beloved staple restaurants are so distinctly different from eachother that it kills the whole vibe. 

What management decided to do is pick just a few top items from the three restaurants: Hub51 (Pub-Food), IL Porcellino (family-style Italian) and Ramen-San (Ramen bowls) but most of my personal favorites didn&apos;t make the cut! Insert sad emoji. I do really like the QR code links to a menu download by smart phone though to reduce the number of hands menus typically pass through. Kudos for enabling technology! Maybe they can do something similar with POS pay as well through the LettuceEats app?! Just a suggestion if management is up to it. It took 20-minutes just to close out the tab. 

Also I know the staff is short compared to pre-covid days, and it really shows! They are clearly scrambling, my order wasn&apos;t even accurate, the things I asked them to please delete from the ingredients, they put extra of instead (yuck) and asking for a side of sauce was just too much for my server. He finally told me after I had literally 2 bites left of my whole unsatisfying meal that he couldn&apos;t find the little cups they serve them in. NBD but awkward.

I hope this experiment is short lived and they go back to the full service, full menu, full vibe we want to support through these bizzaro-world times."
4,"il Porcellino is offering patio dining along with Hub 51 and Ramen San! We went today to check it out and were happily surprised. It is very clean, everyone has masks and gloves, and the menu is through a QR code. Our waitress was very kind and helped figure out a Vegan option for me (orecchiette pasta with veggies) and was helpful in asking the kitchen numerous questions.

I&apos;m giving 4 stars because the food took quite a long time to arrive and vegan options are limited. However, everything was flavorful and sufficient quantities!! I&apos;m usually unamused by small portions and nicer restaurants and this was happily not the case. Nice ambiance and service. Good option with a varied menu!"
5,"I got the Ravioli Al Forno - takeout.

It was delicious. Nice portion too. The crispy prosciutto was money *chef kiss*

The Garlic Bread was bomb as well"
5,"I&apos;ve been here several times and it never disappoints! From casual date nights to wanting some dinner with a large group - this place is perfect. It has a convenient location in River North close to tons of other places to visit afterwards.

The food here is delicious! Pasta tastes so rich and the sauce has so much flavor. I&apos;d recommend the vodka pasta and shrimp scampi. We also had the lasagna and it was good but not the same level as everything else. I also always grab a nice bottle of wine with my food and this place has a wide variety.

The service is always stellar as well. I always have someone different but it&apos;s always great 

With a great atmosphere, tasty food, and spectacular service I will always be returning back!"
4,"I had a good time at the restaurant. The waiter was very friendly and nice. We did have to wait 20 minutes for him to come and take our order in the beginning, but after that the service improved greatly and didn&apos;t have to wait too long. 
Even though it was overall a good experience, there were some things that I thought can be improved.
First is the arrangement of the outdoor seating. The way the seats are set up is in the middle of the streets so there were 5 tables outside, split by pedestrian walk way into 3 and 2. This allowed so many people to walk by the tables, which made the dining experience slightly uncomfortable- especially when groups not wearing masks passed by. I wish we were offered to be seated in the inside right by the open window but sadly we were not offered. 
Second is the food. We ordered meatball for appetizer, a bottle of red, and two Cacio e Pepe for entrees. The wine and the appetizer were very good, but the pasta was a bit watery, tasting soggy/ overcooked, as depicted by the soup in the bottom in the picture attached.
But I think my experience could have been better in different circumstances/ if I ordered something di. I hope the seating arrangements are figured out so it&apos;s safer, and I am definitely willing to try this place again."
3,"I really wanted some calamari and I saw some from other&apos;s reviews unfortunately I didn&apos;t get the fried one as there was no option to specify. What I did get was some burnt flavored kind in some red sauce it was awful. It wasn&apos;t even decent to eat not to feel bad about spending the money. I want my $15 back for the appetizer that went in the trash. The fettuccine and chicken parm were good just not worth the price, but hey it&apos;s downtown so it is it what it is. They forgot to include silverware on a togo order so eating at the hotel was fun as we looked for silverware so make sure you ask for some if ordering to go. The beer was okay I guess sort of like a Budweiser if that&apos;s your thing."
2,"Ordered via caviar &amp; the food just wasn&apos;t good....Cacio e Pepe had Alfredo-style sauce, the cheesy bread was dry, and the tiramisu was sickly sweet."
4,"The dimmed lights and ambiance make this a very cute and romantic dinner spot! They also have decent happy hour specials. I came here with a friend for happy hour and sat by the bar area. The bartender was very helpful with recommendations. The happy hour special includes both drinks and a few food items. I tried their Italian and Meatball subs and both were delicious! I would definitely come back here for dinner or another happy hour. 

Con: It does get busy on weekdays around 5 pm so finding a seat around the bar area might not be easy."
4,"We had a great, relaxed, warm, inviting experience. We loved the ambiance. It wasn&apos;t life changing Italian, but it was homey and solid. The friendly and knowledgeable staff, and prompt service was amazing. The food was not out of this world but it was good and good portions. The bread was delicious especially that they pour over olive oil and  garlic. The burrata lasagna is what I ordered for main course. That&apos;s what they are know for but it was just okay not mind blowing. I wouldn&apos;t order that again if I came back but I would come back and try something different. 100% recommend!"
5,"We were very very delighted by our culinary experience here. 

**Be sure to check the website before you dine in (in the future)- we found a deal for $25 off!!*

When we arrived, there were cute diy lights and warm lighting that made the date experience feel cozy and authentic. 

Our waiter was very kind and attentive, and made sure to routinely check on us. 

We ordered the artichoke appetizer, which was just okay in my opinion. It could&apos;ve been that I haven&apos;t had artichoke before, so it wasn&apos;t as satisfying as I thought it would be. 

Both of our pasta dishes were very flavorful and delicious. The meat was well prepared and the sauce complimented the dish well. I wish the portion size could&apos;ve been slightly larger, but we ended up feeling satisfied at the size by the end of the meal. 

Overall, a great date spot with great grub!"
