5,"Jeni&apos;s is one of my favorite ice cream shops ever. This is a pre-covid review since we definitely aren&apos;t sampling anything at the moment. I absolutely love their sampling system because every employee is always so nice when we want to try more than a few flavors. I&apos;ve brought out of town guests here and it&apos;s always a joy seeing them sample the classics and the new flavors without any pressure. The folks working there always do a great job describing the flavor when they give it to you.

We always have a few pints of Jeni&apos;s at home, but popping into the store is awesome. The smell of the waffles is wicked good!"
5,"It&apos;s expensive but worth it. I just used part of this stimulus money to get pints delivered because it&apos;s quarantine self-care time, ya&apos;ll."
5,"I scream,  you scream,  we all scream for ice cream 

jeni&apos;s ice cream of course!

We finally made it to Jeni&apos;s Ice Cream and what a treat it was.

We loved everything about the ice cream from the texture to the flavor and the longer lasting melting time.

We ordered  a scoop of Darkest Chocolate and Pineapple Upside Down Cake ice cream. Both were delicious.

If you&apos;ve never tried jeni&apos;s ice cream, you really should, just make sure you take the time to savor the fragrance and flavor of the ice cream. 

We loved it so much we each took a pint home with us."
5,Amazing just had the whiskey pecans ice scream!!!! Soooo fire omg I can not believe how good it is! I don&apos;t want to finish it. Try it out it&apos;s amazing and they close late
5,The best icecream in town! My boys love it! Quality ingredients and taste incredible.
4,"I&apos;ll be the first to admit, when I first tried Jenni&apos;s I didn&apos;t necessarily get the hype. Yeah they&apos;ve got unique flavors, it&apos;s cute inside, and the sampler option is nice, BUT their ice cream wasn&apos;t all that. I&apos;m a guy who typically likes rich, creamy, all the fat and calories ice cream, and sticks to basics flavors, aka not Jeni&apos;s. But after giving Jeni&apos;s a couple tries, I&apos;ve really come around and had a change of heart. And maybe it&apos;s just bc it took me a couple tries to find a flavor I loooved.

And now, all I want is their Gooey Butter Cake! It&apos;s become one of my absolute favorite ice creams I&apos;ve ever had! It&apos;s creamy, flavorful, and not overly sweet. It&apos;s the perfect after dinner treat. I also love that when you order a cup, they still throw in a piece of waffle cone so you have something crunchy to nibble on. While I still don&apos;t understand the appeal behind their famous flavors like Brambleberry or Brown Butter Almond, that&apos;s okay! Because give me all the Gooey Butter Cake you&apos;ve go Jeni. I also love that they ship Nationwide and offer pickup so during these tough times, you can treat yourself to some GBC ;)"
2,"I&apos;ll start of by saying the ice cream is pretty good. Not the best I&apos;ve ever had, but definitely tasty. The issue is the ridiculous portion sizes for the what you pay. You&apos;re paying $8-$10 for two, golfball sized scoops of ice cream and a waffle cone. You could walk down to Jewel and get a pint of ice cream for $5. Or, better yet, walk down the street to Foxtrot and get a pint of Jeni&apos;s ice cream for $10. Same cost for a lot more ice cream. Everyone I know who&apos;s gone to Jeni&apos;s has been disappointed by the portions. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere better."
5,When they say splendid boy do they mean it!!! This place is packed in the summer evenings!! It&apos;s worth the wait! They have some of the best flavors in the biz!
5,"Jeni&apos;s Splendid Ice Cream is a Wrigleyville and Southport gem. Bramble berry is my favorite; however, there are so many unique flavors to choose from every time you go. I don&apos;t remember her name, but the Wrigleyville store had what I can only describe as an ice cream &quot;sommelier.&quot; She knew her ice cream, and could recommend an ice cream flavor after 3-4 quick questions. It was like going to a scratch bar and having a bartender whip you up something fresh on demand. Highly recommended and a must for out of town guests."
5,Excellent ice cream!! A lot of flavors and can&apos;t really go wrong with any of them! You know Jeni&apos;s is really good because they keep growing and opening more locations. Has that farm fresh ice cream feel to it! Super yummy!!
5,"Love this place! I know a lot of reviewers say that this place is expensive, but I don&apos;t think so... Baskin Robbins isn&apos;t nearly as good and maybe I forgot, but they seemed more expensive. Maybe I just don&apos;t like paying for their ice cream because Haagen Daas is better. 

Anyway! I&apos;ve been here countless of times. I appreciate that they have a seating area, water, and a bathroom. You know how many small places like this in the city (and suburbs) don&apos;t have a bathroom! 

Also, they do charge more if you are dining in. It&apos;s stupid, but it&apos;s a Chicago tax (i think)."
5,"Such a lovely and welcoming ice cream shop! All of the choices and unique flavor options can be overwhelming, but the staff members are absolutely delightful, so knowledgeable, and will describe any flavor with wonderful accuracy. They&apos;ll also give you as many samples as you need, all in reusable adorable metal spoons! You will pay a premium for the quality, but it&apos;s well worth the splurge! I got to half scoops so I could try two different flavors and the portion size was just right for me. This place is popping even in the winter. Expect lines on a warm day."
2,"Jeni&apos;s is fairly good ice cream but very over hyped. If they didn&apos;t have a good marketing department, nobody would think they were anything special."
5,"Classic favorite.  We live close to 2 places and we love it  
My favorite would be  super moon and they&apos;re seasonal ones"
5,"I&apos;ve been to this location multiple times, parking is a pain but it&apos;s soooooooooooo worth it, last time I visited I had the oooooie gooooie cake, and can you say YUM!! Lol

My son enjoyed his chocolate ice cream, I can&apos;t remember what flavors my friend had but we were all satisfied!"
5,Can&apos;t go wrong with traditional flavors or seasonal delights. Up to three free scoops on your birthday!
4,Popped in here on a lovely snowy day for yes icecream.  Only us Midwesterners can understand it&apos;s not just for hot summer days! I was delighted with all of the different flavors and the clerk happily let me and my crew taste a good 4 mini spoons each. I opted for the darkest chocolate as it was deliciously rich and decadent.  All of the flavors were amazing it was hard to pick just one. I only wished they had nuts as an additional topping.  I like my chocolate with nuts and I understand it is for those who are allergic that they sans the nuts.... (sad face) Anywho lovely place for a delicious scoop!
5,"Oh Jeni&apos;s... If you&apos;ve never tried Jeni&apos;s before, it definitely lives up to the hype. With locations popping up in all the neighborhoods in Chicago it seems, we&apos;ll be able to get Jeni&apos;s just about anytime and anywhere soon!

I&apos;ll say I seem to find myself craving Jeni&apos;s once a month or so. Their ice cream has this really unique creamy consistency throughout and doesn&apos;t seem to melt very fast. HOW DO THEY DO THAT?!

Being a purist, their vanilla is always one to make it into my trio sampler. While I&apos;ve never had a bad flavor from here and they seem to consistently offer different flavors depending on the season, you&apos;re truly in for a unique treat each time you visit. Way to keep things fresh! Other flavors I love are the salted peanut butter with chocolate flecks and just about any chocolate or coffee variation they offer at the time.

Definitely worth a stop if you&apos;re craving ice cream!

&apos;Til next time, cheers!"
4,"Customer service is fantastic. The place is spacious and very clean. Ice cream is delicious. Really smooth, bold flavors. Great flavors to choose from. Only downer but not really, No Nuts. I love nuts, but understand people have not allergies."
5,"If I could eat jenis everyday for the rest of my life I would. Amazing, incredible, I love u Jeni"
