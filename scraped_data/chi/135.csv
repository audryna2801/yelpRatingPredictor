5,"Holy Molly! Even during covid this place is incredible!! We ordered their barley soup, chicken enchiladas, and prime burger!! Everything was DELICIOUS!!! These guys know how to make food taste like heaven!!

Also the service was incredible! Our waiter was very kind and welcoming! The barista also came to our table to answer a question about coffee options! Incredible, great job, I will always come back!!"
5,"Even though I live closer to the River North location, this has become my go-to Beatrix. I work at Lurie so it is so convenient to end up here for drinks after work [well, pre-Covid cold weather] or grab Brunch with friends prior to an evening shift. The food and drinks are always consistently good and the staff is great! I&apos;ve only had one bad service experience and considering the number of times I&apos;ve been to this location, that&apos;s a very small percentage so basically negligible! 

My go to&apos;s for lunch/dinner are the Straight A salad and the Kenebec fries! For breakfast, I love the pepper and egg sandwich or the eggs your way! The breakfast enchiladas on the brunch menu are SO good!! Their pastries and desserts are incredible and I have yet to try something I didn&apos;t like! Overall, SO wonderful!!"
5,"If you&apos;re looking for an affordable and extremely yummy place to grab breakfast/lunch, Beatrix is your place! I want to start this review by highlighting their efforts to keep their diners safe. Rather dining inside or on the patio, they take your temperature using a touch-less thermometer. This allowed me to feel safe while dining in their patio area and that the restaurant truly cares about their consumers and workers! I wish other restaurants/ establishments would take these measures to ensure safety! The patio was socially distant for a comfort eat as well. 

Okay-- on to the good stuff. Beatrix has a simple menu packed with so many yummy breakfast and lunch options. I came for a quick breakfast and ordered &quot;Eggs Your Way&quot;  which came with eggs, hash browns, and your choice of brown sugar bacon or turkey bacon (all for 11.95 -- a steal) . I ultimately landed on scrambled eggs with pepper jack cheese (game changer) turkey bacon and the hash browns extra crispy! In addition, I ordered their melon and berries and an iced coffee. I was beyond pleased with this meal. The eggs were  scrambled yet fluffy and so very cheesy which was the absolute best. I loved their toast which was served with a side of their raspberry jam, that jam was amazing! Sweet, a little tart, and fresh with small seeds in it. The hash browns were golden to perfection and the turkey bacon was crispy packed with flavor. The best part about this meal was the price! I was STUFFED for 16 dollars! (11.95 + 3.50 for the fruit)  and more than happy with the quality and flavor of the meal. My server Kelsey was so very sweet and accommodating. I will happily be back for a quick, tasty and affordable meal here all while staying safe and enjoying a nice outdoor view."
4,"Though I&apos;ve never tried this shop for dining, I sometimes buy baked goods whilst my morning walk.
As I got to know that Chicago city celebrated 158th birthday these days, and this shop sell limited &quot;Birthday pound cake&quot; which looked so cute, so I grabbed it today.
Staffs are always nice and friendly here."
4,I had the prime burger and let me just say that it was PRIME! It was cooked to perfection and the topping were exactly the way they should be. Beatrix knows how to make customers keep coming back!
3,"If you have seen the size of their take out box, the $19 portion of the poke bowl is a bit disappointing.  It does not even fill half way up the depth of the container. Flavor for this bowl is great, just not the portion for $19."
5,"This Beatrix location is right across the street from the Hyatt Centric Magnificent Mile.

I was staying at the Hyatt Centric - and wanted some place with more reasonable pricing than the restaurant in the Hyatt Centric.

First, it was winter, and very cold out. I ventured into Beatrix - and was greeted immediately, as well as seated. After looking over the menu, I opted to start with a cup of hot tea - the Turmeric-Ginger-Citrus tea - served in a cute little single serve glass steeping pot. For dinner, I selected the Tomato-Basil soup, finished with a Basil finishing oil; then an order of their Kung Pao Cauliflower. I can&apos;t recall the last time I had a vegetarian dinner - but this was hearty, filling, and delicious! Really hit the spot! The tea was really good as well - and the service was on point.

The following night - I came back for dinner - this time I sat at the bar to eat. I went with the same tea as the night before - but for dinner, I ordered their Slow Braised Short Rib w/ a chili-chocolate glaze, smoked almond slaw, and corn tortillas. I skipped the corn tortillas and ate the rest the way it was. The short rib was ridiculously tender and the chili-chocolate glaze was spectacular, although I wanted MORE of it - and I would not have been disappointed to have it be spicier! The slaw was also outstanding! It provided a nice textural contrast to the meat - it was fresh, crunchy, and flavorful!

Again, service was really good!

Fantastic restaurant!

5,"Love this place! Had some friends from out fo town staying with us and we missed breakfast time on Monday morning and didn&apos;t really feel like having lunch but got some goodies from the bakery to hold us over while we went to a brunch spot and let me tell you, their baked goodies are to die for! So delicious and flavorful but so fresh and simple! Obsessed! 

I had been here for weekend brunch before and was super impressed as well. Will definitely come back for brunch and in time for breakfast soon too! Definitely a hit in my book!"
4,"My boyfriend and I came here for a Sunday brunch and it was pretty good! He opted for the Prime Burger and I got the Rigatoni with Vegetable Bolognese dish. We both really enjoyed our dishes but I thought it wasn&apos;t worth the price to be honest (hence, only 4 stars). However, if you ever stop here for their coffee, it is beyond delicious! I&apos;m a big coffee drinker and decided to try their Lavender Honey Latte. It was so good that I practically drank so fast as if it was water on a hot summer day. While I still encourage people to try this place out and make their own decisions on the food, I would definitely recommend this place for their coffee 100%."
4,"This was my first time eating at a Beatrix. Stepped in prior to the lunch time rush. We did not have a reservation, but they were able to seat a party for 2 quickly. Place was already filled with patrons.

Server greeted us quickly and gave us a run down of the menu. It&apos;s comfort food with a healthy twist. Waters were brought and I ordered the Mango, orange &amp; pineapple nectar  fresh squeezed juice. This was refreshing.

For my lunch, Enlightened Caesar with grilled salmon added. The salad is romaine, arugula, capers, croutons, grams padano &amp; Greek yogurt dressing. This was very good. Salmon and greens tasted fresh and sauces were light and were not used to cover the taste. 

Server was friendly and attentive and the food was excellent. I am a fan, but not alone. As we were leaving, there was a gaggle of people at the door, waiting for a table."
5,"(Note: This review is for food picked up during COVID19
 Unfortunately, I do not have a photo.)

Whoa. 

One of the greatest silver linings about this very strange time is the ability to try restaurants you might not normally have a chance too. Alinea. RPM Italian. And now, Beatrix. 

Yes, Beatrix belongs listed in the same company as those two. Especially with their near perfect takeout menu. 

A dinner for two, very reasonably priced, consists of their take on a caesar salad (easily one of the best I&apos;ve had), a delectable quinoa salad, and two quinoa and mushroom burgers. 

Let me cut to the chase: this is a special veggie burger. The brioche roll is perfect, grilled just enough to hold the patty without falling apart. I could eat the roll on it&apos;s own and call it a day; but, that quinoa mushroom burger is something to make sure you try. Jam packed with flavor, topped with cheese and a beautiful aioli, this thing rivals many of the regular burgers in town. 

Once life resumes, I look forward to visiting Beatrix and checking out the full dining room experience."
5,Amazing service and food is excellent and Jordan who works here is super nice and friendly great with customer service! Will be eating here again 100% recommend:)
4,"Unbeknownst to me, this was a Lettuce Entertain You Restaurant.  And as a coffeehouse &amp; Restaurant this offers a unique spin on restaurant offerings.

We started our evening with the chicken meatball appetizer in a ginger soy glaze.  They were very good.

For our dinner entrees I choose the Straight &quot;A&quot; salad option with grilled chicken.  I always love a fruit and nuts in my salad.  My husband chose the special of the the night which the name escapes me, but it was a grilled chicken with roasted veggies.

They also have glasses of select white &amp; red wines for $5 a glass.  Up until 5 pm I believe.

The one thing I wasn&apos;t happy with was that we had an open table reservation online, and they tried to shove us in a corner table near the kitchen.

When we asked to be moved she then offered us a communal table.  I mean I would hardly consider that an option.  If I walked off the street without a reservation I would find that acceptable.  But not for someone who takes the time to make a reservation.

Otherwise food was good, service was decent.  I like the healthy options that are offered.  But I wouldn&apos;t consider this a destination."
5,"So glad I got to experience brunch at Beatrix! We had reservations for 10:30 and only had to wait a few minutes to be seated outside. It was such a nice day and they even had umbrellas to block the rays. 

We started with mimosas, orange and blue. Very tasty, especially the original mimosa. Then I had the egg white omelette with golden hash browns, sausage and delicious wheat toast. I enjoyed it all! I had no idea sausage could be so good and flavorful and light but juicy. I wish I had a whole platter of it. 

The omelette was very filling and fluffy and the tomatoes and veggies on top were a nice touch. I asked for the side order of hash browns and am glad I did! Crispy and perfectly complemented the eggs and toast. 

I definitely didn&apos;t finish it all but I tried my best! Maybe I won&apos;t fill up so much on the mimosas next time. I&apos;d come right back and order the same exact thing for sure!"
4,"Great coffee and we got a coconut and chocolate cookie. We came on a Friday around 5 and there was limited seating. I guess the tables are reserved for dinner guest- which makes sense. Although, I wish they would allocate more space for the bakery section. 

In the restaurant side, they also have a little food bar where you can buy food to go. Definitely an interesting place. Worth going to."
4,"I LOVE BEATRIX. The salad bar options are great and the options changes often enough that I can eat there weekly and not get tired of the food. The dinner is fantastic as well. This is probably the only place that I consistently get fries because the aoli that comes with it is just so amazing (if its doesnt come with please ask for it!!!). I&apos;ve pretty much tried everything on the menu and can honestly say that everything tastes good. The vibe is great (although sometimes I fear that I run into colleagues...). The drinks are also great- would highly recommend making your own cocktail with the juices on the menu. 
My only complaint is that the dessert on display on my last visit had bugs all over them ew (hence taking off 1 star)."
5,"Came here basically everyday during our Chicago trip for coffee and hot chocolate. According to my bf and brother, they have the best nitro cold brew in town. They also even had a pumpkin nitro cold brew they were offering when we went. Since I do not drink coffee, I opted for their hot chocolate. It was soooo good. Not too sweet either which I was happily surprised about. They also offer pasteries so I couldn&apos;t help myself and ordered a Kouign-amann. It was delicious. Perfectly flaky and tasty!"
5,"Perfect brunch spot!

They have a cafe on the side with various drinks and pastries. The inside of the restaurant is very roomy and cute! 

The service was also amazing! There was a slight confusion in who was serving our table, and when the server finally came she not only apologized, but also gave us a tray of pastries for free!

The food was also amazing. The steak chimichurri &amp; eggs was done very well! We also got the Light &amp; Fluffy Pancakes which was SO GOOD. They were legit light and fluffy, and just melt in your mouth!

Definitely a place to go!"
4,"Had a solid lunch here on christmas eve. I had a turkey burger which came with a quinoa kale mixture on the side. The burger had good flavor but was charred a little too much in places. Quinoa was solid. Good coffee too and the waitress let me take a to-go cup on the way out. 
I&apos;ve been here for brunch before and think I preferred that menu to the lunch menu, but no major complaints this go around."
4,"I was in Chicago for the weekend for a conference and got to try this place for breakfast. It was a short walk from my hotel in the heat of the action. The inside had a cozy feel to it. The waitress tended to us promptly. 

I ordered a coffee which was far too floral for my taste. My friend ordered OJ which he said tasted fresh. I ordered the lemon pancakes and the chicken tinga. The pancakes were nice and fluffy. The simple syrup was not too sweet and the candied lemon peels on top added tremendously to the flavor. The tinga had a delicious spice and the perfectly cooked egg on top helped cool down the heat. I would definitely order the tinga again! 

My friends enjoyed their maple coated bacon. Their eggs didn&apos;t look as well cooked as mine did (pretty overdone)."
