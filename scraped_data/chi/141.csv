5,"We came here for lunch and it was really good! There weren&apos;t a ton of people there and the tables were spread out and the sections had plexiglass in between the two sides of the seating areas.

Overall I felt safe due to the lack of people and staff wearing masks at all times."
5,"We went here on maybe the last nice day of the fall season and got to sit outside. It was a Sunday afternoon, but still kind of busy. We were grateful we got a table in their outdoor seating section since we were trying to be safer due to COVID. We tried the all you can eat option. The price increased due to COVID but still wasn&apos;t bad for the quality of food you get and it being AYCE. We got fried oysters and takoyaki to start. I have never had either before and thought they were both just okay. I am glad I tried them, but I don&apos;t think they are my cup of tea. We then got a few rolls which were surprisingly really big. The last AYCE we have been to served small rolls so that is what we were expecting but sushi taku does it big which is awesome! For two people, we couldn&apos;t eat that much so next time we want to come here with a group (when COVID really dies down). The place has a nice vibe and the indoor dining looks very nice too. I would recommend this place for group outings to do AYCE or for a date just grabbing a few rolls to share. The sushi is great, prices are appropriate, and the service is good!"
5,"Have you guys been to other AYCE sushi places? I have, and that&apos;s why I don&apos;t prefer AYCE sushi but Sushi Taku changed my mind! Sushi Taku&apos;s fish is perfectly cut, not too thin not to chunky. It&apos;s not dry, but buttery! Even the rice was perfectly cooked and flavored. They did change the price due to COVID but I think it&apos;s still worth the money. Great selection of appetizers, but shrimp tempura was cold (the only down side of my experience). HOWEVER, I WILL DEF BE GOING BACK!"
5,"Sushi Taku is a great restaurant, one of my favorite places to eat.
The food is wonderful, the service is outstanding!
I&apos;d like to thank our server, MEL, great person and professional. 
Good job guys, keep it up!"
4,"Multiple visits during the pandemic. They have a nice outdoor setup. Heaters available outdoors to brave the elements. It also has a good flow of air coming in and out. I wore my jacket while eating but gloves / hat weren&apos;t necessary to feel comfortable. Bottled water and individual condiment set ups show thoughtfulness of the establishment. Miso so nice on cold days.

The hits: fatty slabs of nigiri, hand rolls included in ayce, fresh fried tempura, unique combinations in the rolls like the mango tango.
The miss: on one occasion-rice that didn&apos;t stay together on multiple nigiri.

I&apos;ll continue to contribute my all you can eat sushi dollars to both locations of Sushi Taku. $20.99 M-F lunch noon-3 pm."
4,"Was looking for an AYCE sushi place in Chicago and came across Sushi Taku. Outdoor dining is open and they have plastic tents set up with heated lamps. It was nice and cozy! 

I came here with a friend for lunch and we were already set on AYCE so we didn&apos;t waste any time. During the pandemic, the pricing is the same whether you come for lunch or dinner ($27.99). The menu has a great selection of sushi ranging from nigiri, signature rolls, regular rolls, and vegetable rolls. There are also a good amount of appetizers to choose from. We ordered the chicken karaage to start which was delicious! For sushi, we got a total of 8 pieces of nigiri and 4 rolls (wish I could remember all the names!). First off, the nigiri and rolls were HUGE. I think these are the biggest pieces of sushi I&apos;ve ever seen. Pro: you get a lot of food. Con: you get full off of a few pieces and can&apos;t try other rolls!! Nevertheless, they were delicious. My favorite was the spicy 2 in 1 roll.

For dessert we ordered the tempura oreo, ice cream, and cheesecake. The dessert was just ok, but again, you don&apos;t come to a sushi spot for dessert. All-in-all I would definitely come here again!"
5,"The hype is real. Best AYCE sushi around but it&apos;s SO good and the deal is SO good that it&apos;s hard to go to any other sushi restaurant given the quality and price. The sushi is delicious and I especially love their salmon and tuna rolls. However, the real treat here is the nigiri, which is INCLUDED in the AYCE deal!! Unheard of!! Their fish is so fresh and tasty, so I&apos;ve switched to mostly getting nigiri now. Favorite nigiri are the tuna, white tuna, salmon, and yellowtail.  They also give you a HUGE piece of fish for the nigiri. I&apos;ve never been to a place with more generous portions, whether AYCE or not. Other go-to&apos;s included in the AYCE menu are the crab rangoon (crispy, salty goodness), shumai- either pork or shrimp-, and miso soup. Last but not least, the dessert of course. I LOVE their green tea/matcha ice cream. Also, you can&apos;t go wrong with the mochi or fried Oreos."
5,"Another sushi place to add to my list of faves! This place delivered quickly and the sushi was incredible, stuffed with more of the good stuff than the overload of rice you get at most places. We were very impressed with all the combos of flavor and specialty rolls. Definitely ordering from them again!"
3,"I have to start my review with the caveat that I ordered my food as take out so I know it probably isn&apos;t as good as it could have been. Got 3 rolls- spicy tuna, the baked fire dragon roll and the crazy Kani roll. As well as edamame and smoke salmon nigiri. 

The rolls were pretty small in comparison to other places I have gone. 
Spicy tuna was eh. Crazy Kani- was good but nothing to write home about. The fire dragon roll was good but not as good as I expected (given it was take out and probably not as warm as it would have been). Edamame was pretty basic and a large quantity. Smoke salmon Nigiri was the best part of the meal- so fresh and just melted in your mouth !"
5,"Our go-to sushi spot when my husband and I have a craving. This place always has a very long wait so be sure to call ahead and ask to join the waitlist. Food is excellent - always so fresh, the portions are great, though I wish we could order half roll instead of full sized roll since we always want to try as many variety as possible. Service is top notch too, a pleasant experience all around. We&apos;ve also always managed to find free parking in the surrounding neighborhoods, so that&apos;s a plus."
3,"Let me start off by disclaiming that I have an avocado allergy, and that makes loving sushi VERY hard. I know it&apos;s a nuisance but some restaurants are better than others at taking it seriously. 

We called Sushi Taku for a to-go order and I mentioned 2-3 times that I had an allergy. This was in the fall before indoor dining was shut down, so the pick-up process was stressful. There was not a ton of space to socially distance from other pick-up or dining-in orders. And alas, when I got to the car, avocado was in the rolls. 

I brought it back to ask if they could replace it, but it looked like they just disassembled the rolls in question, took the avocado out, and re-rolled them. I had some stomach problems later that night, which suggested they were not super thorough with fixing the issue. That being said, the sushi itself was amazing - I wanted to love it. I hope we can go back in the future and have a better experience with no allergic reactions!"
3,"This place is always packed. Call advance to be on the waitlist, so much easier instead of waiting on line. They do have indoor and outdoor seating. 

Is it covid safety friendly not that much. One no asked any covid questions.  Everyone is wearing a mask. However the table next to me. They look like it was clean but not disinfect clean. If you have weak immune, I highly don&apos;t recommend.

Overall the service was really good, asked question and everything. The menu price did change. It&apos;s a bit more expensive. The dinner hour is almost 30. And once you get to the table you have 1.5 hours at your seat."
4,"I went for all-you-can-eat sushi a few weekends ago, and it was great. One thing I&apos;d warn is that you might have to wait 30 minutes to get a table if you don&apos;t have a reservation. We got a table after walking around a bit in their front tables. It was a lovely spot. 

We got a bunch of their speciality rolls, and a few of their appetizers. Our favorite of the appetizers was the crab Rangoon. We got the calamari, which was alright with hardly any calamari! I don&apos;t think we could pick a favorite of the rolls because they were all so good. The one with mango was a little different, and I really liked that one. The low point of the meal was the dessert. I&apos;d definitely get again for all-you-can-eat, but probably not for normal meals. All of our food came out promptly, and the staff was very friendly."
4,"Sushi taku is good! 

I went with the girls this weekend and we had a blast. It&apos;s BYOB and they have indoor and outdoor dining (with umbrellas!). They have an &quot;all you can eat option&quot; but we chose to do a la carte. We recommend the dragon roll, the sashimi, and the mochi! 

We didn&apos;t like the Oreo tempura
Overall it&apos;s a 4/5 sushi spot because it has a great atmosphere but not the best sushi in the city"
5,"Sushi Taku is absolutely the best all you can eat sushi place in the city! Honestly I don&apos;t think I have been to a better all you can eat sushi place in the country (and I have been to a lot)! This all you can eat sushi place gives you the best bang for your buck as it has amazing quality sushi, nigiri, rolls, dumplings. It is a sushi lovers paradise. Each time I go I get lots of nigiri rolls (because these are my favorite) but I also stuff myself  with delicious crab Rangoon&apos;s, Gyoza, shumai, shrimp lollipops, and more. Not to mention the amazing dessert options including fried Oreos, cheesecake, and green tea ice cream. Don&apos;t second-guess any longer, go to sushi Taku now!"
4,"Sushi Taku boasts huge portions, great value, and sleek decor. 

It&apos;s a popular spot so be prepared to wait a bit. They have a fantastic outside seating area (I&apos;m not sure if this is temporary for COVID), and it seemed to be the ideal place to dine to enjoy the August weather. 

The servings are also very generous, so be careful not to order too much. Each uneaten roll will lead to a $1.00 surcharge. I paid $6.00 for my greed, and received a to-go box for them. 

You can BYOB for $10.00

Recommendations: Try a bit of everything. Remember, the appetizers are huge. Order slowly."
4,"Covid-19 Isolation Review-

We ordered out from Sushi Taku and CANNOT wait for COVID to be over so that we can eat all the sushi at the buffet!

We ordered:

They have specials that are reasonably priced and make it easy to try a lot of their rolls. 

Mango Tango Roll- the roll was delicious; the fresh mango made it feel/taste summery, and the lobster was enough of a taste (not small specks but enough to taste).

Angel Hair Roll- one of their best sellers.  Delicious roll with the a hint of apple. 

Spicy 2-in-1 Roll (delicious roll and had the right amount of spice).  I love spicy- this is spicy!

Crazy Kani Roll- Again, spicy but with a crunch from the tempura.

Mexican Roll- I don&apos;t usually order yellowtail, but this roll was delicious and again, spicy! Our favorite roll of the night.

Boston Roll- very fresh tasting and a good &apos;intro&apos; roll if you&apos;re new to sushi.

Spider Roll- really delicious as well- the soft shell crab was cooked perfectly."
1,Got a to-go from here yesterday. Food is always pretty good expect my boyfriend ate a piece of sushi and spit it out because there was a staple in it
5,"If you&apos;re ever craving sushi, this is the place to go to! With an extensive array of sushi choices, I went in for the lunch deal with a friend that only cost us $20.99! Might seem a bit pricey in the beginning, but for what it&apos;s worth, we finished a tray of about 6-7 rolls of sushi (and we made sure to get one to go!). 

Such vibrant colors on the sushi and very fresh! I definitely recommend, along with outdoor seating (as I&apos;m still hesitant on indoor seating, but hey, I went out either way! Who am I to say?) 

Favorite roll: Mango Tango Roll
I also had the steamed Gyoza... also amazing!!"
2,Buyer beware: they tell you it&apos;s &quot;all you can eat&quot; sushi but fail to tell you (both the waitress and the on the menu) that they charge you for each piece of uneaten sushi. Scum ball move and likely won&apos;t be dining here again because of it.
