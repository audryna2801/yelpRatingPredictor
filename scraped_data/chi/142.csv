5,"I was craving a burger and after a quick Yelp search, I stumbled on this gem. SO GOOD. Just wondering why it took me so long to discover it! Ordered for pick up and it was ready in 10 minutes! The burger was juicy and perfect and the cheese fries were bomb! Will definitely be back!"
5,"Gotta have a dog when in Chicago! This is my 4th visit to Chicago. Although times are different now, we still had a great time. 

Since outdoor seating is mandatory we had to find a dog place that accommodated that. Using YELP of course we found Flub A Dub Chubs. I called prior to make sure we could bring the amount of people we had. No issues there. The gentlemen that answered was so nice. 

We were greeted by a women who took our orders. Very sweet and funny. My husband and I both had the double dog combo- chard with all the delicious fixings. I got tots, he got fries. Another bonus for choosing this place is they have a vegetarian dog option. My sister is vegetarian and also has never had a Chicago dog. She LOVED hers! 

As we were sitting out front. Not only did the owner come out so did the sweet lady and a guy from the kitchen. Nice little conversations and checking if we needed anything. 

Very sweet people that made this trip feel as normal as it was the time before. 

Support your local businesses! You&apos;ll want them there when normality returns."
4,"If this is what an authentic chicago hotdog is like, i&apos;m sold. The restaurant has a very cool atmosphere and you become aware of it as soon as you enter through the doors. The framed drawings of hot dogs all over the walls show that Dub Chub&apos;s is beloved by locals and has been so for decades. 

This place has a really nice, historic charm behind it and I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if the cooks knew many of their customers by first name.

All that being said though, I do wish the hot dogs were a little big bigger considering the price. Other than that, I loved this place and will certainly miss it once I leave Chicago"
5,"I found this place through Groupon a while back and probably stop in at least once a month now!! 

My go to is always the Lenny G burger. 

Their burgers are amazing and I highly recommend the fried chicken sandwich too!"
4,"Chicago Dogs and fries. If this is what you need, you won&apos;t find better. In Lakeview, this should be your go-to!"
5,"I didn&apos;t know what to think of Flub A Dub Chubs at first. I mean I just spent $32 on 5 hot dogs. I told myself these mo fos have to taste great to justify this price. They all came with fries so you were at least guaranteed to get full, but at the end the day, that&apos;s a hell of a lot of fries. 

Their service was great. Very welcoming and very kind. They even offered us a cup of water while we waited. They took their sweet as time making our food and it was worth it. They paid attention to detail, even the wrapping of the food to ensure that it would make it our house warm and with no issues. 

We ordered their Chicago style hot dogs and two Jimmy chili cheese dogs. Chili cheese dogs are always messy, and this dog was no different. The wiener had a nice snap and was coated in chili and cheese. It was perfect and very filling. The chili was meaty and they give you a lot of it. The Chicago dog or their &quot;Flubby&quot; was near perfect. It came with your usually fixings. Tomatl wedges, pickle, sport peppers and Chicago neon green relish and a cucumber. Most after unwrapping don&apos;t look like this, but they wrapped it so perfect that nothing got messed up which made it easy to eat. The only thing that I was missing was a poppy seed bun. The fries were seasoned perfectly and tasted great. 

I was very impressed with Flub a Dub Chubs. The dogs were tasty, pricey but tasty, and most importantly the crew here knows how to treat a customer. Will definitely be back."
5,"Love, love, LOVE!  Great hot dogs in interesting combos (try the chihuahua!) and the perfect tots.  Why don&apos;t more places have tots?  Check out the $5 combo specials on Tuesdays.   
Staff is always super pleasant and service is fast."
5,Their Chicago dog is definitely a step above the rest and is actually one I crave and think about! It is just perfect. Service is also just lovely - friendly and helpful.
5,"one of my favorite spots in lakeview, came late with a friend and the server was super friendly and conversational! great food and a unique atmosphere, would recommend while in the area!!"
2,"The food is just okay, I expected more for the price. We got a 2 dog special - a Chicago dog and a brat - and got 2 brats instead. The fries were good though. We also got the hangover burger and the patty was meh while the bacon was soggy. Onion rings are not good - not crispy at all."
4,"Great place to grab a Chicago dog and some fries. 

The dog is great and the fries are nice and crisp. They have all kinds of options for hotdogs with add ons and other food options like burgers. 

They have deals throughout the week and the employee working the register was very sweet. Almost had a grandma type vibe and was caring for everyone who entered the store. 

The atmosphere is a fun and bright environment even though it&apos;s in a basement, which adds to its character."
5,"Our family is a big fan of Flub a Dub! And it is a love that last for years. 
It is true that I didn&apos;t stopped by in a long time, but they did. 
Tonight we invited our friend to try this burger. 
She is a huge fan of good bbq but very picky. 
I always bragged how she will love those flavors and guess what Her mind was blown away  
She said that she will bring some other friends bc this is amazing.. and it is true. 
Small hole in a wall place ( one of my things why I love this place ) always good fresh food. 
I love that they are constant. We have been to few places and we loved some food and eventually came back for more and they changed cooker or whatever.. I hate that.. 
but that can not happen to Flub. 
He is simply the best. 
Fresh good burger."
1,"Low on the hygiene scale.  Cook had mask under chin with nose out.  Owner/register attendant was making a shake without gloves fully immersing her fingers into the ice cream to push it into the shake jar.  Good news is you get a lot of ice cream.  Bad news is you got whatever was under her nails too.  After having preordering for pickup  via Yelp so that I can pop in and out, and then waiting 5 mins for her to make the strawberry finger shake, the owner gave me a 5 minute lecture on how I should call my orders in instead so she doesn&apos;t have to give Yelp 30% of the order value.  I won&apos;t be going back there again."
5,"The good: Basically no wait for Saturday lunch. I ordered the Woody burger and it was really good! The portebello mushrooms had a crispy coating. You get the choice of a pretzel bun or regular bun (I opted for the standard one). I had my burger cooked medium and it was perfect. The fries on the side were really good too.

The bad: Apparently you get &quot;shamed&quot; for adding ketchup to your hot dog?! It was funny watching the slideshow of people on the TV."
4,"Always will support flub a dubs for genuine hospitality and for being the quirky gem of a hot dog spot. Even though I cannot seem to find my hot dawg drawing from 2016 lol. Great vegan dogs! Also, tots for the win!"
4,"Love their dogs! If you&apos;re sharing for two people, definitely consider the 2 dog special thing that&apos;s $10. I didn&apos;t notice it one of the times I went and made a grievous, not very cost effective error. 

Seating on the sidewalk when it&apos;s nice out is pleasant!

Interior is otherwise covered in hot dog fan art &amp; the establishment is down some steps."
5,"The Roe is amazing! A bit pricey, but the portions are definitely worth the price. I&apos;ll be going here a lot more now!"
4,Solid dog - felt like a college place. Super low budget interior but was there for the dog and got a good one. Veggie dog was a nice option
5,"Dang... I&apos;ve lived in the neighborhood for 4 years now and introduced my dad to Flub A Dub Chubs (he&apos;s hooked) and decided today to get a little wild and try the beef... this dipped beef is hands down the best beef I&apos;ve ever had (and I eat a lot of beef) coupled with their homemade giardiniera is one of the best meals I&apos;ve had in a long time.

And it was great to see the place moving food left and right!  A true neighborhood staple!"
5,The place where ketchup lovers will spend eternity yearning for their packets of sweet overwhelming bright red glue. This is a Chicago dog. Excellent tots. Nice folks. Especially good while watching a bum fight with a security guard across the street. Highly recommended. Yellow mustard or death.
