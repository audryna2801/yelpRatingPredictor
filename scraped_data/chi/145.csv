5,Great food and very quick delivery. We love the fried catfish as well as the bucket of chicken. The beans and Mac and cheese are great too
5,My boyfriend and I will just order their desserts sometimes. They&apos;re really really good! Wish they sold sodas on the delivery apps. That would make this place beyond perfect
5,"Awesome food! This is very good and straight forward cooking done right. We got the chicken and shrimp, and chicken and ribs combo meals. For take out, we recommend not getting the fries as they did not transfer well (like a lot of fries), otherwise the beans, man n&apos; cheese, and collard greens hit the spot. We also thought the hush puppies were better than the biscuit. We will definitely be back!!"
5,"I give them a 5. Great food. We had the shrimp po boy. It was excellent. I had the boosted chicken and it was so good. The sides were great as well. Try the Mac n cheese and beans. We finished with the bread pudding. 

Only compliant was the biscuit. It was a bit too doughy. 

All and all an amazing choice."
3,"Carryout has never been high on our list, but through much of the past year it&apos;s been our only way to enjoy restaurant meals. In the midst of a difficult time for restaurants, I&apos;m reluctant to write anything negative and it&apos;s not my intention to single out Clucker&apos;s. But our most recent experience here was typical of the frustrations we&apos;ve encountered at several places.

Alright, here goes: I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich combo for the Missus and a Cuban panini combo for moi through ChowNow, the online ordering app. Clucker&apos;s combos include one side. A list of sides popped up for the chicken sandwich but oddly enough not for the panini, so I typed my side choice (broasted potatoes) in the &quot;Special Instructions&quot; box.

We drove to the restaurant to pick up our order, which was ready when promised. I checked, and sure enough, the broasted potatoes were absent.  I explained the ChowNow glitch to a worker who then grabbed an order of &apos;taters, saying, &quot;Next time you order, please call us.&quot;  Well, I prefer to order online because I loathe busy signals, being put on hold, and getting disconnected. Growl!

My Cuban sandwich, though not the Miami original, was an agreeable interpretation. The broasted potatoes were yummy. My Missus was much less fortunate. The online sub-menu gave her a choice of 3 sauces: &quot;Regular,&quot; &quot;BBQ,&quot; or &quot;Buffalo.&quot; She ordered &quot;Regular,&quot; assuming it was mayo-based. But they gave her BBQ sauce.  The lettuce on her sandwich was so soggy, it soaked through the bottom half of the bun. After blotting the lettuce between paper towels and crisping the bun in the toaster, she described the sandwich as &quot;average, nothing special.&quot;

Here&apos;s the straight dope on carryout and delivery: Once the food is on your table, if there&apos;s a problem, you are NOT going to drive back to the restaurant. But it&apos;s important to contact the restaurant, explain why you weren&apos;t satisfied, and give them an opportunity to make things right. Restaurants need to work harder to avoid careless mistakes on to-go orders, even as they reopen their dining rooms. I&apos;m giving Cluck-Cluck 3 stars instead of 2 because our previous experiences here were much better."
3,"Holy chicken sandwich! My husband and I have passed this place many times and wanted to try it. We ordered delivery through GrubHub. The food came hot and fast. My husband and son had a chicken finger meal which they both enjoyed. My husband&apos;s mac and cheese was fresh and super cheesy.

I, on the other hand, had the fried chicken sandwich. This had to be the biggest chicken sandwich I have ever seen made with a mutant-sized chicken breast. Unfortunately, quantity does not equal quality sometimes. My sandwich was bland but fairly juicy. It needed some sauce or mayo or something to help flavor it. I did request barbecue sauce with my order but it never came. It seemed like the breading/batter was missing salt and pepper or something. My mashed potatoes were good. We would probably try it again but have the more traditional chicken."
3,The food is great as always but the last 4 to 5 times I have ordered from them they either forgot all the sauces and now tonight they forgot to put in the coleslaw I would rate them higher but they keep leaving things off the order
3,There shrimp Po-boy is amazing weird hours though also love they&apos;re Mac and cheese they also have parking which is great
5,Hands down.... chicken is amazing.  Thankful to have a neighborhood spot we can support.   The owner goes above and beyond to give you a smile and know they are thankful.  Chicken dinner is affordable for a family.
3,"Cannot say that Mother Cluckers fascinated me. Sandwiches and fries are not bad, vegetables are fresh. And the main advantage is that you can dine inside, they have social distancing and stuff. Yet as for me the food was a little bit blunt. I would advise using some spices and pepper"
4,"My favorite thing about Mother Cluckers is honestly their customer service. I went to their Palatine location to try their chicken sandwich, and although I wasn&apos;t a big fan of it, their customer service was amazing. Had it not been for their customer service, I may have never came back. Fast forward to this location, and the consistency is definitely there. Very attentive and friendly staff. This location is also a lot smaller. 

I remember saying I should have just ordered their breasted chicken instead of their chicken sandwich. We ordered their 8 piece with mashed potatoes and Mac and cheese. They were unfortunately out of biscuits and hush puppies at the time, so we had to settle for their cheddar jalapeño corn muffin. 

Their mashed potatoes were very tasty and the Mac and cheese wasn&apos;t anything special. I also wasn&apos;t a big fan of their corn muffins. They were to dry and when you think jalapeño, you think spicy, there was no kick and couldn&apos;t tasty any cheddar. Wouldn&apos;t order these again. The chicken however is of course the highlight of the night. Breasted is basically a healthier way of frying a chicken, while not losing it&apos;s unhealthy taste. Perfectly seasoned and cooked chicken. It had a nice crisp on the outside and very fresh tasting. I&apos;m just glad I gave them another try and wouldn&apos;t mind returning."
5,"Ordered from here, and all I can say is this is some really good chicken! I ordered the 8 piece meal with two sides and the chicken arrived in a promptly manner. They were very well breaded and very moist. The breading was crispy and seasoned quite well. I also got a large side of fries and Mac and cheese. The Mac and cheese has a nice kick to it. The biscuits were good, but just a little bit dry. Overall I was very pleased with the food I got from here today. They have quite an extensive menu as well, so I will definitely be ordering from them again."
4,Amazing food! The chicken sandwich is so good and portions were so big I could barely finish my food! Their chicken is roasted which seals in natural juices and is apparently a bit healthier than the typical fried chicken. The mac and cheese honestly taste pretty great! The hush puppies are cheap and pretty solid so they are worth a shot too. Give them a try!
4,The broasted chicken was great- the servings are big. The breasted potatoes are nothing to rave about but the slaw and hush puppies are good.
5,"I ordered the 8 piece fried chicken with sides and it came hot and fresh with great speed! The chicken was crisp, well done and nice flavor. Perfect Sunday afternoon picnic. 

Although the fried chicken was delicious and fresh, (an obvious must have), what really impressed me was the sides, which are usually pretty underwhelming with fried chicken orders. The baked beans with bacon was so satisfying, and the coleslaw was fresh and delicious.  I&apos;m very picky about coleslaw, and this was quite good, with a creamy sauce that had a nice tang without overwhelming you with vinegary-ness or creating a soupiness all over the plate. The biscuits were ok, not the flakiest but heartier and denser, still tasty, all together a really great meal!"
4,"The chicken was very flavorful and the mashed potatoes were great!
I would have liked the chicken to be a bit crisper- maybe it was because I ordered take out and the time between pick up and eating was delayed but the chicken just didn&apos;t have crisp I was looking for. It made up for it in flavor. 
It&apos;s also cool they use a local farm for the chicken."
4,"Staff was friendly and the food came out fast. 

Fried chicken sandwich: huge portion. The sandwich must have been at least 12 oz of meat. Not too shabby, since it covered most of what I ate that day! It was good, but maybe not the best I&apos;ve ever had. Reminded me more of a schnitzel sandwich, I think because the chicken wasn&apos;t seasoned as much as I am used to. It could have had more flavor. 

Biscuit: again, good but not the best I&apos;ve had. 

Bread pudding: amazing. Piping hot, cinnamony caramely goodness. This brought the whole experience up a notch. I&apos;d come back for the bread pudding alone. 

Overall, good food with a homey neighborhood vibe with some great 80&apos;s classics bopping in the background."
1,"One star.  I tried to call them about my botched online order.  I posted details here since they didn&apos;t answer the phone.  I&apos;ll call my credit card company tomorrow. I&apos;d love to work it out.  But they didn&apos;t answer the phone.  

Don&apos;t order online.  There&apos;s no support. 

Here&apos;s my prior message:  

Three stars with hope they contact me.   I ordered as shown on the attached. You can see what I received.  I&apos;ve called them 29 times tonight.  It&apos;s busy.  I hope they make it right."
4,Good hush puppies. Not too greasy. Chicken was good - a bit spicy if you&apos;re a wimp like I am.
5,"Wow Mother Cluker&apos;s what a gem!! IF you haven&apos;t been here, you are truly missing out!! Unfortunately, places like this are very few. From the second you walk in the door you feel super welcomed and greeted right away. It was our first time and they were super patient with us and helped us with all the questions we had and recommended an amazing dinner! We ordered broasted chicken and half ribs. Two pieces of chicken and a half rack of ribs with different sides, absolutely DELICIOUS!!! not a single thing I would change! Chicken came out piping hot crispy super tender. The ribs was fall off the bone amazing with this glaze sauce on it was phenomenal legit my mouth is watering as I type this! The hush puppies, Mac &amp; chess, corn bread, baked beans, coleslaw was the sides and I would order them all again so good!! worth every penny! The customer service was hands down some of the best I&apos;ve ever had, I felt like I knew these guys like my buddy&apos;s! We left very happy and stuffed that&apos;s what&apos;s it&apos;s all about! We also got the bread pudding for dessert and that&apos;s a must! WE will absolutely be returning! so happy they are minutes away from my house! 100% recommend!"
