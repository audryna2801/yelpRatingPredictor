5,"Come on admit it...every once in a while you wake up and are like &quot;what&apos;s missing in my life? It must be turkish coffee and baklava&quot;
I was overjoyed that this was not one of restaurants closed during the pandemic . Everyone who goes there is properly spaced. The room is devided by boxes.

If your mom was Turkish she would force you to eat everything you ordered in one sitting. But since that&apos;s not the case unless it is you can eat leftovers for another time.

My friend had the baklava and I had turkish coffee. Apparently you have to tell them if you want it extra hot, strong, more sugary or just a little sugary. I wanted mine just a,little sugary...

They give you this carrot salad that has I think mayonnaise and bread while you wait.

The people next to me come all the time and order Turkish pizza with coffee every few days. It looks razor thin and and has beef in it with no cheese. Something to come back and try.

I had some beef skewers as appetizers with what I thought was a side of taboule...that&apos;s not just a,side ...that&apos;s a portion for paul bunyan...yowza.

I chose the veggie options on the side very carefully because me and spicy dont get along. The baklava is the best in chicago or is on par with the best I&apos;ve ever had. Ironically I came here to prepare for a trip to Turkey in a few months...I think I&apos;m gonna have to prepare more. Awesome food spot that has indoor dining. Yes I put back the mask when they come over and ask us if we want more."
5,"Zizis has been my savior in covid. From take out in the beginning, to the blissful outdoor seating in the summer, to now extremely safe indoor dining, Zizis has saved the day not once, not twice, but many times in the last year. The staff here is so firnedlt that they&apos;ve come to feel like family. Zizis is better than a home cooked meal. Paired with a great baklava at the end, and flan on the house, it might just turn your day around, too."
5,"Zizi&apos;s is one of my absolute favorite restaurants in Chicago. I order from here 1-3 times a week depending on my schedule. The food is always fresh (even via delivery, and I live in Logan Square these days!), the people are incredibly friendly, and the prices are very reasonable especially considering the serving sizes and quality. Speaking of the serving sizes, most of the platters (chicken doner is my go-to) can easily make 2-3 hearty meals, and keep very well. The salads are also huge, and delicious. I am partial towards the kale and the Turkish feta, but they&apos;re all good. Add meat if that&apos;s your thing. 

Oh, and the bread. Get the bread. It is fresh, usually still warm, and amazing. Their desserts are solid too, especially if you&apos;re a rice pudding fan. Now that I type this, I&apos;m wondering why I didn&apos;t order rice pudding tonight....

Anyways, you can&apos;t go wrong here. Look at the menu, find something that sounds good to you in the moment,  go with it, and thank me later."
2,"Overcooked Adana and dry kofte kabob...

This place is okay foe Turkish, much better off at Pera, cafe Istanbul or Turquoise...

The meat was a bit over cooked and too try...having lived in Istanbul for two years this place was definitely overrated and way overpriced ...

We ordered a kofte, Adana, cig kofte and salad the bill was $70...seriously too expensive for subpar food"
5,"Killer place: great food, large portion, nice staff, good price. They often throw in a little something too. I&apos;ve had a few gyro places in Chicago, even highly rated ones, and my disappointment was unresolved until going to Zizi&apos;s. 

The beef gyro sandwich, wrap, and fries are amazing. The former is so big that even my constantly overconsuming American ass can&apos;t finish it in one sitting."
5,"Let me start this by saying that I have been eating Mediterranean food since I was a little baby. This is THE BEST I have EVER had. I&apos;m a lentil soup SNOB and this red lentil is not only the best lentil soup I&apos;ve ever had, but the best SOUP I&apos;ve ever had. I can tell that this is a family business that takes great pride in their business and it shows in their food. 10/10, A+, literally amazing amazing food. The dolma is amazing, the chicken platter is amazing (my boyfriend LOVES it). Just amazing job. Thank you!! Will be addicted to this soup for years now."
5,The BEST Mediterranean food!! Zizi&apos;s has high quality food with safe quality indoor dining. We were given a dessert on the house as it was my first time coming here. The staff is friendly and very quick to serve. I highly recommend!
5,I ordered a falafel sandwich with fresh cut fries they were amazing!! I forgot to mention I always order this EVERYTIME !!!! Yum Yum!!
5,"Excellent place. Ate here sitting out due to the &apos;rona times. 
Menu is simple and easy to get through. 
Had the chicken kabab and the Turkish flat bread with toppings called lahmacun. 
Excellent and flavorful. Also had a salad. 
3 dishes came to approx 40 USD 
Very much a mom (polish) + pop (Turkish) and kids store. 
The free bread was excellent and so was the carrot dip. 
Great value for money 
Would return and I strongly recommend!"
4,"Overall: Arguably the best Turkish food in the area, with great prices to go with it.

The good: We started off with the lahmacun, which was thin, crisp, and flavorful. I&apos;d never had one before and, paired with the amazing and complimentary bread, was a great start to the meal. The bread was warm and soft, I had to contain myself to not eat more. The service was friendly, they have outdoor seating (though the inside&apos;s atmosphere is a nice touch), anad it&apos;s BYOB. Oh, and the prices are right.

The not-so-good: The Adana (lamb) wrap was great but didn&apos;t blow me away, nor did the fries. They were still great, but nothing out of this world.

Food: 8.5/10
Atmosphere: 8.5/10
Service: 8.5/10"
5,"We ordered doner kebab (gyros) platters. Everything tasted so good. We will be coming back here, again and again."
5,"Ordered the chicken doner kebab plate for takeout and a side of dolmas.
Every bit of it was delicious and one plate lasts me three meals! The chicken was perfect but best part is the buttery rice it comes with. I could eat this forever."
5,"Amazing authentic Turkish halal restaurant. I loved the pies. They have great variety of options.
I would love to come back again"
5,"Zizi&apos;s is such a delight. They have an amazing menu and a cozy atmosphere that makes you feel at home. But if that doesn&apos;t pull you in immediately, the complimentary crispy bread and carrot spread will. 

The first time I came here, my friend and I shared the falafel wrap (which comes with really great fries) and arugula caprese salad. The falafel is wonderful and its texture is on the creamier side. I wasn&apos;t expecting to love the arugula salad as much as I did, because it seemed fairly simple, but they managed to make it taste exceptionally good. I had never tried ratatouille before coming to Zizi&apos;s, but I was intrigued by the Pide with Eggplant Ratatouille so I ordered it the next time I visited -- it was delicious and light, wrapped in thin dough and served pre-sliced so it was easy to share. Zizi&apos;s is BYOB, and needless to say, everything pairs wonderfully with a bottle of wine.

The service is always great and I feel happy just thinking about the food here. Can&apos;t recommend it enough!"
5,"I love this place. It&apos;s easy, delicious and the price is always good. We&apos;ve only eaten in once a few years ago but otherwise it&apos;s all take out. And everything stays fresh. I highly recommend the platter with all of the dips. It&apos;s seriously it&apos;s own meal!"
4,"Zizi&apos;s is a nice little spot for Turkish cuisine. The owner is very friendly and attentive. They have good selection of different dishes. Sultan platter looked great, however they didn&apos;t ask how well we wanted our meat and it ended up being a little dry."
5,"This is going to be my new favorite, after-work snack pick-up spot. I ordered the cheese pide, just because I wanted something small and chill. I got a solid meal and evening snack out of my one order! It was so tasty and something new for me. I look forward to trying other items off of their menu. I ordered takeout because, again pandemic living, and it was easy, smooth, and early. Can&apos;t wait to try more and support local businesses during this wild time!"
5,"Couldn&apos;t love this place more. Fresh, delicious food, friendly service and a great little outdoor patio. An awesome family run Chicago business!"
5,"This place is open and delivering, they are family owned and their dishes are great ... The trifecta of food!  Their moussaka keeps me coming back. 
Don&apos;t cook dinner tonight, call them directly and order in!!"
4,"One of my favorite places for iskandar kabob. The tomato sauce that they pour over the lamb doner is super tasty. I&apos;m writing this review specially after ordering take out and it was just as good! The quality of the food was the same and the portion size was massive! My two year old really enjoyed the sujuk pide, it was pure cheesy goodness."
