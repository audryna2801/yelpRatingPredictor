5,"I&apos;ve been trying to come try this place out for a while now, but they&apos;ve seen to always run out of bread every time I tried. So my biggest tip is to order ahead and order ahead early, because they will run out! And don&apos;t let them tell you that it&apos;s going to take 30 minutes for your order to be complete, because I arrived in half the time and the order was ready for pick up! 

We ordered their &quot;spicy&quot;, &quot;italian&quot; and their &quot;Mr. G&quot; I&apos;m a big Italian sub guy, but I didn&apos;t really care for neither the &quot;Italian, nor their &quot;spicy&quot;. They were good, but nothing special. 

The Mr. G though, was truly something special. It came with sharp imported provolone, hot sopressata, prosciutto di parma, volpi Genoa salami, ruffle mustard balsamic vinaigrette, artichoke, fresh basil, lettuce w/ red wine vinegar and oregano. All of that for $9.95. Yes it&apos;s pricey for a sub but worth every damn penny. The bread was nice a soft, but did seem like a little too much bread and not enough of the other stuff in between but it every bite was still very damn delicious. I know longer feel like I have to go to Italy, since my mouth experienced a tour of Italy with each bite I took. All the ingredients work perfectly together to make this very flavorful sandwich. I&apos;ll definitely be returning very soon!"
5,"The subs were really tasty. Ordered the Italian, spicy, and turkey sub. Also picked up some mild and hot Giardiniera to go. I did the order online; for pick up before I went. There is a window for pick up and ordering. I loved the red roasted pepper on the turkey sub. Gave it an extra kick. I preferred the spicy over the Italian. Both were excellent. The staff was very friendly and appreciative of my business which I liked! This was my first time to JP Graziano&apos;s and I&apos;m sure not my last."
5,"Yum!! I got the most delicious turkey sandwich from here yesterday and now all I can think of is that I want to go there whenever I have a craving for a sub. They are currently offering takeout, but there&apos;s a park nearby in West Loop that would definitely make a great spot for a picnic. 

The servings here are very big, but the sandwiches are so good I finished both easily. My favorite part of the turkey sandwich I ordered was the bread. You could tell how fresh it was and struck the perfect combination of crunchy and doughy. The inside struck a nice balance of turkey, cheese, lettuce, tomato and mayo so that they all balanced each other nicely. The turkey was hearty and not dried out like other sliced turkey I&apos;ve had at other places. 

I really enjoyed this because I managed to eat so much without feeling gross afterward. This will definitely be my new go-to sandwich/sub shop!"
5,"In terms of Italian subs, this is the best in Chicago. Bari takes second place after visiting this place!

Food is fresh and every aspect of the sandwich is high quality. 

Don&apos;t forget to add some hot giardiniera!"
5,"I&apos;m disappointed in myself for not having completed this review before. 

I found out about JP&apos;s from Barstool Dog Walk, a great locally based podcast.

The sandwiches here have always been amazing. I&apos;ve had just about every one of them on the menu and they all have their own different taste. 

I highly recommend the veggie, mr. G and the American. You can add or subtract items as you see fit, but I suggest adding the hot giardiniera. 

An underrated item on the menu is the soup and focaccia. Regardless of the soup, it will always pairs well with the cheesy focaccia bread.

When you go here, you should expect to be treated like family. Jim, his family and the employees here are always so kind and welcoming. I can&apos;t say enough about the service.

Can&apos;t wait to go back soon!"
2,"This place gets so much publicity that you think that they could put a few more slices of their excellent meats and cheeses to make an Italian sub taste like an Italian sub and not a veggie sub. Yes you can pay an extra buck or two for more of each but when they charge ten dollars for most subs you&apos;d think they could just make it right from the start. 
There are dozens of sub joints in Chicagoland that provide better value and fillings than here. Think Vinnies, Bari&apos;s, Al &amp; Joe&apos;s, Frankies Deli, Fontano&apos;s, Leno&apos;s, The Original Hoagie Hut, Tony&apos;s, Scudiero&apos;s, Capri, etc., etc."
5,"One of the original gems of Randolph St.  These people are doing the lord&apos;s work here.

Fresh bread, quality ingredients, generous sandwich sizes.

Pro-tip: Get the muffuletta if it&apos;s on the menu.  A little different from a traditional NoLa version - JP uses mild giardiniera spread instead of olive salad/relish - but equally tasty.

I&apos;ll also sing the praises of the Italian and the Spicy, and even simple sandwiches like the Prosciutto or the Porchetta are flavorful and satisfying.

Super-friendly crew here too."
5,"Absolutely top-notch. We love to get subs from here at least once a week at work. I get the Spicy with hot giard &amp; it&apos;s just fantastic. Good bread, good meats, quality all the way through!"
5,"They have the best Italian sandwiches here. It&apos;s worth exacerbating my TMJ for them. I always either get the Mr. G or the Tuna. Pro tip for the Mr. G is to add porchetta. The tuna is made to order, and I always do easy mayo and mild giardinara. The giard is bomb. I have zero pictures because I always end up devouring the sandwich right when I get it."
5,"I&apos;ve been grabbing a quick sandwich at J.P. Graziano Grocery for years, long before the neighborhood became so trendy. 

Rustic and cozy, this little shop offers a lot. In addition to super sandwiches, you can pick up things from the market. 

My sandwiches are always prepared with tons of fresh ingredients. The lettuce crisp and the tomatoes juicy. Meats and cheeses are always fresh and plentiful. I think crunchy yet chewy bread make sandwich perfection. A sandwich wrapped in paper tells the whole story. 

The guys at the counter are always super friendly. I can&apos;t wait to go back soon!"
3,Had the Mr. G and it was good but I thought the bread was a bit tough. Just not for me. The service was great though with some good recommendations.
5,We picked up sandwiches to take to a nearby park to eat with friends. Three of the four ordered the Mr G with fourth getting the Italian. We all really liked our sandwich. Order early as they are very busy and might run out of bread later in the afternoon.
5,"Came here during the times of social distancing, so we ordered ahead online and waited outside for it to be ready. Took about an hour total. Worth it! First time trying The Spicy and I loved it-wish it was a little more spicy or had giardineria on it, but that said still a great sandwich for the price. My boyfriend had the Italian and I loved his too. Would definitely come back and highly recommend"
5,"Open for carry-out during the pandemic! I was very excited to hear that they were opening back up just last week. It jumped straight to the top of my &quot;COIVD-19 Take Out&quot; list. We ordered the Mr. G (of course), a muffuletta and a cannoli. The Mr. G still is my favorite sandwich to get. Super tasty and so many quality ingredients in between their crusty and chewy bread. The muffuletta is slathered with their tasty spread and the sesame seed bun really comes through. Usually, I eat only half of a sandwich in one sitting. But I guess if you are starving to death, you can probably make it through both halves. And their freshly filled cannoli is the perfect way to finish a meal."
4,Very good classic Italian subs. This place is legendary and has a cult following. The family still owns and operates this gem and takes pride in treating each customer with top notch service. If you&apos;re craving an Italian sub this is an excellent option.
5,"Absolutely blown away by this spot! It was mine and the husbands first time in, and a random stop when burgers were too far of a walk in the cold  
The price was great for the sandwiches packed with fresh ingredients, the meat so flavorful and the bread a great thickness. I love the casual order setup, and didn&apos;t feel rushed to order. Definitely will be back to try more sandwiches, especially their special. 

They also have a deli with cheeses, meats, and olives. We went home with a half pound of the castelvetrano olives and are almost done with them after a couple days, so good! The cashier was also really friendly and said it was her family&apos;s business. Love supporting places like this, family-run and welcoming to everyone who walks in."
5,"Came here upon a recommendation of a friend and I&apos;m pleased that I did! I&apos;ll be back for sure. 

Seems like the place is a real Chicago treasure since majority of the people that walk through the door seem like they&apos;ve been there before a dozen times. The owner helped us with our orders and greeted everyone through the door. 

I had the Tulfano&apos;s Antipasto and my boyfriend had the Mr. G and we shared. Personally the antipasto was a little tooo sour for my taste with the pickled peppers and artichoke and I liked the Mr. G better, but my boyfriend actually liked my antipasto better! Go figure. Quality ingredients in the subs though and exactly what I was craving that day."
5,"Ordered delivery from here the other day. Scheduled delivery for 12:25pm and it came literally on the dot. This was a great start. Now, to the food... we ordered Mr. G, Muffuletta, Mozzarella/Tomato Caprese as well as the cannoli. The subs were amazing. You could tell they used high-quality ingredients and everything was super fresh. The cannolis were also very good. I would definitely order from here again."
5,"For this type of sandwich (italian style cold cuts), J.P. Graziano is excellent, and they have a lot of very tough competition. Overall, I would rank them the best in the area, and that is saying something because the West Loop/West Town has some REALLY good sandwich places. Specifically, their sandwich bread is top notch, not that the rest of the sandwich isn&apos;t fantastic, but the bread (in my opinion) is the best part."
4,"Was visiting the West Loop for lunch today and decided to try this place out, it was highly recommended.

I went with the veggie sandwich and it was great.  I wish I would have asked for a side of hot giardinara and some salt, the flavors were excellent and fresh, I just like a little heat and salt.

My boss and a client split their Muffaletta and Mr. G subs.  We were all very happy with our selections.

The line was out the door almost all of the lunch hour and there is very limited seating."
