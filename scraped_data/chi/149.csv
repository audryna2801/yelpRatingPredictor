5,"I have to first thank Eddie V&apos;s for the best Sweetest Day dinner! Everything was great! The food, ambience, servers and host, and certainly the heed to COVID precautions! 

We decided on Eddie V&apos;s after missing our reservation at another restaurant. Thank God we did! 

We ordered the Kung Pao calamari for an appetizer, I apprehensive at first because I&apos;m not a fan of nuts in my food but it was so flavorful and cooked perfectly. We cleaned the plate...lol even eating all the garnish! 

It was four in our party and three of us ordered steak. ALL of us were delighted with the steak, me and my husband ordered medium while my friend ordered well done ( I know I know, smh) but each was was cooked perfectly. My other friend got salmon which she enjoyed! We then shared sides, each side feeds 2-3 people. We got the spinach, au gratin potatoes and Brussels spots, all very tasty.

Lastly I can&apos;t forget about the drinks! My Red Dragon cocktail was excellent!  I had to get 2..lol

Although pricey. It was definitely worth it, it was by far one of the best meals I had Chicago!"
5,"Okay, WOW!! I may never cook Thanksgiving Dinner again!! They menu at Eddie V&apos;s was spectacular! Even the dressing was outstanding, and I&apos;m VERY picky about dressing!! The grilled asparagus was seasoned to perfection and the portions were just right! OH, and the pumpkin pie was a huge hit!! The whole experience from ordering to pickup was superb!! FIVE STARS!! Thank you Makelle and the whole team for saving my small pandemic Thanksgiving dinner party!! It was DELICIOUS!!"
4,"This visit was in May of 2019.  

We had been looking forward to eating at this restaurant for a long time, have only heard great things about it.

We went here for brunch.  The food was excellent, and the service was as well.

My favorite was the steak and eggs and the deviled eggs.

However, we were seated in a booth in the bar section.  It was the second booth from the back wall.  

The middle of the seat in the booth was all torn up.  This is not a small tear, it is a large tear, at least 1 foot long and the entire width of the seat cushion.  This is also not a new tear, it obviously has been there for a long time.

Thankfully, the dress I was wearing was of a durable fabric.  Someone wearing an outfit made out of a delicate fabric might have their clothing ruined.  This should be repaired asap.

Our reservation was at 12:30pm.  At around 1:00pm one of my guests went to the men&apos;s bathroom.  The garbage can under the sink was overflowing and there was a pile of paper towels on the floor.  Two of the towel dispensers were empty.

Both of these items left a bad impression on us in an otherwise excellent experience."
5,"Initially when the four of us came in we were seated by the bathroom. We asked to be seated elsewhere and were graciously accommodated. Matt was an awesome waiter. Very witty and responsive. Knew all there was to know about the menu. He never made us feel rushed. Food was superb from the oyster apps to the calamari. Our steaks, scallops and fish were all cooked perfectly."
5,"I went here for the first time for a late Valentine&apos;s Day celebration and it was amazing. We started with the crab cake appetizer and all the reviews about this were spot on, it was so fresh and delicious. For our entrees and sides we tried the Parmesan sole, New York strip, truffle Mac n cheese and lobster mashed potatoes. I hardly have words to describe it all as it was beyond phenomenal; needless to say we had to eat every last bite. The atmosphere was sophisticated and the music was fitting, not too loud. The service was fabulous and overall we had a wonderful experience."
5,"We sat at the bar for a drink before dinner. Bartender was short and kinda rude but it was extremely busy for restaurant week. My husband and I found the music too be too loud, not to mention not the best musician.
They should take note to Trulucks on this.

We were sat with Ali who truly made our dining experience exceptional! 
We had the restaurant week special which was phenomenal! The shrimp appetizer offered was amaaazzzinggg!! 

We didn&apos;t care for desserts oh the menu and my husband is allergic to bananas.  I asked Ali if she could swap out our desserts for the s&apos;mores dessert and she gladly made it happen! 

The s&apos;mores dessert is a 12/10! Seriously I&apos;d come here for this dessert alone! 

Also, don&apos;t skip out on bread! The sourdough is served warm and crunchy on the outside with a soft inside.

Thanks Ali for the amazing service! We can&apos;t wait to come back and have you as our server !"
4,"This place gets 4 stars for the vibe alone. The food, compared to Joes, I would pick Joes. I just wasn&apos;t satisfied with it. I give this place 4 starts mostly due to the drinks. They are good and would come back just for the drinks alone."
4,"Had a really good social distanced restaurant! I loved the steak, stuffed shrimp and grilled halibut. The ambiance was great and their choice of Riesling was amazing!"
3,I wanted to love this place but sadly I didn&apos;t. The ambience and the service was amazing. I studied the menu for a couple weeks and was most excited about ordering the lobster tacos. They were underwhelming. Most disappointing was the steak. It had a flavor like it had been sitting out too long before cooking. The crab cake was good and the crab legs were crab legs. The saut√©ed spinach was great. I wouldn&apos;t say I would never go again. But I&apos;m convinced this was a Covid casualty. Will try again in the future. Oh... the martinis were excellent!
5,"This Resturant was an absolutely amazing experience. The lobster tacos, fillet mignon, lobster fried rice, and bananas foster were all 10/10. Our server/bartender Margo was a pleasure and she makes the best dirty martini and 24 karat. You won&apos;t regret this gem of a restaurant!"
5,"Not a whole lot to say here. Came here on a recommendation from our Lyft driver. Good choice. 

Straight from walking in the door. Pleasantly greeted by several people. Reservations not needed but definitely recommended. Especially on a weekend. We came during the week. Walked right in. But didn&apos;t have premier seating to say the least. Coat check is available. Which is very nice and rare....at least in Cali. 

Quickly seated and greeted by our waitress. Drinks did not come out super fast. But presentation was exquisite, divine, and the drinks were PERFECT. Not just delicious. But the actual &quot;pour&quot; itself for our martinis was too the rim. Nice presentation and tasted delicious. 

Before I forgot, we sat in the lounge. Which was nice. Live jazz music playing. Not overbearing. You can still have a conversation. 

The food came out perfectly timed after our appetizers. Same as the drinks. Very nice presentation. A lot of flavor. Hot. And tasted delicious. Our steaks were cooked perfectly. No Ruth Chris, where the steaks come out SIZZLING. But still damn good. 

We didn&apos;t get a chance to order desert: cuz we were on the food. But I heard it was spectacular ! As far as pricing....yes, this place is expensive.
But you get what you paid for. Good service,
GREAT food, nice ambiance, etc...the value is there. Enjoy."
4,"Living in Chicago, we usually don&apos;t gravitate towards national chains for steak and seafood because of all the unique options that exist here. However, I have to say, Eddie V&apos;s is and has always been an incredibly solid option for dining. I don&apos;t think I have been disappointed even once coming here in terms of food. They have one of the best (and freshest) crab cakes in the city. Their steaks are always perfectly cooked and seasoned. However, my absolute favorite dish here is their Chilean Sea Bass. It&apos;s so light and flaky. I could easily have it every day.

If you&apos;re wanting to try this place, I would recommend checking it out during Chicago Restaurant Week. You can get a 3 course meal for $48! 

My reasoning for 4 stars vs 5 unfortunately is related to the service. While our server was really nice, everything just took forever! We got the Amuse bouche well before our wine. Our crab cake literally took almost 30 minutes. We ordered our second drink by the time that arrived. I am hoping this is a one off experience."
5,"On Friday evening me and my friend had an amazing dinner experience at Eddie V&apos;s. For both of us it was first time dinning there. Our server, Brandon did a great job (especially with presentation of our desert drink), he was knowledgeable, friendly and helpful. We started our course with Tuna Tartar appetizer paired with NV Venue Cliquot. Since my friend is vegetarian our menu choices differed until desert. Both her and mine salads were delicious (Burata &amp; Beet; Warm Goat Cheese) that was paired with 2017 DuMOL Chardonnay (very buttery). As my main entree I enjoyed Chilean Sea Bass and gf had Eddie V&apos;s Shiitake Fried Rice (I highly recommend to try it with any fish dish on the menu!) paired with 2017 Siduri Pino Noir (great choice for flavorful dishes). As a sides for table we had grilled asparagus and Truffled Mac&amp;Cheese. You might not believe, but we had a room for desert thanks to our servers patience (we definitely took our time to enjoy every course) (Hot Chocolate Godiva cake served with ice cream -- to die for!) paired with my highlight of the night XO Envy (Remy Martin XO cognac, Angels Envy Bourbon, 10 year Towny Port &amp; Black walnut bitters). I had to have another one of those after dinner.    
Great atmosphere, delicious food, professional and friendly stuff!"
3,"Came here for a business dinner we had reservations on a Friday night but since we were a party of seven we waited in the bar until they all arrived. We were placed at a nice round table at the back of the restaurant. The ambiance and vibe I did not care for at all. It is very dimly lite. In fact in comparison I don&apos;t think I have eaten in a place so dark unless it was a movie theater.

We started with a seafood tower that was ginormous but there was something for everyone and plenty of it. I concentrated on the Alaskan King crab legs they were terrific. Not really in the mood for my usual cocktail and frankly I probably could even see the menu to read it. 

Such a large group we had to share some desserts. One of them was a banana foster butter cake. They were not special at all nor memorable. If I ever get invited here again I will definitely pass."
2,"While I&apos;ve previously raved about the food &amp; my experiences at my &apos;at one time FAVE&apos; restaurant, I was utterly disappointed on my recent visit, 8/29. Came for my sister&apos;s 55th birthday, I ordered the crab stuffed shrimp, sauteed spinach &amp; au gratin potatoes. The Potatoes were undercooked &amp; the shrimp was overcooked!! Sent it back &amp; they STILL  bought it back out OVERCOOKED!! They also charged me for a glass of wine that I sent back and they charged me $18 for half a dozen oysters &amp; another $24 to have them prepared Rockefeller Style. When I pointed this out to the server &amp; asked to speak w/the manager, he came back w/the adjusted bill &amp; the manager never came to my table to acknowledge &amp; apologize for the error. Long story short, I won&apos;t be back, I&apos;m so over Eddie V&apos;s-"
5,I rarely give 5 stars but this restaurant really blew my mind. So when I booked the reservation they asked if it was a special occasion and it was (my anniversary). When we arrived they decorated the table for us which really made it feel special and personalized. They had a handwritten card wishing us a happy anniversary and little heart confettis all over the tablecloth. They even gave us this amazing dessert for free! But even besides these little touches the dinner was amazing! I got the salmon and my boyfriend got the sea bass. Both were delicious but my favorite was the truffled Mac and cheese. Sooo creamy!! The waitress was very personable and friendly and so was the rest of the staff. The hostess even wished us a happy anniversary More than once. I highly recommend this restaurant!!
5,"We come here quite a bit but we have never had such an incredible and positive experience like we did this time. The manager, Mikal, and bartenders Margo and Matthew made our experience exceptional. We highly recommend Eddie V&apos;s -Chicago and can&apos;t wait to come back again."
5,Down here for my birthday and everything was great !! Awesome atmosphere was kinda quite...but food was great.
5,"Rarely do I give 5 out of 5 stars but I have to say how impressed I was with Eddie V&apos;s. I went for the first time last night with one of my friends and the food/drinks were amazing. We started with their &apos;Red Dragon&apos; drink. I don&apos;t drink often but I would definitely recommend this. For appetizers, we ordered the kung pao calamari, asparagus &amp; crab cakes to share. I really enjoyed the calamari. Fresh and delicious. My entree was the bone-in ribeye cooked medium well. It was perfectly prepared. 
The service was also superb. Our server was very helpful &amp; pleasant. Looking forward to patronizing this restaurant again."
5,"The Mrs. and I were spending our Christmas weekend downtown.  On the way down, our daughter told us of this place so we decided to cancel our current reservations and check out Eddie V&apos;s.

The atmosphere was posh, cozy and staff was friendly and attentive. 
My wife ordered the Twin Lobster Tail and I had the Surf and Turf.  My wife said that that was the best lobster she&apos;s ever had and the Surf and Turf was very good as well.  I thought that the little bit of spice they added to the Lobster kinda diminished the flavor of the lobster itself.

The wine was pretty good, actually don&apos;t remember what it was although I don&apos;t rate the wines usually because the restaurants don&apos;t make the wine.

This will definitely be a repeat next year for out annual Christmas weekend.."
