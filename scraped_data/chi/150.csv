5,"A friend and I came recently came here for brunch on a weekend. S.K.Y. was one of the restaurants with reservations that with open ventilation etc. They opened some of their window panels that ran almost floor to ceiling for extra air flow. And they offer space heaters for your table if it gets chilly. At the time, they were open for indoor dining via reservation only. The situation may have changed since then.

When we were there, we had the entire place to ourselves which was kind of nice. Staff were masked and tables were spaced out. They had extra hand sanitizer in the restrooms and laminated instructions to use a paper towel to open the doors. I felt safe and it seemed like they took covid19 protocols seriously. Masks were worn when our server approached our table. And now moving on to the food &amp; experience.

This was my first time and it was highly anticipated; I&apos;ve always seen it driving by on 18th. Since I arrived first, I ordered a coffee to warm up, served in heavy ceramic mug with the cutest container of cream. When my friend arrived we immediately went into catch up mode and gabbed over drinks.

It felt like years since we last saw each other, and we had to remind ourselves to browse the menu and order so that we can eventually eat too.

We shared all the dishes. Here is what we ordered:
+Matcha Bombilinis
+Smoked Salmon Rillette Bagel
+Garlic Beef Noodles

The food was delicious. To be honest, it feels strange writing a Yelp review that&apos;s not for a take-out order. And yet, despite the visible and invisible impacts of covid19, a friend and I have found a tiny slice of joy and normalcy. I loved the food and all the extra touches, details, and flavors. S.K.Y. is an awesome place for modern &amp; contemporary cuisine.  If you&apos;re opting to stay home, check out their prepared meal kits and cook-at-home kits!"
5,"Arguably one of the best dinners paired with service I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing in Chicago.  Went here right before the COVID lockdown on restaurants (again).  The food was phenomenal, the service was pretty good (a bit on the slower side, but SUPER friendly).  

From the apps to dessert, I don&apos;t have yet one complaint. I definitely plan on visiting S.K.Y. again and I definitely recommend you to go try it! Invite ya friends, fam, etc for an experience you won&apos;t regret.  

The prices match the quality in my opinion.
Street parking was quite easy, however not free on 18th, expect to spend about $6.

I Almost forgot about the COCKTAILS! So, so good. Get one! The wine selection is good too. 

I hope my pics attached do some justice.

10/10."
5,"I really enjoyed their 3 course meal offering.  The portion size was actually larger than I thought I would get, so it was more than enough food.  Everything was good but a little rich in flavor and heavier than I thought it would be.  I ordered the cauliflower salad, cod and potatoes.  The patio enclosed area was nice and comfortable and we definitely were not cold at all.  It was a very enjoyable dinner and I&apos;m glad they had seating available during this pandemic."
4,"Everything here was so so good. We got the truffle croquettes to start and they were delicious! Loved every bite of it. Incredibly crispy on the outside and creamy and flavorful on the inside. The truffle wasn&apos;t super overpowering which I was a little afraid about prior to ordering, but it was the perfect amount in every bite. 

For entrees we got the prime beef short rib and the Mediterranean sea bass. Two very different dishes but both very good. The short rib was packed full of flavor. It was coated in peppercorn and served with Asian pear and long beans. Super savory and very much has an Asian flair to it. The sea bass was much lighter, served with a lemon garlic jus over a bed of spinach. I actually liked this dish better because I was able to taste more of the inherent flavor of the fish. And I&apos;m also a sucker for spinach (literally don&apos;t know why). The fish was also so tender. 

Everyone was super friendly and it was a great ambiance. Lights were dim, music was not overly loud. Great spot if you&apos;re looking for a date night place!"
5,"S.K.Y. is one of my favorite restaurants in the city. It is an outstanding meal every single time! The lobster dumplings are to die for. 

During quarantine they had the best and very reasonably priced take home dinner menus. I tried a lot of different restaurants and this was far and above the rest. Somehow the food was still warm when you got home and tasted as good as at the restaurant. 

When restaurants had opened back up it was one of the first places I went. The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable and the food is out of this world. Every dish I have gotten there is delicious. It is so consistent even with a changing menu. I can&apos;t say enough good things about this place. 

The pastry chef is also phenomenal. The chocolate chip cookies are insanely good and I am an avid connoisseur of chocolate chip cookies. Run, don&apos;t walk here!"
5,"I was a tad bit hesitant coming here for a celebratory dinner due to the pandemic and some mixed reviews from friends but WOW was I impressed by the food and service at S.K.Y.

First off, S.K.Y&apos;s safety policies for sanitation and social distancing were by far the most transparent and well-managed out of all restaurants I&apos;ve been to since March. We received a bottle of hand sanitizer just for our table, our server informed us before the meal that plates would not be replaced to minimize contact, menus were contactless, and there was even a foot door handle in case we didn&apos;t want to touch the handle with our hands. The restaurant wasn&apos;t totally empty but patrons were seated very far from each other.

For drinks, we got the private jet and burning budd (highly recommend). Each had its own unique taste and was decently strong. Between two people, we shared five dishes which ended up being just the right amount of food: cornbread madeleines, Maine lobster dumplings, organic fried chicken, foie gras bibimbap, and cheesecake brûlée. I can&apos;t begin to describe how delicious each dish was--they were balanced in flavor and texture, and evoked memories of familiar home-y dishes with an interesting twist. The cornbread and dumplings were our winners. The only dish I didn&apos;t like as much was the cheesecake, which had a harder texture (think ice cream cake) than I would have enjoyed.

The atmosphere and service were just wonderful as well, and I will definitely come back again!"
5,"My favorite restaurant in Chicago by far. The ambiance, service and food is impeccable always. I&apos;ve been here a handful of times and leave blown away each and every time. I ordered the burrata, shrimp dumplings, miso cod and the truffle ice cream/meringue dessert (OMG, OUT IF THIS WORLD) the last time I visited. The desserts are a must here! 

Must-orders are their lobster dumplings, cornbread, cucumbers, any dessert and you really can&apos;t go wrong with the main entrees either."
5,"Debuted in Pilsen late-2017, S.K.Y. is Chef Stephen Gillanders&apos; first solo project, a decade with Jean-Georges Vongrichten plus two years at LEYE&apos;s &quot;Intro&quot; developing a diverse skill-set that sees Gillanders exploring global influences that feel both familiar and distinctive at the same time.

Boasting the initials of wife Seon Kyung Yuk, her vision responsible for a modern space housed inside a building constructed during the 19th Century, guests visiting S.K.Y. amidst the global pandemic will find tables sparsely filled and service especially accommodating with a bevy of safety precautions in place.

Seated after a quick temperature check, high-tops in the bar perfect for singles as TV On The Radio played overhead, it was after perusing a QR Code menu that the night&apos;s special was suggested, Salt Cod pureed with silky-soft Potatoes alongside housemade Fry Bread and Jalapeno Peppers a perfect example of Gillanders&apos; intent to &quot;prepare familiar Ingredients in a modern, innovative way.&quot;

Born in Los Angeles, but Asian-inflected across much of S.K.Y.&apos;s menu, dish two saw the kitchen fuse France with the American South by way of Cornbread Madelines, undoubtedly a far-cry from Proust&apos;s ideal but nonetheless delectable while signature Lobster Dumplings offered thin-yet-sturdy Gyoza packed with Meat afloat in Butter primed with Yuzu, Chervil, Chiles and Mint.

Told the Fried Chicken was something special, but reluctant to pass on Chef Gillanders&apos; Bibimbap, it would need to be a World-class piece of Poultry to compete with roasted Duck Liver atop Mushrooms, Scallions, Nori and blackened Chinese Broccoli - not to mention housemade Gochujang that added heat and umami to bowl-crisped Rice beneath.

Not stopping here, though the aforementioned plates would be a good amount of Food for most couples, it was on the server&apos;s suggestion that a &quot;baby&quot; Banana Budino arrived alongside S.K.Y.&apos;s recently-added Mille-Fuille, the former a worthy signature from Pastry Chef Tatum Sinclair with hints of Bananas Foster while the latter rivaled any in France - including Jacques Genin and Alain Passard - in terms of taste and texture."
5,"Fantastic Brunch!   We are so glad you are open again for brunch!  The service, food, atmosphere and experience was fantastic!    It was a true dining experience!"
4,"You know it&apos;s funny; and I&apos;ve mentioned this before, but there&apos;s certain places I like them so much, I don&apos;t want to share with Yelp - but that would be counterproductive, right? 

S.K.Y., really impressed me. Usually, I&apos;m hesitant about places with &quot;small plates&quot;, shared menus, family style, etc. It&apos;s not that I&apos;m selfish (I like sharing my food), but I want to make sure I&apos;m full. When I dine out, a minimum requirement is to get full. I mean, I&apos;m paying for it, correct? Most of the time, it&apos;s feast or famine at places with these styles of entrees - either you&apos;re going to get a lot of food, or you&apos;re going to get some cutesy small bites, and leave still hungry. Thankfully, the latter was not the case at S.K.Y.!

We dined for brunch, with what was sort of a Prix Fixe menu. 3 courses, with 4 choices per each course. Myself and a friend split most of these courses, along with trying other things the rest of the group ordered. We ordered:

1. Charred Broccolini - this was really good; good pairing of flavors with the Parmesan and the greenery of the broccolini.
2. Spicy Deviled Eggs - not bad, but I have a penchant for deviled eggs. I&apos;d suggest the BLT Bao or Garlic Beef Noodles. The Bacon &amp; Egg Fried Rice was OK, but only if you really want a rice.
3. Organic Fried Chicken - this was amazing. Get it. Thank me later. 

If you go with a group, coordinate so you can each try a little bit of everything. Not to mention, it&apos;s bring-your-own alcohol, which is always a plus in my book. All that for $28, you&apos;d be hard to find a similar situation for brunch in the area given the level/category of restaurant S.K.Y. is. 

The atmosphere was excellent. The decor was nice, but not too over-the-top. This would be a great date spot, or, like I did, brunch with friends. Here&apos;s a real tip, so listen closely:

Take a date here. Not first date, but 2nd or 3rd. See if you can snag a seat at the counter which faces the kitchen (pictured). If there&apos;s a wait for your reservation - don&apos;t fret. Sit at the bar west of the main entrance (also pictured) and have a drink while you wait. The key to great experiences, are to make it seem as if it was on a whim, even though it was carefully thought-out and planned. There. Free game for you Yelpers who&apos;ve made it this far in my review. 

4 stars. I had no qualms with my experience. The food was good, we brought our own drinks, and it was priced fairly. I&apos;d be interested to return for dinner, and will certainly bring friends here as one of my &quot;secret spots&quot; off the beaten path. Perhaps, my rating may increase the more I visit and explore. 

Thanks for listing to my Ted Talk."
5,"This Sunday was my first time at S.K.Y.  I went for brunch.  I wish I had adequate words to describe the amazing food that I tasted!  I had the roasted cauliflower salad, bacon and egg fried rice, and coconut pancakes.  I moved to Chicago from Spokane a year ago, I am so glad to find this brunch spot.  I feel like I have found something unique and flavorful experience on brunch without being tradition eggs and pancakes.  I was worried. I would not find a spot like this and was missing the amazing place I had in Spokane.  I am looking forward to trying their dinner menu."
5,Don&apos;t walk... RUN. The food here hits different. Like I didn&apos;t know I had certain taste buds until I gave it a whirl. Nice dinner vibe in there very nice place to go on a date or with an intimate group of friends. Get the empanadas and ceviche. Got a few other things can&apos;t remember but everything is amazing so.
5,"Service from the beginning was very good. We hadn&apos;t made a reservation and wanted a regular table so the they took a few minutes to &quot;move some things around&quot; and we got a table! Throughout the meal, servers were informative and on top of changing out our plates. The appetizers came out VERY fast.

I attached photos with captions of everything we ordered but I&apos;m not gonna critique all of them. To make it simple, I&apos;ll say you can&apos;t go wrong with the any of the items we ordered but my personal favorites were: lobster dumplings, seared diver scallops, pork chop katsu, and all the desserts. You should order hamachi sashimi or white ceviche or both.

My (minor) criticisms: If there&apos;s 5 of us and we order lobster dumplings not knowing we get 4 dumplings....shouldn&apos;t we be informed of that first? 
Also, NY steak was flavorful and tender but not juicy.

4,"So we went twice in 4 days so this will be 2 reviews in 1. First we did dinner for our anniversary mid week and it was so good we decided to book brunch that weekend.

Dinner: the lobster dumplings are solid and we also had the special seafood salad. It was a nice assortment of seafood with a light zesty dressing with a little arugula and avocado. Entrees we had the fried chicken and cod, again both solid. The chicken is boneless thighs with a creamed corn and habanero sauce that mesh well. The cod was cooked well and the summer squash cooked several ways was a nice compliment.  Dessert was awesome. The cheesecake brûlée was tasty but comes with passion fruit sorbet and a passion fruit variety on the side both are VERY tart, so balance in each bite is key.  BUT THE STAR OF THE NIGHT was the pavlova. The truffle ice cream with the toasted meringue, awesome concept.

Brunch: Brunch is a per person menu and a la carte options. We had 2 per persons... started with the charred broccolini and warm mushroom salad - I could have had a few of those and been fine.  The broccolini was done expertly and the mushrooms went very well with the mild goat cheese and pickled peppers (serranos I believe.) next was the deviled eggs - 3 per order, very tasty, and the garlic beef noodles.  The noodles were great with a nice chili broth and dehydrated chilies was a great second course. For entrees we had the hash and French toast. Both were great - I&apos;m not the biggest fan of the coating on their crispy potatoes but they&apos;re still good. I thought the French toast was awesome. It&apos;s served in a bowl, crisped on top, served with a caramel anglaise and whipped cream.  Very satisfying and just enough sweetness to not need dessert.

Maybe a touch pricey for the portions but it&apos;s Chicago. Highly recommend and is quickly joining our short list of go-tos."
5,"The whole dining experience at S.K.Y was amazing. Things that I tried that evening: Amuse Bouche, Hamachi Sashimi, Rohan Duck Confit, Organic Fried Chicken, Crispy Potatoes, Blue cheese and carrots, Foi Gras Bibimbap, Shrimp Ceviche dish, a couple cocktails and the desserts!! 

Highly recommend it and will definitely be back!!"
5,"S.K.Y. has an unpretentious, casual dining atmosphere with dishes worthy of Bib Gourmand or James Beard fame. With a cohesive fusion of local American favorites to pan-Asian specialties to French and Australian desserts to Italian and Spanish wines, I felt incredibly blissful trying the chef&apos;s playful creations derived from flavors found across the world. 

There was simply nothing amiss with anything we ordered: hamachi sashimi and black truffle croquettes as snacks, Maine lobster dumplings for appetizer, and the roasted Icelandic cod and grilled beef short rib for our main. For dessert, we had the pavlova and mille-feuille. If I had to pick favorites, the dumplings and cod were absolutely phenomenal. Their selection of wines are very well valued, and our Nebbiolo was good to the last drop. I&apos;m also a huge fan of their sour cherry wine as an after-dinner drink. 

I think the staff are amazing, the music selection had us vibing, and the menu had us so excited to return for more."
5,"I&apos;ve ordered plenty of takeout this year, and my recent order from S.K.Y. was by far the best takeout I&apos;ve had. One of my coworkers orders from S.K.Y. often and recommended the salmon or the fried chicken. I don&apos;t love salmon but was &quot;feeling healthy&quot; so I ordered the salmon as part of the $39 2-people dinner deal. Lucky for me, I am only 1-people so I got to enjoy all the food. The salmon had a really delicious black truffle crust and lemon sauce, and the fish was perfectly cooked. I also had the warm maitake mushroom salad and creamed corn which were delicious. Lastly, the lobster dumplings were rich and buttery. The food was nicely portioned and packaged. They offer in-restaurant or curbside pickup which is very convenient. I will definitely be back to try the fried chicken later this week!"
5,"Great restaurant. The service is very good and I liked the drinks. Cinderellas Slipper or whatever it was called was great and citrucy and herbal tasting. Very light and tasted like juice. Super dangerous. We did the tasting menu.

The black truffle croquette was delicious and warm on the inside. The salad accompanying the croquette was great too.

The white shrimp ceviche was very well done and tasted very fresh. Had just the right amount of acidity added to it.

We ordered the Maine lobster dumplings. They were delicious, full of lobster meat and with a pretty thin shell. They were served on some melted butter that was very good with the dumplings.

We also had the warm mushroom salad. The mushrooms were prepared to be a little crispy and with a great broth that was at the bottom of the plate.

Crispy seared salmon on a bed of potatoes was very delicious and the fish was very soft and cooked just right. The top was very crispy but that part was also very thin.

The grilled beef short rib was very tender and had an amazing glaze on top with ginger, pepper and garlic. Came topped with asian pear. 

The banana pudding and caramel ice cream was great."
5,"An absolutely exquisite experience. 

From before going to dinner here, I had a great experience with Matt, who manages reservations. He accommodated my ever-changing request for our reservation time, and once we arrived he was there, smiling and had saved us a seat at the chef&apos;s table just because ... lucky us!

It&apos;s rare that in a place of this caliber you get to witness the talent working relentlessly to put out the deliciousness that they do, plate after plate. Perhaps watching them work while we enjoyed the fruits of their labor made it even more enjoyable but every plate we had was exceptional.

Lauren, our server, was nice, friendly and you could tell she was proud of the menu. When asked for suggestions, she offered her opinion but it was clear that she felt every dish would be fantastic. 

My husband and I shared everything we had:
1. Amuse ouche of edamame
2. Hamachi
3. Black truffle croquettes
4. Lobster dumplings 
5. Branzino
6. Fried chicken
7. Chocolate whiskey pie

Delicate, mindfully crafted dishes, each packing their own stunning flavor it&apos;s hard to pick a favorite. I loved it all and want to go back for more.
 
As we left, to our surprise, Chef Stephen Gillanders popped over to say hello and we let him know we LOVED it. How nice of him, and his entire team to make our dinner so incredible.

Easily one of the best meals I&apos;ve had in Chicago. I&apos;ll be back!!!"
4,"Industrial chic decor, avant-garde fusion menu, but you knew that already so what&apos;s makes them standout other than the open kitchen occasionally cheering every time they deliver an order

I give them props for taking risk. You can see the effort and care into every dish, presented with great aplomb at the table. 

One needs a Yin to appreciate the Yang. Unfortunately all our entrees were overpowered with seasoning. They were the- foie gras bibimbap, lamb and pork belly and even the Salmon. I can taste the intensity of the  resulting flavors but it&apos;s not for me. My son did really like the lamb and pork belly though. 

The appetizers of duck confit and Lobster dumplings we&apos;re good. Considering the overall all experience pricing was fair. Maybe I was expecting too much since they in Chicago magazine top 50 restaurants.
