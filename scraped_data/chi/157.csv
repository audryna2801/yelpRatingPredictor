5,"This restaurant have been the most special for me since the time of my college years, then medical school and now during my residency application and externship while caring for my patients during COVID-19.

My waiter, Alan, was simply the kindness and most professional. He has been working here for over 10 years and became a new father this February, 2020. I had also recently became a new father this September, 2020. The whole Chicago, nation and the world is feeling the impact of the pandemic, and we all have to unite and love each other to pull through together.

All anyone who is a fan of Cafe Iberico or is new to it, please come and support them. Their menu and service have been adjusted for the safety and care for all their customers and their food is still simply the very best.

Please ask for their off menu item, the Grilled Octopus and Potato Fries. I could eat for eternity lol.

Their mixed meats paella was amazing and so were their chickpea salad and spicy potatoes.

I hope to get my residency here in Chicago and to continue being a customer here for at least another 20 years to come. Please come help to support our Chicago restaurants. Thank you and Stay Safe everyone"
4,"Not only is the paella delicious &amp; well-portioned, but it&apos;s totally affordable too! I ordered takeout from Uber Eats here after I got a craving for the famous Spanish dish. I ended up with the Paella Iberica which is the combo paella featuring seafood, beef &amp; chicken mixed in. Can I just say, YUM?!? And only $10! I&apos;ll be back here again and again for more paella that won&apos;t break the bank. I also need to try the tapas as they also look yummy af."
4,"Know this place over 7 years and it&apos;s a lovely place. The only reason for 4 stars is because unfortunately the portion size is less than before. Not sure because of the Covid, but I can&apos;t wait dine in there again!"
4,"A girlfriend of mine was having her bachelorette party here, and I was happy since I had never been!

I love tapas so you can try a variety of dishes and our party&apos;s table was covered with plates including flavorfulempanadas, queso, spicy potatoes and many pictures of Sangria.

Everyone at the table enjoyed it which is rare."
3,"It&apos;s a love/hate relationship, mostly because the food is really fabulous and table service is painstakingly slow and rude! The lowdown here is it is about as close as you can come in the downtown area for authentic Spanish Tapas, regional dishes of Spain, and a solid cafe bar bringing me back to fond memories!

Amongst my favorites include the grilled squid with a light lemon oil, stuffed dates, steamed mussels in marinara sauce... and who could go wrong with sharing a seafood paella? The vibe is very relaxed and casual, actually a little dungeon-ish with family crests linning the walls, the music overhead is all in Spanish, and a fair number of patrons can be overheard speaking Spanish as well. I seem to come at off hours or something as its never all that busy. 

Also I&apos;d highly recommend giving into desserts here. They are not too big but will surely satisfy your tastebuds for something sweet after a savory meal."
4,Wow what a filling meal! We had the patatas bravas and they delivered on the spicyness. The potatoes were perfectly made crispy on the and fully cooked and soft on the inside. The goat cheese was perfectly flavored and delicious. And the veggie paella was good but could have been spicier. We had an enjoyable experience all around.
4,"I came with a large group, and we had a great time at Cafe Iberico.

We ordered so many different dishes on the menu from mushrooms, calamari, spicy potatoes, skewered beef tenderloin, baked goat cheese, chicken and ham puffs, grilled squid, grilled shrimp, stuffed dates. We also got one of each dessert (we had a lot of people in our group!). So overall we had a lot of food. It wasn&apos;t the best or most flavorful tapas I&apos;ve had but the meal was tasty and filling overall. My favorite dishes were the mushrooms and the baked goat cheese. The deserts were all pretty good, but just a bit too sweet for my taste personally.

Overall, this casual spot is great for small and large groups who don&apos;t mind sharing dishes tapas style. The staff was very quick with service and friendly.  wouldn&apos;t necessarily come here just for the food, but it is a nice environment to have a good time with friends/family/coworkers."
2,"The first thing we noticed when we walked in was the very strong seafood/fish smell. No matter how much you might like their taste, the odor is certainly not as pleasant. 
We were seated promptly and offered water. Just a few minutes after we agreed to change tables as there was a large group coming in and we were seating at a needed table. 
We ended up ordering the Pulpo a la gallega and chicken (and some ham) croquettes. We wanted to try a couple of plates first before ordering anything else... but let&apos;s say that was all we ordered. 
While our order was being &quot;cooked&quot; we were given bread. The bread was fine but I personally like it with olive oil. We had oil at the table but I wanted some extra virgin olive oil and being at a Spanish restaurant I thought this was an easy request. 
When I asked our waiter for some olive oil he told me it was at the table. Was that olive oil? Maybe it was a blend... but for sure it was not evoo. So I left the bread for now. 
A few minutes after the food arrived. Damn... was that octopus &quot;cooked&quot; fast!
The octopus was served with potatoes, which is usual for that dish, and those were tender. Yet, the actual octopus was not a star. I do not think it was very fresh nor cooked to order. 
Then onto the croquettes, which we were told were made in house. They were just ok. Were they made with the classic bechamel sauce? Hmmm, don&apos;t know. Not much chicken nor ham. The accompanying sauce(mayo with some garlic) was yummy... and guess what? It was used for that bread previously mentioned! Lol
We could not drink at the moment and soon after we asked for the check and left. 
Maybe if you want to drink with friends etc this might be a spot you would consider but if it&apos;s a good meal what you are after you could give a try to another place close by. 
By the way:service was fine; friendly hostess at the front; place needs some care (chipped/broken tables etc) 
Not coming back"
1,"No 
Don&apos;t waste your time. 
Had the bartender try to bullshit a bullshitter. 
Went here to show our friend a carrajillo. Which is espresso and 43. Lit and served and usually over ice. 
This guy served it in an espresso shot glass and was adamant that they are only made with brandy. And crappy brandy at that.  I don&apos;t recommending chains but go to Fogo for the show. We taught them how to light the 43."
5,"Girls Birthday celebration is a must here ! Place is loud . So we can chat as loud as we want . Bday ice cream is funny , always a nice surprise for someone new . My favorite plate here is the octopus over fries and the creamy garlic potatoes . Sooooo good to pick on throughout the night . My sisters favorite is the mussels . White and red sangria pitchers is a must everytime we come!"
3,"The ambiance at this restaurant has changed a lot in the past 2 years or so because the owner closed (or forfeited, due to high rent) the space that was behind the current bar. The current space is smaller and has terrible acoustics. Last night it was so loud in there my ears are still ringing for having to shout to carry on a conversation. I wonder if the owner could install something to absorb the sound. 
I had one of the soup specials: Porrusalda, which was really good. I also recommend the dates (datiles) wrapped in ham. The Raxo was nothing to write home about. The best dessert is actually the banana (platano) with caramel and ice cream. Oh my lord. I&apos;m going to try to recreate that at home. 
So the food is promising, but they need to do something about the sound level."
5,"I was yearning for some authentic paella, and this place kept appearing in my Google searches. I grabbed a friend and she and I set out to give it a try.

The food was delicious. We both ordered tapas of course, with me getting the calamari and my friend got the veggie empanada. The calamari came out and it was big enough for both of us to share (even though I ate most of it). It came with lemon and a tomato dipping sauce and it was delicious. The portion was great for the price. I had a bite of my friend&apos;s empanada, and it was amazing as well. It wasn&apos;t in the shape of the empanadas we&apos;re used to so at first we were skeptical but the first bite quickly changed our mind and had us hooked! So delicious!!

As the entree we got the seafood paella to share and even though the server quoted us 35-40 minute wait time (which is usual since it&apos;s made to order) it actually came out much quicker than that, so that was a nice surprise. The paella was amazing! The rice was seasoned so well and so tender, and there was ample seafood throughout. The paella was def big enough for us to share, and we left pretty full.

Service was great as well. I had to wait for my friend to meet me, and most places downtown are weird about your total party needing to be there before they seat you (especially a busy place like this), but they let me have a table before my guest got there and my server immediately brought water and bread to start. He was attentive but not overly attentive, which I like especially when I&apos;m out catching up with friends.

It&apos;s a cute spot for a night out with friends, but it also looks like it could  be a nice date spot as well. Def will be back!"
4,"I came here for dinner with family and hope to return next time to sit at the bar either by myself or with a friend as there is a bar similar to a sushi bar where you can get much smaller appetizer portions for a more reasonable price.

FYI-If you order the Paella be prepared to wait 45 minutes for it to arrive!

My family and I ordered:

The Octopus
Goat Cheese Bacon Wrapped Dates
Ensalada Rusia=tuna/potato salad
Sea Scallops
Tiramisu Cake for Dessert

The food was quite delicious and we enjoyed that several of the plates came with rice in a saffron sauce."
1,"This place is not what it used to be. They closed a larger very rustic and decorated room off. Service was slow. Guy forgot my sangria and he came back to ask what I ordered to drink after the water and bread already being late.

Hostess refused to sit us in the main dining room even though it was still open another 95 minutes!! Instead made us eat at a bar at date night. When the food come again out of water to drink and while the two hostesses were EATING and DRINKING the ENTIRE TIME!!

Food can really be hit or miss. Service was terrible, slow, forgetful.


I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s new owners or what but this place used to have a two hour wait Saturday night now it&apos;s like a bunch of unsupervised people waiting for the restaurant to close."
3,"Alright place for tapas right in the heart of Chicago. Went here with a group for a school dinner, so I can&apos;t speak to the specific prices, but I&apos;m reviewing based on what I assume are average prices for reasonably nice place in downtown. Our group was pretty big so we all got to sample a bunch of their most popular offerings:

Tortilla Espanola - classic egg and potato omelette with onions. Alright but could&apos;ve been a bit more savory
Croquettes - fried well, the garlic aioli it came with was really tasty
Patatas Bravas - crispy potatoes with a spicy tomato sauce (not the spicy creamy aioli that I&apos;m used to). Not bad but not very impressive
Pulpo a la plancha/grilled octopus - chopped into little bite-sized bits, the octopus was super tender and had lots of briny seafood flavor.
Pincho de Pollo - a grilled chicken skewer served with rice, caramelized onions, and a hefty dollop of garlic aoili. My favorite dish there, the chicken was tender and the caramelized onions were cooked perfectly and full of sweetness
Chorizo y Morcilla - assorted sausage platter. Portion could&apos;ve been bigger, the chorizo and morcilla (blood sausage) were good but there was one that tasted a kinda closer to a hot dog.

Overall, not a bad place to get reasonably priced tapas in the middle of downtown Chicago. The quality of the dishes can be hit or miss, but service was always fast and the atmosphere is warm and inviting. I wouldn&apos;t mind coming back to try some of their other options."
3,"Look, Cafe Iberico was a Chicago staple. Losing that full restaurant is like losing a legend. But times change, neighborhoods change and I guess this place decided to go the express route.

The good news is, the best thing on the menu hasn&apos;t changed and now you can buy it whole or by slice. That&apos;s the tortilla espanola and it&apos;s hard to beat. Apparently you can also get sangria kits to go so that&apos;s fun.

It has a cheap take-out feel to it is that it&apos;s reduced to the bar area and the food (covid safety) is all in #5 plastic containers. Which brings me to my lower rating. They clearly don&apos;t care about the environment just by this display alone.

As for the food, mine was cold by the time I got home, and that&apos;s my own fault, in any case the garlic chicken is great and the chickpea salad side is better than I&apos;d even hoped. The papas bravas are a bit on the spicy side but yummy. 

As for el plastico, see the real rating on the PlasticScore App for why I may never eat here again. At least not during covid when they are creating enough plastic to pave Lasalle street in its entirety on both sides."
4,"It&apos;s been almost 2 decades since hubby and we&apos;re here... the sangria remains the same and fortunately the food is still pretty decent. We had the chicken empanadas, shrimp, scallops, salmon dinner and seafood paella. Everything was good and just as I remember."
4,"I have been here many times with friends/family, in my &apos;pre-Yelp&apos; days so this is my first review, sort of. I love getting the patatas bravas (roasted potatoes with hot sauce), paella and sangria. I hoped to impress a picky cousin of mine but she wasn&apos;t too impressed. 
We got patatas, sangria, bread with goat cheese, olives. My cousin and brother got an entree from the specials list, I forget what, and we went out for dessert (but I love the flan, the custard and the cake!). 
The ambiance was more family than adult, and I really miss the big room with the windows! It&apos;s too tight and loud in the main dining room. I hope they re-open the down stairs, it was very intimate and quieter."
5,"Food: DELICIOUS
Service: good 

I&apos;ve been coming to Cafe Iberico for over a decade, cannot believe I hadn&apos;t already reviewed it! It is beyond my favorite tapas place in Chicago. There are others that are good (yes the one in Lincoln Park everyone knows) but this is better. The menu is bigger, the portions are larger and the flavors are bigger/bolder/more authentic. I love bringing friends here and blowing their mind with how good it is. They don&apos;t take reservations and the wait can be long, but it&apos;s worth it.

Onto the food... my favorites and must order items are: Patatas Bravas, Pulpo a la Plancha and Paella Iberica. Other runner ups for me are Champinones a la Plancha, and Queso de Cabra. EVERYTHING is good though, so eat your heart out and leave stuffed!"
2,"Very Disappointing what has happened to such a great restaurant of Chicago!!
Years ago Cafe Iberico was awesome ! The food was fenomenal as the service. Ambience was fun and always bustling , but now it is a smaller space, the food is ok but certainly not what it use to be. Service was at a minimum. Paella was soggy and have no flavor. Shrimp were like rubber. Octopus was dry
Being from Madrid , I use to come here and get my comfort food.. never again."
