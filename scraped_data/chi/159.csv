5,"Just ordered carry-out from the Gundis for an at-home date night and had an AMAZING meal! I could not recommend this spot more--if you are looking for a unique, hearty, flavorful, delicious meal, you absolutely should try The Gundis!

We ordered:
-The hummus: super tasty, great consistency, beautifully presented (even in its to-go box!). The bread that came with the hummus was also excellent.

-Beet salad: what a great salad. The beets, unsurprisingly, were delish. But the combination of beets + arugula + feta + pine nuts + a spicy-sweet dressing really shouldn&apos;t be missed.

-Tirsik: I was obsessed with this stew. I ordered it with the bulgur and think I could eat this every day. Loaded with veggies and incredibly flavorful. I ate it with some of the bread and lavash crackers that came with our order and was in veggie stew heaven. Tasted even better the next day as leftovers.

-Beef Sac Tawa: my husband really, really enjoyed this dish. He said that the meat was super flavorful, juicy, and just overall really-well prepared. He got it with rice and was able to make two meals out of it (especially in light of all the apps that we also ordered).

Baklawa: WOW. This dessert hit it out of the park. I had never had baklawa prepared this way but it is definitely one of my favorite desserts now. The goat cheese, figs, nuts, and honey were so complementary. 

Rice pudding: Also delicious! Came with apricots and blueberries. I prefer thick rice pudding and this did not disappoint. Out of the two desserts we ordered, this was overshadowed by the Baklawa (not in a bad way, though!).

Homemade cookies: the restaurant also threw in a couple of cookies to our order and they were great! I think they were almond, but also had a slight citrus taste to them. Whatever they were, we really enjoyed them.

Needless to say, we will be ordering from The Gundis again. This is one of those places that you get annoyed with yourself for just learning about! Try it out and you won&apos;t be disappointed :)"
5,"This restaurant was beyond amazing. The interior is modern and sleek and the service was great. 
I was literally left speechless after a wonderful brunch here with my friends. We did the Turkish Breakfast spread with the Sujook scrambled eggs. The spicy sausage combined with the soft scramble  was delicious. I also had the baklava crepes which weren&apos;t too sweet and bursting with nuts. You must try the Turkish tea and coffee. 
Although the breakfast spread was beautiful and very filling, I think next time I will opt for just the eggs, cheese rolls, and fries as we didn&apos;t really care for the various olives and jams. 
Will definitely be going back there for brunch once indoor dining resumes."
5,"Ordered takeout - this place is great! I&apos;ve never had Kurdish food before, and this was a super flavorful introduction. I really recommend the sampler for appetizer - I loved the whole spread! For my entree, I had the chicken and veggie sac tawa which was also great. Looking forward to coming back and trying other dishes!"
5,"I came here tonight with my friend for dinner. We came here because we love trying Middle Eastern cuisine, so we were excited to try this place. Plus it&apos;s so close to place.  

We ordered a bunch of dishes to split.

Appetizer: ezme and walnuts, hummus, octopus salad, and baba ganoush. These were arranged on the plate to form an &quot;x&quot; shape and were perfect for dipping our bread into. The grilled calamari tasted really good and was cooked perfectly.  I like the sauce that it was in. We also ordered the spinach and pine nuts, which was steamed spinach with balsamic vinegar and topped with pine nuts and cherry tomatoes. 

Drink: cherry fruitbelt. It&apos;s a sparking cherry soda that was kind of tart. It tasted like a cherry wine with bubbles and without the alcohol. The cherry flavor did not taste artificial. 

Entree: beef shihsh and lamb shish. The meats were flavored nicely and came with mix green salad, steamed tomato, and rice. 

Dessert: kutish baklawa. It was like a small  crepe that was filled with fig and goat cheese. The small crepes were rolled and arranged in a starfish pattern that was drizzled in honey. They was also dried figs, piatachios, and almonds on the plate. 

Dessert drink: kurdish tea. It was black tea that light tasting and came in a small glass cup and saucer. 

Overall, everything tasted delicious! My friend and I had fun trying everything and we had a great time."
5,"SO good! Had the Zaza omelette for brunch, and it was amazing, as were the potatoes, Turkish coffee (highly recommended), and even the bread. Took 1/2 home and devoured it later.  I would go back any time!"
5,Stuffed chicken is FIRE. I don&apos;t live in Chicago but try to make a stop at The Gundis when I&apos;m in town. The sauce on the stuffed chicken is absolutely addicting - I&apos;m excited to make my own attempt at home using their take-home spices
5,"Really great neighborhood spot. The lamb is always delicious, and you can&apos;t go wrong with extra pita. The dip combo is great, and service is always on point. We picked up for a nice Friday evening, it was a great spread. Looking for good healthy food, check this place out."
5,"I haven&apos;t been as pumped to visit a restaurant as this one. Numerous people from across the country have encouraged me to visit The Gundis! And now I officially see the hype. A friend and I got the Kurdish breakfast spread, and boy was it good! Every aspect was absolutely delicious. The eggs with halal sausage were so flavorful. The variety of cheese paired with bread and the jams were absolutely wonderful! This spread was full of flavor and never ending excitement. Speaking of never ending, that was the best way to describe the tea! There is an endless service of tea, which makes the breakfast experience that much more enjoyable! I would highly recommend this spot!"
5,"While I have now only been here for carry out, I believe if what I got was only a portion of the greatness of this restaurant, I believe this might be one of the best local restaurants I have been to in awhile. 

A group of my friends do a restaurant club and this was the first time we tried to do one remotely. I thought it was odd that my friend picked this place, but the menu looked promising. 

First of all, the packing and organization of the food in the bag was amazing! Everything was labeled and in perfectly sized boxes. What really impressed me was how the food was plated (or boxed). I included the pictures below because I was blown away by the beauty. You do truly eat with your eyes. 

What about the food? All my dishes were either great or unbelievable. I went a little overboard and got a couple of appetizers and desserts. I got the hummus and halloumi cheese. Both were phenomenal, especially the hummus with its thin chips. I also like the zip to it! For dinner, I got the  Adana Kebab with rice. It was like a spicy little meatloaf. I highly recommend it if you are unsure, mostly because it&apos;s pretty straightforward. For desert, I got the chocolate and pomegranate mousse and the tea and cookies for two. Both were great! I also got a cucumber lemonade which was freshly made and went wonderfully with the food! 

If I could say there was any downside, it would be cost. It&apos;s a little on the expensive side, but the portions are pretty generous. The food is also spectacular and of top quality so I&apos;m willing to put out the extra bucks! 

I can&apos;t wait until this quarantine is over so I can go there in real life!"
5,"I love this restaurant so much! Our favorite is always the beet salad, grilled octopus, and beef kebab! We love the Kurdish coffee too! The staff is so nice and polite!"
5,"10 star and a shout out to this place !!!!! I believe everyone who visits this place will definitely fall in love with it. I have thoroughly enjoyed everything about this place. 

This is my first time being to a Kurdish Restaurant. I fell in love half way just by looking at the pictures of the food itself. Restaurant has a cool vibe, with the awesome service it is even more welcoming. I&apos;ve been here with my friends and Our order contains, Kurdish breakfast(Shared), Wayne Omlette(s), fig and walnut Pancake(S) and baklawa crepes. 

I am falling short of words to describe how good the food tasted. Side bread, olives, house of jam(Oh fig is an absolute delight), cheese, omlette...I mean everything. The best olives I&apos;ve tasted in the recent times. Fries have a nice spicy touch to it. Cheese Rolls are fried to perfection, crisp on the outside and cheesy soft inside. 

Pancakes are really good too, Baklawa tasted little dry to my palette. Apart from that everything is fantastic. We went in the early hours as soon as they opened so we bypassed the usual crowd and didn&apos;t have to wait. 

Highly Recommended !"
4,"Came here for coffee and ended up having a full brunch at 4pm. It was great unexpected Kurdish food which I hadn&apos;t had in a long time. 

Coffee was spectacular, authentic Turkish coffee."
4,"*4 stars. Modern Warm inviting - but pricey. You do however get decent portions. Since it was our first time  we had our server Suleyman pick our entrees. They are:

Spicy Jumbo Shrimp with rice(too lemony) was average the side veggies were good. 

Stuff Chicken - here the spinach stuffing complimented the poultry and cream sauce was not heavy(according to my wife)

Mardin Egg Plant stew - was served over a bed of egg plant stew(baba ganoush). A fine dish with lamb and veggies. 

*4stars -I was going to rate it less because of the pricing and average food BUT my wife and son liked it. In addition, this place was continuously  packed, they all can&apos;t be wrong."
4,"[Delivery Review]
Overall: The Gundis&apos; great dinner experience makes me excited to try their brunch someday (and dinner again!).

The good: The chicken sac tawa was great - it had the perfect amount of spice so it wasn&apos;t too hot, and it had a nice marinade to it. The mix of charred/sauteed peppers and onions in combination with the spiced chicken gave a well-balanced flavor. Having the bulgar on top and the bread on the side was smart so neither absorbed the juices (both were also great). The portion sizes are generous as well.

The not-so-good: For a delivery option, the cost is a bit much. The ambiance of the restaurant and the freshness of the food would help justify it a little bit, but to pay almost $30 for one person is a bit much. But, it did help that I had enough leftover for lunch the next day. The delivery was also almost 45 mins late, but I don&apos;t blame that on the restaurant and rather the 3rd party app."
5,"Came here for dinner with a friend, and I have to say, it was my first time here but they had been here several times before. So that tells me this place must be good. The service was great, we were checked on many times and they even let us stay a bit after they were closed because we lost track of time of when they closed so that was super sweet of them to not bother us. 

Now for the order:
Appetizers:
-The Sampler: came with baba ganoush, hummus, ezme, and octopus salad and great fresh bread! This was so yummy! Highly recommend. 

-beet salad: It was all right, it wouldn&apos;t order it again. Nothing special, there are other good options!

Entre: Stuffed chicken
So so good! I enjoyed it so much, this is highly rated. 

Overall, I will definitely come back. My friend said he grew up in Sweden with a bunch of Kurdish friends so he likes coming here. This was such a fun experience for me and I am really looking forward to trying the famous Kurdish Breakfast here someday!"
5,"Amazing experiences every time I&apos;ve eaten at/gotten take out from The Gundis! The Kurdish Breakfast is the greatest brunch experience and every dinner we&apos;ve gotten has been delicious. They have the best quality, tastiest food and kindest service (we brought our kids multiple times pre-pandemic and they were always so sweet). An awesome place to eat/get a great meal to go!"
5,"The Turkish breakfast is second to none! Fresh bread, yammy scrambled eggs, and a variety of delicious jams!! The service is great and they follow social distancing and all other Covid guidelines."
5,"Absolutely a neighborhood favorite! From the fresh and delicious ingredients to the cozy atmosphere and amazing staff! Everyone already knows their brunch is top notch, but their dinner is also incredible. We ordered the Sampler app( perfect for trying a little bit of everything) and for main course the Lamb Shank, Stuffed chicken and Crusted Salmon. Yummmm everyone was so pleased with their meals. Salmon is nice and light, chicken was surprisingly very juicy and the lamb dish was pretty large so we had leftovers. We had a few samples from the desserts with Kurdish coffee. My favorite was the burnt bottom milk pudding and rice pudding and apricot, my friends preferred the chocolate mousse. It was all fabulous dinner experience!"
4,"The food was really good, the restaurant was clean and quiet, more expensive than the average restaurant in the area. 
We were four people, we ordered the Mezopotamia, lamb shank,lamb sac Tawa and Mardin eggplant stew. four Ayran, the total was 150$  

The waiter were nice and funny."
5,I&apos;ve been 3 times already and consistently the food is always amazing. It&apos;s always fresh and comes straight away. The waiters all followed Covid protocol and the tables were spaced far and really clean which made us feel comfortable.
