5,"Bright wok is a shining beacon of light, both before COVID and during. But I&apos;m going to focus on during- they quickly shifted their model to allow you to do typical take-out or stir fry kits to make at home! So unique, I love it. 

The food is just all ways spot on. I love to make a veggie bowl with noodles and a mix of the ginger tahini and the teriyaki sauces. DROOL. It&apos;s amazing. 

Fast, fresh, delicious food you can enjoy without feeling guilty. And it&apos;s FILLING and good value. Can&apos;t say enough good things- if you haven&apos;t tried it, YOU MUST!"
5,Brightwok is awesome! The staff is welcoming and the food is great. The quality is just as good as pre-pandemic and I&apos;ve been ordering online for carry out. The order is always on time and ready for pickup. This is one of the best lunch options in the loop!
5,"I love love love Brightwok. My coworkers and I have been eating here regularly since they first opened in the loop. Ingredients are always fresh and their homemade sauces are so fantastic. It&apos;s very easy for folks with special dietary needs to eat here. While working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic, I&apos;ve regularly ordered for delivery!

I will say I think the Loop location (on Adams) has better quality control than the River North location. The RN location often doesn&apos;t use enough sauce, and one time they even forgot my rice! I order from the loop one more often, and its always been perfect.

The staff is always very friendly and helpful!

Pro tip: Get a fried egg or sweet potato fritter on your bowl, you won&apos;t be sorry!"
5,Very tasty and very healthy food option. I tend to stick with the creamy cashew sauce option but you really cannot go wrong. Love this place!
4,"TL;DR Solid fast-casual and healthy meal option in the Loop (that&apos;s even open for dinner!). The food comes out fairly quickly and I like that there is self-serve water and sriracha. The staff members are also very nice!

=====

Went here for the first time for dinner on a weeknight and enjoyed it. It is bright and spacious inside with ample seating and the food came out quickly and was cooked to-order. 

I ordered the &quot;Build Your Own Bowl&quot; with rice noodles, tofu, zucchini, carrot, bean sprouts, creamy cashew sauce, and kale (which shrunk so small I almost forgot about it) ($9.15 before tax). The portion size was good (I ended up taking ~40% of it in a to-go box) and everything was all reasonably well cooked and palatable. Normally I&apos;m on the more carnivorous side but I don&apos;t think I was really missing anything by not ordering meat. 

I also ordered the masala chai ($4) which was a little too sweet but well-spiced and also non-dairy! My friend ordered the &quot;Everyday Eat Right&quot; bowl; it smelled very good and he seemed to enjoy it.

As almost always I do have a few nitpicky areas of improvement to list. The flavor of my bowl was a tad under-salted and bland for me but much improved with dollops of the sriracha sauce they had available. Some small parts of the tofu and vegetables were also slightly charred and I&apos;m very paranoid about eating burnt food - I realize this probably adds to the flavor but the best stir-fry in my opinion has food that is nicely browned, maybe even to a darkish brown, but never, ever black. 

Nitpicking aside I would definitely be happy to come back and try the other things on the menu and the other, hopefully more savory, sauces!"
4,"A literal gem. 
I built my own bowl with 1/2 rice, 1/2 mixed green base. for my veggies, I got peppers, broccoli, carrots, and kale. Then added tofu, a fried egg, and chose the coconut curry sauce. It was so good - I love how you can see exactly what is going into your bowl, how they cook it right in front of you, and how convenient this is! A great fast-casual, healthy lunch option in the loop. My complaint is that they are only open during lunch hours - I feel like they would get a lot of business for dinner, too, and they&apos;re also closed on the weekends! 

Good portion size - not TOO large so that you don&apos;t leave feeling overfull. Will definitely go back!!!!"

4,"I love this concept! It&apos;s like a chipotle, but for noodles. 
They had one noodle type and then various sauces and proteins and veggies. 
All of the sauces were vegan which was really nice to choose from. 
The veggies were all good quality and plentiful. They had kale, edamame, broccoli, various onions, tofu, etc. I got a mix of two sauces plus about 4 different veggies. Then they heat and mix  it up in a wok, and voile! 
Also, I really judge a place by its ice tea and their iced tea was SO delicious. Really flavorful and they poured it from a growler because they only make a certain amount each day. 
I wish they had bright wok kitchen in California because I really think the concept would take off here!
A clean, healthy, flavorful noodle house that&apos;s caf√© style with very reasonable prices. Would definitely return, or if I found some in any area I was in I would definitely go there!"
5,"Great spot for fast fresh food in the Loop! They have several protein options, so you&apos;re easily able to eat vegetarian/vegan if you&apos;d like. I especially like the tofu. The vegetables are very fresh, and they provide a lot in each bowl, which I really appreciate. I&apos;ve only had the Crunchy Crave Bowl, so I&apos;m excited to try others."
5,"This is set up like a Chipotle.  Sort of.  You line up and walk down the line placing your order.  Then you have to wait for them to cook your bowl in  a wok while you get seated.  It only takes maybe 5 minutes from start to finish.  It&apos;s pretty quick.

I ordered a Chicken Thai Basil with veggies and brown rice.  Chicken was cooked tender.  Veggies were crisp tender along with a perfect rice.  Sauces were house made and all fresh and flavorful.  Everything had a fire roasted flavor and was simply delicious.  Iced Chai was amazing.  A cashew butter, chocolate chip and vanilla cake finished off a delicious lunch.

I would eat here regularly if I lived nearby.  The chopsticks message on the wall was also a nice touch that adds to the ambiance."
5,"Okay, I have to give the 5 start rating for this place. I was surprised by the ambience when I walked In(My first time though), given how it looks from the outside and how confused one of my colleague, searching for the door to get in..LOL.

This place is neat and and bright as it sounds. They have pretty good amount of eating for dine in. I liked the decor on the wall with chopsticks, nice touch. On the menu you will have options you s order straight in for the stir fry or you can choose to build your own bowl.

Build bowl -Chicken with veggies and brown rice, this Basil sauce. To place your order is of same style you do at chipotle or most of the Mediterranean places. I went in during lunch hour, didn&apos;t have to wait for long time. It was quick. You get to choose 4 veggies for free and you have to pay extra for others and I believe some veggies come under this extra category which you have to pay ..for example mushroom which I had to pay extra.

You choose your options, pay and wait. Your order number will be called when it&apos;s ready which was pretty quick in my case. 
 
Food was delicious, cooked well enough, veggies crisp and tender. Good food and healthy Choice. This is a place worth trying and even going back. The price range, I would say a bit more compared to what you pay for a stir fry in other places(Depends in what you have in your order). Food quantity and taste is pretty good for what you pay, worth it !"
3,"Their Motto is &quot;Eat Right, Live Bright,&quot; and That&apos;s What You Do Here.
 
We dropped in here for a quick, cheap bite during lunch and had a great experience. Brightwok is a veggie-focused, Asian-inspired restaurant serving fresh and colorful bowls of delicious-goodness. Their sauces are all homemade and flavorful, and their menu is dairy- and peanut-free.
 
I ordered their Kick&apos;n Panang bowl ($9), that came with white rice, local tofu, zucchini, squash, carrots, broccoli, and onions--I added a crispy egg on top ($1.50). It was great--lots of fresh veggies and a tangy sauce I made sure to sop up with every grain of rice. My date ordered the Earth, Curry, and Fire ($10), a bowl with chili coconut curry spiced hot, white rice, local tofu, kale onions, carrots, bell peppers, and crispy egg. She loved it too.
 
We&apos;re not from Chicago and were so glad to come here for lunch. This is a great place to have a quick, healthy meal that&apos;s easy on your wallet and easy to fit during the work day."
5,Found out from a colleague and really enjoy it. Their rice noodles are the best. I usually get it with teriyaki sauce.
4,"When I first walked in, my impressions were this place is so spacious and clean. We came on a weekend and it was mostly empty so really easy to get seating. Place is also quite large so plenty of seating. 

I&apos;m guessing this place is really popular for weekday meals since it has many healthy options and easy to grab and go. 

I ordered the sweet umami mushroom bowl. teriyaki, rice noodle, steak, mushrooms, squash, carrots, onion, peppers, zucchini. Lots of ingredients all stir-fried together, made fresh.

Concept of this place is pretty simple, but it turned out really good!"
5,"Ordered this for a group of 15 and it was a big hit! Really nice presentation and was fresh. Everyone liked the variety and how it was filling but not heavy.

We ordered:

White / brown rice
Crunchy Crave stir fry
Everyday Eat Right stir fry
Sinful banana chips
Magic cake --- reallllyyyyy good!

Try this place out if you&apos;re in the loop and want some great stir fry!"
4,"Filling, tasty food on the go.

Kick&apos;n Panang - 4/5. Good flavor. Lots of veggies. Medium spicy. Large portion.

Came for lunch on a Friday and it was relatively busy but operates like a well oiled machine with employees busily working over their wok stations. It appears that it is a mostly order ahead business. 

Requested the dish with brown rice, an egg, and grilled pineapple. Something got mixed up and didn&apos;t get any of those. Brought it to the staff and they quickly added the egg and pineapple (I didn&apos;t realize the rice swap until later) and gave me a coupon for the future."
5,"Place buzzing with Millennial office crowd, food healthy and fun. I asked for Estrada&apos;s spice and it was! That NEVER happens. The veggies were fresh, the egg crispy, the vibe uplifting. The perfect lunch."
5,"Didn&apos;t really have high expectations for this spot. Relatively healthy lunch place offering up quirky creations at a reasonable price point. Saturday late afternoon and no one in line.

Quickly decided on the &quot;Earth, Curry and Fire&quot; with chicken instead of tofu ($13ish), as well as the Iced Masala Chai ($4). Bowl is made in front of you as all the ingredients are mixed together and topped with a freshly made fried egg. Amazing taste from the coconut curry, the perfect amount of heat that went well with the chicken and veggies. Rice at the bottom wasn&apos;t overbearing as the egg softened everything up. Masala chai is a little heavy on the clove, yet a good combo for the meal.

Service here is patient and there&apos;s a lot to add from the condiment station to the left. Definitely a spot I wish I had the option to go to near my office."
5,This is our favorite lunch spot! It&apos;s healthy and delicious. I&apos;ve tried almost everything on the menu and have never been disappointed! I would highly recommend! It&apos;s also great for those with dietary concerns! Gluten and dairy free!
4,"4.5/5 

My team at work ordered from Brightwok Kitchen for dinner. 

I ordered the Sweet Umami Mushroom and it was delicious. Don&apos;t let the name deceive you - it was not sweet at all, it was savory. It was a noodle dish with steak pieces and vegetables. The meat was very succulent and the mushrooms paired well with it.

If you work in the loop or not, I definitely suggest you visit this place for lunch. 

One of my coworkers ordered the Jalape√±o Love because of the jalape√±os and said he hated the other ingredients inside the bowl: onions, pineapple and kale, but said the Jalape√±o Love was absolutely amazing, not once but multiple times and wants to go again.

This place will definitely become a lunchtime regular for me."
