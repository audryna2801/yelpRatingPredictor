5,"SOOO DELISH... I haven&apos;t ordered or been there since Covid started. However, I have been a customer in the past for 20 plus years.. 
AND THEY HAVE NOT MISSED A BEAT.. The tortellini spinach soup amazing, light , airy, pillowy tortellini in a garlicky broth and saut√©ed to perfection floating spinach.. YUMMM..
The Carbonara ( I added Grilled asparagus) yummmmm. 

I also update for the ribbon pasta instead of the spaghetti ADD A LIL Parmigiano Reggie Anna

Last but not least... linguine and clam white SAUSE... so many , clean and seasoned clams!!
CLAM DUNK !!"
5,"Love their vodka sauce cavatelli and chicken fettuccine Alfredo. Portions are very big. Love dining in because Dave the owner is awesome and welcoming and it has a neighborly feeling, but their carry out is fast and withstands getting it home well. If you dine in, get the lemon drop martini; it&apos;s strong yet so delicious!"
5,"The front of the place looks like it belongs on Taylor Street and the food would definitely belong there.    Ordered takeout for Mother&apos;s Day.   They had a great family meal with chicken marsala, pasta, salad and dessert.   The chicken marsala was among the best I&apos;ve had in the city.   Rigatoni with vodka sauce hit the spot.   Salad, bread and peppers were good.   The tiramisu was perfect.   Also ordered the cavateli and that was phenomenal.    Owner was taking orders and was a super nice guy.    Definitely can&apos;t wait to go sit inside."
4,"The lasagna is pretty darn good. There are thick layers of ground beef and thick layers of cheese and relatively thin layers of pasta. The extra red sauce they pour around it is good. All together it works for me and I&apos;ll order it again (and ask for extra sauce).

The chicken parm is pretty good too - I liked the cheesy tortillini they give as a side. 

My wife loves the pasta with vokda sauce. 

I have a thing against Italian bread - it&apos;s never as good as French bread. That applies here too. It&apos;s nice bread, just too dry for me. 

I&apos;ve been here twice now and I&apos;ll be a loyal customer and try more new dishes going forward."
4,"I absolutely adore this italian cuisine, especially pasta is amazing.
Every weekend me and my husband are dining out and already many times visited Viaggio.
Food is tasty, just as my hubby say &apos;service is too slow&apos;. But I actually understand, weekends may be full of customers"
5,"I cannot say enough good things about this place! Our first time here this evening was such a wonderful experience. My husband and I are celebrating our anniversary and they made us feel so special. All the staff is so kind and cheerful. The food is amazing! I had the lobster ravioli. Dave, the owner, came over and chatted us up for a while. I felt like I was part of this family because of how they make you feel... at home and loved with delicious food.
Well done! I can&apos;t wait to bring friends and family back here... again and again!"
5,"Nicolas our Server was amazing!!!! From the moment we walked in to the end of our dinner. First time at the restaurant invited by the in-laws and it was amazing, my favorite Italian restaurant for here on out! They gained a regular... I had the Vodka pasta sauce and it was so fresh, hot in temperature as well as the items I added to the plate. Honestly this review is nothing but positive and the cannolis with pistachio incredibly made fresh. They are very lucky to have Nico thank you again for the service and being very attentive to us. Always appreciate great service and made us feel like we were at our own home."

More details:

Crew of 9 people. We went there for a birthday dinner.
Very poor experience. They will not see me again.
It all starts by us asking for a table for 9 (we had made a reservation). Them giving us 2 separate tables, when, actually, only 2 other tables were full. Pathetic customer management.
Then, the staff came to ask us &quot;Ok what cocktail do you want?&quot;. 
Excuse me? I believe the question is &quot;Would you like to start with something to drink?&quot;. How rude are you? How pushy are you? 
This waiter came back 3 times with the same question. However, none of us was ever offered a glass of water, neither was our other table.
We started with 2 bruschettas ($9 each), 2 fried calamari ($15 each) and Mescal mules  and old fashions (cocktails are around $15 too).
We then followed with Fettucini Alfredo for a lot of us ($18), with added broccoli (+$2 or 3) and added chicken ($4 or 6). Some got Rigatoni Alla Vodka ($18) with added chicken ($4 or 6). One got Lobster Pasta (I believe between $25 and $28). And we had sides of Caesar salads ($12) and house salads ($8). We also had 2 bottles of wine (which I believe are around $60).
They messed up so many dishes. The pasta was not Al Dente. 
Total bill was more than $600. You would think that the staff would have gone above and beyond.
How can the staff be so rude? I am appalled. With that kind of behavior, I would expect them to go under with covid. I will not miss them. 

Overall?

Do not go there. Super rude staff. Overcooked pasta (please teach them what Al Dente means). Weak cocktails. Messed up orders. The whole thing! 
So many other great options, where you are treated decently and do not end up paying a ridiculous amount."
5,"Our favorite spot- Viaggio continues to impress, time and time again. If you have not tried before, please order and help out during these tough times. Food is out of sight, and the customer service is second to none. Best Italian food in the city!"
5,"Is it possible that I had better Italian food here than I did on my week long trip in Italy?!

I don&apos;t know how they do it. Let start with vibes, you might as well feel like you are at home. The hostesses never miss a beat. I don&apos;t want to put them on blast but there were 3x we didn&apos;t have a reservation, we showed up and they either made room for us or sent us to a bar next door and told us to come back in 5 minutes.

These people know what they are doing with quality and food too. Giving these guys a 5 star makes me want to change all of my other 5 star reviews to a 4. It doesn&apos;t get much better than this. 

I have brought at least 6 different guests to try this place out, every time thinking I was overhyping it. Not once was someone disappointed. 

Only condition - GET THE MEATBALLS"
5,"The food is amazing. I usually get the mussels and the linguini clams which are both very flavorful and well seasoned. For an antipasti, you get a large amount of mussels and the are so juicy it should be a sin. You can tell it&apos;s a very family oriented true Italian restaurant. I always go in to casually dine but it would be a great spot for a date or to bring your family or a group of friends."
4,"Solid choice for Italian food in west loop. The meal starts with bread on the table, grilled peppers, and olive oil. It was a lovely start to the meal. Tried dishes including the Chilean Sea Bass which was a special, the chicken dish called West Loop, cheese ravioli, and vodka pasta. Of all of them the chicken and the vodka pasta were the best. They had so much flavor and texture, and portions were huge. 

Our waitress was very kind and helpful, however you could tell she was very busy! She did a great job at managing her tables however know that this restaurant is relaxed and you won&apos;t be &quot;in and out&quot;."
4,"Went here because the Loyalist had a super long wait. It was a solid Italian food experience.

I found the service a little over the top but it was cute, so no complaints there.

My friend J and I started with the Caesar salad, which was enjoyable, and I went with the Scampi. I love me some Shrimp Scampi and the one at Viaggio had really good flavor. I think I remember wishing the shrimp were a liiiittle less overdone, but still very good. 

I agree with another reviewer on the large portion size. I could not finish all the pasta served with my scampi.

I would happily go back to Viaggio."
5,"Amazing!! The food is to die for and the service is phenomenal. Our team comes in to work the Chicago Boat Show every year and now requests Viaggo&apos;s as the finale dinner for the week.  Dave always accommodates our late dinner reservations and Julie hooks us up.  Bottles of Chianti, Meatball salads,sausage and peppers, mushroom ravioli, chicken, lemoncello...the list goes on and on!  Everything is delish.  Super fun times had by all.  Thanks for taking care us.  We will see you January 9th, 2021 @ 9:30pm. 

The Crew from WakeSide Marine"
4,"I called before showing so we were seated immediately. They offer valet parking for $11 but we were able to find parking a couple blocks down the street.  The service here was decent. Our server checked on us a few times. 

We ordered mussels, lobster ravioli and lasagna. Mussels were juicy and flavorful. Lobster was creamy and saucy. We all thought lasagna was too greasy and we were overwhelmed by the amount meat that came with it."
5,Definitely in the top bracket of Italian spots I&apos;ve been to in Chicago.  Tried the vodka rigatoni and the carbonara - both were huge portions that delivered on flavor and value.  Was bumpin on a Saturday night but service was still great.  Nice wine selection and really great chocolate cake too - def recommend and plan to come back.
5,"I would say one of my top 5 Italian restaurants includes viaggio. So here we are trying to find a nice local place to eat and hang in the west loop. My family suggested this one. With the pandemic situation i know its kind of tricky to try new places there is uncertainty of it being a good experience or not. But my family and I are out here supporting local businesses. The 5 of us walked in, sat in open space area next to the bar. They are very much up to standards with cleanliness, and diner expectations. We ordered some appetizers calamari (crispy not oily), jumbo shrimp with lots of garlic in a citrus based sauce (so delicious) and mozzarella rounds i guess they were lol. The table ate them too fast for me to tell!  I ordered eggplant with the side of fettuccine tortellini, nice contrast eggplant was good. Tad bit salty but thats because it absorbs less oil. I do it that way at home. I tried the chicken parmigiana too. All of us enjoyed our entrees and even we had extra to take home. (My mom said her fettuccine tasted just as good when she reheated it) so that&apos;s a good sign. Service was great, nehnad joe very entertaining and attentive to our group. We even agreed to take up trying desserts here, the tiramisu was really good the real deal. House made blend of espresso and liquore to me. Tried Chocolate cake really moist and not to sweet but also would recommend. I was impressed and we all agreed to come here again."
5,"Best of the best! If you want exquisite food and white glove service, this is the place. Everyone went above and beyond from the owner &quot;Uncle Dave&quot; to his attentive staff (Niko, Hector, and honestly everyone) made us feel like family. Looking forward to our next visit while in town. I highly recommend Viaggio&apos;s to those looking for an authentic Chicago experience."
1,"We came in on Monday July 20 around about 8:30pm, we were excited to get Italian food the manager or while we he was instantly asked us if we are going to be quick? And they&apos;re closing at 9 it was so rude that I was appalled by his demeanor. Never coming back to this establishment."
5,"First time visiting Chicago and I found this cute little place. It was a little more classier than expected but still I didn&apos;t feel out of place with my causal attire. The service was a bit slow but they were down a person and just finished up hosting a huge party in the venue so I understand. The food wow I have no words it was absolutely delicious I had the filet mignon with the mashed potatoes. The sauce was absolutely ridiculously delicious, my friend ended up picking at my plate than his! Definitely recommend this place!"
