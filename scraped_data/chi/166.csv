5,"Love this spot! Such a unique menu and never disappoints. I have always ordered delivery to my office for lunch, but the location in the loop is great for a quick lunch break.

The &quot;bacos&quot; are so my favorite. Take a traditional taco like ropa viejo or guaillo pork, and a delicious spongy steamed bao bun and you end up with a crazy, delicious, one of a kind meal!"
5,"So this location used to be called Spotted Monkey - and while the name may have changed, pretty much everything else is the same. It&apos;s still my favorite lunch spot in the loop. And through covid-19, I&apos;ve been able to order delivery to get my fix.

I&apos;ve tried most of the menu, and pretty much everything = a mouth full of happiness. But my go-to items are the bacos and the puerto rican rice bowl with chicken. Oh, and obviously the eggrolls! So yummy, plus everything is reasonably priced (for the loop).

Back in the days when I used to dine in, I loved the &quot;hole in the wall&quot; vibe and super friendly/awesome service. 
...Basically if you haven&apos;t tried Saucy Porka yet, you need to  put it at the top of your list."
5,"Ever since my sister moved to Chicago a couple months ago, she hasn&apos;t stopped raving about this place. I took a little adventure to visit her from Michigan and she told me we had to order delivery from Saucy Porka. She ordered the duck bao while I ordered the plantain tostones (I forgot to add a tofu ginger bao which I deeply regret). The plantain tostones were SO delicious! I usually hate anything that has a slight curry flavor but this dish was everything I didn&apos;t know I needed. I am so sad that there isn&apos;t a location in Michigan, however, anytime I&apos;m in Chicago I will definitely stop by!"
5,"Diners, Drive Inns, and Dives (3D) inspired me to try SP. 

And SP was an integrated, flavor-amalgamated simple-complex pleasure.

Fusion cooking appeals to me because I&apos;m kinda fusion as a person - a blending of many ingredients from many good and bad experiences and aspects of my unique human existence.

So what is fusion cooking?

&quot;Fusion&quot; is a form of cooking that combines contrasting culinary traditions or techniques into a single dish - Asian and Latin in this case.

 It does not fit squarely in any one traditional food genre.

Let&apos;s call it a cross-cultural culinary mash-up, like playing baseball with a tennis racquet, maybe or maybe not.

These SP interdisciplinary fuses appealed to my simple but complicated taste buds one day, not knowing where my silly taste buds might lead me tomorrow:

-Chorizo Egg Roll  Queso fresco cheese, sweet potato, red cabbage, onions, with avocado

-Bao Tacos  Guajillo Pork topped with pineapple salsa and served on a steamed bao bun

-Beef Ropa Vieja  With kimchi a served on a steamed bao bun

-Five Spice Duck  With pickled Asian slaw and plum sauce aioli served on a steamed bao bun

Fusion seems so very right to me.

It seems to be the recipe for the &quot;bestest&quot;me.

&quot;Life is worth living when God throws His divine dice in your favor. He has slow-stirred my life with wisdom and discernment about all manners of people; which is no secret agent in my soul sauce, it brings flavour to the taste buds of God&apos;s blessings in my life with extra side orders of favor.&quot;
~Tracey Bond"
5,"Asian/Latin fusion is something I&apos;ve never tried or seen before, and this was such a great idea.

The Chorizo Egg Rolls were the first that I had to get into, and was arguably the best of what I ordered. It&apos;s got really tender chorizo shreds, great crunch from the deep-fried shell, and comes with a refreshing aioli-like dip with subtle heat. The Five Spice Duck wasn&apos;t very distinctive or interesting in my opinion. If the duck came with any form of five spice, it was overshadowed by the pickled vegetables that were sandwiched in. Da Funky Monkey fries you cannot go wrong with. Thick, soft potato crinkles that make a perfect edible spoon for their delicious dip. The Chorizo Egg Banh Mi is just a number of great tasting ingredients in a hefty baguette. Really hits the spot and is huge for being less than $6. 

I&apos;m incredibly impressed with the food and the prices at this establishment. Try something new at this humble, unique, and locally-owned business!"
5,"I absolutely loved and throughly enjoyed my lunch here. I ended up here on my friend&apos;s recommendation. I was going through the menu, reviews and pictures prior placing the order(Used Ritual) and literally drooling inside over the food pictures.

I&apos;ve tried, Panama curry chicken Baco, Panang Curry Tofu and Soy Ginger Tofu. I am not so much into Tofu, overall it tasted Okay. Tofu Bacos tastes better with any side suace(I get sriracha). But the chicken bacon is absolute heaven. I should have ordered just the chicken ones ..lol. I am all in love with the texture of the back bun on how softI also did order the sweet potato fries, they are good too. I just wish I would have gotten the bet out of it if it weren&apos;t a to go order. They kind of turned soft in the box.

I can&apos;t quote much about service and all as I just went and picked up the order. But the lady at the counter spelled out each of us order specifically to make sure we are getting what we ordered so they seem to be pretty good at service too.

The ambiance looked cool too. The dine in place isn&apos;t that big but it&apos;s pretty decent compared to other fast food type dine in places. This place is definitely going into my favorites list."
5,"Quick review: Cheap, quick, delicious. That&apos;s really all you need to know.

A little more: Anytime I come across an Asian-Latin fusion spot, I always make it point to try it out, and this place did not disappoint, The menu consists of salads, soups, rice dishes, sandwiches, and bacos (Bao + Taco). The last item is pure genius: more on that later.

The place is kind of small, but it&apos;s efficient. Here, you place your order at the counter, and they&apos;ll either bring your food to you, or you can take it to go. Once I placed my order, my food was on my table in less than five minutes. 5 stars for quick service and efficiency. 

Food: There were many items that I wanted to try, but I settled on trying three different &quot;bacos&quot;. One gaujillo pork, one Panang curry chicken, and a guajillo shrimp. The shrimp was the best and full of flavor. The chicken was my least favorite, but it was still relatively good. The steamed buns did a nice job of holding everything together and had a nice texture. 5 stars. 

Price: Situated in downtown Chicago, this place is hard to beat for the price. 5 stars.

Conclusion: for a quick, well-priced, and delicious meal, you should definitely give this spot a shot."
5,"ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS ! I found this spot looking on yelp for a different taste of food, and I lucked up ! Fast service , food was amazing , friendly staff .... clean kitchen. I ordered 2 shrimp Bacos , 1 chicken , 1 pork .... they were so good I couldn&apos;t get a picture. The beef egg roll was my favorite the flavor was AMAZING, it was cheesy and seasoned well ...  I will definitely try again !"
4,"Went here for lunch with a buddy of mine to just catch up on life since we haven&apos;t seen each other for a while. I came from San Antonio to visit and my buddy said this was one of his favorite spots to get some lunch and it was close to his work. It&apos;s a very small spot but it&apos;s definitely a good grab and go spot.

My buddy ordered the bao tacos and man they looked and smelled real good. They were so good my friend didn&apos;t even let me try it lol but I&apos;ll definitely be back to try them myself. 

I ordered the grilled shrimp po boy which had the grilled shrimp topped with pickled onions and some asian slaw which was carrots and jicama I believe all served on a French baguette with chipotle aioli. This was one of the best po boys I&apos;ve ever had. It came with a side of chips that weren&apos;t so good but it didn&apos;t bother me. 

Overall service was good and I can&apos;t wait to go back and try the rest of the menu."
5,"Came here before when it was Spotted Monkey. The SM sign is still up but now Saucy Porka took over! Menu is still great, so let&apos;s go straight into what I ate.

3 Bacos: Guajillo shrimp and Guajillo Pork and Ropa Vieja Beef; with a side of the special egg roll! All three were very tasty, packed with so much flavor! Usually restaurants serve two baos as an appetizer, but three of these filled me up well! Oh, if you&apos;re not familiar with Bacos, they are a fusion of the Asian Baos (steamed buns) used as the &quot;tortilla&quot; for tacos! Their egg roll is also really outstanding, with a side dipping sauce so addicting to my tastebuds. 

Overall, I really enjoyed my meal and service is great! Water is conveniently in the front for you to refill which I prefer in most eateries because waiting for water can&apos;t get annoying. I anticipate that they will make more changes to the place now that Saucy Porka took over its sister restaurant. I will definitely return, perhaps check the newer location!

Special thanks to Justin, cannot forget him, for such a great experience both visits! Love the hard work these guys put into small businesses/hole-in-the-wall gems :)"
4,"Saucy Porkas fusion cuisine is definitely intriguing and has some star players! Very casual dining where you order at the order and there&apos;s a few high seats throughout the small space. Food came out very quick so this is a great lunch spot if you&apos;re in a hurry too. 

Bao-cos were yummy and I liked the idea a lot! Also the sweet potato fries were a win for me! The paella was also quite delicious - love the Chinese sausage! The big winners for me was their sauce assortments! The spicy aioli was perfect and the other sauce accompaniments (can&apos;t remember all the names) were very good. Be a fusionist yourself and mix some sauces together!"
5,"We were bored with our usual Grubhub restaurants so my partner suggested Cuban. We saw this Cuban/Asian restaurant and decided to try it and we were sure glad we did! Food was delivered quickly, and everything was delicious. I ordered the Duck Ban Mi, while my partner had the Ropa Vieja Banh Mi, and we also had the Plantain Tostones to share. I can highly recommend any of these dishes and their Vietnamese iced coffee is good too.

We look forward to ordering again and trying new things on the menu as there&apos;s a lot to choose from. The only con is the hours; it&apos;s a breakfast /lunch joint only which is a pity because I would love to eat some of their menu items for dinner!"
5,"The food is good and interesting, but the service is excellent. They&apos;re fast and kind and really attentive, but not in an obnoxious way. Really enjoyed it."
4,"My bookmark got visited on this trip. They has a good line of people during lunch waiting to order. Other Bao, the has Asian bowl selection. The restaurant is located on S. Financial Place. The apple map show wrong location. The yelp page has right location. 

I got the beef barbacoa, thai chicken, and shrimp Sofrito. This Bao is good for lunch. They are well garnish. The price they charge for each Bao is reasonable. Three Bao are enough for my quick lunch. My wait for the order is good. Enough time to return to work."
4,"Our office just moved to the Old Post Office and we were looking for lunch options nearby. We walked in a little after 12 on a Friday. It was packed so we decided to take our food to go. The line moved pretty quickly and we did not wait very long for our order. So don&apos;t be scared if you go in &amp; see a line. I ordered three baco tacos and I thought that was the perfect amount. I had the Guajillo Pork, Guajillo Shrimp  and Beef Ropa Vieja. The beef was very tender but not my favorite but that is probably just personal preference. I&apos;ll try the chicken next time. I really enjoyed the pop of the pineapple with the pork and the corn &amp; chipotle sauce on the shrimp. My friend had the tofu banh mi and really enjoyed it. Will definitely be back."
4,"Woah, I feel like Saucy Porka took a slice out of my mother&apos;s recipe book and made a bowl that reminded me of what I used to eat growing up. That is one compliment I am happy to give this small hub of flavors here in the South Loop.

My coworker and I came here for lunch one day after seeing that we had tried a majority of the other Asian restaurants in our area. This spot stood out in my search with its Asian-Latin fusion, so I decided it was wort ha shot. During lunch time, this small restaurant is packed! There is a small dining area with tables for 2-4 people max and a counter where you order from their chalkboard menu above.

What was on the menu? Banh mi creations, tacos, bowls, you name it. I was impressed with its variety and the blend of typical comfort food you would find from families under both backgrounds.

I decided to try their Asian Style Paella ($12) because it blended together Chinese sausage I grew up eating with carnitas over a bed of rice. While it&apos;s certainly not in the traditional sense of a paella, the sheer combination of these ingredients drew me to the bowl. The verdict?- The bowl reminded me of what my Mom used to make me when I was a kid and this pure nostalgia really helped me bring out those tastes. The bowl was a perfect blend of meat and rice and I absolutely loved my meal.

Would definitely recommend trying this spot out for anyone interested in fusion cuisine. I am looking forward to returning to test out their tacos in the future."
3,"My workplace caters from this place sometimes and I always end up eating cold leftovers as I try to get a bite and taste of this goodness. I finally got a chance to eat the fresh food from here as I came here during my lunch break to celebrate my coworkers&apos; bday. This place gets packed easily during lunchtime and there is not that much seating inside. The orders are fast and you get your food fairly quickly. They don&apos;t open on the weekends and they close early at 3pm on weekdays. The opening times here are limited which makes sense why it gets so busy here during lunchtime!

I tried many things when I had the cold leftovers at my workplace (mostly the rice and meats). This asian-puerto rican restaurant has delicious food no matter what you pick from the menu. They have some vegan and vegetarian options too! I tried their curry sweet potato fries which was not served fresh because it was kind of cold (wish it was warm but they probably made a whole batch beforehand for the large crowds) but the curry aioli sauce that came with it was really good. I had the cheesy budda sandwich was was hot and fresh with a lot of gooey Chihuahua cheese and yummy mushrooms and grilled poblano peppers. I scarfed everything down and immediately walked back to work after we finished. My stomach did not feel well afterwards. I need to make sure that I give myself some time to digest after eating such good food here!"
5,"Very yummy, great service and enjoyed sitting outside!

We got the rice bowl, breakfast bahn mi and a tofu bao taco. If I  was hungrier I would have gotten more of the bao, as that was my favorite"
5,They&apos;ve earned every star! I had the curry chicken sandwich and my daughter had the brisket sandwich.  We throughly enjoyed our lunch! Definitely a reccomend....
5,"Saucy Porka has such good food, and the quality is amazing for the price you&apos;re actually paying. The restaurant is small but charming, and the food is beyond spectacular. We ordered several different things off the menu, and everything tasted good. Definitely recommend their loaded fries!"
