5,"Ordered pick up, but it seems like they are having indoor seating with reduced capacity. Friendly staff. Homestyle Filipino food. Everything is great!"
5,"Definitely a hidden gem. This place is a mom and pop type of Filipino restaurant. They specialize in breakfast and brunch. They have adapted to COVID times by putting up some tables outside with umbrellas. All the meals come with a free soup appetizer, called Lugaw which is a warm, porridge-consistency, with chicken and lemon. I got a basic egg and bacon sandwich with cheddar cheese but also I got the potato pancakes which were interesting and different from traditional latkes. They were much more cake-like with a pancake consistency, but served with applesauce and sour cream. Overall I really enjoyed this restaurant and it&apos;s home grown appearance. If you&apos;re in the area, try them out. The patio outside is dog friendly and the pups there definitely add to the experience!"
5,"Disclaimer: my review is from my 2 visits prior to COVID-19.

I don&apos;t live in IL so every time I visit Chicago I try my best to visit this place. Love the friendliness of the staff, the ambience, and of course, the delicious food. 

My first visit I was given complimentary soup and coffee at the bar while I was waiting for my guests to arrive.

I ordered the Filipino breakfast combo. My past 2 orders were the skirt steak with longanisa and skirt steak with tocino. You get a side serving of champorado (chocolate rice pudding), eggs, and garlic fried rice. Added bonus to all this is that the prices are reasonable.

Having eaten at Filipino restaurants in NYC, NJ, and the Philippines, I can definitely vouch for this place. Highly recommend it."
5,"Delicious breakfast spot.  One of my favorites; favorite breakfast spot in my neighborhood.  The free congee is always a treat and it&apos;s one of the few places in chicago that will do a proper spam and eggs.

You can&apos;t go wrong here, truly.  it&apos;s amazing!"
5,"Uncle Mike&apos;s Place was on my Chicago list because we don&apos;t have any Filipino restaurants in our city, and I love Filipino food and breakfast... so you know I&apos;ve gotta try a Filipino breakfast place! My boyfriend and I made it there early on the morning we were leaving town while visiting Chicago last summer. 

There were only two other groups inside, and I felt comfortable dining in. I&apos;d looked over the menu quite a bit before visiting, so I knew I wanted some breakfast options. I ordered the half steak and eggs, and my boyfriend got a spam, egg, and cheese sandwich. 

To start you get a complimentary bowl of lugaw, which is a rice porridge with ginger and garlic. It was so warm and comforting! I loved it. The ginger and garlic flavors were really bright without being too overpowering. Our main dishes came out pretty quickly and everything was cooked perfectly. The steak was seasoned really well and had a great flavor. It was also cooked to the perfect temperature for me, medium rare. The plate also came with a cup of champorado, which is a chocolate rice porridge. It looked like refried black beans so I was surprised when it was dessert. It was nice and chocolatey without being overly sweet. The garlic rice was also really delicious. Three different types of rice in one meal, and all were great! 

The spam, egg, and cheese sandwich was also really good -- don&apos;t knock spam if you&apos;ve never tried it! If you like hot dogs, you&apos;ll like spam. I was so happy with this meal and definitely will be stopping at Uncle Mike&apos;s again in the future. Note that there is free street parking available, but watch for posted signs about street sweeping as we saw a few cars that had been ticketed while we were there."
4,"Homestyle Filipino food that hits the soul in a deep way.

Uncle Mike&apos;s is straight up. They don&apos;t over glorify Filipino food, which is really simple food. The prices of the food resemble quantity and quality, unlike other Filipino places that will charge for more for less because they &quot;fancied&quot; a plate of chicken adobo. 

Having moved out of my parents&apos; house for 4 years, this is a place that helps me when I feel homesick from my mother&apos;s cooking.

I got the breakfast combo that includes fried garlic rice, 2 eggs, tocino, small cup of chocolate rice, vinegar sauce, etc. All this food for $14 ish. So amazing. So good. NO BS. LOVE IT!"
3,"For my pinoy folks if your ever in Chi-Town, it took a while to seat us, but it&apos;s because we were a party of 7, the lady that brought our drinks was very friendly but it took a while for the waitress to come and take our order, food took a while to come out even when it was just us and another couple or maybe there was a few more folks on the other side of the restaurant."
5,"If you haven&apos;t been to Uncle Mike&apos;s Place, this place is a must! Authentic Filipino breakfast, what more could you want? The portions are huge and very filling. You get a savory lemon soup to whet your appetite first. And then the entrees come with your choice of meat, accompanied with garlic rice and eggs. The Tocino (sweet cured pork) and the Longanisa (Filipino sausage) are my favorites! And then to finish off the meal there is a sweet chocolate rice pudding. Can&apos;t think of a heartier way to start off your day!"
5,One of our all time favorite breakfasts in the city!  Today we ordered skirt steak and tocino combo with a side of longanisi with eggs over sticky rice.  Few things to note... the skirt steak is amazing.. comes with an in house sauce similar to A1 but with more depth.  Garlic sticky rice is fantastic.   All meals start with a complimentary bowl of Filipino soup.. think of it like a porridge with hints of ginger and chicken.   Filipino breakfast portions are huge here too.  We love Uncle Mike&apos;s and you will too!
5,"I really miss the day that we could dine in. You can enjoy the atmosphere, decoration, and wall tiles for how Filipino family diner looks like. Tocino &amp; Skirt Steak Combo with sunny side up and garlic rice is classic. You will be served one salty congee as appetizer and I want to have more if I could."
5,"Obsessed with Uncle Mike&apos;s. Having never had a Filipino breakfast before, I wasn&apos;t sure what to expect but I absolutely loved it!! We were seated quickly (table of 5) for a Saturday morning. Cute, homey ambience and very attentive, friendly staff. The waitress gave good recs too since we were unfamiliar with what some of the items were. 

Everyone at the table was given a complementary porridge as an appetizer. Similar to congee in texture but flavored with lemon, garlic, and chicken. So good! I had to stop myself from eating it all because it was a healthy portion and I wanted to save my appetite for the meal I ordered 

The longanisa reminded me of char siu pork and it was sooo good! The tocino (sausage) was good too but the longanisa was definitely my favorite. Mixed with the egg and rice, super tasty and very filling. The staff was also great about making sure we had plenty of fresh coffee. Absolutely loved this place for the food and hospitality and we will be back!"
4,"First time trying Filipino food, and had a great experience! The place has a casual diner vibe with big tables that could fit up to 8 people. They serve complimentary lugaw (glutinous rice porridge with garlic, ginger, lemon, chives, and chicken) with every meal, which were FANTASTIC. They also serve complimentary(?) coffee (they didn&apos;t charge me for the coffee so I&apos;m saying it&apos;s complimentary but it might not be lol). Never tried tocino before, but I&apos;m so glad I did at Uncle Mike&apos;s! Tocino -- for those who don&apos;t know -- is a sweet and savory pork shoulder dish, and it&apos;s served with garlic fried rice and two eggs of your style. 

I very much enjoyed my first experience with Filipino food; I would give it a 5-star review, but the service was a bit slow and the servers were kind of disruptive as we were talking. But overall, definitely worth checking out!"
5,"The best skirt steak in town - their ad is not false!

While I moved here from San Diego where you get some of the best Filipino food, Uncle Mikes is not far behind. Stop in for an authentic breakfast that can include any variety from skirt steak to spam to longinisa to tocino and more! 

I prefer the half skirt steak, cooked medium (still so juicy), with the garlic fried rice and I have been adding an extra egg (game changer alert!!). They also give you a yummy porridge beforehand and I learned you can get a soup similar to sinigang instead. 

The only thing I miss is this specific hot sauce they used to carry that was similar to Tapatio. Now I just bring my own hot sauce! #noshame 

*sorry for all and any spelling errors."
5,Hard to bead value. Tasty food with reasonable prices. Large portions stuffed us completely. Decent coffee
5,This is definitely the place to get your fix for spam ! I always order spam and eggs paired up with rice or cabbage soup you can&apos;t go wrong. Very friendly staff especially the girls at the counter.
5,"Love love love this place! I&apos;m Filipino and the tocino and longanisa are A+. The garlic fried rice and lugaw are also delicious. You get a buttload of food with every breakfast, it&apos;s basically two breakfasts worth. Also one time they gave me a free slice of cake?? I was very confused but pleased!!"
5,The best Filipino breakfast ever! Mike is always a great host and I cannot remember a time ever leaving hungry. Love the skirt steak and longanisa combo! Must try!
5,"I woke up this morning with a taste for something different for breakfast so I flipped through my memory bank of breakfast spots that I haven&apos;t visited in a while and Uncle Mike&apos;s popped up!  I went to their website and glanced over the menu and decided YES Uncle Mikes it is!!  

I ordered the steak and Tocino combination and everything was on point.  The steak was tender and flavorful, the garlic rice was very tasty, and the Tocino blew my mind!!  They included steak sauce and pico de gallo but in my opinion, putting steak sauce on a steak marinated and seasoned this well should be a FELONY!   

The Lugaw was okay, nothing to really jump up and down about - it&apos;s rice porridge with fried garlic and green onion - nice and savory, but my REAL surprise was the Champarado (sweetened rice porridge)!!  For you 70&apos;s babies who are familiar with Cream of Wheat or Cream of Rice, this would be that perfect bowl of slightly sweetened Cream of Rice, but you know it&apos;s homemade because it doesn&apos;t have that manufactured smoothness but rather a homemade &quot;Mama stirred this thang up&quot; type of smooth texture!  A spoonful of that and the Tocino is the perfect mouthful of sweet and salty.  

So my signature final verdict?  Is it Itis worthy or not?

VERY ITIS WORTHY!!

Get over to Uncle Mike&apos;s for a very authentic Filipino breakfast before all of Chicago discovers this place!"
5,"We love this place! the portions are huge and the food is so good. Very friendly people, too. It has become one of our go-to&apos;s :)"
4,"As someone who was born in the Philippines, having Uncle Mike&apos;s in Chicago feels like being home. They have good portions for meals $12 or less. All the silogs - you name it!

I&apos;ve been hearing about this place a lot from other fellow Filipinos so you know this place is legit. I brought some of my coworkers and friends here who aren&apos;t Filipinos and they have been dying to come back :)

Don&apos;t know why but I get happy when foreigners appreciate and enjoy eating Filipino food!"
