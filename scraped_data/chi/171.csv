5,"I got the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich, carry out. The packaging was good and secure, keeping the fries and sandwich warm, which is greatly appreciated.

The Buffalo Chicken Sandwich was great. I don&apos;t like coleslaw, so I didn&apos;t love that part, but hey, that was part of the sandwich and I still ordered it. The bread was good, the chicken was flavorful and spicy.

Good value!"
4,"It is pretty good and reliable place to go @River North.  This is cumulative 4 out of 5 stars, based on several visits. Last one this week was more of 3-3.5 star visit.  There was not much energy and atmosphere usually expected at Hub 51.  COVID killed those good vibes, I guess. Indoor dining just reopened few days before we visited, and it figured. Ahi tuna was pretty good, and so were other items from Ben Pao side of the menu. Not outstanding, but definitely not bad.  Service was adequate. Drinks were mew, in my opinion.  They are a bit on a pricey side.  Would try them again in &quot;after COVID world&quot;"
5,This is one of my staples when I come to Chicago! My family and I always stay at the hotel next to Hub 51 and I always make sure to pop down for a quick bite and drink. They have a great menu with a lot of options and service is always impeccable. They&apos;re so sweet and I was so glad they were able to remain in operation during COVID. The drinks are always strong and absolutely delicious.
4,"I really enjoyed the Hub 51. They had an awesome playlist that Sunday coupled with a really friendly and energetic staff. Where the menu was concerned I really appreciated the level of variety. I sincerely felt like there was a good chance someone could easily find something to fit their mood, no matter what that mood might be!

Diving into the food, I ordered the Breakfast Nachos with a side of chicken sausage for my entree and the Crab Rangoon chopsticks as my starter. When i read the description of the crab rangoons i remember I seeing something about jumbo lump crab meat which I thought sounded amazing. I think I was hoping for some crab chunks in the filling but that wasn&apos;t the case. The flavor was also quite heavy on the cheese filling and light on the crab. 

The Breakfast Nachos however were spectacular. I really appreciated how cheesy they were and the eggs on them were cooked to perfection. The chips had an awesome crunch that the fresh jalape√±os only added to while giving you a little bit of heat on the finish. I tend not to order dishes without meat in them, big carnivore here, but by the time I&apos;d eaten the nachos i actually forgot about my chicken sausage (which was also delicious) and had to go back and eat them. 

Overall my experience at the hub 51 was dope. My two points of negative feedback would simply be that I think the bottomless mimosas/belini&apos;s are a bit pricey. They&apos;re 27 per person I believe and I wish the Crab Rangoon was a bit heavier on the crab. Everything else was awesome, my friends said their dishes were pretty epic and I&apos;m excited to go back and try other menu items!"
5,This was a great place to have dinner in downtown Chicago. The ambiance and vibe along with the friendly service set a positive energy for the resturant. The food was extremely good and the menu had a variety of options. I had the ahi tuna and got green beans instead of rice which was an exceptional exchange. My boyfriend got the seven seasoned chicken dish w/ rice. They were both extreme good and portions were pretty big! Definitely recommend!
5,Great brunch spot! Excellent food. Of course the bottomless mimosa option is key. Great venue with outdoor seating along the perimeter when the weather is nice
5,"I love Hub 51 for their weekend brunch! Such a steal of a deal $25 for bottomless mimosas. I think my group had near 70 glasses over a course of a few hours. 

Our server was so fun and accommodating and the manager on duty, Philip, was also great. 

Great staff, great ambiance... and holy cow the Mexican Hashbrowns are delicious! Simple idea with a great taste."
5,"When people ask me where they can find the best nachos in the city, I don&apos;t even hesitate when I say Hub 51. They&apos;re not skimpy on toppings, which is obviously key when it comes to nachos. Their pulled chicken melts in your mouth and the cheese is SO YUMMY. If you&apos;re looking for amazing nachos, Hub 51 is for you!!!"
4,"Came here on a Tuesday night and it was pretty busy - glad I made a reservation. For a starter, we ordered the brussels sprout salad. I really enjoyed the addition of the dates for sweetness and almonds for crispiness, otherwise the salad would have been pretty bland.

For our entree, we ordered the nachos and the grilled fish tacos. The grilled fish tacos came deconstructed, and were very average. The nachos were the star of the meal, with a mountain of delicious toppings. The chips are very thin, so eat quickly or they&apos;ll get soggy. 

Pro tip: if there are only 2/3 in your party, ask for the SMALLER SIZE of nachos for $12.95 as opposed to the normal size for $16.95. Our server recommended it when I gave a concerning look about the portion size of the larger plate. The smaller size still was an alarming amount of food that the two of us were unable to finish.

Overall, would definitely come back for nachos and drinks with friends! It&apos;s such a great price for sharing."
4,"Came for Saturday brunch. Solid range of creative options.

Breakfast nachos - 4/5. Good blend of flavors and a large portion. Takes a while to eat and probably wouldn&apos;t get again but was good. 

Cinnamon roll pancakes - 5/5. Wife got this and loved the frosting. 

Carrot cake - 4/5. Was given this for free since it was our first time at the restaurant. Carrot cake itself really moist. The frosting felt meh to me.

Wife would go back more readily than me."
3,"Nice space, great service from Londen, and good food...although this isn&apos;t my favorite LEYE spot, it&apos;s a nice option for travelers and businessfolk in the River North area.

We came in for dinner last night and tried the Bang Bang Cauliflower, the ahi tuna poke and the grilled fish tacos (all of which are specialty items that are favorites of the restaurant).  The cauliflower was great, but the other two dishes were just fine.  We chased this with the carrot cake dessert, which was also tasty but not completely full of its own character.

The menu at HUB 51 can best be described as &quot;yeah, we make that too.&quot;  The menu doesn&apos;t take any chances but everything is solid, if not spectacular, American cuisine with hints of menus from everywhere else.  Very safe for tourists or those who are only able to eat certain categories of food!"
3,"We were visiting from Las Vegas and decided to go check out Hub 51 for brunch. When we arrived, the restaurant was busy with a social atmosphere. We were seated pretty quickly but waited about ten minutes before our server came. We ordered a pitcher of Vodka-cucumber bulls$&amp;t, and for food we ordered the scrambled egg nachos and the short ribs benedict. 

We waited for our food to arrive, and unfortunately our drinks came out about 10min later after we had to remind a different server. We had to ask the other server for utensils as well while our food sat.

The scrambled egg nachos were very unique and tasty. The chips stayed crispy. The nachos had salsa fresca and topped with scrambled eggs, guacamole, and cheese. The short rib benedict was good but nothing spectacular. The beef was slightly overcooked. The muffin and the eggs were perfect. Our drink was very refreshing but after a pitcher between the two of us, it didn&apos;t have much alcohol in it.

Overall, not a place I would revisit. The food was decent and I&apos;m sure the service is usually better on less busy times."
5,"Went here on a whim for brunch with boyfriend one day. It&apos;s Chicago, going to be honest hard to find places with bad food; so, we usually just end of trying places saying it&apos;s good and maybe returning later. This is a place we both agreed we need to go back.

Our waiter was super attentive, the atmosphere was great (very trendy without trying too hard), and the food options were a good price for Chicago, especially that location.

Boyfriend had breakfast burrito, I had a ribs eggs Benedict. I also had a cold brew bourbon. SO GOOD! Food was hot, super flavorful, and filling without being sickly.

Now, it was our first time, so our waiter said we could have a free dessert. The blueberry butter cake... Honestly one of the best desserts I&apos;ve had in so long. Warm, flavorful... Had butter cake at a much higher end place before but this one take it.

Overall, we had a great experience, feel we had great food and service for a great price, and I plan on coming back here for brunch again or to try their dinner options at some point!"
4,"Came on a Thursday afternoon, around 4. Seated outside at first, but it was chilly so we moved inside.

Menu cocktails were good, but small. Food was okay. Bye 6pm they started playing a mixture of movie types. And the restaurant started to pack in with people."
5,"Went with the family for brunch on a Sunday and it was fantastic.  We arrived right when they opened (10am) and the service was excellent.  We had the cinnamon roll pancakes,  breakfast nachos, lemon pancakes and the bacon and egg sandwich (with hash browns).  All of our entrees were outstanding and I highly recommended the spiked coffee with a donut on top!  We will definitely be back!"
4,"Went to this place for dinner and it is definitely a popular place. It was packed with the after work crowd. There is a lot of variety here from burgers to sushi. The restaurant is part of the Lettuce Entertain You group so if you go to those spots regularly then the music and scene will be familiar, which means good tunes and a lot of energy here.

I sat at the bar since there were no tables available. I had Hamachi &amp; Serrano Chile roll as well as a Spicy Tuna roll. Both were solid choices and surprisingly filling enough that I did not order a third roll. Most folks around me had &quot;two-handed sandwiches&quot; or tacos. So these will be my next things to try when I return."
5,Amazing restaurant. Good prices. Phenomenal food. I will be coming back to this place again and again!
4,"A trendy restaurant with a short menu and warm ambiance. The menu jumps from burrata and sushi appetizers to salads, sandwiches, burgers, grilled fish and stakes; then takes a turn to tacos and nachos. It would be overwhelming had it not been placed on a single sheet.

Our waiter took his time to explain the menu and made our experience for the better. We ordered shaki-shaki tuna, burrata, Asian chicken salad, a cheeseburger, and finally a warm brownie and gratis carrot cake.

The appetizers were flavorful and delicious. The rice in shaki-shaki was slightly soggy and being slightly fried didn&apos;t add to crunchiness. The Asian chicken salad was fresh and crunchy; however, the chicken was not grilled, thus didn&apos;t add to a flavor profile. The burger was moist, flavorful, and grilled perfectly. Finally, the deserts were well balanced, fresh, and delicious.

The service was great since our server was friendly, attentive and prompt.

Overall, it was a pleasant dining experience; however, the menu is somewhat confusing and made it difficult to choose. The Asian chicken salad even though fresh was hitting one note and needed vibrancy. We would like to return to taste other dishes."
5,"I ordered my Thanksgiving dinner from Hub this year after deciding not to spend it with family. I was apprehensive about ordering a traditional thanksgiving dinner and having a bland, non-homemade meal but I have to say that this Thanksgiving spread was by far the BEST Thanksgiving meal I&apos;ve ever had (don&apos;t tell my family). The turkey was PERFECT but the sides really stole the show. The mashed potatoes and Mac &amp; cheese were honestly insane. Also the gravy, a very telling factor in a Thanksgiving meal, was the most amazing flavorful gravy I&apos;ve ever had. Thank you Hub for saving my favorite holiday with a meal that was truly above and beyond."
4,"Overall good experience. Trendy atmosphere, friendly staff, and prompt service. Our waitress was attentive and personable. The food was pretty good! We ordered chicken egg rolls for an appetizer and steak tacos and a classic burger for entrees. Everything came out hot and tasted pretty good. My only criticisms are that the place has really bad acoustics, so it is pretty loud. Also, our appetizer came out at the same time as the entrees.. which was confusing and made our entrees a little colder by the time we got to them. There are definitely better places in the area in the same price range, but I will definitely be back! I live in the Loop, so it is in walking distance, which is great."
