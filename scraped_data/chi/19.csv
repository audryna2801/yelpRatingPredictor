5,"The most delicious cupcakes in Chicago. The cupcakes have dough/a nice treat in the middle that make it spectacular. Many of their options need to be refrigerated so keep that in mind if you&apos;re walking around! Highly recommend the cookie dough, and cheesecake flavors."
5,"Kept hearing this place was good from locals and finally made it out there during COVID!

Arrived on Friday evening post-dinner and got the Peach Cobbler and the White Chocolate Raspberry to go. No line and friendly service. 

The cupcakes are well packaged, so they aren&apos;t damaged by the time you get home. The cake is moist, the flavor is as promised, good ratio of cake-filling-frosting, and not too sweet! 

This is NOT those sickeningly sweet cheap cupcakes from your local grocery store. These are divine! Better than Sprinkles in my opinion. Worth it!"
5,"These cupcakes are a perfect DREAM. After a life of scraping off super sweet frosting off my cupcakes, these cupcakes changed the game. I&apos;m a fan of cupcake wars so my family and I decided to walk in after seeing the winners of cupcake wars season finale sign. The workers were super friendly and patiently helped us figure out which flavors to choose. 

Every single cupcake was SOO GOOD. There aren&apos;t words to describe how good they were. Just sweet enough and frosting perfectly complements the rest of the cupcake.  These cupcakes deserve to be eaten with a fork and savored with every bite. Thank God I found these wondrous cupcakes and I am so happy there is a location near me.  

If you haven&apos;t already you NEED TO TRY THESE CUPCAKES. Trust me these are worth it. Find a location near you and go go gooo"
5,"I used to never like anything filled, once I had Molly&apos;s cupcake I was forever sold! I know you&apos;d rather do something else than spend $4 on a cupcake, but it&apos;s not just any cupcake, it&apos;s full of love I promise! These bakers in all the stores seem to enjoy what they do and each location has served the same quality. 

I&apos;ve ordered lots, here&apos;s some to name:

Chocolate Cupcake
Cookie Monster
German Chocolate
Ron Bennington 
Carrot Cake
Chocolate Decadence 
Vanilla Cupcake
Peanut Butter Nutella

My favorite is the chocolate decadence! ;D"
5,"This review is long overdue but we had such a fantastic experience working with Molly&apos;s Cupcakes for our June wedding last year! My husband and I had been fans of Molly&apos;s long before our wedding, so when I found out they did wedding cakes I knew I had to investigate!

The cake tasting was our favorite part of wedding planning and we settled on flavors for a small 2-tiered cake as well as a variety of cupcakes for our guests. Molly&apos;s did an amazing job with decorating our cake, and as usual, everything was fantastic and delivered at the venue without any issues. Ordering cupcakes was also a perfect way to accommodate our guests who had special dietary needs, allowing us to offer vegan and gluten-free options.

I would absolutely recommend Molly&apos;s to anyone looking for delicious and budget-friendly options for their wedding cake!"
5,"Holy shit I don&apos;t usually leave long reviews but I have so many feels about these cupcakes.

1. They have FILLING it is brilliant and delicious and improves them x 1000.
2. They are so light and fluffy and not at all dense and heavy like cupcakes usually are.
3. The icing is also light and fluffy and not 3 inches of hard gross wax that falls off as soon as you bite into it.
4. They are exactly as delicious as they look.
5. They were still just as good the next morning."
5,"Best cupcakes in town! amazing 
Let me tell you guys When I say they&apos;re amazing I mean it best customer service also very friendly people"
5,"I&apos;ve been here countless times but I hadn&apos;t been back in awhile so I had to remind myself just how good these cupcakes are. Now they have other locations but this main one makes the absolute best cupcakes by far. I got half a dozen of their cupcakes and every single one was amazing. I&apos;m more of a fruity and vanilla cupcake person so I really enjoyed the peach cobbler, blueberry cheesecake, and creme brûlée cupcakes. The peach cobbler cupcake has such light and flavorful cream on top, as you can also see in the picture, it is absolutely heavenly to bite into. The cake itself is also incredibly moist and filled with a wonderful peach flavored jam. Easily one of the best made cupcakes around. The blueberry cheesecake was equally moist and flavorful and I very much enjoyed the crunchy texture of the cookie pieces on top. I also absolutely loved the sugar and crunch on the outside of the creme brûlée mixed with the softness and moisture of the cake inside, I just wish there was more fruit on top!. Each bite was again, amazing though. The other cupcakes, peanut butter Nutella and the famous Ron Bennington are more my family&apos;s favorites because they love chocolate and Nutella. Per their report, the cupcakes were incredibly soft again while very rich in flavors. You really can&apos;t go wrong here and there&apos;s a cupcake for everyone. I love the uniqueness of their cupcakes and the amazing quality that only comes from very highly skilled bakers."
4,"My wife and I both love Molly&apos;s Cupcakes! The price is steep but they&apos;re super rich, very filling, and definitely worth it. Would highly recommend all of the flavors. This was our first time ordering in advance and picking up during the pandemic. Only taking off one star because the employee was very rude when I arrived to pick up our order."
5,AMAZING!!! First time at Molly&apos;s and would recommend to everyone! They had such a wide variety of cupcakes and flavors for all palettes. Very decent pricing and the gals working were so sweet! Yummy yummy yummy!
5,"By far the BEST cupcakes in the city. We were eating dinner nearby &amp; decided to swing by this place (so glad we did). I got the creme brûlée cupcake and my brother got the butterscotch caramel. Both of the cupcakes were filled and so so good!!! Personally, I thought the butterscotch caramel was a bit too sweet. Nonetheless, it was still delicious. We also arrived to Molly&apos;s cupcakes very close to closing and they still had a wide variety of cupcakes available for us and the staff was very friendly. 

So excited to stop by again and try more flavors!"
5,"There&apos;s no better way to fill the time at home than to fill your stomach with essence of butter and cake combined into a small handheld batch of perfection. 

No other cupcake is as rich and well rounded compared to what Molly&apos;s has to offer. Get the Cookie Monster, it is heaven for $4.

The above is my Sons review- for me the cookies and cream is To Die For. Followed closely by the white chocolate raspberry."
5,"One word--addictive! If you come here even for just one cupcake, be prepared to return again, and again, and again... 
This particular location can get really crowded on weekends, so it&apos;s worth considering taking your sweets to go and eating them at home if you live in the area. Also, definitely do not count on being able to find parking if you drive here. 
My favorite flavors are the crème brûlée and the peanut butter nutella."
5,"Just when I thought I couldn&apos;t love Molly&apos;s more *boom* I discover something new....smh
I went to Molly&apos;s for my usual creme brulee cupcake and while I was there I noticed they had cheesecake. I usually just focus on the cupcakes and go but today I got distracted. I spotted their turtle cheesecake.  Had to have it!! Now did I get it instead of my cupcake? Of course not. I got both... lol (yes I&apos;m greedy)
This cheesecake was EVERYTHING!! It is regular cheesecake with a graham cracker crust topped with chocolate, caramel and lots of delicious pecans. OMG, it was fantastic. I couldn&apos;t eat the whole thing in one sitting but it&apos;s definitely possible if you really love cheesecake. Now I have another item I must have when I visit Molly&apos;s."
4,"Molly&apos;s is a Chicago institution. They have an array of maybe 12-15 different types of cupcakes available, including their famous &apos;center filled&apos;. 

I had the Salted Caramel Butterscotch and it was delicious. The cake was moist with a nice crispy caramel top and edge and was filled with a delicious salted caramel buttercream.

Will definitely be back!"
5,"So as I&apos;m leaving the neighboring Del Seoul, I spy with my greedy eye a cupcake establishment. Signage touts that Molly&apos;s was the season finale winner on the Food Network show &quot;Cupcake Wars&quot;. Good golly Miss Molly, you did that girl! Way to go.

You go inside and it&apos;s a warmly lit, cozy establishment with swings  to spark a moment of nostalgia for the older crowd. They have seasonal flavor offerings and some interesting cupcakes that make you want to yell &quot;Give me one of each!&quot;

Thank you Molly for offering a generous military discount on your items. Each cupcake was wrapped with love and the workers were very patient, inviting and jovial.

Feel free to devour your scrumptious goodies on site or take them to your car or whatever hidey hole that you use to do unspeakable things to your desserts.

I can see myself going back to try more offerings and staying there to people watch."
5,"I love Molly&apos;s! The cupcakes are such perfect consistency &amp; the frosting is the best. Wayyyy better than Sprinkles. The Samoa is the best! 

And that&apos;s all I have to say about that. 

Jackée"
5,"Definitely got drawn in by the Cupcake Wars sign...and wow, they didn&apos;t disappoint! I got the White Chocolate Raspberry cupcake which is my favorite dessert flavor! The cupcake was delicious - the frosting was so light and fluffy which I love, and there was a surprise of white chocolate filling inside of the cupcake! And some raspberry flavor at the bottom! I absolutely loved this cupcake, can&apos;t wait to come back and try other flavors!"
5,"Delicious and creative cupcakes! I appreciate how the cupcakes are balanced in flavor; they&apos;re sweet but balanced so the flavor of the different ingredients really come through. 

Definitely get the center-filled cupcakes!! The flavors are creative and they taste soooo good. I&apos;ve tried many flavors but my favorites are the creme brûlée and cake batter. The creme brûlée cupcake has the custard filling and the caramelized sugar on top - it really tastes like creme brûlée! And cake batter cupcake reminds me of a birthday cake with funfetti base and cake batter center... YUM. I&apos;ll definitely be back for more when I need a sweet treat :)"
5,"Molly&apos;s was the first cupcake place I ever visited in Chicago, and so far, it&apos;s been the best. Their cupcake flavors are creative, delicious, and clearly beautiful. I don&apos;t necessarily have a favorite, though their red velvet kills, but my girlfriend would swim an ocean for their creme brulee. Even though we&apos;re living in tough times, Molly&apos;s signed up for Uber Eats which allowed me to get them for her birthday - thank you, Molly&apos;s! 

What I love most is that they&apos;re sweet without being too rich. I&apos;m someone who needs to crave sweets and can&apos;t eat a bunch at a time, but Molly&apos;s, I&apos;ll have almost always. I also distinctly remember enjoying their atmosphere. Although small, it&apos;s very welcoming and fun to sit on their swings. 

Molly&apos;s, we love you!"
