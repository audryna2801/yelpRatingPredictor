5,"Stopped by during the covid indoor dining ban and ate on their heated outdoor patio. 

The patio has three four top tables and two two tops. 

Upon entry our contact information was recorded for contact tracing purposes, our temperature was taken as well. 

The tented in dining area does not have Kuma&apos;s signature soundtrack playing, this made for a more intimate experience than what would normally be had in the dining room. 

I ordered a lunch portion of the plague bringer with sweet potato fries, and my partner ordered the led zepalin. I was surprised I could order a lunch portion at four in the afternoon, but I was glad as it was plenty of food for my appetite.

The plague bringer was excellent. Although it is a late entry, it has easily taken the number one spot for best burger of 2020."
5,"Even though we didn&apos;t get the experience of being inside surrounded by loud heavy metal, Kuma&apos;s still exceeded all of my delicious burger expectations. We sat outside on the patio and were very pleased with the social distancing and safety measures they have in place. The service, beer selection and burgers were all incredible. I got the neurosis and hubs got the pantera - we got a huge kick reading over the all names and descriptions! The bathroom was also super graffitied out and a perfect addition to the ambience. Hopefully we can come back and feel comfortable sitting inside once this pandemic is behind us some day!!"
5,"I feel so very fortunate to live walking distance from this gem of an establishment. Kuma&apos;s has done an outstanding job of adapting to COVID regulations. My order was being neatly wrapped up as I walked in to pick up. As always, the staff were welcoming and cheerful. Rock on!"
5,"Delicious Iron Maiden burger, fresh sweet potatoes fries. Large chicken tenders with great tasting blue cheese.


Scrumptious every time!"
5,"Heavy metal and awesome burgers... head bangers couldn&apos;t ask for a better bar!
They have so many options for burgers that you can pretty much get whatever you&apos;re craving. 
Also, the portions are huge, so no way you leave hungry."
2,"What happened??? I wait 336 days for the sleep burger to return only to be disappointed. For appx 10 years i travel to the Original location, usually on November 1, to get what is normally the most delicious turkey burger in Chicago that is topped with an outstanding thanksgiving experience all in one bite. Not this year. I ordered online on Friday at 3:58 for pick up. Turkey burger itself was huge, almost too big, it was bland and disappointing. The stuffing was gushy and mushy and didn&apos;t stick to the sandwich like it normally does and didn&apos;t appear to be tempora fried.  Normally cranberry, stuffing, turkey and gravy are all in one bite not this time. I will say that the gravy was good. 

The original location burger use to have a peppery thyme season flavor and grilled to perfection. I knew something was different because when i ordered online it only took 10 min. The chef use to brag about the 20 min process to cook the perfect turkey burger. I have been known to eat at least 5 to 10 sleep burgers in November it usually is so GOOD i go back with a new friend. Can&apos;t say I&apos;ll return this time. 

There must be a new chef or change of ownership. This tasted like a wanna be sleep burger that i have had at the Schaumburg and Diversey locations.  If this is the new normal then the original sleep burger has been put to rest."
1,"Gross.

$72 for bloody burgers, three heady beers, and blaring music in my ears. 

We still left 20% tip.

We asked for medium and got bloody. 

Tip:  Masks for everytime you talk to the server. So if you don&apos;t want bloody burgers, loud metal music or to mask everytime then skip this place"
5,"I feel sorry for anyone who hasn&apos;t experienced kuma&apos;s sex in your mouth burgers. It&apos;s a must try at least once.

You may or may not be a fan of heavy metal music but when you&apos;re here, it&apos;s a vibe. The coolest thing I enjoy about kuma&apos;s is the diversity of people who visit. All age ranges, all different types of backgrounds-it&apos;s really for everyone and it makes me happy seeing everyone enjoy the food and the experience. I even saw a few baby strollers a few times, it&apos;s kid friendly!

The actual food is delicious. I always stick with the same burger-the Metallica. I&apos;m a sucker. Medium, juicy, succulent, perfectly cheesy and spicy with some bleu cheese and bacon. I go nuts. I.lose.my.shit. every time. 

You can choose between chips or fries for your meal, both are good but their fresh cut potato fries are SO good. Awesome beer selection and great apps. Love me some Mac and cheese and some fried pickles!

The best advice I can give you is it hits different when you haven&apos;t had it in a while. This is literally a once a year to once every two years type of thing for me. It&apos;s heavy and it&apos;s delicious; don&apos;t overdo it and ruin a good thing!

I&apos;ve gotten into debates about this burger and while it may not be the best you ever had (and may be for some) you can&apos;t argue it&apos;s up there in the charts without question."
5,"True Score: 5 Stars

Kuma&apos;s Corner is a rambunctious place - loud heavy metal music, lots of people talking, busy serving staff, signs everywhere - making it incredibly fun! There are AMAZING burger combinations, enormous Mac &amp; Cheese plates, and an extensive list of craft beers available. We shared an order Fried Pickles, then each ordered a burger. The portions are huge, so despite everything being incredibly tasty, I could only finish half of my order. If you like spicy, edgy, over-the-top combinations this is your place. Don&apos;t come if you&apos;re squeamish, like quiet, or aren&apos;t tolerant of all types.

Excellent beer selection too, burgers are all built quite cleverly with different toppings, but the true greatness is the burger itself. Seasoned perfectly and cooked to temp.

For the record, my choice that day was the &quot;YOB&quot; burger. I really wish I can learn to prepare such meat at home! Too bad that we went to this place on our last day before leaving Chicago, otherwise I would have gone back to try a new one! 

Congratulations to the restaurant and those who are reading, no need to look for more alternatives for burgers. You can just grab your wallet and go!  Great spot!

Thanks"
2,"I was honestly hoping that they would&apos;ve met my expectations as it was my 1st time eating from here. Made an online order and request a medium well Kuma burger with fried onions, mayo, and extra patty. End result was a well done burger, no extra patty, no fried onions, and no mayonnaise. Very disappointed"
4,"Good burger options, I keep going down the list with every visit. Mac and cheese is worth a try."
4,"When I first heard about this place, I thought &quot;tourist trap.&quot; It&apos;s a bit off the beaten path though, about a half mile from the train station if you&apos;re taking public transportation. It&apos;s definitely a ways away from the touristy spots in Chicago. In the downtown loop there is a gimmicky version, but this location is the original. It is in fact on the corner, hence the name. 

There is a lot of cool art and rock memorabilia. There is a good selection of beers on draught. Let&apos;s talk about the burger: this burger was pretty damn good. Again, I set my expectation low, but I was pleasantly surprised. I had the Yob, which had a big old roasted red pepper on it, for which I am a sucker. The burger was juicy and filling. I am a fan. I&apos;ve only made it up to this location once, sadly. The other times I&apos;ve popped into the West Loop location. It&apos;s has a lot less character, but the burgers are still solid, it&apos;s just easier to get to from where I usually stay. One of these days, when I have a lot more time in Chicago, I&apos;ll definitely be popping back into the OG Kuma&apos;s Corner."
4,"I know Kuma&apos;s is famous for their burgers but it was the sides that I loved while the burger was actually quite boring. I got the original Kuma&apos;s burger, which had a fried egg and bacon on it. I found the burger to be fairly plain and the meat overcooked. I ordered it medium well but it tasted  way too over cooked, dry, and flavorless. I expected more seasoning in the meat but it was overall fairly forgettable. I loved the sweet potato fries because they were soft and moist with great seasoning on it. The sides were definitely the highlight though. The jalapeño peppers came with a wonderful jam dipping sauce that accented the savory cheese surprisingly well. The fried pickles had wonderful seasoning and even better dipping sauce. Some of the best fried pickles I&apos;ve ever had because they were also the perfect thickness! The chicken tenders were so incredibly soft they practically fell apart while the dipping sauces again added complimentary flavors. Overall, the burgers are definitely over hyped while these sides seem to be overlooked."
3,"Eat there, pick up your food, but for God sake don&apos;t ever order delivery!

Ive eaten at Kumas several times before Covid and brought home food during Covid.  Bottom line is this; they have great food, beer, and a wonderful atmosphere.  

The reason for anything less than 5 stars is because of their delivery service and my most recent experience.  I realize they outsource delivery, but their choices reflect on their business.  The driver got lost, food arrived 45 min after leaving Kumas and arrived soggy cold (unedible).  When so many are out of work, have some pride in your product and hire your own people instead of using incompetent 3rd parties.  Id pay more and so would many others if you asked.  Your product deserves better!

Again, for anyone picking up or eating in you will be very happy.  Next time I will pick it up myself.  For the Doordash delivery driver, you get 0 stars."
4,"I happened upon this spot by the proposal from a companion; the staff is mindful and inviting making astounding mixed drinks (I recommend the Adrenaline) and nourishment. Regardless of whether you are simply up for a beverage, in case you&apos;re a metalhead, this is the spot for you!"
2,The only reason this review gets 2 stars is because the jalapeño poppers were bomb. The burger was horrible. Fries were okay. The buns were stale. Didn&apos;t even toast them. When I ask the nice waitress she starts to make an excuse saying  it was too busy and they don&apos;t have space on the grill to toast the buns and that they don&apos;t normally toast them. Literally lying to my face. I was expecting an apology. On top of that they mixed up my medium burger with my friends medium rare when they handed it to us. This is my first time trying it and not at all what I expected. Burger was falling apart because buns were hard. One of the worst tasting burgers I ever had. Rather get some five guys.
4,"We have finally made it to the original Kuma&apos;s Corner location on Belmont last weekend.  The four of us stopped by on a Saturday about 4PM, so at such a non-peak hour we were seated right away though the crowd was considerable already. The drink menu is massive with many excellent local-centric selections so it takes awhile to flip through all the lovely choices. The burgers have crazy names to go along with the heavy metal soundtrack. The Mastodon burger has cheddar cheese, bacon, fried onions and BBQ sauce over a 10 ounce beef patty. Along with the side of fries (or you can get potato chips), three of the four of us wound up taking leftover burger home. 

The service was fine, without any nasty rock and roll attitude. The one odd thing was going to the men&apos;s room. The toilet was literally like a sauna - my bud commented that the heat from the hand dryer was &quot;cooler&quot; than the temperature of the bathroom. I suspect the sauna effect was a malfunction and not a nod to heavy metal hell."
2,"Kuma&apos;s usually does not disappoint but today was the exception to the rule.  After waiting over 45 minutes four our food, the mac n cheese was barely still warm.  When the waiter asked how our food was he spoke to the manager who said they would remake it.  After waiting 45 minutes for it the first time, I declined since I did not want to spend my entire afternoon in the restaurant."
5,"Metal themed restaurant and bar. This is the original location and it&apos;s very small so there&apos;s almost always going to be a wait. I understand there are a few other locations. My friends from Chicago took me. It&apos;s one of those places that if you go to Chicago and you like metal and especially if you like burgers while listening to metal, you put it on your list. It&apos;s pretty straight forward. There&apos;s not too much more you can say other than it&apos;s good food and the atmosphere makes it better. As far as burger places go it&apos;s a little above average with different custom burgers named after metal bands but it&apos;s not some sort of super high end fancy burger. The music adds to the ambiance. I believe I was told that they put on a yearly music festival as well or have in the past. It&apos;s for sure worth going over a chain restaurant. You&apos;re going to pay the same price and not have to listen to adult contemporary or 90&apos;s pop music and in the end isn&apos;t that what we all really want?"
5,"Come here if you&apos;re trying to indulge in a burger and fries while listening to various metal genres. Even if you&apos;re not a fan of metal, this place has such a great menu, you&apos;ll most likely enjoy any item you choose."
