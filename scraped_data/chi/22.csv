5,"So delicious! The honey butter fried chicken pizza is SO GOOD. It&apos;s sweet and spicy . The best flavors are happening in my mouth right now..I couldn&apos;t wait to write this review. They also have growlers to go for carry out as well! The carry out procedure was so easy and safe. 

We placed our order and it was ready in 30 minutes. We arrived and a staff member in a face mask greeted us and asked our name- (there&apos;s also a big sign with a number to call and they will bring your order to you) We wore masks inside our car and the staff did as well and stayed as distant as possible (about the length of our medium Pizza i guess you&apos;d say haha) . Definitely bringing our growler back to be refilled and ordering this pizza again!"
5,"Finally tried Piece! It&apos;s been on my list for a while now but I rarely make it up to this neighborhood. If I&apos;m being honest, I went to try Pizza Friendly Pizza but they were sold out a few hours after opening. Super disappointed and still in the mood for pizza so we called in a quick pickup order.

On the phone, the woman told us 30 minutes but it was only a 6 min drive and we only had to wait 10-15. We got the large since it was only a few dollars more than the medium and it was HUGE. But hey, pizza next day in the toaster oven is always a plus.

To the food - we couldn&apos;t decide between the Honey Butter Chicken or the Atomic Sausage so we went half and half. They have a rule that you can only have one pizza sauce and the HBC comes with white, so we went with that. It was a great move because both halves were DELICIOUS. I&apos;ve been disappointed with some recent Chicago pizza but Piece holds a candle to hype. 

It&apos;s sort of a hand tossed-thickness for the crust and the toppings were plentiful. The white sauce was good - will try the red sauce soon and report back - and both flavors were unique and bomb.

Compared to other pizza places, the prices were similar but you got a lot more! We will definitely be traveling north for some more! We&apos;d love to dine in next time and grab some beer as well. Great job, Piece!"
5,"Tried this place for the first time and I have zero complaints! Pick up was super easy and the large pizza was huge. Love the style of this pizza and crunch! Will order in the future but not as often because it is a little on the pricier side. Great pizza for hosting, etc."
2,"Breath taking. No literally, I was gasping for air while choking down the extremely dry pizza. I&apos;m still trying to figure out how the reviews are so great, but my butter chicken pizza was just disappointing. I&apos;m actually wondering &quot;maybe they were overwhelmed and just gave me the short end of the stick?&quot;. There is no way that pizza was $30 or the pizza everyone is raving about. 

Look, I want to be sensitive because of covid and I understand things are tough, but the pizza was trash and their system for pickup was . You order an hour in advance. Show up and put your name in. (My guess is they don&apos;t start making the pizza until you check in). Then wait 25-30 minutes more for them to bring it out. What&apos;s the point of ordering ahead?  I&apos;m not mad, just disappointed."
4,"[COVID-19 Take out review]

If you are in the mood for thin crust pizza (New Haven-Style), Piece is the place to go to! We ordered for take out (didn&apos;t see them on Grubhub or UberEats so you&apos;ll need to phone in your order) and was not disappointed by their pizza! The selection is small compared to other pizzarias, but they have perfected their selection! 

We ordered 2 medium pizzas between the 3 of us and we had leftovers for the next day! The medium sized pizzas were the size of a large at other places! We ordered the spicy sausage (red pizza) and the honey butter fried chicken (white pizza). Both were very delicious! 4.5/5 (I think it tasted even better the day after!).

For an appetizer, we ordered the goat cheese, which came with warm garlic bread. Very unique and definitely worth a try if you want something different! (5/5)

Overall, a great place to order thin crust pizza! 

So yummy!"
4,"Was surprised with dinner from here for my birthday! It was on my list of places to try, but covid it has made it tricky. It was delivered to my house and honestly was disappointed at how cold it was! The food seemed to have been out for hours. The taste was still there, which is why I&apos;m giving it 4 stars, but definitely won&apos;t order delivery if it&apos;s going to come cold."
4,"Really enjoy piece, everything from the food to the drinks. Have always had a good experience here and just before traveling for the holidays, we decided to get a couple pizzas to go. In general, I would give 5 stars but for pick up, deducting because there was a big line outside that we were waiting in. After about 5-10 min, people in line started asking each other how long they had been waiting. I called the front desk again and asked about pick up, she told me you had to call to tell them you were there and they would bring it out. No sign telling you that nor no mention when you placed the order. Immediately, I told the line and everyone started calling the front office and pizzas were flying out the door. Food was great but directions could have been more clear."
3,"Review for takeout - 2 custom pizzas. A red pizza with italian sausage, fresh tomatoes, basil. A white pizza with honey butter fried chicken, caramelized onions, mushrooms.

Crust simply wasn&apos;t great. Very chewy. Cheese was similar. We weren&apos;t able to eat our pizzas until 30 min later so maybe that&apos;s a factor. 

In general, most of toppings and sauce were good. I especially liked the caramelized onions. The glaring disappoinment was the honey butter fried chicken. It was chunks of dry chicken breast. Not fried. No honey. And again, dry.

The prices are decent and the large pizzas were actually large so that&apos;s good."
4,"Was seated quickly and temperature checked before sitting down. Got crowded relatively quickly but as expected for a Sunday afternoon and tables were well spaced apart. 

For 2, we split a small red pepperoni pizza which was the right size for a small lunch. Came out quickly and hot! Good thin and crispy/chewy crunch, much denser than what I&apos;m used to coming from NY. The pizza and pepperonis were wonderfully salty. Will be back!"
4,We love us some piece pizza. They are taking Covid seriously which is great. For carryout I&apos;ve had two weird experiences where they couldn&apos;t find my order for a while cause I ordered with DoorDash and that causes issues and the second time I called it it had no issue with the pick up but it was missing the meats when I opened at home. Can&apos;t wait till normal so we can go back again in person.
4,"Don&apos;t be like me! Make a reservation, or order in advance. I had been craving pizza and decided to give Piece a try after reading so many great reviews. I went on a Friday night without a reservation, please please please make a reservation or you will be disappointed. I popped up around 7pm, and the hostess informed me that they were booked for the evening if you did not have a reservation. She did inform me that the bar was, &apos;first come-first serve&apos; but after waiting for about twenty-minutes no one budged, so I decided to go next door to &apos;Piece Out&apos; (love that lol) to order my pizza to-go. So in walking up, you have to still call and place your order to-go via telephone although there is a person sitting at the door... We&apos;ll just say for efficiency?? So I called, placed my order and she informed me it would take 50 mins. Fifty, 5-0. I was a bit flustered, but also its a busy neighborhood, on a Friday, I should have made a reservation, or called in advance so totally my fault. 

Any who, I ordered the &apos;Honey Butter Fried Chicken Pizza&apos; and after tasting it, I didn&apos;t care that I spent over an hour trying to get to this pizza! Literal fried chicken on the pizza (and you can taste the honey flavoring) scallions, buffalo sauce, and like little fried pieces they refer to as  &apos;crunchies.&apos; I ordered a medium and literally ate the pizza for two days straight. You definitely get bang for your buck, they cut the slices huge! My only critique (outside of the wait time) is the crust was a little tough by the time I made it home, and gets more tough as you reheat it. Still highly recommend!! Go get you some!!"
5,Been here several times and nothing beats it when you&apos;re craving this style. I know it&apos;s New Haven but this is what I consider NY style anyway (sue me). This time however I grabbed a growler of the Citra Haze and it was so great! I&apos;ve had their Pilsner dining in before and it was great but these guys don&apos;t get the recognition they deserve for their beer.
1,"Covid has been around for a year and it&apos;s not an excuse to treat your carry out customers like caddle.  Really subpar communication and expectation management.  It&apos;s chicago winter, making people stand outside for 15 minutes for you to &quot;find an order&quot; is unacceptable.  Figure it out"
5,"I had been craving Piece - it had been sooo long and I made the mistake of following them on Instagram so I was taunted on a daily!

Started the meal with the goat cheese appetizer. So damn good! I order it every time. 

For the pizzas, we got the special that was with heirloom tomatoes, pesto, fresh basil and mozzarella. I thought it was pretty good - I&apos;m not a huge pesto fan but this one tasted like a Margherita Pizza with a twist. We also ordered a white pizza with bacon &amp; caramelized onions  - half with mashed potatoes, half with clams. Delicious! I love their crust and there just isn&apos;t another pizza around here that has the taste that they have. The mashed potatoes - sounds weird, but try it...trust me! Next time I want to try it on a red pizza!

I might have ordered a small cheese pizza to-go for myself...don&apos;t judge me!"
4,"I&apos;ve been to Piece pizza multiple times over the years. Great place to meet up for casual pizza and beer with a group. It was recently also voted in top 10 out of 100 best pizza places in the US! 

Usually the food is great! I always tend to get the red pizza base and add a few toppings that the group would like. My to go order is the red base with gardinera and spinach and garlic  the crust is nice and flaky with a good ratio of toppings throughout the pie. The trays they use make it easy to share the pizza and still converse without a huge high pizza dish blocking your view of your friends across the table.

I did go recently and they have COVID precautions. There was an empty table in between our group and another party. Hand sanitizer at the door AND a personal bottle for the table. Temperature checks when you walk in. I&apos;m not sure if there was any changes made to the recipes since COVID but this time I felt like the pizza tasted different. The crust on one of the pizzas was super thin and made the pizza super crispy (not bad but not usually what the pizza is like here). We got a white base pizza and it was very overcooked by just looking at the color on top. Hoping it was a fluke and will be back soon!"
1,"Nice thin crust pizza. It&apos;s not NYC style and quite frankly this place is overrated and overpriced for what they offer. Go to Dominos instead or just stick to Chi-style deep dish. The owner also has time to troll you on Yelp if you leave an honest opinion for them. I&apos;m glad the rest of their service staff wasn&apos;t as terrible as the owner lol. Kudos to the staff for keeping up with a troll of a boss

We will be happy to drop this from our Chicago must haves going forward.

The owner responded with a variety of articles showcasing how great of a place Piece is. While I don&apos;t doubt the articles, this is exactly why it is overrated!! It&apos;s just regular overpriced thin crust pizza. The place doesn&apos;t offer anything outstanding so I would rather go to Dominoes which has a great impression of NYC style pizza for $7 than spend $32 for a half as good pizza here."
5,"Absolutely delicious thin-crust pizza. Their beer is pretty good, too! Definitely recommend the atomic doug&apos;s pizza"
4,"Pizza was really great! Dough has perfect thickness, cheese melts in mouth. And if you order large it is really LARGE!)) I could say good quantity for its price. If not slow service then would be full 5 star"
5,We have ordered Piece a fee times for delivery and it is always great and so consistent. Thank you to the team at piece!
5,"We couldn&apos;t be happier that Piece has reopened for carryout &amp; delivery.  It&apos;s our favorite pizza place in Chicago.***

Piece does New Haven-style pizza.  I&apos;m not going to pretend that I know what that means, but it&apos;s a thin crust, in the same ballpark as a New York slice, but not cut into slices that are the size of your head.

I&apos;m largely a carnivore when it comes to pizza, and the pepperoni, bacon, meatballs and (especially) Hot Doug&apos;s Atomic Sausage are all on point.  The sauce is not on the sweet side, and that&apos;s to my liking.

I&apos;ve enjoyed every beer I&apos;ve had here as well, and I&apos;m looking forward to the day when we can once again imbibe on-premise.  It&apos;s a rare trip to Wicker Park that doesn&apos;t start or end at Piece.



***Full disclosure: I think deep-dish pizza is wildly overrated, and were I not married to a Malnati&apos;s fan, I&apos;d never go near the stuff.  But had I opened with this, half of you would have stopped reading."
