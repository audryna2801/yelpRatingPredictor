5,"Tonight we were in the mood for Korean BBQ Chicken, but our usual (Crisp) was newly closed on Sundays. Our search brought us to Del Seoul and we are so excited to add this gem to our rotation!

First, ordering online was super easy. I&apos;m a pictorial person and having photos of the food was super helpful. The order was ready right when it said it would be! 

Second, COVID-19 precautions were followed. Our meal pickup was safe and followed necessary restrictions! Thanks keeping the safety of your employees and customers first, Del Seoul!

Third, the food was FANTASTIC! Portions were generous and prices were very reasonable! We started with the kimchi fries and they were decadent and full of flavor. We devoured them! 

We both tried the Original Ganpoongi Chicken and it blew our tastebud minds! The perfect synthesis of savory, spicy, and a hint of sweet! And the side of sticky rice to accompany helps to cool down the spice as needed.

We loved our to-go experience at Del Seoul and look forward to replicating it in the future!"
5,"They are consistently good. Take out today was Kalbi poutine, an excellent interpretation of this Canadian staple. No gravy on this one but still tasty. 

Next was the bibimbop, this was light on the meat but all the marinated veggies mixed with the rice was really flavorful. You get sweet, sour, and base tastings in this dish. 

Last was the O.G chicken. This is there take on Korean fried chicken - excellent, spicy no complaints."
4,"Came here twice during my last week in Chicago. I called the orders in, picked up 15 minutes later. It was an easy process. 

I really liked the Seoul Street dumplings and shrimp tacos my roommate and I got for our first order. Then for the second order, I ordered kimchi fries, a bbq taco and my roommate got the banh mi sandwich. The kimchi fries are split into two containers for takeout which was helpful for us since we were splitting but it wasn&apos;t until later that I realized that only half of them came with kimchi on them and I got the one without. The sauce for the fries was delicious though. The pork bbq taco was good but I prefer the shrimp. 

Overall, good casual dining and takeout spot. I meant to try this place when I first moved into the neighborhood and wish I had done so rather than waiting until my last week in the city!"
4,"It&apos;s been some time since I last ordered from Del Seoul (BC or Before Covid times), but absolutely missed it so I had to get my fill in. I opted for the kimchi fries and Kalbi &amp; Shrimp tacos. Super filling and hits the spot. I really enjoy the shrimp taco, it&apos;s nice and flavor full with every bite. It seems to be a very popular item on the menu. As I waited for my order to come out, I lost track of how many times i heard folks order a shrimp taco. I recommend it, nuff said. Enjoy! 

Their wings are pretty dope too. Saw some new dishes I wanted to try. Will have to make a comeback soon."
5,"It seems like more and more fusion places are popping up all over.  Del Seoul is one of them but as you can tell by the name it is geared more for many popular Korean foods.  This place has a fusion with Mexican, Japanese, Vietnamese and even Canadian foods also.  The food is great. The menu is not huge but still you may find yourself having a hard time from the options.  I decided to dive in by going with the K-Town wings, Kalbi poutine, and the bulgogi bento box.  The place can be a bit cozy and that means tight when it comes to seating.  The Kalbi poutine is best described as loaded fries topped with short rib and pickled onions on it. I do wish I got it with some kimchi on it.  The bento box was a good sampling of Korean bbq and the wings were crispy.  If you ever had Korean fried chicken from a certain other chain that sounds like wonton these are much better.  The only thing bad was that I knew once I left Chicago I would not be able to sample the foods until my next trip back.  A solid five stars."
5,"I&apos;ve been to Del Seoul too many times to count and have never had a bad experience. Literally everything on the menu is straight fire. Like most people, I went first for the tacos - they are known for the shrimp tacos but I looove the fish. I stayed for the bento boxes and the bibimbop, which are my go-tos now. When you can eat indoors, both come with hot stone plates that keep everything sizzling as you eat, but they are just as good as takeout. Oh, and THE WINGS are even better than that popular chicken wing place up broadway (crisp) - soo saucy and crunchy. They were on Guy Fieri&apos;s Diners Drive Ins and Dives for a reason ;) Also worth a shout out are the seasoned gamja fries, as they are so unique and addicting. Hmm, have I mentioned everything on the menu yet? Because you literally cannot go wrong here. 

I&apos;ve noticed that since COVID/lockdown they&apos;ve started selling takeaway, heat at home stir fry boxes. I think that is so creative and you bet it&apos;s next on my list to try here!! Oh, and they have been offering to-go beer and hard cider for suuuper cheap (at least for a restaurant). Go go go!"
5,"By far one of my favorite Korean fusion restaurants in the area. You can choose anything from the menu and know it&apos;s gonna rock your world. If you can&apos;t choose though I highly recommend Kimchi Fries ($8.25) or the Bulgogi Bento ($13.95). You have to remember that authenticity isn&apos;t the main goal here - it&apos;s creativity, more like Korean inspired dishes. As long as you keep that mindset you won&apos;t finish a meal unhappy!"
4,"Im not a huge fan of Korean food in general BUT i must say, I was so impressed with the food! The seasoned gamja fries (kids menu) were so good, as well as the spicy BBQ chicken taco (yum!). My brother had the kimchi fries and the bibimbap. Portions are generous and the flavors are spot on! Definitely worth a try. 
And now with Covid, they don&apos;t allow dine-in, but I would recommend take-away and heading to a nearby park to enjoy the meal."
5,"Order spicy tofu hotpot, kimchi fries and bulgogi beef rice bowl which is served cold and I had to heat it at home. I wish it wasn&apos;t served cold it would&apos;ve tasted better but I still give it a 5."
5,"Bestttt Korean tacos in the city. 

I usually order the sambal fish, kalbi short rib, and sesame chili shrimp. I don&apos;t know if I can pick a favorite though, that&apos;s super hard. Everything is so flavorful and at a great price too. Do yourself a favor and get the kimchi fries with an extra side of garlic sesame aioli. I&apos;m not a big fan of kimchi but these I can eat for days. The banh mi sandwiches from here are also pretty good! Can&apos;t wait to come back and try the bibimbop and hot pot."
4,"I haven&apos;t had Del Seoul in years but was able to grab some takeout a few weeks ago. 

They have a whole system for safely ordering and receiving takeout. I ordered two Kalbi tacos and they were better than I remember! Savory and salty that balances nicely with the coleslaw to neutralize the saltiness. 

Will definitely stop by again if I&apos;m in the area!"
3,"All this covid thing is very strange bc you realize how you miss people from the certain places. Yes people who male atmosphere.  
I loved to eat in Seoul. But sitting on the sidewalk with that paper bag, I just didn&apos;t feel good. 
Idk if food tasted same or worse bc of everything around. Thay put few tables out side but it was almost impossible with that weather and wind. 
I decided to sit and try to enjoy. 
I like food from this place. 
They are nice, trying to explain everything I asked behind that plastic shield. 
I ordered and sit outside to wait for food. 
After 10 min lady brings my order and I decided to eat it there. 
I ordered bowl with rice and veggies and taco. 
It was good. But yet I missed that mojo. 
Somehow that food just doesn&apos;t look that glorious anymore in that plastic container. 
I love to cook and when I go out to eat I wanna enjoy every part of dinning out. 
But I hope everything will return to normal soon."
1,"&quot;Eats at Kogi once&quot; was my kneejerk reaction to this place. The food is way too similar to Kogi for comfort but mediocre in every way, they don&apos;t even reheat the tortillas!"
5,"The wings are delicious so is the bimbimbop bowl! They have a variety of options, the place is clean and has a fun vibe. Highly recommend for a casual night out or weekday treat!"
5,"Came across Del Seoul, by seeing it on a episode of Guy Fieris show and had to try it. Got an order of the K-town chicken wings which were awesome! The sauce was amazing and the chicken was perfectly cooked. I really liked that the chicken was lollipopped, it made it less messy to eat and it was easier to get every last bit of meat off the bone. The shrimp tacos were fantastic. It was an explosion of flavor. The shrimp was perfectly fried. Also ordered the bbq pork taco, but it lacked a lot of flavor. All in all I highly recommend trying Del Seoul and definitely ordering the wings!"
5,"A few friends and I popped in here for lunch before we went to Wrightwood 659. It was a quick delicious meal!
We ordered Seoul Style pot stickers for the table. They were very meaty and good. 
I ordered 2 tacos; the shrimp and the short ribs. My favorite of the two was the shrimp. But I also liked the short ribs. Both had good spice and lots of crisp cool toppings to balance the heat. 
Frankly, I wanted to try one of everything... the wings at another table looked great. My friend&apos;s veggie bibimbap looked good and healthy.
I also had a beer with my meal. Perfect to balance the spice."
5,"I can&apos;t believe I have never written a review for Del Seoul, this has been my go to takeout place in Lakeview for the past 6 years. They are always reliable and their food is unique and delicious. I always get the shrimp tacos and the seasoned gamja fries, which are so good! They are usually really busy but they are always efficient and friendly. I moved to Evanston and I still venture all the way to Lakeview sometimes just to get tacos!"
5,"This is probably my favorite restaurant! When I don&apos;t know what I&apos;m in the mood for, i always end up w del Seoul bc it&apos;s a no brainer for quality, flavor and reasonable price! I&apos;m not a fan of tofu BUT their tofu taco here is actually amazing."
5,"Everything here was delicious I wish I found this place sooner. We came on a Saturday night with a few friends and got the following

Shrimp and Kalbi ( short rib) tacos. These were great the meat for both were seasoned really well and topped with the cabbage. I thought the amount of cabbage on the tacos would take the flavoring away from the meat but it did not. I think it made it even better.

Chicken wings these were slightly wet but very crunchy and full of flavor!

Pineapple and peach Soju ( dont be fooled by these little bottles you can actually get a few drinks in with these and a light buzz."
