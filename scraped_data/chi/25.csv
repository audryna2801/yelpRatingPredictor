5,"My wife and I got a well earned getaway weekend for our 10th anniversary! We decided to check out a new place we&apos;d never been to before. I had heard from several others that this place was outstanding so we decided to make a reservation for 6pm on their patio.

They offered patio or indoor seating and with the current COVID-19 Protocols we felt better about being outside. We felt very comfortable as we sat under their heat lamps and had a nice romantic dinner.

We started with their bread, which was about $9. I&apos;d say it&apos;s on the better end of the spectrum but certainly not worth the money. I mean, it&apos;s bread! 

Next we had the apple salad which was outstanding. I&apos;m not a huge apple fan but their salad blended sweet with spicy and was just the best. Then we ordered scallops and pork belly and were mesmerized by both. We decided to share everything and didn&apos;t regret it as we enjoyed every single dish they brought out. 

I would highly recommend this place to those seeking a &quot;close to normal&quot; dining experience!"
5,"If Covid&apos;s got you down and you want an excellent date night out with perfect food &amp; beverage, this is THE spot. Safe &amp; socially distant, and the menu is outstanding. They execute to perfection.

Since I&apos;m thorough, below is what we had:

Two kinds of west coast oysters I&apos;ve never had from Samich Bay, Washington: Samich Pearl (left) and Penn Cove (right). These are both third best in my mind next to Kumamotos and Kusshis. Loved em! 

Steak tartare with some seriously amazing *perfect* seeded rye bread, fresno chili dijonaise and fried shallot.

Midwestern cheese plate with fresh chevre, brie, and an ash rind gooey cheese, fennel roasted candied cashews, apricot preserves, and sweet cherries.

Not pictured, a lovely glass of Spanish cava paired with the oysters and a glass of French bordeaux just because. Plus, my hubby&apos;s Westmalle Dubbel beer which was on draft. The place has an extensive Belgian beer list, a well curated wine list, and pretty cocktails. 

I think the intention there is to go there and stuff yourself full of fresh baked bread, meat, and Belgian beer, but really I felt myself being drawn toward the vegetarian dishes. They looked stellar. Next time!

Keep up the good work Publican, your servers are doing a phenomenal job!"
5,"*pre covid review* 

Hands down one of the best brunch places in the city. Their food is just great. If you are open to trying something new but that still feels like comfort food and is delicious then this is the spot. We usually come here for brunch and it is never repetitive. Their menu has a few staples (like their mouth watering, thick, and tender bacon) that don&apos;t change much and then their main dishes which rotate and change. I love that because it means that you are forced to try something different every time. It seems risky on their end but it allows them to remain creative with new dishes and I appreciate that. 
Aside from the amazing food, the staff is great and always attentive. They take reservations which is another reason why I love them but they do book up fairly quickly for brunch some times. 

Overall I love Publican and I highly recommend coming here for brunch or dinner!"
3,"Maybe it was because I came here for brunch but I had very high expectations for this place. Due to Covid, we reserved the prepaid seating in the outdoor igloos and had trouble ordering enough to fulfill the $50 each minimum. Each main dish was ~$15. We ordered the chicken and dumpling, publican scramble (spinach, crema, and crispy shallots), and the pork belly hash. All the food were a little too salty and fatty for my taste but the portions were decent. 

While the food was not very impressive, the drinks were delicious! The bourbon cream coffee and the pear hot toddy hit the spot especially on a cold morning dining outdoors. 

The service was a little a confusion. The waitstaff seemed to be in a rush, perhaps due to the pre-paid outdoor dining time limit and constantly checked to see if we were done with our food. 

However, I have heard good things about its dinner options and willing to try again!"
3,"First time here and first time doing the prepaid seating and our experience has been terrible so far. I understand there&apos;s a pandemic but that shouldn&apos;t be an excuse for a &quot;high end&quot; restaurant. They couldn&apos;t find our prepaid $45 reservations and they don&apos;t have 70% of the menu. We weren&apos;t told this until after we already sat down. I had 4 choices to pick from prior to my arrival and they don&apos;t have every single one of them. We had to rush to order and was completely off guard by the lack of choices. I heard raving reviews of this place and always wanted to give it a try. I support my local restaurants and businesses and this is not a good representation. I only have it 2 stars since they were somewhat accommodating to not being able to find our prepaid reservation and the mask policy is strictly enforced. Otherwise it would have been a 1 star.

Update: the server and manager were apologetic about our experience. Therefore, I upped it another star."
4,"Went for Sunday brunch on 11/22 in the igloos. Great staff, I mean stellar, excellent people. They provided recommendations, knew the menu (super important), and were honest - just down right awesome service. I was not a fan of the hash browns though. The menu literally says &quot;hash browns&quot; but they are deep fried in butter and they were very crispy like hard(maybe some people like that).  

The domes are not heated I would suggest dressing warm, and there is metered parking in walking distance. I loved the new branada toast (it&apos;s not avocado toast although it looks like it on Instagram). The chicken and dumplings were good, skillet looked good really can&apos;t go wrong."
5,"No matter what you do, get whatever dish features pork belly... either brunch or dinner. You won&apos;t be disappointed. Bloody Mary&apos;s are great too."
5,"Had a fantastic experience at publican. Beer and wine list is so well rounded, truly something for everyone. We had the scallops, bread and fish dip, oysters, bbq carrots and charc plate. Everything was FANTASTIC! My fiancé a little bummed because ham plate was taken off of menu."
4,"Outdoor seating with translucent pods is a thing and it looks cool. This block of Fulton St is lined with them and you need to have your selfie taken here. 

The publican does comfort food right. By it self the dishes were fine taken as a whole, they take it up a notch. 

The farm chicken with au jus on a bed of French fries is having not only a savory and well seasoned bird but is like having poutine at the same time. The side sausage is good counter to the richness of the bird. By the way the dark meat is absolutely delicious.

The BBQ carrot tasted like meat carrot. It did not taste like a vegetable. Our server suggested the mussels which my wife and son really liked. The bread it came with was excellent. 

Fulton is now bougie - that comes with prices to match just be aware of that when you dine here."
4,"The Publican is a must visit in Chicago for brunch! And during COVID and indoor dining shutdown, they offer outdoor tent dining or individual bubble/ house dining (requires $150 deposit which is non-refundable and is applied towards your restaurant bill.) -- We did the tent and we&apos;re plenty warm. You can make reservations online, but we were able to get a table on Sunday in 45° weather without a reservation. The service was good and the food was delicious! I ordered a bourbon cream coffee which was a bit too bourbony for me, but I think bourbon lovers would go nuts for this! -- Will definitely be back to try more dishes!"
3,"We ate in one of the igloos- &quot;private domes&quot;- they are not heated. The reservation system says &quot;dine without the elements.&quot; You are in the elements when it is cold out, the description is quite misleading. The igloos also have an open flap which also lets a lot of heat escape. 
This should also be made clear when making a reservation and paying a non refundable $200 deposit. Overall food was great, naturally got cold fast but the courses were well spaced. The service was a bit slow especially for how few tables there were."
2,"We invited friends for dinner, who never ate at Publican, for what we thought will be a great dinner at a reputable place. We have dined here before, more than once, and also recommended the restaurant to people from out of town, so what could go wrong, right? Well let&apos;s just say it was not a great experience we hoped for and our guests weren&apos;t really that impressed. Why? Simple, it was the service. The stuff seemed so displeased to be there it made for a disappointing experience. Please retrain them! Food was good, no complains there. However, there&apos;s so many other places with great food in Chicago that one could go to where they can feel welcomed. Oh, and maybe next time when there&apos;s snow, clear your the pathway to the restaurant. Or at least put some salt, so no one slips on ice."
3,"I experienced a problem with my delivery order from the Publican which was not satisfactorily addressed over the phone that evening, so I emailed the restaurant the next day and never received a reply. That was over a week ago, so I finally decided to write this review.  Delivery service was exceptional and on-time, and the food and cocktail were top-notch; however, the order I received was not correct even though I called on the day-of to confirm my order.

I ordered one Up-For-Anything and one Pescatarian, but received two Pescatarians.  I called the restaurant once I realized the mistake, and the host first offered to leave a &quot;note&quot; to &quot;do something for us&quot; the next time we visit.  I declined this because we are not currently dining out (hence the delivery order) and because we are moving out-of-state and may not have a chance to return in the near term anyway.  Then he offered to refund one half of the cocktail, and finally to refund the full cocktail to try to make up for the error.  I accepted this because I could not stay on the phone any longer, and I appreciated the gesture, but I was left feeling very disappointed in the exchange given the cost of the meal.  The host indicated that the chef chose the same fish dinner as the up-for-anything option because &quot;he thought we would like it,&quot; which we did...but if I had wanted two Pescatarians, I would have ordered two Pescatarians.

I chose to order from the Publican for my husband&apos;s birthday because he loves them for the interesting meat dishes, and because he loves chef&apos;s-surprise experiences. And since we will be moving, I was thrilled to find this delivery option to give him a last chance to experience this restaurant since we cannot dine out. I chose the up-for-anything dinner for him and the seafood for myself.  So I was very disappointed because the birthday treat I intended for him did not come, but instead we had double of my own meal.

Again, even though it was not correct it was all delicious and well-prepared, and I appreciated the responsiveness on the phone that night. But I was bothered that the seemingly token comp wasn&apos;t even offered until my third expression of disappointment. My experience went from excitement over a special occasion high-end meal to a less-than-expected dinner experience and an underwhelming feeling of my problem being dismissed. This is not the sort of experience I expect to have at the Publican, which historically has been very good."
1,"Terrible service.No hospitality.
We booked the weekend brunch and when we arrived we had to wait a lot until seated then waited again for the order...and again when checking out.our server was cold and showed no hospitality.
There was a lot of trashes around our outdoor seating.
Very, very unpleasant.
Our server told us that  waffle and schnitzel were unavailable, at the timing of ordering , but he should have informed us before...
And food was also average, blunt, no surprise.
Just very much pricey for their portion.
And they charged us full price though we already put $30 in advance , when we booked online...so we had to ask the server to correct it.
Never come back."
5,"Let&apos;s shine a spotlight on another restaurant that has been truly amazing during the pandemic. 

First, the food is great, even if you don&apos;t order pork. The roast chicken is delicious, with a nicely salty sauce that goes perfectly on their fries, and the sides are interesting, textured, satisfying, and creative. I&apos;m thinking of the bbq carrots with ranch sauce, the burrata with tons of veggies, etc. And the desserts - an important and tough test in my household - are superlative. 

Second, they deliver! To Hyde Park! I don&apos;t mind doing some curbside pickup when I have to, but with little kids at home and Chicago traffic being what it is, I award a huge premium to any place that will give me 30-60 minutes of my life back by delivering to my door. Down here in the ivory tower we don&apos;t have a ton of amazing delivery options. But Publican is one of them.

Third, the customer service goes above and beyond. We had planned out a great spread for a Friday night dinner. The spread arrived, but missing our roast chicken. Hamlet without the prince and all that. Many restaurants would have just apologized and refunded the chicken. But the Publican recognized that without the chicken, dinner was ruined. They rushed the chicken through the kitchen and packed it into an Uber Connect. It arrived before we were done with the first course, and saved the day. And on top of that, they added a loaf of the best Publican bread for free. And they STILL refunded the chicken. 

When I worry about whether the Chicago restaurant scene will survive the pandemic, I think: as long as places like the Publican survive, we will be ok."
2,"I have dined here many times and have never been disappointed until Sunday, Valentines Day.  We had reservations for 10 am (when they opened) and we arrived about 10 minutes early.  We walked in to the lobby area as it was single digit temperatures outside and were met by a very rude hostess.  In a stern but loud voice she let all diners waiting that the restaurant did not open until 10 and no one would be seated before that.  

When we were seated, I quickly realized that something was wrong with the heat because it could not have been 60 degrees inside.  If it were any colder I think I would&apos;ve been able to see my breath.  I ordered coffee and a Bloody Mary and the coffee was amazing.  I noticed that my Bloody Mary was taking a long time and noticed it sitting at the bar.  It sat there for 10 minutes until the server came back into the dining room and finally served it.  

Our food took a long time but I could see they were doing a massive number of carry out orders and understood the kitchen was busy.  I looked for my server as I wanted a refill on my coffee but he again disappeared.  After waiting about 30 minutes longer, our food arrived.  It was room temperature and based on how cold the room was it was safe to say it was cold.  

We sent our food back and we&apos;re met with dirty looks from a guy who I assumed was the person in charge but not once did he come over and apologize for the poor service and cold food.

This was a first bad experience in many great meals I&apos;ve had here so I&apos;m not going to boycott the restaurant.  I just feel that the owners and management should know that when they take time away, they need to make sure to put an adult in charge.  Worst Valentines meal ever."
5,"Gotta call in advance and reserve you spot. Decided to check this place out after watching this show called , F*ck that&apos;s delicious, and oh my it really is !!!! We ordered the soft shell crab, oysters and pork belly and frites. That was enough for 2 people. Ambience was nice on a busy Friday night During the pandemic.. but they were extra careful and did what they need to do to make sure everyone stays safe. Really love the food here and can&apos;t wait to come back."
5,"Loved having brunch here! 
Their Covid precautions were well organized and clean. 

The food was amazing! The pork belly was so crispy, chewy, and flavorful. The Biscuit Sandwich with Flank Steak was also a great meal that hit the spot. The different ingredients and condiments in the sandwich complimented each other so well! My favorite was the Belgian waffle. It was so light and crispy, yet was still chewy and so delicious. The jam and butter that came with it was also the perfect complement to the syrup!

Definitely want to come again next time I&apos;m in town!"
4,"Great local food on the main drag on Fulton&apos;s restaurant row. They offer &quot;greenhouse&quot; private dining pods outside with a min. Purchase deposit, which we found quite nice and intimate and well as safe from COVID. Food is to be shared amongst guests and doesn&apos;t come out as a meal but more like tapas. We tried the homemade bread, mussels, shrimp, and scallops- all with lots of fresh herbs and tons of flavor."
4,"We had a really great time here. Beer was great, oysters were great, the bread and dip trio was great! The pork belly for me was just OK and the service also seemed a tiny bit lacking, but overall super glad we decided to make reservations here."
