5,"Avec is truly terrific.  It took me awhile to write this review, but I went during the summer.  We sat on their front patio for outdoor dining which was a cool experience.  I would really like to eat inside because it sounds like a cool experience, but it was nice to soak up some sun.  The service was terrific, by the way.

As for the food, I heard the dates were a must get.  I really liked them, but I actually didn&apos;t think they were a must get.  If you like bacon wrapped dates, get them, but they aren&apos;t a must.  

What is a must is the rotisserie chicken with mezze.  It was SO much food, and super flavorful.  All of the mezze was really good, and the pita was perfect.  Highly recommend, I&apos;m excited to try the River North one."
5,"Wow! That basically should sum up this meal but I&apos;ll write some more. Went here during the covid pandemic and had to pre order our meal the night before. Did the wood fire pizza which was incredible. I never even seen mushrooms like they had on the pizza. Such a delicious flavor and perfectly cooked. I had the pork shoulder and it was so tender and juicy packed with flavor. The focaccia came and I barely could eat it as I was stuffed but I did have a piece and that cheese was to die for. We had the butcher steak which was cooked perfectly with chili mayo and sweet peppers that accompanied it perfectly. The little gem salad is a must to start! Too many delicious desserts. I had pumpkin cake with chai latte that I had to stuff down my throat bc I was so full. 
Amazing staff! This is easily one of the best meals I had in Chicago and a top meal I ever had"
5,"Had one of our favorite course menus back in October right before indoor dining closed. Had been here multiple times before, but had never done a coursed menu. It was fantastic! The wine pairings were amazing too. Large portions, but doesn&apos;t make you leave feeling stuffed. Waiting for things to open again so we can come back."
4,"I had a great day spending in this restaurant and eating delicious food.
The waiters and the waitresses entertained me with a full of confidence, passion, and determination.
Besides, the drinks and food that was served for me taste very good and yummy. Thanks for making my day splendid!"
2,"Disappointed.  

I ordered Paella carry-out, and it did not include the shellfish (mussels / clams) as pictured in the menu and the online ordering was NOT intuitive (picture included).  Also, some of the squash was so hard it was inedible. 

For a Michelin recommended restaurant this did not live up."
5,"Love this place! Came here for my birthday on one of the last warm days of outdoor dining and was impressed! We heard a lot of hype about their Moscow mules which were very good (honestly wasn&apos;t blown away so was confused why all the hype, but still enjoyed it). As for food, everything was AMAZING! We loved the chorizo stuffed dates which were a unique mix of sweet and spice. If you&apos;re a cheese lover like myself, then the focaccia is a MUST- cheesy, salty, crispy goodness! Also got (and loved) the brussels sprouts which are a great side to split. Our other favorite was the roasted pork shoulder which was tender and seasoned with a unique, tasty blend of Mediterranean spices. For dessert, we went with a seasonal option which was a berry cake that was fruity, light, and delicious!"
5,"Avec sits a few blocks east of restaurant row, and just another few blocks from Proxi. It is in good company, and certainly deserves its own accolades. 

Of course, it had them. Avec isn&apos;t exactly a secret; however, it&apos;s also not one of these stuffier, higher end, exceptional restaurants. Avec is warm, friendly, inviting...and everything they make is incredible. 

Our most recent trip was on Labor Day. Despite not really advertising it, the manager told us he was happy to allow us to order anything we wished, from cocktails to meals. 

They make a tremendous Manhattan (I got mine neat, up, and with Rye), perfectly balanced hitting all the high. notes. 

This time, we only had time for their hummus and homemade pita. You could use this pita for a pizza dough, it is absolutely incredible. The flavor and complexity of the hummus itself was also on another level, elevating a barroom staple to fine dining. 

I could go on forever, but I really should highlight the flatbread. It doesn&apos;t look like any flatbread you&apos;ve ever seen, more like a pizza with the sauce taken off. But, my god, this flatbread is divine. You get a perfect dough, with all the right amounts of olive oil, cheese, seasoning, and salt. It is impossible not to finish, and so sad when it&apos;s finally gone. 

One of my favorite spots in Chicago - can&apos;t wait to
be back!"
3,"My husband and I went here for a date night in November. Initially we saw little seating in front of Avec, and then realized they are also using the outdoor tables in front of blackbird for Avec seating also. We ordered a few items: the bacon wrapped dates, steak, and cod brandade. The dates were delicious, we have had them before and they didn&apos;t disappoint. The steak had great flavor. We were disappointed in the cod. It tasted bland and worse... fishy. We barely touched it. The service was pretty bad, we had to flag down a waiter to get our bill at the end of the night. They never came by to check on how the food was, didn&apos;t notice we barely touched the cod. The service and cod are the reason I&apos;m giving 3 stars."
5,"Last night I met up with some friends and we tried to go get dinner at Kaiser tiger. They were checking temps and apparently one of our friends tested one degree high. It&apos;s 90 degrees for god&apos;s sake! So fortunately we made the decision to head down to Avec. Blackbird ceased operations Friday, so we sat outside on their patio and had a couple rounds of drinks and caught up.

Our server, Corina H, was very personable, had good recommendations, and in the outside environment it was hot but so nice to get out.

We started with a few openers, focaccia with honey (we ordered a second one because this is just simply addictive and flavors/texture is perfect), little gem salad, bacon wrapped chorizo stuffed dates...and our table ordered a full order of chicken that was presented with so many accoutrements (hummus, pickles, peri peri hot sauce, more olives) it was stunning. 

Our hosts who brought us here know the ownership and management team apparently. We were treated like royalty and the food was just ridiculously tasty. 

The pastry chef should be lauded for her creativity and flavors. We were told Nicole was her name. Being a type two diabetic I let Corina know that I&apos;d rather die eating these desserts than live another moment. You&apos;re missing out if you do not save room for this amazing display of stunning finishing courses. I&apos;m not kidding. They are by far the best I&apos;ve had anywhere. 

Next time I&apos;m back I will splurge and come back to spoil myself. Took a walk into the old Blackbird and used their restrooms and took a glance at all of the awards all over their walls. It&apos;s sad I never went to try the food, but to see the history and the layout- I wish 2020 never happened. We are going to lose so many great places and the history is important. 

Thank you to the entire team of Avec. You killed it last night!!!"
5,"One of my favorite spots in Chicago.  Get the bacon wrapped stuffed dates &amp; some cava!  My only complaint is I hate communal seating, but the outside has nice little private tables.  The staff is always wonderful &amp; accommodating regardless."
5,"Made a reservation for Avec to enjoy a happy hour/early dinner and it was phenomenal. 

We stuck to lighter dishes since we were going to dinner after. 
- Chorizo stuffed medjool dates: sweet, savory, smoky, with a nice spicy kick at the end. So good. Must get. 
- Brussel sprout salad: light &amp; refreshing with nice zest from citrus vinaigrette 
- Chicken Liver Pâté: the BEST I&apos;ve ever had. Light, not too pungent, and  incredibly smooth/creamy. I literally ate the pâté in a spoonful by itself. It was that amazing. Cranberries +mint addition was a nice creative flavor pairing that works well to cut through the richness of pâté.

Service was great. Space was a bit small, so get used to dining next to your neighbors. Overall, 10/10. Would come back!!"
5,"I have loved Avec for about ten years. They&apos;re really great during the pandemic too. I order carryout from them frequently and they&apos;re always easy to deal with, very organized. Get the paella, it&apos;s about $32 if I recall correctly, and it&apos;s good for about 6-8 large servings - a steal."
5,"I LOOOOVE this place!! You really can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu here. The interior is a cozy, community-inspired atmosphere. Meals are portioned well. It looks like it&apos;s on the small side in terms of how much is on your plate but it really is quite filling and VERY tasty! I love seeing the new items on their menu and trying them out. Highly recommend!"
3,"The last time I was here was about 5-6 years ago. A lot has changed since then. I came here wanting the bacon wrapped dates since it&apos;s been awhile. I don&apos;t remember being so spicy! It definitely has a kick to it. But you can&apos;t go wrong with their chorizo-stuffed medjool dates with bacon and piquillo pepper-tomato sauce. It comes with a big chunk of the freshly baked bread. The price has doubled compared to 8 years ago. We came here for brunch on a weekend and we ordered the heirloom tomatoes on grilled sour dough with garlic aioli, soft boiled eggs and fresh chicory. The tomatoes are super fresh and the garlic aioli tastes like Greek yogurt with vinegar in it. I thought it was good overall, but it does have a more sour taste with garlic aioli. The third dish we ordered was the wood oven baked French toast with fresh ricotta, summer fruit compote, mint and almonds. It comes with 5 small, thick slices of French toast. It&apos;s very filling because the French toast itself is very dense, but it melts in your mouth. It&apos;s served fresh and warm so you can feel it going down your throat into your stomach.  This is when you want to grab a pillow and lay down and just sleep. It&apos;s sooo good. They give you a lot of ricotta cheese and the summer fruit compote (it looks like the smucker&apos;s red raspberry preserves with the seeds in it). It was good to end it with the French toast since our first two dishes were on the savory side and the French toast on the sweet side. I&apos;m glad they served it that way!  

I know avec is a small space, but they had to reduce a lot of seating area due to covid. They got rid of all the barstools and only have three tables available inside. They have more tables in the patio area. They also  blocked off a section in the back. They have one bathroom available for everyone to use. It&apos;s just sad to see how covid took a hit on the restaurant industry bc I know avec would be busy and crowded inside with the hustling and bustling of people. They do take reservations online but you will have to pay an upfront deposit that will be refunded to you later when you receive your check. If you don&apos;t want to make reservations online, you can still stop by and check in if tables are available."
5,"This is my favorite &quot;fancy&quot; restaurant in Chicago.  I love it so much that I have never seen the need to explore further (I never tried Blackbird while it was open).  Since I&apos;m not comfortable dining in during the pandemic, I got takeout from here through Tock as a treat and it provided a much-needed dose of emotional connection; I get the dates every single time and eating them reminded me of when eating at a restaurant was a less fraught concept.  They&apos;re super organized about take-out; you pull up and never even get out of your car.  I know they are planning to re-open for in-person dining but I will not be coming back until I am vaccinated, so it&apos;s going to be a while.  I want them to still be there when I can eat in a restaurant again, so I&apos;m happy to get takeout in the meantime."
5,"I&apos;m still not willing to dine at restaurants at this stage of the pandemic, but Avec&apos;s rotisserie dinner, delivered quickly and easily via one of the apps, was amazing. It wasn&apos;t cheap, but the hunk of roasted lamb they claimed would serve 4-6 served four adults with probably 75% of the meat still remaining for leftovers. The fixings (salads, hummus, etc.) were delicious and my only complaint is that there weren&apos;t tons more of them. Possibly the best meal I&apos;ve had delivered during the pandemic.

Edited to add, I&apos;ve also realized you can order just the sides, salads, and smaller dishes (this is called Avec to go rather than rotisserie, also on the apps) and it is just as delicious!"
4,"2020 Restaurant week menu (did not include olives because...they&apos;re just olives lol):
1. Chorizo-stuffed medjool dates with bacon and piquillo pepper-tomato sauce
2. Dark chocolate cremeaux
3. Wood oven paella with confit chicken thighs, morcilla sausage, mussels and tangerine aioli
4. Brussels sprouts panzanella with golden raisins and calabrian chili

I enjoyed all the dishes except Brussels sprouts panzanella. All I tasted was vinegar and some heat. To be fair, I ordered this without cheese but it was so much vinegar...the chef couldn&apos;t make adjustments? 

Service was good. Staff were on top of wiping my table, changing out dishes/plates, water refills, fulfilling other requests.

4,Nice quant place. Great great oyesters. Good place for a nice date. Great deserts as well.
5,"Dined here at the patio for my girlfriend&apos;s birthday and I loved their menu. 

Food (5/5): I tried their Chorizo stuffed dates, oysters, paella, and focaccia. Out of the 4 menu we tasted, both of us agreed that the paella and focaccia was equally good. I know the chorizo dates is popular but personally, I think they&apos;re alright; it&apos;s good, but nothing overwhelming. The oysters was our least favorite since it&apos;s pretty simple and I don&apos;t think it was anything special. Focaccia was amazing. When it came, it looks so simple and plain but when we bite into it, it was just a flavor bomb. The combination of cheese, truffle, and butter mashed between two layers of crispy thin focaccia bread is addicting as heck. Last, but not least, the paella was definitely something to come back for. The rice itself is already tasty but the addition of large fresh shrimps and the chorizo makes the plate even better. Great char on the rice itself, I love it when the sides are crispy; mix that with the sauce, perfection!

Ambience (4/5): It&apos;s pretty small and since only outdoor seating is available, the place does get a little bit tight but hey, we&apos;re grateful we even got the chance to eat outside and they made sure to follow strict guidelines to ensure everyone&apos;s safety. Overall, it&apos;s pretty casual and everything was kept in an orderly fashion.

Price (4/5): When we reserved the table, we had to pay for it upfront and the price itself is not cheap. Avec is a well renowned restaurant within the area so you can expect to pay at least around $30 per person. Some of the dish is very small and I wouldn&apos;t say its the most worth it but some are huge too like the Paella, which I think its worth every penny.

Service (5/5): Professional staff, and very accommodating. As I mentioned, they made sure that the food handling and service is following the guidelines provided by the CDC; they even provided us a paper bag to store our masks while we dine so it doesn&apos;t catch dirt! 

Overall (5/5): Avec is a great restaurant and serves awesome Mediterranean cuisine. I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a nice place to eat around the area."
3,"I went to Avec for the third of fourth time tonight and was disappointed overall. I used to love their famous bacon-wrapped dates, focaccia (which was still very good this time around), but the farro/pea pod salad, butcher&apos;s steak and even the watermelon/tomato/stracettela salad was overly oily and many of the dishes were very salty as well. The steak dish had 1 or 2 whole jalapeños roasted on it and my boyfriend was unaware of this and bit into one thinking it was a pepper (his mouth was on fire for 15 minutes). Not sure why they think people want to eat a whole jalapeño (dish was also topped with an excessive amount of herbs). Service was also very slow, we were at the restaurant for 2 hours and our waiter was inconsistent (3 or 4 people came to our table) although this may be due to COVID. We ordered the chocolate cookies and peach tart dessert (both were veryyyyy good)."
