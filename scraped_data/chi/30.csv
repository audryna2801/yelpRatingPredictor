5,"These are the exact chicken &amp; waffles I think about on my worst days. Hands down, the best thing ever--better than the numerous ~fried chicken with a side of pretention~ restaurants in NYC, anything I&apos;ve had homemade, anything at all for real. We visited pre-covid so not sure how the situation currently is, but really hope that they&apos;re holding up okay. If I were in the area I would order takeout daily!

My friends and I came by for brunch on a weekend morning; we drove in from the suburbs and joined the Yelp waitlist hours in advance. We still had to wait almost an hour once we were there (so, in total, a 3 hour wait), but I really think it was completely worth it. You can plan ahead by joining via Yelp too. Street parking is not too hard to find and there are options to walk around, sit in your car (if driving in), or sit in the restaurant (pre-pandemic, obviously). 

I had, of course, the fried chicken and waffles and it was absolute perfection. The maple butter, the sweet potato waffle, the hot chicken--just wow. All the flavors combined could not have worked together any better. I don&apos;t even like sweet potato and I&apos;m obsessed with that waffle. Portions were generous, food came out quickly, service was WONDERFUL. Our server was so friendly and warm, it was like eating at a close friend&apos;s place.

Highly highly recommend to all! I can&apos;t wait to return someday."
5,"Still open for takeout!

Amaaazing French toast! Had to get the super flight to get a taste of many of their flavors and loved them all. Would absolutely come back/order again in the very near future."
5,"First restaurant/first time
Around Lincoln park area. So glad I was able to check out this highly rated restaurant before they got busy.  Staff was nice and sweet, offered us with their fav dish off their menu and that yummy hot sauce for the cheeses hash.  The jambalaya omelet was delicious and everything else we ordered. Would like to comes again sooner lol, great breakfast/brunch spot in the area. Debit/Cc cards only cause of Covid. Who carries cash now anyways lol"
5,"Amazing food! Love it  best French toast in town
Great costumer service
Is BYOB
Definitely coming back"
2,"Great customer service but the food did not live up to the hype. The eggs were over cooked, the cheesy hash browns were bland and mushy.  The French toast (which is what they are supposedly famous for) was okay but I make better. The one thing I did love was the portobello mushroom, it has so much flavor and was delicious!

Overall, the food is over priced for the quality and taste of their food. This is definitely a one timer for me."
4,"I ordered from this restaurant via Postmates to my hotel room but next time I will defintley try it in house. That&apos;s on us for being lazy. Overall, we enjoyed our food. I love the variety of flavors offered. The French toast - bread was a little too thin for my liking but the flavor was there. The chicken and sweet potato waffle was pretty good. I will be back when in Chicago.

5,"Absolutely incredible in every way - truly THE definition of foodgasm! My friend and I split the French Toast Flight, &quot;We&apos;re Movin On Up&quot; Executive (which came with Angus Rib Eye Steak paired with two eggs your way and a side of hash browns), and the Fried Chicken and Mild Sauce Omelet (one of their special dishes). I had no complaints with any of the dishes - French Toast flavors weren&apos;t too overpowering and had the perfect amount of sweetness without adding Anya edition also syrup, the Angus Rib Eye Steak was very juicy and tender (literally melted in my mouth), AND and Fried Chicken was still crispy even after being covered with the mild sauce. On top of all of this, our waiter was incredible and had riddles for us throughout the entire dining experience! Last but not least, this is BYOB so an absolute MUST if you&apos;re wanting boozy brunch! They have a Yelp waitlist so you can definitely prepare your party ahead of time - this is an overall meal you won&apos;t regret. I cannot wait to feast again at this Black-owned business!"
5,The BEST food and customer service! Outstanding ambiance and the food was well worth the price!
3,"I hate that I came to Chicago at a time when the governor banned in door dinning. It makes it so much harder to get the vibe of the restaurant and give a good review. Although I must say the food pics look  amazing. 
I ordered the lemon pepper lobster omelette which comes with hash browns. To be honest I didn&apos;t like it. The lemon pepper seasoning was a little bit to much, especially for a breakfast food. The eggs were fluffy and loaded with veggies, but the hash browns were a bit hard. They probably needed to be cooked a little longer.   On the other hand this place has to be a local favorite because it&apos;s been a revolving door from the time I pulled up until I left. 
Shout out to executive chef Ken L. Polk for the creative spin on french toast and omelette. Next time Im in Chicago I&apos;ll give them another try. Im excited to taste the french toast flight."
5,Excellent service from Tusiime. Exceptional levels of Blackcellence in effect in this joint. Food was eclectic and delicious. I had the catfish with hash browns and scrambled eggs. Fye!
5,"We checked in at 1:30 and was told it was a 30 minute wait (keep in mind they close at 2). We still received the same level of service as if we walked in when they opened. Tim was amazing and provided great service and recommendations! This was my first time, I will be back!"
5,Food was really good. The crab cake dish they have right now was the best. I will be back!
5,"My boyfriend had heard of this place from some family so we decided to check it out while visiting Chi-Town this weekend. The wait was about an hour after we checked in on the Yelp waitlist, so beware. We came on Friday and waited in our car until our table was ready at about 10 minutes to 1pm. 

I had the French Toast sampler with a side of cheese hash browns. My beau got the strawberry French toast with a side of chicken sausage. We both loved our  dishes, however the hashbrowns were not much to write home about. That being said, our waiter brought some home made hot sauce to go with it that SET IT OFF! Try the hot sauce. It&apos;s worth it! The portion sizes were so-so, so next time we&apos;ll probably order something different. We were still satisfied though. 

Please note that this place is BYOB, so if you want mimosas, remember to bring your own bottle of champagne. Our waiter was also really nice and attentive. He gave us a run-down of the specials and even gave us some riddles which were fun. My only gripe with the service was that toward the end of our meal, multiple bus-boys and our server kept coming to us trying to take our stuff away while we were still eating. They must have needed the dishes, I guess, but it really started to be annoying with every minute, a new person asking if we were done. &quot;I&apos;ve got a fork full of food in my hand sir, no, I&apos;m not done!&quot;"
4,Excellent food. Very friendly staff. Efficient service. Food is fresh. Love the seasonal menus. The French toast is the best I&apos;ve ever had. Love the tea selection. Must try. I always take my out of town guests here prepandemic. My only issue is the wait is always long especially on weekends. Recently the wait list was two hours so I had to go somewhere else. Just plan accordingly if you want to eat there.
4,"First of all, I&apos;m glad I read someone&apos;s post about Yelp waitlist. It is definitely helpful to do it this way instead of just showing up. We headed there as we became 8th on the waitlist and had to wait maybe another 20 minutes after the 15 minute drive there. 

I had the super flight French toast to try the rum raisin of the week. That wasn&apos;t my favorite. I enjoyed the strawberry and caramel French toast. Juicy and flavor penetrates the toast. The B&amp;B sausage omelet was another favorite for me. I went with chicken. Gravy on top, well seasoned. I was full off this before I attacked the French toast. 

Go with an appetite. Go and eat. 

Oh, they don&apos;t have mimosa options but if you bring your own champagne and such, they are happy to mix for you."
4,"In Chicago for Labor Day Weekend and friend in Miami saw me post being in Chi-town and recommended this spot which was co-signed by friends here. So glad I did. Black-owned yet had diverse patrons for the nearly hour and half I dined and observed. Not exceptional, just simply good soul food inspired menu. The items I ordered were seasoned well, tasty, quality prep. Salmon croquettes had hearty flavor, a good Cajun aioli with straightforward cheesy hash browns enhanced by a very good housemade hot sauce they should maybe bottle and sell. So glad my server advised I could do half order of French toast; they are known for their flight of four flavors. I followed my server&apos;s recommendation to have the week&apos;s special Butter Cookie flavor. Oh my, this was the move. Non-fussy yet creative and yummy menu.

My server Nadine was awesome #receipts -- attentive, patient, knowledgeable, polite -- and such a pleasure to be waited on by someone that took pride in serving, particularly in this time of racial tensions. Had a chance to watch and then meet Me-Chelle a member of the family ownership. Solid covid-19 hygiene standards practiced by the staff. Professional and well ran establishment from my experience and in asking passersby on the street.

Come hungry as the experience with be filling. I couldn&apos;t believe people were waiting in cars and socially distanced on sidewalk to dine as well as all the to-go orders. Actually I can, and wished Miami had Black-owned spot like this."
5,"There was a wait but this place was worth it. If you can get on a waiting list I suggest doing that because the line is long. 

I love that they have very creative breakfast options. It was very difficult to choose between the jambalaya omelette and the jerk chicken but I chose the jerk. It was very filling and delicious. Slightly spicy and good. The eggs were fluffy and a perfect accompaniment. 

It was a miracle that I got the French toast down because I was very full. I enjoyed that they didn&apos;t have that inner sliminess that many places have. 

The salmon croquettes were by far my favorite item. They didn&apos;t taste like your standard croquette and the sauce really made it something different. They were tender and flavorful. 

The staff was funny and my favorite was the jokester of a waiter who made sure we had everything we needed and wanted. They also Accommodated us when we got to our reservation a few minutes late. They placed us next in line behind the next group , which was fair."
4,A very solid breakfast choice! Delivery worked out great and I was very happy with how delicious the food was.
4,"B&amp;B still got it!! They&apos;re doing their thing during COVID too. I no longer live in Chicago but this had become my favorite breakfast spot so during my visit I had to check it out. They&apos;ve distanced tables and they&apos;re using their space a lot better, given the circumstances. The food was legendary, as usual, wanted to circle back twice in one trip. The server was knowledgeable, wore a mask and kept our surfaces clean. I truly enjoyed my time here, as always."
5,Three words: French toast flight. It is seriously incredible! They use honey butter on all of their French toast which makes it extra delicious. Batter and Berries is hands down the best breakfast spot in Chicago
