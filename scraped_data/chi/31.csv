5,"I always try to find a place to have a fun brunch while visiting different cities, so after some searching, I decided to make a reservation at Shaw&apos;s Crab House for our visit last summer. They typically have a Sunday brunch buffet, but with COVID restrictions, they&apos;ve changed it to be a plated four course meal. The atmosphere in Shaw&apos;s reminded me of Mad Men and Don and Roger eating platters of oysters - not overly fancy, but a place you could go if you wanted to dress up. We wore shorts and nice tops and felt totally comfortable.

Brunch consisted of the following:
First course: French toast bread pudding, flambeed tableside, scrambled eggs, candied bacon, pork sausage, and hash browns. My favorites from the first course were the French toast bread pudding (very fun display), the scrambled eggs - they were so creamy and buttery, and the hash browns - perfectly cooked potato that was also super buttery!

Second course: cod ceviche, chilled Aloha mussels, shrimp cocktail, caprese salad, Caesar salad, and rolls. Our favorites from this course were the mussels, which had a touch of sesame and were very savory and delicious, and the cod ceviche which was really light and refreshing.

Third course: Alaskan king crab legs, macaroni and cheese, and roasted broccoli. The king crab legs were definitely a favorite, but the mac and cheese was also very well done. Perfect al dente noodles with a rich creamy sauce.

Fourth course: your choice of a dessert; we opted for the creme brulee and Key Lime pie. These were both excellent versions of these classic desserts!

Our server was very attentive and we felt taken care of during our meal. They will box anything up that you don&apos;t eat which is nice - we ended up taking quite a bit of food back to our hotel. I ended up feeling a bit under the weather after eating so much rich and decadent food, but that was simply due to the butter and salt that we consumed, no fault to Shaw&apos;s. I would definitely come back and try some other entrees and oysters!"
5,"They&apos;re open inside with limited capacity. However, their out side set up is very nice and warm. 
The food is just outstanding. The gumbo, lobster bisque, and Buffalo Shrimp are a great start. The lobster bisque had great flavor and lots of lobster. The Buffalo shrimp had a sauce perfect to soak up with the table rolls. 
I love the in season small bay scallops. Others had the spectacular walleye and haddock. 
The wines are expensive but a great selection and the service is always outstanding!"
5,"So after my terrible experience at Shaw&apos;s, I went back. It&apos;s been a long time and even we&apos;re still grappling with the pandemic, which truly changes my expectations of all restaurants.

Anyways, my husband and I had reservations last night for outdoor dining but now that the indoor dining has reopened in Chicago, we opted to sit inside. We were literally the only party in the entire place for much of our meal, but that might have been because it was a Monday night and we sat in the formal dining room.

I had the Alaskan king crab legs and my husband had the surf and turf. We started with the bay scallops and shared Brussel sprouts, au gratin potatoes and the masked potatoes. 

Everything was absolutely phenomenal. To start, our scallops came with a lemon butter sauce which I opted to get on the side because I despise lemon, but I loved it so much I was dipping everything in and pouring it on everything! The crab was perfectly cooked and half cracked. My husband said that the lobster tail with his surf and turf was the best he&apos;s ever had, and that&apos;s his go to dish every time I drag him to a seafood place.

The service was also top notch!! But we were also the only folks in the place so it was to expected to be doted on. They followed excellent covid rules by checking our temps when we came in and the tables in the dining room were very well spaced out to allow for appropriate social distancing.

This was the Shaw&apos;s I know and love. I&apos;m so glad they were able to keep things going through all this and I will gladly be back again soon to support the business. 

If you&apos;re looking for a safe and excellent place to dine, it&apos;s time to make a reservation at Shaw&apos;s."
5,"Came here with a friend for lunch and it as great. We made a reservation for right when they opened, so we had the place to ourselves for a while, but even when others started coming they were seated far away and we were plenty spaced out.

The use a QR code for menus, and the server offered to help if we needed help pulling it up or navigating the website.

It was pretty easy to use and I started with an old fashioned to drink. That was super strong and super delicious. 

We started with calamari and gumbo. My friend loved her gumbo and we both very much enjoyed the calamari- came out hot and crispy.

For entrees I got the crab cake BLT sandwich. It was delicious, tender, and meaty. It came with fries with were amazing as well.

My friend got the seafood trio (scallops, shrimp, and a crab cake) which she loved and raved about.

The portions were large and the food was amazing. 

We def would come back and try other menu items."
4,"Honestly, this would be a 3.5 for me but I&apos;ll round up! We did the Valentine&apos;s Day special for two which was a great deal for $170. Included stone crab, oysters, shrimp cocktail to start. Choice of soup or salad (came with rolls), steak and king crab for entree with truffle mashed potatoes and creamed spinach. Then dessert was a choice of Keylime pie, raspberry pie, or chocolate cake.

Everything was good but it&apos;s all kind of the basics for a seafood and steak restaurant. We really enjoyed the king crab but it&apos;s always good if it&apos;s quality. The steak was good but nothing mine blowing. I liked the truffle potatoes for not being a huge mashed potato person but wasn&apos;t impressed with cream spinach. The desserts were both good. Overall, it was definitely a tasty meal and a good option for a nicer restaurant but I hate spending 200+ dollars on a meal just to have it be baseline."
3,"Is it worth the price? Sadly, no.

Shaw&apos;s is an upscale seafood restaurant located in downtown Chicago. The atmosphere is definitely classy, so I would say dress semi-formal. From all the rave reviews online, I thought Shaw&apos;s would be a stellar meal. But personally, I felt that the small portions and expensive price tag don&apos;t go hand in hand with the &quot;feel&quot; of the restaurant. 

GRAND COLD SHELLFISH PLATTER ($115) Maine lobster tail, oysters on the half shell, seafood ceviche, jumbo shrimp cocktail, Alaskan golden king crab, lobster claws, chilled mussels, blue crab fingers
The platter was good, but it&apos;s definitely not worth $115. I would pay $80 max and I feel like that&apos;s pushing it. Favorites were the ceviche, crab, and shrimp. 

PAN SEARED ALASKAN HALIBUT ($40) spring peas, yukon gold &amp; purple potatoes, garlic potato sauce, lemon espuma
When I saw my dish, I was a bit shocked. It was such a tiny portion of fish with some peas. The fish was solid, but it&apos;s also something I can find and pay $10 for at a casual restaurant. 

As for everyone else&apos;s dishes, the same commentary was said. All the portions were small, considering everyone&apos;s dish is around $40. The menu itself is so elaborate and everything sounds delicious, but when the plate comes to the table, you&apos;re left being disappointed. 

The food is good don&apos;t get me wrong, but I probably wouldn&apos;t come here to eat again with those prices. The next day we went to a chain restaurant (will not be disclosed) and my dad liked his fish better there than at Shaw&apos;s."
4,"We decided to try this restaurant for our anniversary and it was a wonderful experience. Our server was attentive and they do provide heat lamps while dinner is served outside. The ambiance is different as we are seated outside next to traffic while under the bridge with passing cars but nonetheless, the food definitely made up for it. They provided complimentary bread and butter to which that was delicious as well. I thought we would not be full with these items but we were left happy. Thank you for accommodating to our needs and for the wonderful food/experience.

Do not forget to call ahead or make reservations online due to the limited seatings!"
1,"My husband and I have been frequent customers of Shaws in Schaumburg. We had a taste for seafood, so we decided to give the Chicago location a shot. Unfortunately, the experience left us crabby. 

The hostess was kind and seated us immediately. That is the only positive part of our experience. When it came time to order, my husband requested the surf and turf (medium rare filet), I asked for the chili crab legs. 

The steak arrived cold. My crab legs didn&apos;t taste fresh and were barely warm. Its obvious they were cooked at an earlier time and sat under a heating lamp. 

My husband asked the waiter to swap out the steak. A manager came over with a new piece of meat. He asked us to try it in front of him. It was a really awkward interaction. The manager also made a joke, asking if I needed a bib to finish my crab legs. I&apos;ve got a sense of humor, but it didn&apos;t really seem appropriate to be making jokes after serving us a cold steak. 

Im reasonable and can understand that mistakes happen. But when you&apos;re paying $70 per meal, you expect your food to be warm. We left disappointed and were stuck with a $160 bill before the tip. We won&apos;t be returning to this location."
4,"Last night was packed with many first. It was my first time having grilled calamari as opposed to fried, first time at Shaws, and it was additionally my first time having sushi at a venue that wasn&apos;t technically a sushi spot. I was a little on the skeptical side at first especially with the sushi from a spot that wasn&apos;t technically a sushi spot, but it all worked out. 

The grilled calamari was delicious. I will admit however that if you&apos;re not an individual that genuinely enjoys char&apos;d flavor, you might find this appetizer unsettling. Good thing tho is that the sauce and veggies do a great job of balancing out the char&apos;d flavor. The end result is pretty complex.

Sushi and service wise the roles were amazing and the servers were attentive. Genuinely the ONLY reason I didn&apos;t give the full 5 stars was because while the Manhattan that I ordered was perfect. The old fashion was a tad underwhelming, not terrible, but also not memorable. That would legit be my only point of feedback. 

Can&apos;t wait to go back to try some other items on their menu!"
5,"We just picked up the Valentine&apos;s Day menu for our wedding anniversary and it was really well made, apportioned and an indulgent and luxe menu.

Lobster bisque, the addition of julienne vegetables and tarragon provided some nice herbaceous and lightness to this rich soup

Cold seafood platter - the jumbo prawns with the house cocktail sauce stands out for the balance of flavors, the oysters this time of year seemed like east coast selections which had its fresh brine flavor was a delight and the stone crab claws were sweet

Steak with caramelized onions, house steak sauce (great smoky undertone and balanced with sweet shallots to balance the vinegar sauce  piquant) and king crab legs

For dessert we opted for the Key Lime Pie (nice pucker) and decadent chocolate cake. 

This should be a date night meal option and not just for Valentine&apos;s Day, thank you, it was great"
5,"I went here to celebrate my boyfriends birthday, and it was such a splendid evening! They are strictly doing outdoor seating in their patio currently which we assumed would be cold in the winter, but it&apos;s full of heaters we were barely even chilly. The Alaskan king crab was SO meaty and the club room combination included the perfect bites of the scallops, petit fillet and garlic shrimp. If I could bathe in the creamed spinach I would . I would 10/10 recommend a visit for a special occasion (birthday, anniversary etc), as the menu is very expensive, but you definitely get what you pay for!"
5,"A late review.

I believe i went here around Jan with a customer for dinner.
This restaurant is in Chicago in downtown so make sure you carpool! 

We arrived at the restaurant without a reservation but we were seated right away. 

Really there is nothing bad to say about this place besides the head of parking and the restaurant is always packed.

We ordered:
- King crab which they bring it whole, place it in the middle of the table and let us take a picture and they place back on their crate and start cutting out of the shell and structuring back to the crab shape.
- Cold appetizer which came with fresh jumbo shrimps, oyster and lobster tail and crabs in a bucket of ice on the bottom to cool the freshness. 
- ISOSCELES (Paso Robles 2016) wine. MUST HAVE!!!! 5 stars
- Fresh fish Alaskan smoked salmon will melt in your month. Best salmon I had in years. The flavor was just right and it was cooked to perfection.

Their seafood, bread, entree&apos;s to dessert is 10/10. 
I really don&apos;t know what more can I say about this place."
5,"This place is a must for all seafood lovers! Oysters are fresh and soft. if anyone doesn&apos;t have any experience yet, should discover this tremendous tasty exactly at Shaw&apos;s. Regarding Covid I can say that it&apos;s still good that people have a chance spending time outside with minimum risk for their health. As I see the staff are wearing masks, good ventilation. Yet the distance between the tables could be bigger. In general I for sure will advise the spot and come here again"
5,"Continue to love Shaw&apos;s Crab House! 

Shaw&apos;s has everything one could want.  An enormous drink menu, appetizer menu,  main course menu, side dishes, and desserts.  This is all in addition to their raw bar (sushi and oysters!).  

I recently ordered the spicy shrimp, salmon, and lemon roll.  It was delicious. I obviously had to try to the king crab for the main dish, and it was fantastic.   I also ordered the creamed spinach and potatoes au gratin as side dishes, and no surprise...they were delicious also!    

The above is in addition to their beautiful dining room, and their retro bar.  

Highly recommend!"
5,"I was here recently for lunch on the patio. I tried the large crab claw app, crab cake, shrimp cocktail, California roll, shrimp tempura roll, raspberry pie, and chocolate cake. The food was good and the service was perfection. I will definitely return."
4,"I have visited this awesome and heavenly café for more than 30 years...and today like each time before, they conveyed extraordinary food and service...I must state that the Covid limitations"
5,Fresh and high quality seafood! Our fave was the dover sole and oysters! They also have really soft and chewy bread
5,"It&apos;s hard to beat shaws! 
First off the rolls were out of this world deliciousness! But the king crab really stole the show! We got them cracked which made the meat super easy to get out! My son had the salmon and swore by it (he ate it all before I could try any!) and the Mac and cheese was good too! Between Joe&apos;s and shaws, you have to eat both! Shaws wins for king crab and rolls! Joe&apos;s wins for steak and service! Still, both our favorite places that we ate while in town!"
2,I have been craving a lobster roll. Have had them here before and they&apos;ve been really good. Not this time. Much smaller pieces of lobster and LOTS of mayo. If it were $12 I&apos;d say ok. For $29 ala carte there better be whole claws.  My friend said the lobster bisque was also mediocre. Then there is that COVID charge so I spend $40 for a sandwich with fries. Would be happy to..if it was outstanding. Patio was great however and very cozy.
1,"Quite frankly, one of the worst dining experiences I&apos;ve had. Shaw&apos;s was recommended by several coworkers, so my husband and I chose to dine here on our anniversary. Terribly disappointing. As soon as we arrived, we witnessed 2 hosts working, get in a fight right in front of everyone waiting to be seated. Our waiter was barely present and never offered drink refills or even bothered to check in on how our meal was. The food itself was poor quality. We ordered the Lobster Bisque, Lobster Roll, and Surf and Turf. The bisque was cold when it arrived and was full of shredded carrots from a salad mix. We ordered our steak Medium, but we received rare. Never had the opportunity to have this corrected. The only decent part of the meal was the fries that accompanied the Lobster Roll. Amazing that this meal cost us $160....It wasn&apos;t worth 1/3 of that cost. Wouldn&apos;t Recommend and won&apos;t return."
