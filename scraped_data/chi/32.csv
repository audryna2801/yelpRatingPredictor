5,"Amazing smoke!When we arrived here for lunch on Saturday afternoon the place was full of waiting list so we decided to take out the food.
We ordered half pork belly, pastrami, pork belly and a cup of coleslaw ,about $50 in total.
We were amazed of their smoked meat everything was so full of flavor and tasty.
Also coleslaw was very good.
We definitely come back.
And every staff in the shop was nice."
5,"FAVORITE BBQ joint in Chicago ever since they opened. I always take out of country guests there to impress them with a cool place, delicious Americana food.

Just ordered our Thanksgiving turkey, some sides and delicious pumpkin pie. Had three slices on the first day, all by myself.

As it turned out, they were kind enough to call me to remind me that i had forgotten to pick my food!"
5,"It was my first time trying out this place tonight (via delivery) and everything was delicious. I ordered the brisket sliced (HIGHLY RECOMMEND, it was tender and full of flavor) with a ton of sides: macaroni salad, potato salad, baked beans, elote corn and cornbread. I would order each side again but my favorites were the potato salad, baked beans and elote corn. I&apos;d definitely order here again. Some of the best barbecue in Chicago, if not the best."
5,"This was the new best barbecue I&apos;ve had in had in recent memory. I got the oyler sandwich. The brisket was perfectly tender but had some really flavorful bark and the links were maybe the best I&apos;ve ever had. I also found the sauce delightful, hopefully they jar and sell it. 

They do a really good job packaging it as well, sending the brioche separately from the meat so it doesn&apos;t turn into a disincorporated mess. 

For a side I got the broccoli salad which had a very unique and tasty flavor profile."
5,"If you&apos;re looking for good bbq in Chicago, then I&apos;d recommend this place. Very casual with picnic tables and paper towel rolls on the tables. They will sometimes sell out of the favorites so don&apos;t plan on everything being available if you&apos;re trying to go for dinner or anything later."
4,"I absolutely love this place and I am happy to support them during Covid. It was amazing and inviting before and still is. We sat on the patio for a beer. Ended up with a brisket sandwich, sides, and pickle back shots. The bbq here is outstanding. The alley patio is prob the most picturesque in Chicago. Supporting GSSM as much as I can so we can all enjoy this amazing establishment in the summer!"
4,"Interesting digital approach of the restaurant where many, order and pay is all through QR code.
While ordering kitchen will be already cooking and preparing your order which will be out in no time. 

Strami Shortrib was sooo tender and delicious it basically fel of the bone the second you touched the rib. Top it off with in-house Elote Style Corn and your meal is set. 
Outside seating in the industrial brick laid driveway with steel entry gates adds this place a charm of those 1950-60s meat market where they&apos;ve butchered the cattle."
5,"I had heard so many great things about this prior to heading over here, so I knew it was definitely a must to try it! We got take out, as indoor and outdoor dining was unavailable at the time we went. Pictured is our takeout in a plate at home. We tried the Halal Brisket, Broccoli Salad, Elote Style Corn and BBQ sauce. It was so flavorful, rich and delicious! The combination of the sides were perfectly paired with the meat. It was a such a treat to have this meal, and enjoy it inside, away from the Chicago cold! I would highly recommend trying out this spot and enjoying one of their scrumptious meals!"
5,"I&apos;ve lived in Nashville, TN for 3 years and had my fair share of BBQ throughout the South, but Green Street Meats in Chicago, IL takes the cake! Look at that Beef Rib! 

THIS IS MY FAVORITE BBQ SPOT! I stop here every time I visit Chicago. It&apos;s a must!"
5,"It&apos;s impossible for me not to have BBQ on the 4th of July.  I went to my favorite bbq place here in the city to pick up my order and it did not disappoint!  The pork ribs were fall off the bone (as usual).  I&apos;m not sure what rub they use, but it&apos;s the best. There&apos;s 3 sauces: Texas bbq, Spicy, and Vinegar.  I typically get the Texas just in case I&apos;m in the mood for sauce but the ribs taste fantastic without it.  I&apos;ve also had the pulled pork there and it&apos;s really good!  

Now the sides at Green Street need alot of improvement but on this trip I ordered the watermelon salad.  It was good so no complaints.

I don&apos;t know who the pitmaster is there but the man or woman is my bbq hero."
5,"As a native Texan, BBQ isn&apos;t a food subgroup it&apos;s a way of life.  It would be unfair to compare an out of state venue to those down South, but the smoked wings are in a league of their own.  Crispy, juicy, and all around incredible flavor only attainable by a pit master that knows their craft.  Definitely not wings you can get most places and the countless sauces make for a great individual meal or to share.  So many other great things on the menu I hope to try soon!Smoked Chicken"
2,"Good for Chicago I guess.  There wasn&apos;t much I really liked about what we had today.  My wife and I shared pork ribs, pulled pork, slaw, beans and corn bread.  I didn&apos;t finish any of it and I was both hungry and looking forward to some real barbecue.

We ordered our sauce on the side thinking that this was real Texas bbq.  I don&apos;t know why I got that impression other than it&apos;s called &quot;Smoked Meats&quot; and they&apos;re serving on butcher paper.  That&apos;s where the similarity to Texas BBQ completely ends.  The pulled pork was drenched in their &quot;Texas&quot; sauce.  I don&apos;t like chili powder sauces, it&apos;s not Texas chili and this isn&apos;t Texas bbq sauce.  You can&apos;t taste the smoke or the meat, just chili powder.  Too bad because the actual preparation of the meat is good.

The ribs were overcooked and again over seasoned.  I like a good candy finish but I couldn&apos;t taste the smoke or meat.  Partially because they cooked it too long and partially because they&apos;re really trying to hard with everything they prepare here.  Everything is too much and nothing tastes of its ingredients.  The perception that falling off the bone is a good thing  is a bad thing.  

The beans were cloying.  The slaw was the only thing I thought was ok.  I like mustard and vinegar.  I prefer it to mayonnaise.  I don&apos;t think you should be making gluten free corn-bread for the 5% who are actually intolerant.  That&apos;s just me.  It was just ok, my wife really didn&apos;t like it.  Could they just serve one thing that&apos;s just straight up what it is supposed to be?  KISS, is a simple acronym in the restaurant business.  Subtlety is lost here for sure.

It&apos;s a really cool place and looks the part but they totally failed with what we ordered.  Maybe we&apos;ve just had so much better in the South that we just can&apos;t give this a pass.  I like the menu, staff, vibe but I really wanted to like the food.  Could you possibly just smoke the meat and serve it straight up so we can see what kind of pit masters are really working there?"
5,"Favorite BBQ place in the city! The food is always impressive whether dining in (pre-COVID) or takeout (currently). We usually get the meats by the 1/2 pound since they are SO good you don&apos;t want anything to take away from them. Favorites are the brisket, pulled pork, and pastrami. I really can&apos;t pick which is best because they are all so good and different. The pastrami does usually sell out fast though- so order early! The elote style corn is also a must!"
4,"Ordered Green Street Meats for the umpteenth time because I am a fan despite being a self-proclaimed southern bbq snob. 

I ordered my usual: pork belly, ribs, sliced brisket

Or so I thought....

I get an almost immediate text saying my food is ready. I get to the restaurant, give my name to the kind host, and my order is out in like 2 minutes! Perfect. 

I walk to my car and decide to check my order since I always order sliced brisket but somehow, sometimes end up with chopped brisket (which is okay, but I am not the biggest fan of the sauce it is in). Sliced brisket - (check), ribs - (check), pulled pork (hmmm). Given my thought that I always order the same thing, I walk back up to the restaurant just to change it out. The kind host apologizes and says he&apos;ll have my pork belly right out and writes my name. A kind sir comes out with pork belly and hands it to me. He also shows me the error of my ways (receipts - literally) where I ordered pulled pork . Embarrassed - I apologize profusely and offer to pay. He does not make me feel dumb, but instead tells me to enjoy the pulled pork through my blabbering. 

- I tell this long story to say the customer service is always great and I appreciate it on a day like today when I am exceptionally tired from work and made an honest mistake.

The food:
I love the sliced brisket (not as big a fan of the chopped given the sauce it comes in), the salmon, the ribs, and the pork belly! Everything is always flavorful, tender, and the brisket has a good smoked taste. I also had the cornbread, which is not my style, but still tasty. The reason for the 4 is I am not a big fan of the sides. I like the potato salad a lot, but that&apos;s it. I am not a fan of the broccoli salad or baked beans. 

**I will definitely be back!"
5,"In my opinion, it&apos;s the vest smoked meat place in Chicago. Better than Smoke Daddy, BBQ Smoke etc.
Very reasonably priced brisket and  big salad portions."
4,"We came to Green Street Smoked Meats for lunch. The entrance to Is very European-like restaurant with its entrance through a brick floor alley. There&apos;s tables all through the alley and if you keep going down the alley and hang a left you can dine inside. You really don&apos;t see many restaurants like this in Chicago, let alone a bbq place. Their staff was very friendly and got our food out very quickly. 

My wife ordered their Brisket sandwich and I opted or their 1/2 lb pork ribs. You get four ribs for about $11. A very good deal in my opinion. Especially when the ribs were so tasty. I hate using such a cliche statement like &quot;fall of the bone&quot; but these literally were. The rub alone without bbq sauce tasted so delicious. It also had a sweet glaze that added an extra dimension of flavors to the ribs. I usually enjoy eating half of the ribs dry and bald with their bbq sauce. I tried both their Texas sauce and hot bbq sauce, and the hot bbq sauce was indeed heat but packed with flavor. I&apos;ve visited a lot of bbq restaurants that serve hot bbq sauce and there&apos;s no heat. Green streets version is the truth! The ribs themselves also had a beautiful smoke ring. These ribs are bangin with flavors. 

Unfortunately, I wish the menu was more descriptive. My wife&apos;s Brisket sandwich came with a bunch of pickles and peppers and onions.  It a big fan of all that crap on top of my brisket. I&apos;m so glad my wife ordered this and not me. When will people understand that mess is more with bbq food. Brisket tastes amazing by itself no need for all that cuteness. It also came &quot;chopped&quot; and not sliced. Especially when it&apos;s not really chopped but more like shredded. When the weight actual chopped brisket comes with chunky chopped pieces of brisket. This brisket was shredded and very wet. Like they were hiding the actual dryness of the brisket. Was not a big fan of this sandwich and probably wouldn&apos;t order it again. Had they described what it came with on the menu, we would have probably ordered something else or asked for the sandwich without all that. We also ordered potato salad which tasted great. One order is enough for two. 

I&apos;ll will definitely be returning though. The service was great. The decor was nice. My ribs were delicious and can definitely compete with some other Chicago staples."
5,"Goodness gracious this was some of the best meat I&apos;ve had. We had everything from brisket to ribs, and it was all incredible. This is on par if not better than some of the best spots in the south. I can&apos;t wait to go back, and might even plan a stopover in Chicago just to eat this again. Go with a group so you can try everything!"
4,"Visited GSSM on a cold Saturday night for dinner &amp; the place was packed with a line out the door, have been wanting to hit this spot for a while and finally got around to it. The vibe when you enter is very chill, good music blasting, long line out the door, picnic type tables everywhere for you to choose from &amp; a bar in the middle with seating as well. The place is modeled like barbecue joints in the South of the U.S. (like Austin, TX) and it&apos;s a very similar concept, wait in line and go up to order (cafeteria style) and then pay at the end. You have the choice of sandwiches, meat by the 1/2 pound, sides and also other individual items. 

We settled on ordering:
The Sliced Brisket, Frito Pie, Spicy Pickles &amp; Cornbread.
Decently priced for the amount of food you receive (see  picture) &amp; the workers were pleasant to deal with and were hustling as the people just kept coming. Was worried about finding a seat however there is lots of seating and most people eat &amp; go. The picnic tables could be better wiped off &amp; cleared of derbies between patrons as our table was scattered with old beer bottles &amp; napkins.

The food overall was good, the Frito pie was unlike anything I have ever had before &amp; would tell others to get it. The spicy pickles were delicious not even that hot, I could&apos;ve ate a pound of them. The sliced brisket was a bit chewy to say the least, unlike Texas they do not ask if you want fatty or lean however I wasn&apos;t expecting that much fat per slice. The meat is nicely rubbed and the natural flavor is good enough you don&apos;t even need the sauce. The cornbread was good, not great more grainy then I am accustomed to however seemed popular. I was shocked they didn&apos;t have Macaroni &amp; Cheese as that is usually such a big staple all over the US. I enjoyed the meal however was not blown away like others, good stop in Chicago however for BBQ. Overall 4.1/5.0"
4,"It was pretty busy on a Friday evening but the line moved fast. As a gal from St. Louis, I firmly believe we have the best bbq (s/o to Pappy&apos;s), but his place had excellent reviews so I was excited to try it! 

The brisket melts in your mouth and ribs are fall off the bone. Both are 5/5 and sooooo good. The elotes are the best I ever had, and I&apos;d come again just for that! The pork belly is not my favorite, but still pretty good (4/5). The BBQ sauce was just okay. For a $55 meal, it&apos;s a bit pricy but this is west loop after all."
4,"*pre covid review*

We have been here several times and have brought friends and family to try their food as well. I remember the first time we came was at night and they had all the lights sparkling on the ceiling and the food was great, we were just hooked right off the bat. After that I honestly think we just kept coming back for cocktails and their delicious Elote. I really love that Elote and was a little disappointed to find that it tasted different the last couple times we came. Not sure if they changed it or if I am just crazy but it was much better before. Other than the wonderful Elote, their smoked meats and meats in general are crazy good. I love that they are smoking and cutting the meat right in front of you. My favorites are usually the ribs but I also really like the brisket. Sometimes when its busy it can be hard to find a spot that isn&apos;t crowded (before covid of course I am not sure how the seating works right now). Most times we&apos;ve come it hasn&apos;t been a problem though. 

Highly recommend coming here!!"
