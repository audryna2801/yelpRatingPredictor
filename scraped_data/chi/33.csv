5,"I am not someone who has had much restaurant food since COVID-19 started, but wow, if all restaurants were like Irazu, I would be eating takout all the time! They are very careful about health and safety, more than most (whereas I find the majority of places are lax about setting up social distancing barriers or ensuring masks are completely covering noses and mouths, so you are at the mercy of other customers and sometimes even staff). Here, they are fully masked and only open up the dining area when there is complete ventilation and otherwise provide a takeout window when that is not possible.

Also, as far as takeout is concerned, it is rare to find a restaurant where the takeout can compare to the quality of dine-in, but this place has the kinds of menu items that are your best bet. The smells of the food were great, and the taste and texture of the food did not disappoint. The steak in the pepito sandwich was tender and juicy. The medley of veggies in the veggie casado was salted just right, not too salty as many restaurants can do. Also, each of the different kinds of vegetables was cooked just right al dente, so I didn&apos;t get some that were too hard and/or some too mushy.

We ended up passing through the neighborhood earlier than expected and even though our order was through Grubhub and scheduled for pickup an hour later than we arrived, the staff kindly got our food ready right away as soon as I called to ask, and the owner even struck up a friendly conversation with us while we were waiting.

Wish we were staying closer to this restaurant so that we could frequent this place more often, though I have to say the casado still held up well and was still pretty warm when we got back to our place an hour later. The uniquely flavored oatmeal shake, while still good after our travels, is probably best consumed immediately, but the kitchen packed it very carefully and there were no spills (not even close) despite a long, bumpy car ride in bad traffic."
5,"WOWWWW. 

I am impressed. I had never tried Costa Rican food before, but this trip has me fantasizing about taking a trip!! 

We visited during the quarantine, and there was indoor and outdoor seating available. However, I don&apos;t know if it is typical, but they seemed understaffed. Our service was pretty slow, and it took maybe 25 minutes for a waiter to even come to our table after we were seated. 

However, I am willing to overlook all that because our food was SO tasty. I chose the Chicken Casada. It had all the right flavors- the refreshing and citrusy salad, the tomato and onion based chicken, the rice, and the grilled plantains. It was all so delightful, and the flavoring on the chicken was perfect. I will DEFINITELY be returning and trying even more of the menu. 

I will keep in mind having a more open schedule before coming next time in the event the service takes a bit longer than expected.

Would seriously recommend!"
5,Last night I had a delicious takeout meal from Irazu.  Their skirt steak dinners are amazing!  They have decided to remain takeout and delivery only.  Please support them!  I have been going there for 20 years.  The Cerdas family is the best!
5,"Oh man, was this delicious! We ordered via DwellSocial and got the Surf &amp; Turf Burrito, Chicken Rice Tray, pepito sandwich, plantains, and empanadas. Everything was great -- the steak was perfect, shrimp was delicious, and the rice tasted like my abuelita&apos;s rice. 

Definitely order from here, I&apos;ll be recommending this to everyone! We&apos;ll order on DwellSocial the next time it&apos;s near us again."
4,"I&apos;ve been to Irazu a few times now, and really enjoy it.  The atmosphere and vibe is really cool, I love the Pura Vida feel and the service is always FANTASTIC.  

I usually get the casado, which was one of my favorite things to eat in Costa Rica.  It&apos;s good, but never great, and a little salty.  You come more for the atmosphere than the food, but it&apos;s definitely worth it.  Also worth it is the oatmeal shake.  Highly recommend it for dessert."
4,"I finally made it to Wicker Park to Iraz√∫ to try their much-talked-about Pepito! It&apos;s been recommended by Eater, Thrillist, GoodEats, etc. and some have put it under a &quot;must eat in Chicago&quot; so my expectations were high.

I don&apos;t know if my expectations were through the roof but I thought the sandwich was good - not excellent. I loved the onions, the skirt steak, and the french bread. My only gripe was that it didn&apos;t taste like a sandwich that was made to order. It tasted like the steak, onions had been made, sat out, and thrown together. It was also on the smaller than I expected.

You get complimentary chips and salsa which is always a plus. The salsa has a kick but that&apos;s pretty much it - little flavor.

It&apos;s a great space and the staff were kind. I&apos;ll likely come back to try other things on the menu."
4,"The food here is just so good. We ordered a lot, including tostones, casado, the pepito sandwich, empanadas, and the oatmeal shake. My boyfriend says the pepito sandwich ranks among his top five of all time! The casado with skirt steak is delicious and we loved the empanadas. Even the fries and the plantain chips were awesome. We could have done without the tostones--not a lot of flavor, just very starchy."
5,"We used to frequent this place when we lived in Logan Square but moved long ago. We did a DwellSocial pickup yesterday in Glenview and it was absolutely delicious. We got guacamole (my 10 yo has never eaten so much guac!), plantains, burritos, a bowl, and two gigantic oatmeal shakes. The person who brought the box to my car thanked me no less than 5 times for my order. Heating instructions were so simple.  So grateful for the chance to enjoy this restaurant again!"
5,"My boyfriend and I have been walking past Irazu a couple months now, bc we live steps away and always mention how AMAZING their food smells, but haven&apos;t had a chance to try their food until today.  

Holy crap. We had ordered a steak and chicken burrito, but as a bowl. It did NOT disappoint. The steak was wonderfully flavored and cooked just right. I couldn&apos;t stop commenting on how wonderful our bowls were. I also added rice, sour cream, and avocado to mine. It was just the perfect amount of food, not too little where I&apos;m still hungry and not too much where I have 3 extra meals. 

I was also gifted an oatmeal shake, and I highly highly recommend it. My first sip resulted in me saying &quot;holy shit&quot; 

It is easily our favorite place to order now. Also, the young gentlemen at the counter was so nice and so personable. We are most definitely coming back."
4,"My first time trying out Costa Rican food and I must say I was impressed. From the moment I arrived, parking was easily accessible (city parking meter). The place was fairly filled and as I walked to my table, I couldn&apos;t help but notice what everyone was eating and it all smelled so good. Our waiter was really nice and the staff in general are all extremely friendly. Fried tortilla chips and green salsa are given to every table complimentary-not bad to snack on while overlooking the menu. Horchata and snicker oatmeal shake soooo good! it is BYOB."
4,"Tilapia Taco Platter  | Price: $16. 

Tina&apos;s Tip: 
- Ask to see if you can get the pico de gallo on the side or if they can toast your tortilla. Mine got so soggy! 
- Free oatmeal shake with yelp check in!"
5,"I held a fundraiser for my birthday to feed some essential workers at a local hospital. I choose to order catering from Irazu because I love their food, and I wanted to support a local business. Working with Justin was so nice, and he and the other Irazu workers did such a nice job fulfilling my large order and packaging everything nicely for me so I could easily carry them. When they heard the food was for hospital workers, they were extra enthused, and it was just so nice to feel like part of the Chicago community again after a year of distancing and isolation. The staff at the hospital were so happy to be fed such wonderful food, and I know their empanadas were a hit. Thank you again for such an easy and wonderful experience! I don&apos;t order catering often, but I would recommend this place for those who do!"
5,Definitely a must for shrimp lovers alike. Very pleased with our meal from Izaru. The quality of food is excellent and prices reasonable. The gallo pinto and plantains reminded us of our trip to Costa Rica. The delivery was also excellent.
5,"I had the Chicken Casado and Shrimp Ceviche delivered. It was packaged nicely and traveled really well. The chicken Casado was DELIGHTFUL, bursting with flavor and very filling. I love this neighborhood gem - so YUMMY!!!!"
4,"Tried out Irazu for the first time last weekend, and I&apos;m so glad I did! This was also my first time trying out Costa Rican food. We ordered the pepito steak sandwich, spinach &amp; cheese and beef &amp; potato empanadas, skirt steak casada dinner, and the pork chops a la tica. My absolute favorites were the casada and the empanadas. The skirt steak and the plantains in the casada were amazing, and I really enjoyed the rice that came with it. The only thing we weren&apos;t a fan of was the pepito steak sandwich - the meat was very tough to chew. Looking forward to eating here again in the future!"
5,"Everything here is great! My family loves coming here! Their horchata is soo good if you have a sweet tooth! I recommend the steak burrito or the steak Casado! Management and staff are very friendly and know our faces since we come so often! If you want to try authentic and tasty Costa Rican dining, this is the place!!"
5,Irazu has been a go-to for years for great Costa Rican fare. They&apos;ve gone above and beyond in the pandemic; every order has been better than the next. The manager also reached out just to thank us for our continued patronage through this rough time for restaurants.  Great food prepared by a great family business!
4,"This is a fun, comfortable restaurant with good service and food! They also have solid vegetarian options, including paella and chile relleno, and they&apos;re BYOB. 

We got complimentary chips as soon as we sat down (they were pretty oily but SUPER good) and had to start with an appetizer -- we ordered yuca fries, and the smaller size was perfect to split between 2 or even 3 people. The fries were dense and delicious and I&apos;d definitely recommend them! For entrees we ordered the Potato Taquitos and Arroz con Huevo (they offer the breakfast menu during dinner time!!). I preferred the taquitos as an overall meal because I thought there was a bit too much rice and not enough egg in the breakfast entree, but both were yummy and came with sweet plantains. 

Checking in on Yelp gets you a free oatmeal shake, which doesn&apos;t sound super enticing but is actually delicious! They can also make it with horchata as the base. I ordered the shake to-go and our waiter kindly split it into two different cups to make it easier to share -- the perfect way to end a great dinner!"
5,"It had been a while since I&apos;ve come here last don&apos;t think I had started writing Yelp reviews. Really appreciated the big windows. They bring out chips and salsa. The salsa is green. Went with the surf and turf burrito that has steak, shrimp, black beans and either pico de gallo or salsa. Went with a banana shake. Taste like real bananas. Don&apos;t love eating bananas alone but when you make a shake with them or bake them you can really unlock some massive flavor. Shrimp was pretty flavorful and the steak nice and tender."
