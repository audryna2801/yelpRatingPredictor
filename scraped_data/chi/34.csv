4,"I&apos;ve been wanting to go to Eataly for a while now and never have. My boyfriend recently suggested it for date night and I thought it was a great idea. Unfortunately, due to Covid, we weren&apos;t able to get a full food hall experience, but we were still able to eat at their restaurant, Osteria. 

We had a wonderful time. They had a nice wine selection. We shared a bottle of a white (I don&apos;t remember what it was called but it was first on the list of whites)

The Pizza Fritta appetizer was so yummy-- next time I would ask for a size of marinara to dip in. It needed some acidity. 

The Pappardelle was dreamy. The boar ragu was so hearty and delicious, and the sheeted pasta was cooked to perfection. I will be back even just for this! 

Service was great and attentive. Ambiance was good, felt very covid safe! 

Can&apos;t wait to come back when the quick service options are open."
5,"If you don&apos;t love Eataly you&apos;re lost and can&apos;t be found. Yeah yeah I know I&apos;m biased.  I end up here for the coffee. The coffee ...the coffee.  The Lavazza coffee, espresso is as good as it gets.  Just don&apos;t expect Dunkin or Starbucks here lol.  It&apos;s not the same animal. 

So Eataly has become my goto in Chicago for IItalian groceries/goods as it&apos;s convenient, fast, authentic and reasonably priced.  Just not crazy about the added sugar to the sauce I had last but that shouldn&apos;t deter anyone to come in here.  They still make Venchi hazelnut crepes (togo), gelati, breads, wine all available.  The produce section is now limited: herbs and hard to find organic produce and fruit.   The salumeria is insane, the cheese selection outrageous and the wine collection impressive. Periodically when I see a wheel of P. reggiano just freshly pried open, I&apos;ll buy a piece.....and experience heaven. 

Oh and don&apos;t forget  Venchi chocolate and Xmas panettone.  That is all. 

Tip:  During Covid-19, you can purchase takeaway and groceries and cannot eat inside.  There are about 10 outdoor tables available for dining."
5,"We stopped in Eataly Chicago to grab a quick coffee. The barista was efficient but not overly personable. Our lattes tasted fantastic! So it was a win. 

Since we were there, I had to stop by the gorgeous dessert area. Everything always looks beautiful. It&apos;s like tiny little pieces of artwork. We got a little box of 4 pretty choices and we loved everything. The cream puff and tiramisu were my favorites!

We decided to pick up some black squid ink pasta. They had a fantastic selection of all things pasta. We also picked up a few packages of cookies and other treats. Yikes! Once you get in there, you&apos;ll want to buy a little of everything!

Right now you can park curbside in front of the store for a few minutes with your car flashers on. It was super convenient!"
5,"A special thank you to Julian Perez in the Eataly Wine Department who recently took the time to help me search for and explain a variety of wines and limoncello options!

Julian is knowledgeable, professional, and has outstanding customer service skills!

I will be back again.....Thanks again to Eataly Management for their choice in Julian in the Wine Department-excellent fit!"
3,"Try the hot chocolate it&apos;s super interesting and almost like pudding! I love this place for all the gourmet everything you can buy and take home. They have a large wine selection as well, and before Covid you could get ready made food or dine in the restaurant and it was amazing! Hopefully that comes back soon. 

Only downside was I was walking around a week or two ago there with a friend/client during the snow storm and we stopped in. The lady at the prosciutto and cured meats section was not very pleasant. I had my mask down for a second to take a sip of my hot chocolate and she literally yelled at me. Ha ha no one was in this place at all however, I get the Covid rules I work in design and hospitality. She didn&apos;t have to be bitchy! Literally. I won&apos;t judge Eataly by her though. You can&apos;t stop my shine! Hot chocolate for days."
5,"This place is simply amazing! The fancy collection of wine, cheese, meet, fresh pasta,herbs, fish, risotto, truffle, bread, and fresh vegetables are unbelievably unique and unbeatable! The restaurants were not 100% functional due to covid, so I ordered carry out and can&apos;t express how wonderful they were! The little Italian shopping Center is one of those places that you must go if you come to chicago! High quality homemade mozzarella and fresh pasta are very rare to find! Staff were nice, friendly and professional! I&apos;m sharing some pictures to prove my point;)"
5,"On this #ThankYouThursday  I am giving a shout out to Eataly Chicago.  We were there several months ago when the weather was nicer and you could still dine inside.

As you know. our relationship did not start out so well if you read my first review.  It was like a blind date that went south.  It was like Henry Cavill showed up (food) but when he opened his mouth, I got Donald Trump (customer service).  But in good faith Eataly reached out for more feedback, made good on all the things that caused our first date to end on a spectacularly bad note.

The second date was pretty amazing and I upgraded my review to reflect the effort they had put forth in the level of customer service that we experienced that night.  The Doctor and I truly had a great time there.  The food was never a problem for me, it was the service.

Fast forward to COIVD times, and we make a reservation to do dinner there during our staycation.  If I thought our second date was amazing, the third one I was ready to get those embordered hand towels with our initials on it for the bathroom.  First of all, the level of care that went into ensuring that social distancing was observed was amazing.  I think the next table that was closest to us was about 10 ft away.  The utensils came in their own sealed bag as well as the slices of bread.  Everyone was wearing a mask and gloves.

What was amazing to see was a young lady who immediately went into the bathroom to clean it after some customers came out.  She didn&apos;t see me watching her, but I saw her cleaning.  I also notice the level of cleaning of the tables after customers had left.  That was very reassuring.  Again the meal was a delight as always.  

So on this Thank You Thursday, I salute Eataly Chicago with another star to say I do and will be seeing you in the wedded bliss of my pasta dish with one of those lovely pizzas and a bottle of bubbles to wash it all down."
4,"This is a fun joint to have happened upon.  We are a family of four - two grade school kids, two adults.  We were in Chicago, hungry, adults needed coffee.  We came into Eataly.  First stop - coffee.  Then we helped the kids find something to eat. They had fun looking at all their options and so did we.  It was great for our family.  We all were able to find that perfect something that hit the spot.  We grabbed some groceries for our trip and out the door.  Easy, fun, and an experience to remember!"
5,"Love the authentic Italian aromas in the air. When I want to jazz up my dinners, I make a quick stop here. They have everything you need for making something special; from appetizers to desserts and everything in between. Don&apos;t forget the wine. I stopped in to grab some gouda cheese and mortadella sausage for my cheese board I make some weekends. Of course, I could not resist wandering around other isles."
2,"Giving 2 stars because even though the food tastes good, I found a piece of METAL in my kale salad. I cut my gum on it, but this would have been much more dangerous if I had accidentally swallowed it, or if a kid had been eating it. This is definitely not a mistake that should have happened."
5,"I LOVE THIS PLACE! Eataly is absolutely amazing! It has everything that you need. Since we currently are unable to do indoor dining, Eataly has created out door dining and are trying their best to accommodate! 

The food and the service is absolutely fantastic! I would have ordered another helping if I was not already full from my pasta (and some of my fianc√©&apos;s haha). The drinks are delicious and strong as well.

Also, the &quot;grocery&quot; store and everything else you can buy inside is a FANTASTIC bonus as well.  I love getting all of my imported Italian goods there and the ONLY place I shop to make any Italian dish at home. 

This place truly is fantastic!"
5,"If I lived in Chicago, I&apos;d probably be here every week or two. If you love Italy, or Italian food, this is the place to go - either grocery shopping or to dine (or grab take out in this COVID-era).

When I was there last, I had dinner at Bar Sabbia. The menu is limited at this individual eating area, however the vibe is fun and the pasta and wine are delicious!"
4,"I don&apos;t know why, but for some reason I feel embarrassed admitting I love Eataly? 

I think because it is very much a touristy vibe that&apos;s not unique to any one big city, and yet here I am still proclaiming my fangirling. 

The butternut squash ravioli is heavenly here, and I will continue to return to Eataly for that dish alone. Hubby and I also love wandering around, ordering random desserts and buying random Italian groceries. 

It&apos;s just fun, and the food is good. I love feeling like a tourist :)"
4,"Delicious pizza , tiramisu , coffee , pasta and pesto sauce !! 

The pizza is warm , fresh tasting and the pizza sauce is light but super tasty !  

Tiramisu is bit expensive but it&apos;s so good !! 12 dollars for about medium size . But you can buy the lady fingers and make it at home because they sell a value pack of lady finger for only 4 dollars !! 

Also the pasta and sauces on the second floor is a good place to walk thru and pick up some delicious sauces !! 

I love their pesto sauce . 

Overall a bit on the expensive side for simple things but this is not the place for simple things !  The staff is helpful in finding items because they can be scattered in various parts of the store . 

The major reason for the drop in stars is if you drive the parking in front for pickup has super aggressive people who have no patience ."
4,"I&apos;ve ordered drinks a couple of times from here before. My favorite has to be the Ice cappuccino.

 The server I had today was super super nice . Because i am a little lactose intolerant, but wanted to keep the nice white foamy top on my cappuccino, he suggested to use a milk alternative at the bottom and just use milk for the top foam( so I would benefit from the best of both worlds:) how thoughtful! ). Really nice strong Italian expresso with nice foamy top for a delicious iced cappuccino!

  Takes me back to the train station platforms in Montreux, Switzerland where they had the little vending machines that sell instant hot coffee drinks) this is actually better! But that was more unique of course. My other favorite lavazza is the one inside a hotel on St.Clair and Ohio St which in itself has more of a cafe feeling but this one being inside Etaly has more ample seating! ( If you don&apos;t come on a super crowded summer day !)"
5,"Came here a few days ago and the Eataly restaurant fest menu was available. I got the two course meal. Started with the meatballs (Polpette al Sugo) which were very juicy and very large. As my main dish I chose the Tagliatelle alla Bolognese. Pasta was fresh and the Bolognese was definitely well done. Overall, Eataly always has my heart with their food."
5,"I love Italian expressions like, &quot;Non fare il salame!&quot;

Literally it means, &quot;Don&apos;t act like salami!&quot;

But the English equivalent is, &quot;Don&apos;t be an idiot!&quot;

But I am an idiot!

Anyway, I love the colorful Italian language, and Italian food too.

And Eatly is such a magnificat place to get it.

Their meat and cheese display will take your breath away.

And your olfactory sense will be excited as you inhale the wonderful aromas of fresh baked bread and aromatic Parmigano-Reggiano and Ricotta cheese.

And don&apos;t forget running crusty bread through good olive oil - with crushed pepper.

Sorry, I just drooled on my phone,

Eatly is sorprendente, which means amazing, for a relaxing lunch or dinner with a nice glass of vino like La Mozza I Perazzi.

Bon Appetit!"
4,"Their fresh made pasta and pasta sauces are so good! We also love their tiramisu. Would say their grocery items are slightly overpriced, but that&apos;s expected I guess."
4,"Eataly is both a specialty grocery store and a fast casual food court serving everything from prime rib sandwiches to gelato. I really enjoy cooking, but with my work schedule I just don&apos;t have the time to cook as often as I&apos;d like. Occasionally I&apos;ll make time to whip up something nice. Most recently, I was on a bolognese kick. I&apos;ve been trying to perfect a recipe for a while now. 

Eataly was my one stop shop to gather everything I needed. .. parmesan rinds, short ribs, ect. There&apos;s fresh pasta is inexpensive, well made and a huge time saver. They even offer pasta making classes if you&apos;re looking for cool date night or just interested in learning. 

The seafood, butcher&apos;s counter, wine selection and cheese offerings are all exceptional. They carry the finest selections of premium meats, seafood and cheese. This is an Italian grocer so the wines are mostly if not exclusively Italian.

As far as the food court I typically opt for the pastas or the prime rib sandwich. The gelato is solid, but not special. Oh. ..and the fresh bread is great too. I know Mario Batali hates that he effed up this opportunity with poor choices. This place is a cash cow."
4,If nothing else its a rad place to walk around in. They have a good selection of gurb and grog and some world class pastries. If I remember correctly everything is made by hand on-site. Multi floor establishment in a great area of the city.
