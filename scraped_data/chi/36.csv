5,"Amazing all around. Came pre-covid with a friend and was able to try a little bit of everything. It was all delicious, so fresh and entirely locally sourced. Menu differs nightly so can&apos;t speak to the current offerings, though I&apos;m sure everything is just as good. Especially loved the kale salad, Brussels sprouts, and carrot cake during my visit. Definitely on the pricier end but completely worth it."
5,"This place is the real deal. It&apos;s the perfect combination of excellent service, small batch food, locally sourced ingredients, and local charm. They&apos;re currently doing takeout/takeaway only, so you order at the counter and then wait for your order to be called. There&apos;s a 15% mandated charge on all orders (in lieu of a tip), which I think is more than reasonable. I ordered their breakfast burrito and blueberry muffin, and both were phenomenal. The blueberry muffin was one of the best I&apos;ve ever had - perfectly baked, full of blueberries, but not too sweet, with a sugar crust on top. CHEF&apos;S KISS. The burrito was also amazing - it&apos;s vegetarian, and filled with cheese, eggs, avocado, and potatoes. They also include three small ramekins of red salsa, green salsa, and sour cream. The burrito is lightly seared, so it&apos;s got a perfect subtle crunch. I will 100% be back!"
5,"My favorite restaurant in all of Chicago. From the friendliness of the staff, the freshness of their selections and the fact that their menu is so innovative and changing constantly, it&apos;s why I keep coming back. They&apos;re also being extra careful during the COVID pandemic too and not fully opening up their dining room. While this is surely costing them money, they&apos;re doing this because they care more about the health of their staff and their community more than making a profit."
5,"Does anyone else want to sing the Turner&apos;s &quot;Simply the best&quot;?  XD Ok, well, I am just overwhelmed with positive emotions after visiting Lula cafe! 
 As people say (btw, I&apos;m not sure that someone else would say this, but I would happy to be the first in such case): the soul sings when the stomach is full. And if it&apos;s full with local food - trust me, you&apos;ll not only sing but also dance) 
Moving back to the main idea of this review -  5-star dishes!! The first one is duck breast with charred cabbage and fregola sarda. The second winner was apple-cheddar danish (the ingredients are  apples, white cheddar, rosemary, probably something else but you&apos;d better check it on the menu)! 
My verdict - simply delicious!!"
4,"This place is beyond popular. We had to wait a bit for the two of us. 
My friend picked this little, cute hot spot out to meet up. She&apos;s gotten to know Chicago well since living here for a few years by now. 

This cafe has a cozy feel. Staff were warm and welcoming. We were seated withing 10 minutes of arriving. It was a busy Saturday. 

I had the tofu scramble, my friend ordered the chilaquiles. 
My tofu and vegetable scramble was tasty. My friend really enjoyed her chilaquiles, will have to try her dish the next time I am in town, it looked really good too."
5,"Incredible food, but always a wait - be prepared! For this reason, Lula is always bustling and energetic. Fresh and locally sourced ingredients. Yummy coffee. Definitely one of the brunch stalwarts."
4,"I had heard so many great things and wish i had gone more! Went for brunch on a weekend and it was def busy. Had to wait a bit, but well worth it. Got the soup which was amazing esp with the bread."
3,"I need to come back for their famous brunch but it&apos;s always crowded from what I heard. It&apos;s a cute dinner atmosphere and doesn&apos;t take brunch reservations. 

For dinner, we split the baked feta as an appetizer, my friend&apos;s favorite dish. It was ok but not for me. I like that it&apos;s a unique dish that I haven&apos;t seen everywhere. For my main dish I ordered the spaghetti, it had bacon in it but I felt it was missing beef. I didn&apos;t care for it. Just felt it was too much carbs not enough meat. Wasn&apos;t in love with the bacon."
4,"Lula Cafe boasts an inventive and unique menu and deserves every ounce of Logan Square hype it&apos;s earned. 

I FINALLY swung by for a cozy Sunday brunch, and by 10:30 Lula was packed. I&apos;m not a coffee fan but made an exception for their Turkish coffee bun, which was a thing of beauty. Their Royale sandwich (tuna and toppings on sourdough) was delightful as well. Overall their brunch/breakfast menu had a good mix of classic and innovative dishes. 

The service reflected an &quot;I work in the hottest spot in Logan Square and I know it&quot; attitude. No one was particularly welcoming, but no one was blatantly rude. 

I would absolutely brave the crowds again to try more pastry magic and to be inspired by Lula&apos;s menu."
5,"This is a very nice, low key place that kills the brunch menu. The seating very nice and simple, and service is on point. 

I got the Turkey 99 sandwich and it does not disappoint. It&apos;s made on a crispy grain bread melted with cheddar cheese, avocado, spicy aioli and sprouts and it has such a nice combination of ingredients, it melts in your mouth. 

I also had a great latte paired with a beet and hazelnut cake which was also subtly sweet and the whole meal was beyond satisfactory. I applaud the great innovative creations on this menu and can&apos;t wait to try more."
4,"Came here for brunch with friends! 

FOOD: 
- The French Toast looked really yummy. It tasted so good too, the lemon and cream just melts in your mouth. However, it is a little too sweet. I couldn&apos;t finish this because it was just too much sugar. The portion size is large and i recommend that you order something savory with this. 
- The tofu dish was so healthy! I love soft tofu and the spices on this made it nice and zesty. 
- The burrito was a little bland. It is very filling, most people at the table couldn&apos;t finish more than half so i recommend that you and someone else get this and the french toast and split the dish and swap. 
- The lula coffee was not very impressive. It had an unusual aftertaste. 

AMBIENCE:
- Super trendy and hipster. It&apos;s a very comfortable place to eat, we had families there, Young and old groups of friends, couples, everyone is welcome. 
- Nice and clean
- 2 bathrooms, not gender based 

SERVICE: 
- Had to wait over an hour for a table of 8, but this was on a saturday for brunch. So expected. I wish they took reservations.
- Food was delivered relatively quickly for such a large group
- Staff was very nice, have good suggestions

Had a good time here with friends, interested in trying more of their dishes!"
5,"I love Lula cafe! There brunch menu offers a variety of choices and the dishes I have tried have been spot on! I come here for brunch when I go to Chicago. When I went I got the smoked trout scramble and it was delicious! My sister got the two farm eggs which were cooked well, a good portion size, and came with yummy toast! 
The atmosphere is great, wait staff are friendly, and interior is adorable! If you do go to Lula for brunch plan on arriving early because they do not take reservations. We waited about 15-20 min which is what the hostess predicted. 
Lula is worth the wait! Go try Lula for brunch!"
4,"Lula cafe serves a trout scramble that is out of this world delicious. You can tell they care about each ingredient at this restaurant, and the execution is just spot on. Do not pass this cafe up, it&apos;s worth stopping in"
4,"Very impressed with this place!! I can&apos;t believe it took me a year of living in Logan square to finally try this place and I&apos;m so happy I did! One of my best friends from out of town came to visit and she loves brunch so I had to find somewhere to take her. This place did not disappoint.

We got the brioche French toast - cranberry compote, brown butter caramel &amp; coconut streusel. Now, I&apos;m not a big fan of French toast or sweet things but this was on another level. I ate the whole thing and loved every bite of it. It was so soft and fluffy and just wow. We also got the smoked trout scramble and the tofu and vegetable scramble. Both were full of flavor and delicious. I didn&apos;t care too much for the potatoes though, they were a little bit too salty for me. I will definitely be coming back for more and to try the dinner options."
3,"My fiance is a huge fan of this place. I think it&apos;s super cute vibes/decor but am not as in love with the food itself -- though I will say it&apos;s unique in terms of ingredients and being pretty veggie forward.

I do remember liking the poppy seed pastry at brunch."
5,"In a happening neighborhood like Logan Square, a new restaurant pops up every week. Naturally, you might want to check out everything that&apos;s new and exciting. You might have decided that Lula is just a tried and true brunch spot. This is not so! Lula keeps it fresh every day, year after year! Breakfast, lunch, dinner, Lula has it going on! 
Radicchio and winter citrus salad - this is exactly the salad I love to order at restaurants because it looks labor intensive to make. Mostly, because you have to skin the thin skin off the citrus pieces. Also, whatever the crunchy stuff in that salad was. And the dressing. Best winter salad, really!
Abalone mushrooms with crispy buckwheat. Amazing. They made buckwheat cool. The mushrooms are thick and meaty, the sauce complements the dish well. My meat-loving husband was gushing about how good this dish was.
Ribeye - good, but not a standout like the other 2. I honestly liked the rapini in that dish better then the steak.
Looking forward to visiting again. Always a pleasure to take out of town guests and people from the suburbs here."
5,"It is rare that a famous restaurant lives up to the enormous hype surrounding it, and rarer still that a meal inspires me to appreciate brunch as a concept. Lula Cafe, one of the crowned jewels of the spirited Logan Square culinary gallery, humbly managed to do both. Self-described as a &quot;boheme bistro of the unclassifiable kind,&quot; Lula specializes in fresh and unpretentious farm-to-table fare prepared in rustic but creative ways. Make sure to plan ahead because space is limited and it&apos;s a popular haunt, particularly when the weather is nice and sunny.

At the waiter&apos;s urging, I selected the shrimp and sweet corn pancake, a savory crepe topped with marinated squash, spinach, pistachio, and delicate folds of shredded sheep&apos;s milk cheese. The dish was perfectly balanced in texture and flavor, with just the right amount of sweetness to elevate the nuttiness of the main ingredients. The chunks of fried potato that I stole off my dad&apos;s plate were also superb. Everyone left the meal immensely satisfied and energized, which is a nice change of pace from the typical post-brunch malaise."
4,"I had Lulu bookmared and came here on my one evening free during a work trip to Chicago, completely forgetting I&apos;d come for brunch years ago! Despite my usual no-repeat-restaurants rule, I was glad to try a different meal. I also didn&apos;t feel self-conscious eating alone.

THE WAIT: None on a Wednesday around 5:15pm. They weren&apos;t serving their dinner menu for another 15 minutes. 

THE SERVICE: Chill, good pace, good recommendations (Pasta Yiayia ftw!). I appreciate that you can order half servings!

THE COST: $44.57 total, including tips, for dinner for one. A bit steep but worth it for an occasional treat.

MUST-HAVES: 100% Silk Cocktail, Pasta Yiayia.

See my photos for additional details!"
5,"Oh my gosh. This definitely meets all the hyped up expectations for brunch! 

We came here on a Wednesday morning at around 11:30 AM from out of town. The place was extremely packed, but we were able to snag a seat immediately at the counter space. We would have to have waited 20 minutes for a table. Which is crazy considering that it was a weekday breakfast.

We ordered the acorn squash and egg, as well as the brioche French toast. Both dishes were extraordinary and left us completely satisfied. The brioche French toast melts in your mouth but after a few bites, it was definitely a little too sweet, so sharing a salty and sweet dish with someone might be better. 

Overall, I would definitely come back if in town. They have incredible service and amazing solid dishes!"
5,"Met friends here for brunch on a Sunday. It was very crowded but we got seats at the bar and had mimosas while we waited. They said it would be about 40 minutes for a table and that was accurate. I ordered the French toast and it was amazing. My friends ordered the burrito and the egg plate, and both looked delicious. This restaurant has an amazing aesthetic and I love the vibe. As someone new to town, I will definitely be back."
