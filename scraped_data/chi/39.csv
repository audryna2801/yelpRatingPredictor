5,"One of my favorite restaurants in Chicago! Kai Zan showcases a lot of tasty Japanese fusion-y morsels. Some of our favorites are the Escolar Pearls, Angry Crab, and the decadent Wagyu Fried Rice. The omakase (chef&apos;s choice, tasting menu) is a fantastic choice, as there&apos;s a lot of food at a price that doesn&apos;t break the bank. 

During COVID times, Kai Zan has not offered dine-in, but the pick up options (through Clover) has been great and the food travels well."
5,"Wonderful experience getting carry out! Order was correct, fresh, and beautiful flavors. The sushi was very well packed for travel. Pick up was quick and easy - glad we can still enjoy fabulous high quality sushi!"
5,"I was apprehensive to write a review prior to my 2nd visit based solely off of the fact that I believe &quot;takeout sushi&quot; is an oxymoron. However, this is the best damn sushi I&apos;ve ever had &amp; its the flavors &amp; quality are consistently good. Each visit I ordered the &quot;Kai zan bites set&quot; &amp; the &quot;pearls set&quot; which are both amazing &amp; warrant me ordering each item every time I visit. My first visit I got the wagyu rice which honestly I wasn&apos;t a fan of. It didn&apos;t have the extremely rich wagyu flavor I&apos;ve come to love. That&apos;s however the only negative thing I have to say about this place. On my 2nd visit o ordered the &quot;flaming crab &amp; angry crab maki set&quot; &amp; this is truly solidified my opinion of best sushi in Chicago.  Twas amazingly good. They have earned me as a loyal &amp; although it&apos;s expensive especially considering its take out, I&apos;ll be a repeat customer."
5,Took my partner here for his Birthday. I made a reservation ahead of time. The food was prompt and came out very quickly. The staff was very attentive and kind. They did well at explaining the different options and the plates. The food was to die for. I&apos;ve never had omakase before and I will be having more in the future. The atmosphere was very small and intimate. This place made my partners day extra special.
3,"Kai Zan is wildly popular in Chicago and known for their Omakase. I first tried in 2012 when they first opened. I couldn&apos;t remember if I enjoyed so decided to try again. I&apos;ll start with the positives. The fish and other ingredients were very fresh. The restaurant is small, but service was a team effort. Everyone worked well together to ensure we were well taken care of.

The less than positive. .. while each dish was made with fresh ingredients, I didn&apos;t find myself wanting more. Nothing was particularly flavorful. Again another dining experience were it wasn&apos;t bad enough to send dishes back or complain, but not good enough to seek out another visit. Clearly I&apos;m in the minority with my view. I&apos;ll try again if I happen to be in the area with sushi on my mind."
4,"spending over $300 and being surged out on the grounds that somebody is hanging tight for our table, we had, in any event, three individuals approach us and us needed to leave our incomplete beverages so we can pay rapidly and leave. Despite the fact that the food was acceptable yet I could stay away forever here consequently"
5,Best sushi experience in the neighborhood! So delicious and I&apos;m dying to go back soon!
5,"No doubt this is a 5 star restaurant. I had no qualms bringing a friend for a special birthday celebration after seeing raves upon raves of Kai Zan, and several people telling me this was their favorite restaurant in Chicago. The title is well-deserved!

We got the chef&apos;s choice omakase and the quality and execution of each course was top notch. Granted you aren&apos;t paying hundreds of dollars for the meal so nothing was over-the-top decadent, but each dish used the freshest seafood. My favorite course was the seared orange rush (salmon-wrapped scallop), and my friend&apos;s was the angry crab (tuna-wrapped crab) and the pork belly. Like many have mentioned, you will definitely leave feeling very full, but not full enough to leave out dessert! We tried the mango mochi ice cream that&apos;s made in-house, and it was definitely worth it.

Service was so smooth and our dishes came out one after another with minimal wait. There were people waiting for our seats after our meal so it did feel a bit rushed at the end, but that really didn&apos;t detract from the meal. I really enjoyed sitting at the bar and watching the chefs make the food, but there&apos;s a variety of very cool and intimate booth seating here too."
4,"Open for carry-out during the pandemic! I was excited to see that they were offering some of the favorites from their omakase menu. I had the Kai Zan bites set. The maki rolls were actually my favorite. Fyi, the specialty sushi pieces were much smaller than usual. The food was good, regardless, and I&apos;m happy to support local businesses!"
5,"Wow... I think I found my top sushi place in Chicago and top 3 around the US. My boyfriend took me here for my birthday dinner and our experience was phenomenal. Service was top notch - all the staff were so knowledgeable, attentive, and friendly. It&apos;s so hard to come across this type of amazing service in Chicago. 

The place is small, cozy, and intimate. We got seated at a booth, which was so perfect for our dinner date. We opted for the chef omakase, which is $70 for 10 courses I believe. You definitely will leave full. The dishes came out at a perfect pace. For each course, someone would come over and explain what the dish was along with the flavors in it. I drool every time I think of how amazing each course was, it was that good. Our favorite was the Madai carpaccio - freshest red snapper and olive oil gave it so much flavor and the toro (fatty tuna belly) just MELTS in your mouth! The escolar and maguro pearls was our absolute favorite - perfectly seared and that truffle is to die for. I can&apos;t even begin to explain how delicious all the flavors were. I will be coming back to try the premium omakase along with the uni. 

Make reservations a few weeks out. Credit card is required if it&apos;s for more than a party of 2."
4,"We made a reservation 1 month in advance cuz this place is extremely popular. As soon as we arrived, we were seated right away. The service here was up to par and our server was def prepared to answer our questions.

We ordered their omakase (chef&apos;s choice which is $69 for 10 courses) and added $15 for two people to share. Since neither of us are big eaters, I would say this is more than enough for us to share. 

All courses are fusion style small dishes. Up untill tuna dashi, everything was delicious with their twists. The rest of dishes were the ones you can get at typical sushi restaurants in the Midwest. Our least favorite was the Main which were underwhelming. Overall, nice experience."
4,"The omakase experience here is great! It was more than i could eat, and I can eat. Come with a group, order some sake, and settle in for a great meal!"
5,"Been here a couple times and I am SO excited and looking forward to going back! Kai Zan is the place where I first fell in love with escolar and hand rolls. We sat at the bar and ordered the New Omakase / Chef&apos;s choice. I had no idea what I was in for, but this was the freshest seafood I have ever had. The escolar feels like a cloud in your mouth and is the softest, most delicious fish. If you&apos;re adventurous and love seafood/sushi, this place is a must try! 

Even after I was done with the Omakase I placed another order of the Escolar Pearls. This was also my first time trying oyster and uni shooters and they were delicious. 

The chef prepared some very creative and unique dishes, and to be honest, I cannot remember the names of all of them, but I highly recommend everyone try the Omakase. It is on the slightly more expensive side (around $70), but it is a good amount of food (10 small courses) and so worth it. I don&apos;t usually like anchovies, but there one dish prepared with them that was amazing.  

The restaurant is small and cozy, but very popular, so I strongly recommend making a reservation as soon as you can. Nice ambiance. Service was great and the dishes were served in a prompt manner. Sitting at the bar, we got to see the chef prepare the dishes in front of us which was a cool experience. I actually prefer the bar seating over the wooden booth.

Hands down some of the best sushi and seafood I&apos;ve had in Chicago. Highly recommend!"
4,"My first time trying out an omakaze! My mom told me she needed to make a reservation ahead of time and that making changes to the reservation cost money. So if you plan on eating here, plan properly and accordingly!

The omakaze is charged per person and is 7 courses total. I am not am expert on omakazes so the roughly $60 per person for the omakaze may or may not break your bank (poor college student speaking here, I wouldn&apos;t have imagined coming here if it weren&apos;t for my parents tbh lol).

There were two menus to choose from for the omakaze. One allowed the sushi chefs to utilize their creativity to make a unique menu for you at a higher charge. The other is a pre-set menu that costs less.

Each course of the omakaze were delicious, small bites of sushi or sashimi. The most interesting was the raw quail egg shot; not a huge fan but not terrible. The best was the fatty tuna nigiri in my opinion. The last course is a plate of sashimi for each person, and plates of rolls. Each party gets different rolls based on how many people are in your party. I thought that I wouldn&apos;t be full bt the meal but by the end I could barely finish and my stomach was so full.

This was overall an enjoyable experience and would recommend (to those who could afford it)."
5,Love this spot and the fact that it is so close! I&apos;m happy they are doing carry out because of Covid bc I really missed their sushi. Highly recommended! Definitely get the green monster.
5,"It&apos;s as other reviewers say. You&apos;re getting a great omakase deal at 10 courses for $69. And the food is very flavorful and interesting. Most of the dishes are in small portions of course but you&apos;ll most likely be satisfied at the end. The matcha creme brulee is not part of the regular omakase but I would recommend it as a strong finish to a fun meal. 

Service was solid. Polite and on top of replacing my dishes."
5,"This place really exceeded my expectations. So I&apos;m from California and exclusively went to one place to get sushi because it was the best. Since moving out here, I&apos;ve been trying to find my new go-to sushi spot. While Kai Zan won&apos;t be that new go-to spot because it&apos;s price range is a little high for that, this place is AMAZING for a special occasion!
Both my partner and I got their traditional Omakaze menu, and course after course they just knocked my socks off! The menu had the perfect flow of fresh to sweet to acidic, ending with a beautiful plate of sashimi. Even my partner, who isn&apos;t the biggest sushi lover, walked away enjoying &quot;90%&quot; of his meal - which is pretty darn good. Everything was fresh and soft and delicate with explosive flavor!
Some of my own favorites off the menu were the shooters (because I love squishy things with vinegar) and the orange crush which was salmon wrapped around a scallop.
Like previous reviews have said, you do get a lot of food for the price. This is not a tiny bite per course for 10 courses, you do really eat your fill! We were full by course 8 but kept trucking because everything was so darn tasty. 
The service here was also stellar, they explained every course as it was brought and our waters and teas were always full.
Thanks for an amazing meal Kai Zan, you made my birthday very special!!"
4,"We&apos;ve been here for the classic omakase so we had to come back for the premium which changes based on the ingredients the chef has and uses highly quality products. This seemed like a complete opposite of their regular omakase as it had much more earthy tones (think like hamachi taste and lots of mushrooms) than traditional Japanese seafood (sushi/sashimi). I kind of wish there was a better mix of both, but overall I&apos;m glad we tried this and everything was still very high quality. The quality products given were more uni, wagyu, high cuts of sashimi like fatty tuna. What was really interesting about the sashimi was it paired with a variety of picked vegetables - I&apos;ve never had that before! Really interesting pairing. The donburi with quail egg yolk, uni and ikura and of course the wagyu were my favorite courses. Staff was great, explaining each dish and sitting at the bar was exciting to see the chefs at work. They would even stop and ask us how we were enjoying the meal which made it really personable."
5,"Oh gosh, whenever I&apos;m in Chicago, Kai Zan is a mandatory stop. I dream of Kai Zan everyday! We visited before COVID and had the most perfect omakase dining experience, and we have ordered to-go from them as well. To keep it nice and simple, Kai Zan does not disappoint."
5,"We have been to Kai Zan twice already and it&apos;s always worth to go back to.  We did tasting menu on both times and enjoyed each course served.  The service is phenomenal and the ambiance is great!  We were seated on both times in small private room.

Their omakase is highly recommended and the price is reasonable compared to other omakase in the city."
