5,"Such a cool and yummy brunch spot! I&apos;ve never we been here for dinner or lunch but been out to brunch a couple times and it never disappoints! 
Their burger is always juicy and fresh and cooked to perfection. I also love their selection of freshly squeezed juices which are refreshing and a good alternative to alcohol. Their Bloody Mary bar is extravagant and really unique. 
So sad they pulled the cauliflower grits out of the menu.  I&apos;ll be looking forward to dining here again post COVID!"
5,"We tried this place for a friend&apos;s birthday brunch and it did not disappoint! It was super convenient that they had outdoor seating for those who wished to dine in. The Kennebec Fries were cooked to perfection, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The sauce that came with it was amazing and the fried lemon and chili added a nice touch! The food and staff were great overall and they were sweet enough to bring out a slice of cake for the birthday girl!"
5,"We had take out dinner from here a couple of times We didn&apos;t eat the food until at least 30 minutes after picking it up, so I&apos;m sure it would have been even better fresh.

Almost everything we had was vegan, and there were plenty of options. They were great.

MUSHROOM &amp; QUINOA BURGER- Okay. Probably much better fresh.
VEGAN TRUFFLED MUSHROOM RISOTTO- Delicious. This is really amazing. It didn&apos;t seem vegan.
RIGATONI W/ VEGETABLE BOLOGNESE-Fine.
HUMMUS &amp; VEGETABLES-Fantastic. A really really great hummus.
KUNG PAO CAULIFLOWER-Amazing. I could eat this everyday.
MELON &amp; BERRIES-Great.
HASHBROWNS- Great. Which means probably even better fresh.
AVOCADO TOAST-Okay. Never let Avocado toast sit, this always needs to be fresh."
5,"Spent a day in the city and couldn&apos;t have chosen a better spot for brunch!

The atmosphere was as good as it could be given the circumstances; I ordered an oat milk latte to accompany the heater in keeping me toasty inside and out.

Upon hearing of my vegan diet, my server (Chris) was quick to recommend and describe several dishes--without even having to leave to ask the kitchen!

The presentation of drinks and food was certainly &quot;Insta-worthy.&quot; The Avocado &amp; Jalapeño Toast was the perfect amount of spicy. I also took a vegan cookie paired with a black coffee to enjoy in Millennium Park.

I will definitely be returning next time I&apos;m in town to revisit the immaculate ambiance and service and to explore the rest of the menu."
5,"Such a cute place ! Great energy and even better food. 

I ordered the mushroom and quinoa burger and my friend had the eggs your way and my other friend had the wonderful egg white omelet and we got an order of light and fluffy lemon pancakes for the table w/hot toddies! 

Everything was so so delicious and I highly recommend coming here. 

We had Shua as our server and he was so fantastic and knowledgeable. He gave great recommendations and was so helpful!"
5,Yummy. Delicious. Craft. Unpretentious. Yet really cool vibe. Great service. Full bar. Delightful menu.
5,"So...this review is very delayed, but we had a wonderful dinner at Beatrix back in February.  It was restaurant week, so it was great value in addition to great food and great service.

We started with the kennebec fries, which I have had before, and we enjoyed it.  But the black bean cakes were a very pleasant surprise!  They were so flavorful. Both the black bean cakes, along with the guacamole and chips that came with them, tasted extremely fresh.  The server brought out a glass of pinot noir along with dinner, a nice touch for restaurant week.

My entrée was the salmon and it was cooked perfectly: not too soft, but not overdone and really nicely seasoned.  His entrée was the steak tacos.  Again, they were very well seasoned and a healthy portion.

He got the chia pudding for dessert.  I did not care for it, but I only had one bite so I won&apos;t knock off a star.  My dessert was the oh my caramel pie, which I&apos;ve had before, and it was as good as remembered."
1,"Had reservations here on Friday and it took 25 minutes to seat us. After getting seated we waited about 10-15 minutes for a server and no one came. Finally I waved a server down and he said no i&apos;m not your server but let me go get someone. Waited another 5 minutes and our server finally came. Honestly, I was looking forward to having drinks here, but the service was horrible and the way they managed reservations was bad. The drinks were decent. Won&apos;t be returning to this location."
5,"Beatrix is a great casual spot that has a few locations around the city. I have enjoyed breakfast, lunch and desserts here. 

I think the menu is diverse enough for everyone. If you have a vegetarian in your group, they will be happy too. Their lemon pancakes are my favorite. They are light and thin reminiscent of a crepe but are all pancake. The flavor is not too sweet with just a hint of fresh lemon. I could eat them everyday.

The decor is kind of Mid-Century Modern which creates a cozy feel. The restaurants are spacious and comfortable. There&apos;s a little wood, leather and wicker.

Service is always efficient and professional. I&apos;ve dined at more than one location several times and can always count on great service."
5,"That is absolutely perfect place to have breakfast! I was here some time back and that time dine-in was allowed, don&apos; know if they changed this policy or not. Inside I could feel great vibes of light music and its coziness. They do keep a distance between tables."
4,"Took out the time to try out a brunch spot outside of the city, and this was a great option! They had wonderful outdoor seating with appropriate heating and tents. I tried the Pepper &amp; Egg White Sandwich, which was delicious! It was a healthy and nutritious option. I also tried the Iced Pumpkin Matcha Latte! This normally would have sounded like an odd combination, but being of my two favorite flavors, I wanted to give it a shot! Lo and behold, the latte was delicious! I would definitely recommend trying it out when it is on their seasonal menu!"
3,"Went to Beatrix for the first time this weekend and I&apos;m gonna have to give an average rating here. The server was nice and pretty attentive. Our food arrived in a reasonable amount of time and the prices were fair. Due to COVID, they have a very limited menu, even more so than what is on their website.

I ordered the egg white omelette and the pancakes to share. The omelette was good... but I could&apos;ve made a better one at home. I did appreciate the options for a lower cal option to include egg whites and turkey bacon for the price though. I was disappointed that there was only bread as a side option. No potatoes or choice to upgrade like you typically see for breakfast.

The pancakes were alright. My husband loved them so it could vary on your opinion. I am a bit of a pancake snob so I will say I&apos;ve been disappointed in every pancake that&apos;s been hyped up in Chicago except at Wildberry and Buttermilk (Naperville). 

Overall, I tried the things I would want to so I wouldn&apos;t need to come back here for breakfast. My husband had the burger and he wasn&apos;t impressed with that either. Maybe I&apos;ll try some of the baked goods but otherwise it wasn&apos;t good enough to come back with all the other options in Chicago."
4,"5 stars for the coffee creations, which are some of our favorites in town. My favorite is the iced banana Joe, and my wife is obsessed with the Mexican iced coffee.
3 stars for the food, which is mediocre at best, especially given that you have exceptional options in the neighborhood..."
4,"Love this place! Great for any meal, any time of the day (my favorite here is brunch though). Menu is a bit limited with very good, basic options to more unique dishes. Because of this and since the menu does not change frequently, I would rate it 4/5 as opposed to 5/5 stars. One of my more &quot;basic&quot; favorites is the mushroom and quinoa burger and a more unique one that I love is the light &amp; fluffy lemon pancakes. They&apos;re baked goods/pastries are also delicious (LOVE their chocolate stuffed Nutella cookie) and so are their drinks! My favorite is the turmeric chai latte- very spicy, unique, and tasty!"
3,"I had take-out brunch from Beatrix one morning where I ordered the spicy chicken tinga and the tuna crudo. The main thing is that the foods were not as flavorful as the menu description made them to be, and the dishes seemed overpriced for the amount of food I got. Otherwise, the chicken and the tuna were pretty good."
5,"An unprecedentedly lovely breakfast in downtown Chicago. My partner and I spontaneously decided to check out a new spot in honor of such a sunny day, and what a good decision that turned out to be! To begin, the interior of this restaurant/cafe is just casually elegant in a non-pretentious way, and that extended to the staff we interacted with. The host was kind and gave us the table we preferred by the window (sun shine!) and then we met Daniel, the sweetest and most helpful individual! A recent rescue dog adopter, a sure way to make a friend in me. We love genuine suggestions from staff and Daniel exceeded our expectations in this regard and all others. From helping us pick our juice and (my) coffee to exchanging stories about our dogs, he was just wonderful. Our food was thoroughly satisfying paired with our drinks and the ambience of the entire establishment made for a delightful late morning breakfast. Regrettably, in a moment of enthusiasm, I spilled my juice and made a bit of a mess... Daniel brought me a juice to take home (as we were wrapping up) and during my meal had noticed that I was running low on the (green tomato , I think?) salsa that came with my sandwich and took it upon himself to bring me another one! We were so pleased with everything and having such a friendly and amicable server made our morning. Thank you for a lovely experience! We will most certainly be back."
2,"After reading all the rave reviews about this place we decided to try it. In town for a spay/neuter clinic and had time for brunch. We around 10am and told there would be a 40 minute wait. No problem we had time. After seeing numerous parties seated before us (at about the 30 minute mark), I went up to the hostess station to inquire about seating. I was told rather rudely that she told me 40 minutes and that I still have 10 minutes. At exactly the 40 minute mark I received a text that our table was ready. We walked up and the server was looking for someone else. The hostess told me rather rudely, yet again that she would call me and to stand aside and wait. After about another 10 minutes my friend went up to the hostess stand to be told yet again rudely that she had already told me to wait. So, about an hour after we got there we were finally seated. 
Have to admit, there was nothing special about the food. Mediocre at best. The only thing I enjoyed was the maple brown sugar bacon. 
Not worth the effort or the trip. Won&apos;t be back."
5,One of my fave brunch spots in town! Always bustling but with friendly and efficient staff. The lemon pancakes sealed the deal for me and the rest of the menu looked delicious.
4,"we decided to meet for a girlsnight out, were happy that they take reservations! We were comfortably seated for a large group of 10, the drinks on the menu looked rather healthy but were very good! I enjoyed everything we ordered the Burrata (beets),kale salad, Cauliflower was ok, Blackbean patties were good, Hummus was ok. For main course, the rigatoni was mediocre, mushroom risotto was excellent, The swordfish kebab was the best!!
Dont miss out the Tall Dark &amp; handsome dessert just wish it were taller, Lol and the &apos;oh my caramel pie&apos; was to die for....i would skip the coconut cake next time. Service was tad bit slow on a not so busy day. Will be back with the family."
5,"Okay hands down, my favorite brunch I&apos;ve ever had in Chicago! We made a reservation since it was 5 of us, we&apos;re seated quickly and it was super clean inside. I ordered an iced mocha and the pepper egg white sandwich who was ABSOLUTELY delicious! This is a must order!! Highly recommend this place for brunch"
