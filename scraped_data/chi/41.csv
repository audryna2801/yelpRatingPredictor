5,"Such a wonderful time in a place that seems like a little bit of &apos;nature heaven&apos; in the middle of chaos. 

This place is like the quiet in the middle of a storm. A hidden gem in the busy City Of Chicago. 

Loved being able to take a break from the hustle and bustle of everyday Chicago life. For a mere donation, you&apos;re able to see beautiful rare flowers and other green growing things; all with very interesting names. 

On this trip the greenhouse was closed because of Covid-19, but the time it took for us to see all the sights seems like it went on for hours; I can only imagine. 

I found this place to be quite serene and enveloping. I found myself getting lost in the sights and often times pictured myself having an outdoor gathering in this lovely space. Apparently, this is also what the locals do. And the folks that live across the street, oh my, how lovely. 

I plan to return and visit when the greenhouse is open for tours. I saw a cactus and a few other trees that are almost scraping the A-frame of the greenhouse."
5,"A gem on the west side!  Amazing place to wander around, especially if you need to escape the winter.  Pre pandemic they had wonderful classical &amp; world music shows.  I hope this returns again when it is safer to do so.  Currently you have to make reservations (free!) but am looking forward to going again next week for my birthday."
5,"Completely gorgeous place. Before Covid the greenhouse was just amazing to go inside. It smelled so good and so many gorgeous plants to look at.
It is a real gem in Chicago."
5,"Here you just want to breathe deeply, take a walk, participate in lectures and master classes as well as admire the works of art at exhibitions that often take place here. At the entrance you will be greeted by a lush palm garden, pleasing the eye with the brightest shades of green. The snow house filled with exotic flowers and decorated with colorful stained glass windows invites you to visit the gallery of nature itself. The Garfield Park Conservatory gives a lot of positive ompressions and a lot of pleasure from the opportunity to return to nature and contemplate something beautiful and perfect. This is a great place to get out of the house on a rainy day."
5,"A true retreat in Chicago!
Beautifully presented greenery and spacious grounds are perfect for a local afternoon at this historic venue any time of year!"
5,"I loved visiting the Garfield Conservatory. It&apos;s called &quot;Chicago&apos;s Landscape Art Under Glass.&quot; There are eight indoor rooms that showcase thousands of plants. Outside offers ten acres of outdoor gardens, play areas for children and lots more. I could not pick a favorite room Inside of the conservatory because each of the eight rooms bring something beautiful and insightful. 

The Conservatory offers many programs and events for the public. It&apos;s also a venue for weddings, family gatherings and meetings. You can rent by the room or the entire building. You can spend as much time as you like on the property. At the entrance a donation is requested and appreciated."
3,Outdoor gardens are open ONLY. Masks required and small donations suggested. Staff via social media is not the best BUT in person they are lovely. Parking available in visitors lot. The waterfall is beautiful.
5,"Glory. 

I&apos;ve been coming here since I was a kid - at least fifty years now. It&apos;s still wonderful. In fact, it might be better than it&apos;s every been. One of my favorite things to do in Chicago - one of my favorite things to do in ANY city. Just a world class conservatory.

Nice people, too - thanks to Lacey for the kindness she showed to us in letting us look at her personal video of the Christmas decorations that had just come down before our visit this time. 

Go. Look at my photos and realize that they don&apos;t convey even a fraction of the awesome beauty here, they don&apos;t convey the wonderful fragrances or the warm humid calm. Go - you&apos;ll not regret it."
5,So beautiful! We visited their outside gardens and the Monet exhibit. The flowers were beautiful and the water fountains were relaxing! We weren&apos;t able to stay for too long since it was raining. We will definitely be back!
4,"Experience: Garfield Park Conservatory is located in the West Side of Chicago. It is free for entrance, but they do accept donations. Conservatory is huge and you can definitely spend an hour or two exploring exhibits. 

Parking: There is a parking lot located right next to Garfield Park Conservatory. This makes it very convenient when visiting. Note: When we visited it was during the week. I am not sure how difficult parking would be during the weekend. So take that into consideration.  

Worth: It is definitely worth the visit. Just note, be aware of where the conservatory is located. It has a history of being &quot;dangerous&quot;, but when we visited it did not seem like it at all. Just like anywhere, be aware of surroundings and you will have a great time!"
5,"Being back in Chicago, I feel the need to explore more. Somehow, this place came up and I realized I live less than 3 miles away - so, of course, I&apos;m going to check it out. The only thing I regret is that I did not come sooner (like how have I lived here my whole life and never stopped here?)! 

I came on New Years Eve so it may have been a little more packed than usual but still enough room to walk around. Each room has a &quot;theme&quot; and it was beautiful! I&apos;m so glad I saw the Christmas decor before it was taken out. 

Make sure to check their website! They have yoga classes and a community room to check out! You&apos;ll want to visit again!"
5,"What an amazing place!  

This wasn&apos;t originally on the agenda but with the cold and rain, it was the perfect getaway.  You honestly forget you&apos;re in the middle of a huge city &amp; that the weather is crap outside.  

There&apos;s about 6 different themed rooms: Palms, ferns, desert, sugar leaves, etc.  
It was great to walk around and take in the beautiful sights.  

Spend an hour or the whole day!  It&apos;s so relaxing.  

It is free but suggested donation of $10/adult &amp; $5/kid"
5,Have been coming here my entire life. It&apos;s a wonderful family tradition that kids and adults both enjoy. Absolutely stunning and full of rich history. The spring show is not to be missed. The fern room is my personal favorite because of the waterfall and animals.
5,"I used to frequent this place a lot and was always nice to just walk around, relax and take in the foliage it is also a good place for macro photography with a surprisingly large assortment of different plants. It isn&apos;t on the level of Botanical Gardens or anything, but the location is more favorable for me. They have a suggested donation of $5, but it is free all the same of you forego it."
5,"Took a trip here today and it was a perfect day. Booked a time at 2pm for $5 and got to spend the afternoon walking through the beautiful horticulture. The insides are still not open due to Covid restrictions and masks are required. They had a Monet exhibit which was gorgeous, a community garden, and tons of flowers and trees that I have never seen before. They also labeled each plant so you had the information about them. There is also a labyrinth that is great for meditation! The bathrooms are currently not open to the public so make sure you and your little ones use the restroom before you arrive. However the gold dome does have some open about a block away. There is free parking as well and the green line has a stop at the entrance as well! There is a portapotty near the parking lot, however I do not recommended using that! All and all it&apos;s a great hidden gem in the city!"
5,"This place is a real city gem and an oasis in the Big City.  During our ongoing pandemic, visitors are limited to walking the outdoor gardens and floraled grounds, but that was just fine with us and a delightful way to get our fitness steps in for the day in peaceful, tranquil, and beautiful surroundings.  Admission is free and they operate off a suggested and appreciated donation basis.  You do currently need to register online for a visiting time slot good for a 90 minute window.  There was hardly anyone else around during our Wednesday afternoon visit, so it&apos;s just a formality but they are busy on the weekends I was told.  We will surely return again someday to see what we can inside the conservatory as well.  Being a native Chicagoan, I&apos;m not sure why I never heard of this place until only recently (and it was actually on Yelp that I got wind of it), but the time was right for us to just do some limited city exploring.  I enjoyed being in an older and largely forgotten part of the city, and seeing the historic buildings, like the beautiful and elegant Garfield Park Fieldhouse, the beautiful and historically restored Central Park station on CTA&apos;s very nearby Green Line, and some of the nice looking 2- and 3-flats surrounding the park.  However, the surrounding neighborhood is not a place you want to hang around, and it reminded me of the same gritty ghetto neighborhoods seen in Hoop Dreams, if you ever saw that award winning Chicago-based documentary.  Visiting the conservatory is normal and fine during the daytime though as they have their own nearby fenced and free parking lot on the south end and with a very short walk to their entrance.  Overall, another delightful Chicago gem that just took me a little while to get to!"
5,"Love this Garfield Park conservatory. It&apos;s always easy to get into and a great place to visit (especially during the winter months).

Easily accesible from the green line."
5,"Added more photos to Garfield Park Conservatory. Next to the Art Institute of Chicago this is my most favorite place to visit , especially on a first date. This place is truly beautiful , a garden paradise in the middle of Chicago on the West Side of the city. 

There are inside and outside gardens with ponds , resting areas and picnic areas.  It&apos;s possible to spend an entire afternoon here. Bring your music on your smart phone , bring a book , sit a while and smell the roses.  Take photos , talk to strangers , take your lunch , enjoy this garden in a city. It is a magical place to visit and explore. 

This place used to be empty due to it&apos;s location on Chicago&apos;s notorious west side. But with the addition of inside security and a guard in the parking lot the place has become more secure and hospitable.  Public Transportation ( commuter train - green line ) stops right there at the Conservatory.  Now the word is out and the place often draws a crowd. 
Weddings are staged here on occasion and wedding parties sometimes just stop by for a photo shoot after the ceremony and prior to the reception.  

I&apos;ve already posted a review of this place but noticed my review was devoid of photos.  Ergo , I&apos;m posting some photos taken of the Christmas Show in years past and some summer time photos from a few years ago. 
I love this place. I hope the photos do it justice. But if in Chicago come on down and see this place for yourself. It&apos;s one of the last FREE venues in Chicago and includes FREE parking.  This place is truly a City in a Garden. 
Urbs in Horto ... Official Motto of Chicago.  Latin for City in a Garden."
4,"I&apos;ve taken a date and I&apos;ve walked the Conservatory with my goddaughter. .. I&apos;ve even gone for work events. This is a beautiful place and worth checking out. Don&apos;t plan to spend a full day unless you plan to enjoy a book while sitting in the outdoor garden. Otherwise, I&apos;d say it&apos;s about 60 minutes to casually walk through the entire place. It&apos;s FREE, but please support with a donation or buying overpriced items in the gift shop :-D"
5,"I lOVE this place! 

Where do you go when it&apos;s raining out and you want to spend the day in nature? Here!!!!

Free admission (donations recommended)

Open from 9-5; year round 

The air quality in this place is fantastic! 

Benches sporadically placed for relaxation. 

There is free parking on site. 


There is a jungle room, a desert room, a fern room and then some... all under a glass canopy. 

If I were a millionaire I would have a replica of this attached to my home so I could sit and wander for hours. I would just add a hammock and some music. 

I will be bringing anyone that visits Chicago for the first time here. It&apos;s my new fave place and I can&apos;t wait to return in the winter."
