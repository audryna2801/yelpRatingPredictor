5,"Is it bad or wrong that you pick the hotel you&apos;re going to stay in based on proximity to Do Rite Donuts and Chicken? 

From my January 14, 2019 visit. That&apos;s exactly what I did for this trip to Chicago. The last time I came here (April 2018) I had these fabulous donuts from Do Rite but didn&apos;t have a chance to try the chicken on a doughnut sandwich. 

This time I specifically booked the Hyatt Centric so I could walk next-door to get a chicken on a vanilla Bean glaze donut sandwich. Yeah, and that&apos;s why I have some cushion on my hips and thighs.

It was worth paying more to stay at the Hyatt Centric hotel cost and walking in chilly Chicago to get this tender chicken sensation. 

Not many people would pay six dollars for a chicken on a doughnut or maybe they would and that&apos;s why Do Rite donut chicken sandwich is such a success. 

I doubt that you would find any other chicken sandwich in the city of Chicago for less than $6. And you&apos;re doing yourself a disservice if you did not try this at least once.  Maybe twice.

Okay in all honesty, call it a dozen times. 

Is the chicken sandwich Michelin star quality? No but it&apos;s damn good and tasty. And that&apos;s really all a sandwich needs to be. Plus it doesn&apos;t rob your pocketbook because it&apos;s a $6 sandwich.

You get a nice hearty lunch, a little protein, and sugar and you&apos;re on your way. Probably one of the best lunch values anywhere in the city. 

They give you a bazillion napkins for a reason. Don&apos;t even try to pick up the donut or chicken donut sandwich with your fingers unless you plan on getting sticky and have wet wipes handy. 

Live dangerously. Eat it from the rapper. Kick it up a notch and walk across the street to the Walgreens to get a little hooch put in a brown paper bag and stand on the sidewalk eating your chicken donut sandwich drinking from a brown paper bag. It&apos;s an experience you&apos;ll never forget. 

The only downfall to eating your chicken donut sandwich in the wrapper, you lose some of that glaze deliciousness because it soaks into that rapper. Be a heathen like me and just lick it off..."

*In my yelpions: if you are looking for healthy eat, this wouldn&apos;t be the place to go, matter of fact, just turn around and don&apos;t make eye contact. But, if you are looking for a place to indulge yourself, you found yourself a heaven spot . What I love about Do-rite is their original chicken sandwich; the salty sweet flavor was perfectly balanced, with the first bite, you can tasted the fluffy sweetnesses with the crunch layer of fried chicken, not to mention a layer of Mayo with lettuce in between to create the perfect harmony. Just imaging McChicken has a twins sibling. (Not to mention , you could always increase the spicy level of the sandwich). 

Before their original chicken sandwich, my go to is their maple bacon doughnut. Maybe that why i love the chicken sandwich so much was originally from their salty sweet layer. I am not crazy about pork bacon(i know, don&apos;t judge), but something about their bacon reminds me of bacon candy, which is sweet and hard like jerky. Plus the strong tasted of maple which reminds me of Canada. Everything are just perfect. 

Last, the pistachio donut are one of their well known and popular item, the fragrance of the roast pistachio are super tasty."
5,"Love this place!! This joint has taught me there is no better combo than fried chicken and donuts. And they do both really well!

Their fried chicken sandwich is only $6 and truly worth the price. They&apos;re always served fast and fresh. From the soft brioche bun to the crispy fried chicken this sandwich is sooo good for a quick lunch! I&apos;m a wimp with spicy things, but their spicy fried chicken sandwich is so good too! 

I unfortunately don&apos;t have any pics of their donuts but I can guarantee they are also amazing. The cinnamon crunch and Bavarian chocolate frosted donuts are so good! Really worth the price! 

It&apos;s right on Northwestern Medicines campus so you&apos;ll always see a massive rush of people in scrubs running in to grab donuts or sandwiches, but the service is quick   And they currently have outdoor seating!"
5,"What an amazing experience. I found this spot on YELP! It was close to my weekend accommodations. Literally, a 3 min walk. I&apos;m so glad I did. This is what YELP was meant to do, connect people with places!  
This location is directly across from the ER of a local hospital and you can tell it is a favorite of the hospital personnel. They came in with a steadiness of those assured of what a quality product is. They knew the menu and they were patient. 
The sweet spot, pun intended, serves chicken, fries, and donuts for all hours of operation. My sons and I opted for chicken tenders and fresh donuts. The chicken was made fresh to order. We each had 3 strips and a variety of donuts. They chicken was moist, full of flavor, tender and juicy. The donuts were nothing short of amazing. The freshest donut I&apos;ve ever had, due in large part to them being made daily, throughout the day, on premise. The cost was comparable to any place else and the service was pleasant.  I&apos;ll visit again and I hope you do too!!"
2,"Do-Rite usually provides excellent service--reliably delicious donuts. Especially their cake donuts are on point. 

I am incredibly grateful for their gluten free donuts--they have given me a glorious escape, whenever I need a treat to calm my nerves and take me to a far away place.

Unfortunately, their standards seem loose today. I saw the donuts on display looking significantly darker than usual, so I commented to the team member behind the bar about the color... noting my unease. They simply told me that the donuts were &quot;just fried a bit longer,&quot; as if there is no issue.

So in good faith I purchased the experience.

The donut was a gross disappointment, tasting on the border of too much oil and burnt. A very uncomfortable balance. 

If the donuts are burnt, please just don&apos;t sell them. I know gluten free is not as flexible as other donuts--and that may have been the rest of today&apos;s supply, but better to not serve than to lower your standards.

I know DoRite is better than this, but until next time (a month, perhaps) that I get the standard experience, these stars will remain."

Came here to grab an afternoon snack since the reviews looked pretty solid, and my hotel was right nxet door.

Maple bacon donut, 4
Okay. Thought it was a bit overrated since it&apos;s the most popular item on Yelp, but didn&apos;t think it was that great. Only had a couple bites.

Original chicken sammich, 5
Pretty good. Simple, solid fried chicken sandwich especially for the price. Liked the sandwich a lot more than the maple bacon donut.

Service was nice and friendly. No line, so the sandwich only took a couple minutes before it was ready."
5,"Convenient location if you&apos;re in the hospital area. The service and serving are relatively quick, even if there&apos;s a line. I&apos;ve been here numerous times and they always get my order right. No item has been a miss. Service and pricing are on point. 

I recommend the breakfast sandwiches because they have such buttery fluffy eggs. Any combination is delicious.

My favorite donuts are the old fashion, chocolate old fashion, and vanilla bean. 

The fries and coffee are also great!"
4,"I&apos;ve come here a few times now, and everything is great! My boyfriend likes the breakfast sandwiches, which I have had and taste really good. The bread, egg, bacon ratio is perfect and not super messy. I usually opt for a donut. All are great, and they aren&apos;t too expensive. They also have cool old brew flavors. The inside is a bit small with limited seating, even pre-covid, so there is outdoor seating as well."
5,"These are my all-time favorite donuts in the city. They&apos;ve got something for everyone.

If I&apos;m feeling something ultra rich and decadent I go for the cheese danish donut.

If I want something with a little more of a fresh/fruity vibe I go for the lemon pistachio or the orange olive oil (vegan if that&apos;s what you&apos;re looking for)."
5,"This lovely spot has a beautiful selection of donuts for everyone - if you&apos;re a donut person or cakey person, or if you prefer two pieces of bacon on your maple glazed. 

Also has the best fried chicken sandwiches and breakfast sandwiches in the neighborhood that would kill any hangover."
5,"This place combines two of my all-time favorite things, fried chicken + doughnuts, and it does both so well. I think this might just one of my favorite chicken sandwiches  (and it&apos;s definitely less expensive than most of the others I&apos;ve had). Coming in at about $6.50, the original spicy chicken sandwich is a must-try from here (it not too spicy). I would also highly suggest the old-fashioned buttermilk doughnut and the birthday cake doughnut. In my opinion, the chocolate old-fashioned was just meh, as was the candied maple bacon. 

I ordered pick-up by visiting their website and ordering straight from there. You can order individual doughnuts (even gluten-free ones), a box of doughnuts, and an array of sandwiches and sides. You can even get the sandwiches with a doughnut bun (for $1 extra)!! 

After placing my order, I got a phone call from there a few minutes later letting me know a few of the things I selected were no longer available and I could either substitute them for something else they did have, or get a refund. I was really bummed that they didn&apos;t have any more doughnut buns, but the regular buns are super tasty too. I would say that if there&apos;s something from here you really want, you should order/go sooner rather than later because when I went around 6pm they were sold out of a quite a few things. They do update the website frequently to reflect what has been sold out, but they may not have time to do it before you order. My refund for the few items they didn&apos;t have was processed about an hour after I placed the order and I got an email notification about it. 

I can already tell that this will be one of my go-to spots in the city, so I hope you will go check-it out!"
4,"I&apos;m not as big of a fan of the huge expensive doughnut fad as other people are but for those who love that kind of thing they will be in heaven at Do-Rite. 

When I went in around midday there was no wait and the selection was still pretty good. Everything did feel cramped ordering mid pandemic around at least a few other people and the staff wasn&apos;t doing much about it but I guess if the place got more crowded they would have spoken up.

They tacked on an extra fee for covid related costs, which struck me initially as odd, but what I really liked was when I asked the staff what that was they explained it and asked if I wanted it removed. I thought asking was a really nice touch, so I kept it on.

The doughnuts themselves were pretty good, especially the sprinkled one. The ones with heavier cream frosting didn&apos;t survive as well in the commute but they still tasted good for the most part."
5,Bestdonuts in Chicago hands down. The old fashioned donut. Love this place. Stans is great too.
5,"Where do I start?! Do-Rite is one of my favorite quick breakfast stops for so many reasons. 1. The coffee. I always get the cold brew and it never disappoints. It&apos;s very strong but also smooth and creamy. Perfect combination! If you are sensitive to caffeine, this is probably not the cup of coffee for you. 2. The donuts. My favorites are the Valrhona chocolate and the old fashioned. The Valrhona is a glazed vanilla cake donut topped with a thick rich chocolate frosting, very indulgent and filling. The old fashioned is simple but very fresh and flavorful.. hard not to like. 3. Last but not least, the chicken sandwich. AMAZING! You would not think a donut shop would have such an incredible chicken sandwich, but they do. So underrated! The chicken is crispy and juicy, their garlic aioli is one of the best I&apos;ve had, and they top it off with a buttery soft brioche bun. Highly recommend!"
5,"Hands down my favorite donuts in Chicago. Also have AMAZING sandwiches. The original chicken sandwich and bacon (breakfast) sandwich are to die for, along with the fries. 

The donuts don&apos;t taste as &quot;cake-y&quot; as other places in the city. They&apos;re so fresh and have been perfected. The original donuts like Apple fritters are incredible. Plus the chefs are always making some new flavors which I enjoy."
4,"It&apos;s time I update my review for Do-Rite. I&apos;m bumping up my rating to 4 stars. I still think the Doughnut Vault is better, but I prefer Do-Rite to Firecakes and Stan&apos;s. 

Their chicken tenders are pretty good, but the portion is small and they&apos;re pricey. ..same can be said about the Chicken Sandwich. As others have mentioned, if you&apos;re looking for a super spicy option this probably won&apos;t do the trick.

Overall an above average doughnut with the added plus of offering solid lunch options. Service has improved quite a bit too. 3.666 stars rounds up to 4."
5,"Do-Rite did right by me!

Happened to pass by Do-Rite after a doctor&apos;s appointment. I&apos;ve always known about Do-Rite, but today we had the chance to really get acquainted. I&apos;d be willing to drive into the city for this place. 

First of all, the vibe was fantastic. I felt like I was in New York. The location is small and crowded with counter seating inside and tables outside. It was fun to sit at the counter and watch the action happening outside. 

On to the donuts. Blueberry crumb cake donut. Wow! I totally chose this donut at random. I wanted to go with the bacon donut, but the crumb stood proud and pretty on the shelf and called out to me. After one bite, I knew I made the right choice. Moist and fresh, packed with blueberry in each bite, the crumb topping had just the right amount of crunch to balance out the softness of the donut. Definitely not the right donut to eat in the car. It was everywhere! Reminded me of a messy muffin. 

Also ordered up a coffee (discount when you order a donut). They serve Dark Matter, and then off to the side you fix it up the way you like it. What&apos;s to say? It&apos;s Dark Matter :-)

Also ordered up a chix sandwich. It called out to me from the neon orange sign in the window. Donuts and chix sandwich (that can also be served on a donut), the perfect combination. My fried chicken sandwich was fresh and incredibly hearty and filling. Plump and lightly fried with a batter that stayed on with every bite. Next time I&apos;m planning to order the sandwich with bbq and slaw on it. Or...they actually just added a pork tenderloin to their menu. I have to say, the pork tenderloin is making a come back! 

Excellent value. Totally worth every penny. Two donuts, coffee, and a sandwich for $16+. Not bad!"
5,"A Chicago staple and must try if you are not a native! They have donuts and fried chicken sandwiches, what more does a girl need? Prepare to wait a few minutes since there will be a line if the store isn&apos;t already crowded but honestly, do stop in for a coffee and a treat. My husband and I got a donut and fried chicken sandwiches as out last stop in Chicago and it was definitely great! They have some outdoor seating tables setup during Covid and this location is in downtown. I would&apos;t recommend driving here but if you&apos;re already in the area, definitely stop in."
4,"This was my first time having do-rite donuts and they certainly hit their mark. I saw a sign on a garbage can for do-rite and i was a bit uneasy about venturing to a donut spot advertised on a trash can but my stomach pulled me in.

So i heard theres a couple different locations but this specific location is a bit tucked under a building with some hard signage. Alas all was well once i went up some stairs and into an old style entrance and into donut heaven. The line was out the door which is always a good sign, but it was moving fast. The staff was getting the orders in and out with superb efficiency. Their menu was pretty wide for a donut/chicken spot but i had my eye on the prize of the birthday cake donut. Within minutes i was in and out and on the move with my windy city treat. Pricing was just like ANY other donut spot, im not sure why people expect pricing to be like dunkin, if you want a cheap donut go to dunkin, if you want a GOOD donut go to do-rite. they dont lie.

Anywho, my donut was everything i needed it to be. It was fluffy and sweet, the icing was plenty. Sprinkles are life as you know, and it was HUGE. I didnt get any chicken while i was there it was really early in the morning and my stomach couldnt handle that two punch, but based off the smell alone i would say the chicken was good lol.

They have a good staff, good order process, little wait time and good atmosphere.

If you&apos;re in the hunt for an early morning donut this is the place. Tell them sasha sent you :)"
5,"Gluten-free donuts!! And 3 kinds!?! Wow!! I went here on the advice of a friend who is helping me learn how to live gluten-free. I was thrilled to try 2 flavors of gluten-free donuts, a cinnamon and a vanilla sprinkle, and loved them both! I also picked up 2 chicken sandwiches and 3 more donuts for my kids at home- for a really reasonable price, too. The place is spotless and the staff is helpful and friendly. This was my first visit and they got me everything I needed. Quickly, too!! 

Derrick at the counter is a fantastic Do-Rite employee! While I was sitting at the counter enjoying a Diet Coke &amp; sprinkle donut, a really horrible lady came in complaining about everything in site. I guess she&apos;d called ahead to order, but hung up on poor Derrick! Even so, he had her order in process when she arrived, and was super polite and helpful, but she was rotten to him. Why do people feel they can treat others like that?! She was a dreadful lady. Shout out to Derrick for getting through it. He should get a raise. 

I will definitely come back. This shop is very convenient to Northwestern Hospital. Just off St. Clair and Erie."
