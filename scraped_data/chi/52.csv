5,"My most favorite staple of Chicago. The gorgeous Bean.
Before Covid it freaking SUCKED coming here. TOOOOO many people in the summer and it was the same during the winter. 
It sucked trying to get a picture and all the hand prints everywhere. 
Ugh 
Anywho I think Covid has fixed this problem. Sad but true.
You can finally enjoy it in peace and less people.
And actually get a good photo."
5,"Upon entering the park, there&apos;s someone in the front to ensure that everyone is wearing a face mask. As of right now, they have put metal fences up to limit people from being all up on the bean due to COVID-19.

Even so, you would think it takes away from the experience but I personally feel like it actually makes it better? If you&apos;ve never been and want a nice photo with the bean in the back and not be photobombed with tourists then you&apos;ll be able to get a good shot! The only downside is that you obviously won&apos;t be able to physically touch it, but I&apos;m fine with that."
5,"They have sealed the Bean area due to COVID, since this spot gets really crowded. The major park area is also sealed, but love that we could get pictures around the main Cloud attraction, without it being really overcrowded. This is a must see attraction, while visiting Chicago."
4,"The biggest tourist trap in Chicago besides going to the 103rd floor of the Sears Tower this place is perfect just because there&apos;s so much to do here with all the other things going on in the distance. There&apos;s always people here trying to take selfies, group photos and it&apos;s just crowded in general.

I see alot of people tagging, hugging and kissing the Cloud Gate, please don&apos;t do that. It&apos;s a piece of art that should be admired. There&apos;s public restrooms right below you as well. Definitely one of the most beautiful pieces of architecture though the architect himself hates that people call his work of art &quot;The Bean&quot;"
4,"Daaaa bean! All my life I thought this thing was called the bean. Turns out it has a name and it&apos;s actually an art installation haha. Pretty crazy.

My friend and I wandered around Chicago two weeks ago and decided to stop by and check it out. I&apos;ve never seen the bean before but she has. Unfortunately due to covid the bean was fenced off so we couldn&apos;t touch it or take any cool photos with it. Kinda sucky. 

Overall the bean, I mean cloud gate, was pretty cool. If you&apos;re nearby I&apos;d check it out but wouldn&apos;t go completely out of my way to see it."
5,"The Bean, or Cloud Gate (officially)
It&apos;s fun 
It&apos;s shiny 
It&apos;s large
It&apos;s a gate
It&apos;s a cloud
It&apos;s contrast 
It&apos;s abstract 
It&apos;s reflective
It&apos;s cloud gate
It&apos;s interactive
It&apos;s unexpected 
It&apos;s smile evoking
It&apos;s deeply profound 
It&apos;s thought provoking

The Bean&apos;s reflective surface was inspired by liquid mercury. This shiny exterior reflects the people moving around the park, the lights of Michigan Avenue, and the surrounding skyline and green space -- perfectly encapsulating the Millennium Park experience. The polished surface also invites visitors to touch the surface and observe their own reflection, giving it an interactive quality.

The reflection of the sky above the park, not to mention the curved underside of The Bean serves as an entrance that visitors can walk under to enter the park, inspired the sculpture&apos;s creator to name the piece Cloud Gate.

Cloud Gate was built with the Chicago skyline in mind.  &quot;What I wanted to do in Millennium Park is make something that would engage the Chicago skyline,&quot; said Kapoor, &quot;so that one will see the clouds kind of floating in, with those very tall buildings reflected in the work. And then, since it is in the form of a gate, the participant, the viewer, will be able to enter into this very deep chamber that does, in a way, the same thing to one&apos;s reflection as the exterior of the piece is doing to the reflection of the city around.&quot;

It is deeply profound and much more than ac&quot;selfie&quot; op, but we call it The Bean!

Cloud Gate it is!

5,"Cloud Gate, the bean, big silver blob, whatever you like to call it, this magnificent sculpture is a must see in Chicago. Towards the entrance of Millennium Park, it&apos;s easy to find and very hard to miss. Depending on the time of day, there will definitely be a large crowd there admiring this reflective, stainless steel, work of art. Want to miss the crowd? Come early in the morning. 

From the outside, the bean is fun to take selfies with, reflects the Chicago skyline beautifully, and is a great addition to the park. Seriously, it just adds to the fun and the cool art. From under the bean, your perspective is misconstrued as your image reflects in a variety of neat ways. It&apos;s pretty trippy, not going to lie. 

If you&apos;re planning a trip, recently moved to the Windy City and haven&apos;t visited yet, or simply a lover of cool art, add this to your Chicago bucket list."
5,"You can&apos;t come to Chicago without seeing the Bean. In person, it&apos;s gigantic but kinda cool. The reflection of the Bean is so shiny. Coming here very early in the morning will have less people otherwise, it&apos;s usually pretty crowded for most of the times. 

No admission needed. There&apos;s also a ice skating ring right beside it and plenty of park space around. Where the Bean is placed will give you a perfect reflection of the city at all hours. Of course sunny days are best. Definitely a treasure of Chicago."
5,"Also known as &quot;The Bean&quot; for that is what it looks like. Good thing they didnt model it in the form of a mushroom because then, well you would know what it might look like. Instead of Cloud Gate it may have been called Mushroom Cloud.

Designed by Indian born British artist Sir Anish Kapoor, it was inspired by the properties of liquid mercury. Construction started in 2004 and finished in 2006, this structure made up of 168 stainless steel plates welded together and highly polished so that you do not see any seams whatsoever. This structure weighs just a little over 100 tons and it cost a total of 23 million by the time it was dedicated on May 15, 2006.

A must see any time you are in Chicago for any reason, there is no other sculpture like it in the world. Located in Millenium Park, this attraction is just one of many. Open everyday from 6 am to 11 pm, admission is free but of course you have to find parking somewhere and that is not free unfortunately, but hay, any time you are in a large metropolitan city you will always have to pay for parking anywhere you are in city limits.

So take plenty of pictures and definitely bring plenty of hand sanitizer if you plan on touching it. Next thing you know we have a &quot;Bean Virus&quot; going around.

5,"You can&apos;t go to Chicago without stopping to see the infamous Cloud Gate aka &quot;The Bean&quot;. Located in Millenium Park this sculpture by Anish Kapoor showcases the beautiful Chicago skyline in its reflective shine. 

It&apos;s always crowded but if you come early you can miss the crowds. We even got the chance to check it out at night and there was only one other group and it was pretty seeing the reflection of the city at night. Overall a must in Chicago. Located right by the Art Insitiute of Chicago and Crown Fountain. You can&apos;t miss it."
5,"AKA... the bean! Taking pics at this iconic location is on every tourist&apos;s list! As a local, I still love going to it and to be honest, now that it&apos;s blocked off during covid, I love it even more! You can now get views and photos of it without all the people all around, which is great all in its own!!"
5,"Cloud Gate or The Bean has become a Chicago tourist icon. It is simple in design but the magic is its reflective quality, allowing for lovely encapsulations of the skyline or even a fun tourist photo. It&apos;s in a pretty little area that is nice to visit during all seasons. I like to see it in the winter when there is ice skating set up nearby and holiday music playing."
5,"TIP: Plan your visit early on a weekday morning - no crowds! If you have the opportunity and want some pictures at dusk with warm sunset colors in the background, then plan accordingly. 

Location: Millennium Park, Chicago, IL
Randolph St. between Michigan Ave &amp; Columbus Ave 

Also nearby (literally steps away) is Crown Fountain 

Fun Facts: 
1. Cloud Gate was designed to engage the Chicago skyline so the onlooker sees the clouds and, of course, the reflection of tall buildings. 
2. It&apos;s inspired M by liquid mercury (anyone else think of Terminator 2 when you read that?). The inside of the bean is largely made up of a wooden structure. 
3.  The entire sculpture gets a deep clean 2x a year but city workers give it a power hose and wipe down DAILY - no wonder it looks SO shiny.
4. It was created by using computer technology to cut into 168 giant stainless steel plates, which were pieced together like a puzzle then welded - who knew?! There doesn&apos;t appear to be any seams when you&apos;re up close to it."
5,"It was so beautiful to visit this Chicago gem.

I got the opportunity to see it twice, at night and during the day. I suggest you do see it like me because of its two types of beauty.

It was so nice to see snow for the first time on my trip to Chicago and see it on top of this huge and distinctive piece was awesome.

I loved to see so many people taking pictures and enjoying their stay there."
4,"Absolutely iconic and a must see when you&apos;re visiting. It&apos;s a well known area around the world and it&apos;s informally called the bean by locals. We stopped by the Cloud Gate when we were in the city for a friend&apos;s wedding.

There is a fair amount of paid parking garages and some metered parallel parking nearby as well. There are a ton of for a drink place within walking distance so enjoy the area! There are tons of people taking photos with the bean, so be patient and greet some good ones while you&apos;re there. 

Overall: A
Well worth a visit to the iconic landmark!"
5,"Let me just take you through my 5-second inner dialogue when I first went to The Bean.

First thought: &quot;Wow, this is so much bigger than I thought it would be!&quot;

Second thought: &quot;How the hell did they transport this big chrome bean and place it in the middle of Chicago?&quot;

Third thought: &quot;This big shiny, chrome bean is so cool and beautiful!&quot;

Until writing this review, I had no idea that the real name of The Bean was The Cloud Gate. You learn something new every day! 

I personally think this is an iconic must see in Chicago. It&apos;s located in Millenium Park, so once you&apos;re done taking your bean selfies, you can wander around the park and relax. This huge art installation is easy to spot from a mile or two away, so you can&apos;t miss it if you&apos;re walking or driving in the area. 

You can&apos;t leave Chicago without visiting this big, metallic, beauty."
5,"The gigantic structure bends space and causes incredible admiration. Cloud Gate also called the Bean. Incredibly, this sculpture wieighs 110 tons. Be sure to walk in the park under the bean where there are concave plates and even better is to repeat this action during the day and in the dark evening to get a completely different feeling."
5,"Some things about Chicago just never get old, (ie Cubs game, river cruises, deep dish) and one of those for me is the Bean! Whether I&apos;m cruising by on my morning run or out catching Pokemon in Millennium Park I always take a second to stop and admire the beautiful shiny blob formally known as the Cloud Gate! 

It&apos;s a Chicago landmark and one of the most recognizable things about our amazing city. In my eight years of living here, everytime a friend visits, the Bean is always on our list of must sees - no matter the season. While there isn&apos;t much to necessarily &quot;do&quot; at the Bean, it makes for some great photo opts and allows for a beautiful view of the city through its reflective curves and folds. It&apos;s also just a super cool piece of art! If you&apos;re visiting or you live here, make some time to check out the Bean - whether you&apos;ve been before or not! It&apos;s beautiful and humbling to be in its presence. (Although not right now bc it&apos;s closed due to COVID)"
5,"Perhaps one of the most iconic architecture of Chicago downtown.
Since we live within twenty minutes walk from this place we sometimes come here while our morning walk.
Always beautiful shape."
5,"This spot is such a good picture location and a place we are sure to hit up every time we are in Chicago. It just never gets old! The last time we went was during COVID season, and they had it all blocked off, so it was a cool picture opportunity and very rare with no people around. Going into the park you do have to wear a mask and are supposed to keep it on, although we did take it off briefly for this picture."
