5,"I love this Chicago landmark and today on a beautiful Chicago late November evening it was a pleasure to walk over and take some pics of the Christmas tree. Small crowds due to COVID19, thank god! Felt really happy seeing the beautifully lit tree and the Bean in its glory."
5,"I feel like that these are one of those places that should have no less than 5 stars across the board. If you are one of those people that rate this place less than 5, then you better check your ego for it is definitely clouding your judgement. You don&apos;t need the Cloud Gate for that. 

Millenium Park is what Central Park is to New York. Unfortunately (if that) the 2 times I was here for work was during winter. Nevertheless, checking out Cloud Gate aka &quot;The Bean&quot; and Crown Fountain are always a treat. Heck, just walking around the park with the downtown skyline in the background is a beautiful sight. Perfect for dogs and your significant other.  My first time here was with my lovely wife. Unfortunately, the second time I was by myself because she divorced me. Sad face. Such fond memories. 

For those that have any kind of legit complaint, yes, you have to pay for parking but that cant be avoided. How do you think they take care of the park and keep it in such good shape? 

In closing, what I mentioned is only the tip of the ice berg for that is only probably about 20 percent of whole park. I promise the next time I come back whether its for work or pleasure I will explore the rest of the park. Here&apos;s to hoping I have a significant other to enjoy it with.

5,"What a beautiful park, first time visiting it. It was nice walking around and looking around at the buildings with a a lit up tree - the cold lol. Next time I want to see it in the day time but would def come back and bring back family! :)"
5,"Millennium park is visually stunning and unique park located in downtown Chicago at the tail end of the magnificent mile. 

Being a tourists from Louisville we try and visit Chicago about every two years and millennium park is truly one of the coolest things to see in downtown Chicago. Most people will recognize it from the famous shiny silver bean. And that is a cool photo op. However there is other cool things to see when visiting the park. 

It is a very short walk off the path of all the shopping on Michigan ave. Absolutely worth the trek and visit. My kids love running around and taking in the sites. It&apos;s one of there favorite things to do in Chicago."
5,"I can&apos;t believe I&apos;ve been here countless of times and have never left a review. Like many others have said, this park is fantastic. While many people come here to take a picture of their famous bean, there are other areas of the park that has some great sights to see as well. 

Park is really close to the train station, great for photos and to walk around. Prettiest time of the year is absolutely when the white stuff comes down."
5,"What should a park be?

Traditionally, a park is a place where nature is preserved and highlighted, and that is a laudable conception of a park - but maybe not a big enough conception, dimensionally, sensuously, artistically, medianly, and spiritually.

Perhaps a park should be more!

Perhaps a park should be conceived and created to be interactive, a place where human beings, human souls, nature, architecture, and art intersect and interact - and where the human soul will be stirred.

Millennium Park is such a park.

It is dynamic, interactive, magical, transforming, and penetrating and it has a voice, a voice that speaks to the heart, the soul, and the mind - penetrating what pride, passion, intelligence and habit erect on all sides - the seeming realities of this world. 

But you must allow it to speak to you from a place of emotional and intellectual vulnerability, and many can&apos;t do that because they are unable or unwilling to be vulnerable, even for a moment.

&quot;Vulnerability is the birthplace of love, belonging, joy, courage, empathy, and creativity. It is the source of hope, empathy, accountability, and authenticity. If we want greater clarity in our purpose or deeper and more meaningful spiritual lives, vulnerability is the path.&quot;
~Bren√© Brown, Daring Greatly

Ah, to be vulnerable in such a place is potentially one of the beautiful moments of human being life."
5,This is a must see when you were in Chicago. Is one of the coolest nicest prettiest sites that we have seen has so much to offer it has beautiful scenery landscapes buildings things to do everything this place has it all definitely have to go when you were in Chicago made my family had a great great time we will be back to visit and do it again
5,"From live concerts and movies in the park, to strolls with old friends, Star Wars flash mobs, random fuzzy gatherings, and everything in between, this park has seen it all. It was one of the first places I visited after moving to the Windy City in 2015 and it was one of the last places I went before I moved to Ohio. And of course I always stop by whenever I visit. It&apos;s easy to find, walkable, filled with fun interactive art, and the skyline behind it is the perfect backdrop. 

During normal times this park is generally very busy, filled with lots of tourists, children running amok, etc. I would usually try to visit earlier in the morning and I always avoided the weekends. I&apos;m sure it&apos;s looking a little different in 2020, but special nonetheless. 

Go on, take a stroll, enjoy a picnic, and/or take a bunch of selfies (no shame). Now is the time to enjoy our outdoor spaces and mother nature and this park is definitely one of the best in the Midwest."
3,"Beautiful park, seasonal landscaping, The Bean and much more... A tourist destination for sure here, a short walk from the Chicago River Walk and all majors r hotels on Magnificent Mile.

I used to come here a lot more when I got visiting out of town guests. On this visit with my hubby, we were shocked to get turn away with our small dog. 

They fenced up with security and all now!"
5,"Couldn&apos;t convince the MKE Yelper to join me at Millennium Park, oh well (2/19/20). Just glad he humored this tourist. A first visit to Chi-town just isn&apos;t complete without the ubiquitous *Bean*?!

Large park vistas where all paths led to The Bean!
I marveled at it. Don&apos;t let that blue sky fool you. It was hella windy and effing cold. I literally had a chapped face later feeling the discomfort at the airport.

Totally worth the stop for this first time visitor to Chicago. Bright, sparkly, shiny. I want to touch it."
5,"What an absolutely incredible and breathtaking park. It&apos;s been about three years since I took my solo vaca to Chicago and I spent the weekend reminiscing and thinking about how amazing this park and series of parks were. I took my journal and made my plan to take my bean pics and write about the experience and the surroundings. First of all, this park is an amazing spot to people watch and see a bunch of excited tourists and families taking selfies. 

Millennium Park is filled with a theater, pavilion, and of course the Art Institute! I would leave an entire afternoon (or honestly...day) to roam and love up on this park. Chicago is such an amazing city and this park is really the epicenter of what makes it so special. I can&apos;t wait to find myself there on a beautiful day someday soon."
5,"Amazing spot to take numerous gorgeous photos.
If you are from out of state, you must visit."
5,"I yelp about a park about once a millennium, so, it&apos;s fitting that it be about Millennium Park in Chicago.

Since opening in 2004, its popularity has grown to become Chicago&apos;s most-visited attraction hosting 25 million visitors a year. It&apos;s clean attractions and prime location next to Michigan Avenue (just a few blocks south of the Chicago River) truly makes Millennium Park the best new park of the millennium.

Entrance to the park is free. The most photogenic spot is the crowd-pleasing Cloud Gate at AT&amp;T Plaza with its shiny shimmering stainless steel sculpture affectionately known as &quot;The Bean&quot; because of its seamless shape by artist Anish Kapoor.

Another large attraction in the 24.5-acre park is the Jay Pritzker Pavilion designed by architect Frank Gehry which hosts concerts and performances for the public. Meanwhile, in the Loop community area of the park is an interactive work of public art and video sculpture called the Crown Fountain designed by artist Jaume Plensa. Nearby it is the  alluring 2.5-acre Lurie Garden. From November to March, the Millennium Park Ice Rink is fun for all ages.

If you&apos;ve been waiting a millennium to find a reason to make a park a vacation destination, well, Millennium Park is such a haven in downtown Chicago."
5,"Large park, famous in Chicago  as the place that President Barack Obama gave his  presidential speech in 2008. The focal point of the park is &apos;The Bean&apos;,  large silver sculpture was unveiled in 2004 and is one of Chicago&apos;s iconic landmarks"
5,"I went to the millennium park twice during the day and at night. 

I liked both times because it was simply amazing to see how many people gather around these gorgeous place and how clean it was. 
This is a must go place when you visit Chicago. 

You have many benches where you can sit and relax and because we went during the winter they were also had an ice skating rink where people can rent the ice-skating shoes and play there too.  

The Christmas decoration was so beautiful with a huge Christmas tree in the middle that I fell in love with."
5,"A Real oasis where you can hide from the hustle and bustle of the city and enjoy nature and architectural beauty. The park attracts people with its unique expositions and landscape. Open to the public, the park is located in the city center on the Northwest territory of Grant Park. Millennium Park is connected to other Grant Park territories by the BP Pedestrian and Nichols Bridgeway design bridges. Because the park is located above a large underground parking lot and the Millennium railway station, it was recognized as the world&apos;s largest roof garden."
4,"This is always a great place to take some fun pictures with friends or yourself.

The beam provides a wonderful backdrop of the city skyline as well as the sky.

I went here last with a couple friends that came in from out of town. They were in from Coventry and from Scotland and of course we had to show them the beam so we could take some cool and fun pics there."
4,"5 star for Pre covid and what I know of this place. 
Two entry points in and out. 
Wear your masks. 

Hand sanitizers EVERYWHERE! Yay! 

The Bean is blocked off but it was sooo nice and rare to see this landmark without tourists in Daylight. You can still take photos with this 
Majestic piece but just at a distance. 

The sculpture garden is still open but sadly the twin water towers aren&apos;t running water."
5,"Beautiful setting for family and friends.  Get there early if you want an unobstructed view of the Cloud Gate AKA The Bean without any other photo bombers in your shot!

Don&apos;t miss a short walk to the Art Institute of Chicago or to the Art society north on Michigan Ave."
5,"This place is beautiful, everyone in town have to go there, I thought it was close, but no, is open obviously the bean is close but you still can get really good pictures.. downtown Chicago is amazing!"
