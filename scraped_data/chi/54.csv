5,"I&apos;ve loved LBW for years and recently stopped in for date night and my love will continue!
Right now, they are doing a great job of Covid safety protocol, have heated tents outside for while you wait for your table, and the servers wait for you to put on your mask before they approach the table.
We ordered:
Chips and Salsa - 4 different types of salsa bursting with flavor
Potato taco - huge portion, I was stuffed!
Bad burger - my bf said it was one of the best burgers he had ever had
Mac and cheese
Cabin fever cocktail
Little Bad mule
We took home leftovers and had a great date night!

All of this was a little over $100 which we felt was a steal for the quality and amount of food.
Thank you LBW!"
5,"Went here today on one of the snowiest days of the year. I was really not expecting how nice the overall experience was all things considered. I hadn&apos;t been to an in-door restaurant in maybe about a year. 

So many things to consider given that covid is still ravaging the country, and getting anywhere in 5 feet of snow is basically a pilgrimage. But, even still I had a tiny sense of normalcy seeing other people out and speaking like old times before the virus decimated social activity. 

The staff were properly PPE&apos;d and the tables socially distanced. I felt secure. I felt, safe... I had the jumbo fried shrimp; Nice taste with the right about of bite and crisp you would want. The snow storm outside provided an interesting contrast to the experience. The temperature inside was good, cozy decor too.

Tried a cocktail on the menu, something matcha-infused. I don&apos;t recall the last cocktail Iv ever ordered before today. The past sometimes becomes more abstract when not focusing. To pretend I&apos;m eating healthier I also ordered the Brussels sprouts, and was delighted to see the most perfect amount of char on them. Stand out of the meal! 

Overall I enjoyed the experience and would recommend them. Will come back again someday."
5,"I&apos;ve been on a quest to find my favorite burger in Chicago for about 4 years now.  Tough life, I know.  I&apos;m so pleased to say that I finally added a new one to my top 3!  

We visited in the fall, so limited indoor dining was in effect.  I feel like for your first experience, you&apos;ll want to wait for the dine in experience versus delivery.  The ambiance is cool, the staff is around, and it&apos;s not tooo big of a place.  

We had the Bad Burger. YUMMMM!  I&apos;m a total sucker for a double (thin) patty situation.  That plus quality fries and good sauce to dip = WINNER!  As I&apos;m writing this I&apos;m getting hungry.  Need to go back soon (but I&apos;ll do pick up and try to get home quickly before it gets cold)!  

Don&apos;t miss out on the tacos - consider ordering one as an app or something.  They&apos;re random but super tasty!  

Note: We have friends that went all in on the Wolf Burger and weren&apos;t into it.  Could&apos;ve been a random fluke, but unless you&apos;re starving or splitting that with someone, I&apos;d suggest sticking to the Bad Burger.  It&apos;s the best!  

P.S. Parking was available via paid street parking if memory serves.  While we waited (no reservations), we popped over to the wine bar across the street for a drink.  It was awesome!"
5,"This was my first dining experience in a year, and it did not disappoint. My friend and I both had the Steak Frites and  they were perfect. Steak was cooked perfectly, and had amazing flavor. The fries were the right amount of salty. (The best fries were under the steak and had absorbed juices.)

I get perfectly safe eating inside with their cleaning protocols."
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to try this place for awhile and it was worth the hype! We came for lunch so decided to split a burger and side. We got the wolf burger which was INCREDIBLE! The burger itself was juicy and cooked perfectly. The sauce on it was delicious but not overpowering. There are fried onions on top which give it a little texture and a sunny side up egg for extra flavor. The burger came with fries which were thin, crispy, and not too salty which was definitely a plus. We got an extra side of the mac and cheese which had crunchy bread crumbs on top to give it a great mix of crunch and cheesiness! Overall very impressed with this place and would definitely come back!"
3,"The food is good.   The problem is you don&apos;t always get all of it.  I&apos;m not sure if staffing is the problem, but we have picked up three times in the past month and EVERY TIME they forget the fries.  Each time we drove home just to turn back and get our fries.  I want to give it 5 stars but just can&apos;t.  We are on our last limb with this place and it is REALLY unfortunate."
5,"We have been on the hunt for an awesome burger around the city and we finally found my favorite so far. The sliders were way bigger than I thought so it&apos;s a good meal to share with someone! I&apos;m telling you these burgers melt in your mouth, if you&apos;re thinking about trying little bad wolf this is your sign to make a reservation you will not regret it!!!"
5,"I love this place because it&apos;s just a few blocks from house! Their drinks are VERY delicious. My favs here are the sliders, Brussels sprouts, Cobb salad (highly recommend!). I also love their tacos. I often find myself grabbing some for a quick meal if I&apos;m on the go."
5,"I have heard a lot of recommendations from friends about Little Bad Wolf, and decided to finally check this place out recently.

We arrived at about 830pm on a weekday night, and it was still really busy! Luckily I was able to be seated pretty quickly on the patio.

I was very impressed with their large drink selection, especially their craft beers. They have a ton of rare and different options than most places in the area.

The food is definitely the best part though. My boyfriend and I each got a burger- one of us had fries and the other had the Mac and cheese. The burgers were delicious, the Mac and cheese is just incredible (definitely make sure you get it)- and the fries come with a really great aioli. 

The price is a little bit higher than your typical burger- but the quality is definitely worth it.

Au Cheval always was my favorite burger place in the city, but I think Little Bad Wolf has officially took over that title!"
4,"I&apos;m still in full agreement with my original review, but wanted to update. Although people rush to Little Bad Wolf for their burgers, the Fried Shrimp are more worthy of acclaim. They rank amoung the best you&apos;ll find in Chicago.

LBW also is one of the better cocktail bars in the area. They have a really good version of a New York Sour, but it&apos;s not always on the menu.

Pro Tip: The shrimp don&apos;t travel or hold up to delivery well. I suggest dining in or eating during the car ride home, lol."
4,"We arrived for a late dinner - around 8:30p on Sat.  They were creative and had seating outside a long the sidewalk as well as limited capacity inside.  We opted for outside since it was nice out.

Two other small groups but their name in ahead of us.  We were told to expect to wait 30-35 mins to be called and that dining would be limited to 75 mins.  Lady Luck was looking out for us as we only had to wait 15 mins.  We started off with drinks, of course.  I had the Chupacabra and my friend had the Slyvan.  Mine had a bit of the bite to it that I wasn&apos;t a fan of but really liked the Slyvan.  

As far as food, we ordered a combo of baos, tacos and an order of the Brussel sprouts.  Our order came out pretty fast and was soo good! The only complaint I have is that the Brussel sprouts weren&apos;t warm at all. I hope they hadn&apos;t been just sitting out but we ate most of them anyway.  The pork bao was probably the best of everything we tried.  The pork had that crispness to it that just makes you moan.  I loved it.  The shrimp one was just ok.  My friend had the steak taco which I&apos;m told was good and I got the potato one.  No complaints with it.

We noticed quite a few people ordered burgers and they looked good.  Worth a try. Overall, I really enjoyed my visit.  Parking is a little tough if you don&apos;t want to pay for city parking but possible along the residential streets."
5,"I&apos;ve heard great recommendations from friends about this place so I decided to check it out finally. I must say they&apos;re all right! A friend and I had dinner last night and I must say the food was delicious. 

I had the Green Eyes for cocktails infused Chicago Spirit Vodka with Mint and Lime it was delicious and I had the Wolf Burger for my meal which had two patties and side of fries. They were right about the burgers it&apos;s fantastic and taste good! Come hungry because the burgers are huge. The bun was crispy and so does the fries. I sliced my burger and the smoke was coming out so it was definitely fresh. 

The server was very nice and friendly. During this time the staff are all wearing masks, hand sanitizers are provided on the table and it&apos;s all 6ft apart. I would definitely come back and check it out again!"
5,"Very enjoyable experience. The food was great - I had the Bad Burger - and the cocktails were both excellent. The portion sizes are generous and are artfully displayed. 
They are definitely within the top 3 I&apos;ve had in my life. Also, you need order the Mac and cheese! It&apos;s everything Mac and cheese should be. The service was great and we were able to take advantage of the outdoor seating, and the staff makes it all the better.
 Every time I go I end up leaving hugging the hostess goodbye because I had so much fun. There is a small parking lot available me to store. Drinks on point, and fun to watch him whip up the drinks. 
Wish this place was bigger inside. Wait times for tables inside can be very long.
Overall, one of the best burger places I&apos;ve been to in Chicago! Definitely need to come back!"
4,"Little Bad Wolf came onto my radar after I heard that it has one of the best burgers in the city. So of course I had to try! I ordered the Bad Burger, a shrimp taco, and the Mac n Cheese side order for carryout. I placed my order online using ChowNow and did curbside pickup. It was ready on time. The place had a decent amount of patio seating and it was packed on a Sunday evening during Labor Day weekend. 

Let&apos;s start off with the burger. The bun was soft and fluffy and the toppings were awesome. It was a very messy burger with the sauce and melty cheese. The pickles were crispy and had a solid balance with the other toppings. However, I thought the burger itself was underwhelming and pretty bland. It pretty much had no seasoning and was a little flavorless. Maybe it didn&apos;t travel well and it is better for dine in? Like the Loyalist, I felt that the toppings made the burger good rather than the burger itself so that bumps it down a little bit on my burger rankings list. The fries were terrible as they were very soggy, but I knew that going in as fries never ever travel well at any place. The aioli had a pretty spicy kick, but it was very good. I&apos;m pretty sure it was mixed with Sriracha. 

Now for the shrimp taco and mac n cheese. The shrimp taco was small, but boy did it pack a punch of flavor! There was a huge piece of shrimp that was fried and the cabbage had a nice crunch. The tortilla was very fresh and the honey bacon mayo sauce was to die for. The shrimp taco was literally one of the best tacos I&apos;ve had in Chicago, which was a nice surprise! The mac n cheese was excellent and it was very cheesy and gooey. And it comes with bacon and I will never complain about bacon. The bread crumbs and spiraled noodles were a nice touch as well. The portion size was huge as well for about $8. 

Price was average, but the tacos were a tad expensive as they were small and they were about $5/each. But the shrimp taco was worth the price. I would probably order some more tacos and try their baos next time. I saw on their website that they have a massive whiskey list and the prices were pretty solid so I will have to come back and try. Overall, Little Bad Wolf is a great restaurant in the Andersonville neighborhood. I would love to come back and try Little Bad Wolf for dine in and drink some fine bourbon from their extensive whiskey list!"
5,I absolutely love this place. The burgers are phenomenal and i had the opportunity to dine in before the closures of dine in. Take out is just as amazing. Their cocktails are amazing and I highly recommend.
5,"My oh my, Little Bad Wolf what an amazing burger you have. Visited here last night during all this COVID craziness and left speechless with just how good it was. You guys know how to do a burger right at LBW. Ordered the 3-Patty Burger and was shocked as to how quickly it came out and how delicious every single bite was, along with the fries on the side. We went big with this meal and ordered the full size Mac N Cheese and oh boy it could easily feed 4 people, but no worries we love us some leftovers. (Sorry no pictures provided since we destroyed the burgers and fries as soon as they were delivered to the table). Beyond well done LBW, it was an amazing experience. Cannot wait to return with some friends/family for future meals.
Overall 5.0/5.0 nothing to complain about!"
5,"Amazing food and service! I would strongly recommend making reservations if you&apos;re eating outside because right now they only have four tented outdoor tables due to indoor dining restrictions. They also have carryout and delivery through GrubHub! We sat outside and our table was under a heat lamp, warm, and spaced far enough away from others. They have a nice beer selection and beers were cold and interesting local brews. The food is phenomenal here. We had the Mac and cheese with chicken which is a large enough portion to share with two people. I had a fish bao and a potato taco, and although they look small in the photo, they were more than filling for me. The side of elotes was also a hefty portion and absolutely phenomenal. It came with a giant deep fried avocado on the top which was delicious. Definitely coming back here, whether it be for outdoor dining or carryout!"
3,"EDIT: owner responded in professional manner on the same day. 

We lost internet where I&apos;m staying due to the storms, which started the day on the wrong foot. 

Hopefully LBW will reopen soon and I can leave a proper review. 


Old review:

It&apos;s 11:30 on a Tuesday. 

Their answering machine claims they are open from 11am onward 7 days a week. 

No sign of life in the restaurant or notice they are closed on the door. We had a lunch appointment here today and have been left high and dry. 

Unfortunate."
5,"We didn&apos;t realize it was going to be so loud (the family all went for a graduation dinner and my grandmother was with us), but the food was very good. I had the bacon mac and the pork, chicken, and steak bao buns. The steak was the best, was not a fan of the pork. All the wait staff was great. Caution: the salads are ginormous."
5,"Delicious!! We&apos;re in Chicago for the weekend and noticed this place nearby. It&apos;s absolutely dismal outside so we got it delivered. We got the elotes, several baos and tacos. Loved every single bite! Each dish was a home run for us. Highly recommend this place. My one regret is we didn&apos;t get a drink!"
