5,"I&apos;m looking forward for this spot to reopen! My friend and I had a wonderful and very funny experience here. The food, by the way, is simply delicious and we had already heard about it when we went there for a snack. We are big fans of the TV show Beat Bobby Flay and when we saw fish and chips on the menu, we decided ask the waiter for his opinion before making an order. His response was unexpected: &quot;Our chef makes it better than Bobby Flay&quot; 
*shock*
As people say, trust but google it! XD It was absolutely true) The food became twice as pleasant to enjoy!)"
5,"This easily caught our attention when we were looking for a brunch to sit down at before our flight back home. The aesthetic and atmosphere of The Dearborn is excellent. We walked through the revolving doors and we were welcomed by the most sweetest young lady behind the podium. (Great spirit and awesome host, she&apos;s a keeper for a place like this!) It just barely passed 11am on a Sunday morning and we may have been the first people in-- the band was still setting up. The host kindly offered if we wanted indoor or outdoor seating and we opted for outdoor on a nice breezy morning/early afternoon. Once we sat down, our server came out to greet us momentarily. Our server was super polite!

We started off with the mid west fried chicken ($17) and parmesan truffle fries ($10) to start. The mid west fried chicken is not your average fried chicken. It had a very nice twist to it. The maple mustard glaze gave it a nice sweet but not too overpowering sweet taste to it and it is nothing I&apos;ve have tried before. The parmesan truffle fries were literally perfection. They were perfectly crispy and nicely seasoned with truffle and parmesan. Both of these dishes were worth it! 

I got the buffalo chicken sandwich ($16) with fries as a side. I like spicy food, but I&apos;m sometimes a little whimp when it comes to spice. Surprisingly this sandwich wasn&apos;t spicy at all. The buttermilk marinated chicken breast tasted delicious with the blue cheese-boursin spread. I&apos;m normally not a fan of blue cheese, I&apos;m more of a ranch type of girl, but this was SO GOOD! The chicken had the perfect crisp to it but yet was super juicy inside as shown in the pictures. My boyfriend got the lemon-ricotta pancake ($15) and it was beautiful. The presentation was beyond our expectations. It was super fluffy yet creamy with a ton of sweetness, but not too sweet where I felt like it was ice cream. 

All in all this was a great brunch spot. Our server was good, the food was excellent, and the weather was beautiful. Unfortunately we did not get to listen to the live band because we left after an hour of a half or so, but I wish we got to enjoy the music over brunch. They set up then they went MIA... The host was very productive with her time. When we walked in she was organizing menus. When we were seated she grabbed her cleaning supplies to wipe down the revolving doors regularly after everyone that came in and out. The bus boy lacked English and did not understand us when we asked for little plates for our appetizers or utensils, but he immediately informed our server and he came right over and placed some wipes on a plate for us after those flavorful wings. I would highly recommend this place and hope to come back soon."
5,"I sat outside on a chilly October Friday afternoon next to a patio heater. I didn&apos;t notice it had gone out, but the GM himself did notice and changed the tank out personally I ordered a pepperoni pizza and it was terrific. Thin, crispy, chewy. Also an old-fashioned, which was perfect. My husband had the small plate fried chicken, which was NOT your mama&apos;s battered and fried chicken but was absolutely fabulous nonetheless. I had a dish of berry sorbet and it was SO creamy and delicious we both ordered a dish of chocolate ice cream. IT WAS HOMEMADE.  I can&apos;t wait to go back for more. Our waiter was personable and clearly a foodie. He made dinner fun."
4,"Among all the items my friend and I had ordered for dinner here (mussels, suckling pig, too many to name...) the standouts were the Midwest fried chicken and the bone marrow. Both were so incredibly delicious and I&apos;m sure I&apos;d order both again on my future visits. Between the other items ordered, most of the dishes were rather underwhelming, however.

Service was impeccable and I felt very tended to by our server. Drinks were refilled quickly, everyone was friendly, and the staff were so patient when explaining and recommending menu items!

I would recommend the Dearborn and I look forward to my next dining experience here for some more fried chicken and bone marrow!"
5,"Talk about foodie heaven! We came here to celebrate our engagement and had the BEST experience! Sitting at the bar top with Todd was so fun! He was able to give me some great recommendations on wine, while my girlfriend.... wait... fianc√©, enjoyed one of the best old fashioned she&apos;s ever had. They spoiled us with some bubbly to celebrate. The atmosphere is welcoming while embracing some of the historic architectural vibes of the city. Love it! 

Moving on to the food. In the words of Janice from Friends... Oh. My. God. The bone marrow and steak tartar was decadent and beautifully presented. The Brussels sprouts were delicious and balanced out the beautiful bright flavors of the Burrata &amp; Heirloom Tomatoes. 

All in all, visiting The Dearborn while in Chicago was one of the best decisions we made. We had such a great time we came back on our way to the airport for one last experience. They even recognized us when we walked in a d congratulated us again on our engagement!"
3,"Came here on a Sunday right when they opened. We were seated right away. The service was very nice, the waiter and the host were very welcoming. I believe it was the Manager, but she came over during our meal to thank us for coming out and asked how was everything. Very personable!

I was a bit disappointed in the food. Based on the reviews I thought it was going to be the BOMB! The Truffle Fries lived up to the hype. But the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes were ok. The pancakes were falling apart, and once you get pass the toppings, the pancakes were very bland. 

I also had the Egg and Avocado BLT. It was a decent size serving especially with the fries. I wasn&apos;t in love. They don&apos;t have any non-pork breakfast sides. The menu is pretty small, not a bunch of options. But I did see multiple things I&apos;d try on the menu. 

They have mimosas and the Last Dance drink was different but good! They add an 18% gratuity to every bill due to the coronavirus and to make sure their staff is taken care of. 

I wouldn&apos;t say don&apos;t come here, I would definitely come back and try something else on the menu. I just was disappointed this time."
5,"First off let me say this is probabaly the best burger I have had in America.  It&apos;s simple, but executed perfectly. Let&apos;s start with the bun, crisp light, very much the perfect bun I have tried that&apos;s fitting between two patties of perfectly cooked and gently seasoned patties.

The cheese is fantastic, the entire package is just the best burger I&apos;ve had period point blank.

My best bro ordered their protein breakfast everything was great.  The bacon which is the only I tried was excellent, not salty and a great cut balance of fat and meat.  The fruits were fresh as well.

Moving onto the drinks, holy shit. These bad boys not only serious flavor and substance, but also they are STRONG as all hell. They hide it well so non boozey lovers will find a way to get buzzed without ever noticing the content.  The Bloody Mary was fabulous as well. I would come back here for either the DRINKS or the FOOD alone. Pick one, I would make the trek regardless. 

Our server was Kelsey and she was great, attentive, good personality.

Overall I would rate this experience a 9.5/10 because nothing in life gets a 10.

TLDR: come here this place will be my goto in Chicago every single time I visit."
4,"We were greeted by the most ebullient and fashionably dressed host in the city. We sat on the patio but the bar area is open air with &quot;garage&quot; doors as well. It was a nice, warm breezy summer afternoon - a plus when dining in the age of Covid. 

It was disappointing to learn that they were out of many menu items, particularly seafood (no oysters, salmon, scallops). I&apos;m sure this is due to conservative ordering on the part of management during tenuous re-opening. The crowd was light. I&apos;d rather they run out of fresh seafood than to try to dress up old fish and sell it, as is done way too often in the restaurant biz.

Overall, our experience was a pleasant one. Fabulous service, beautiful day, great wine selection. I had the house salad with grilled shrimp. The shrimp were large, perfectly grilled and FRESH. The apricot mint vinaigrette was subtle and complemented nicely. My bf had the trout. It was quite delicious, prepared with zucchini and cherry tomatoes on the verge of blister. The brown butter sauce was so good, it almost overpowered the delicate fish. I wanted a piece of bread to sop it up (yes I was eating off his plate)."
5,"This classy spot is perfect for a weekend dinner! i went here with a friend during the summer, and the atmosphere was very modern and appealing. Our waiter was very accomodating to our dietary restrictions and seemed very knowledgeable about the different dishes! I would definitely come here again when I have the chance to!"
5,"Amazing bar, when we were there a jazz trio was playing. Loved the infused bourbon Knob Creek Bourbon, and the device they use to make it!"
4,"The Dearborn is a spot that I would have just casually walked by if I didn&apos;t know what was here. It&apos;s a good New American spot in the heart of the loop. But there is one thing that absolutely stands out about the Dearborn... the burger.

The burger -- with foie gras -- is something that I think about often and one of the best burgers that I have ever had. It rivals the Emily Burger in NYC and Father&apos;s Office in LA. The meat is cooked perfectly to your desired state, the cheese perfectly melted, and it is wrapped up in a sturdy pretzel bun. The real magic is adding in the foie gras and creating this layer of richness and decadence that is unmatched by anything else. The burger (and other delicious items) makes the Dearborn one of the must-visit spots in the area.

The service in the restaurant is also lovely... and there was a lack of a judgement when I came back by myself to have another burger with foie gras."
5,"Made a reservation for this place on Saturday night because we wanted a bit of a nicer dinner and it did not disappoint!

The place ambience is really nice and good for a date night spot. They seated us right away and the service was really good! 

As for drinks, we had the old fashioned that was super delicious and I&apos;m normally not a straight whiskey drinker. I ordered another cocktail called the summer tease which was a little too fruity for my taste but the last dance cocktail was delicious!

As for the food, we got the pheasant with truffle risotto and OH MY GOD that truffle risotto was so decadent and rich, I could eat that all the time. We also got the sucklinf pig which was nice and tender however I was not as much a fan of the apple sides as I thought it was a bit plain. 

Overall this is a good dinner date if you&apos;re looking for a pricier option with good service, yummy cocktails, and delicious food!"
5,"Y&apos;all. I went back and EVERYTHING WAS BOMB !

The lighting was dim and even with the super awesome iPhone 11 Pro camera , these photos don&apos;t do the food justice but bear with me. The fish &amp; chips, particularly the fish, was absolutely delicious. It was so perfectly cooked throughout and the flavor was on point. The salmon and lentils were just as amazing. All of the flavors were so perfectly paired. I kept eating way past being full because it was just too good to stop. I can&apos;t personally comment on the old fashioned, but my hubs said it was the best one he has ever had. House made bitters; whaaaaat?!   

Last but definitely not least, service was excellent. Josh, our server, was super knowledgeable about everything on the menu and made great recommendations. Plus, he was funny, which never hurts. Brian, one of the managers, was also kind enough to check in on us several times and answer questions about the food. 

All in all, I&apos;m glad I gave this place a second chance. It&apos;s a block from where I work and I&apos;m excited to have another go-to spot."
3,"Ok, this is one of the few times I feel like I was steered wrong with the reviews. I honestly have no idea how the Dearborn is rated so well. There are so many other restaurants I have been to that taste so much better.

I have now been here twice for brunch and both times, I was underimpressed. The first time, I was convinced by the server to order the burger because it was one of the best. Unfortunately, I found it to lack flavor.

Lack of flavor seems to be the theme of the second experience as well. My friend ordered the bone marrow and soft scramble. She felt that everything in the dish was &quot;one-note,&quot; and nothing stood out. They did include Chipotle mayo with the dish, but that would just take over the dish, and in the end, didn&apos;t belong.

The chicken fried steak also lacked flavor unfortunately. I think it is super important to season with salt and pepper prior to deep frying. I don&apos;t feel like that happened so the meat had no flavor. Plus, it was tougher than I would prefer. Also, the sausage gravy was a bit too sweet. I think if it was peppery, it would have been so much better. Instead of sunny side eggs, I ordered the eggs to be prepared as a cheesy scramble. I did not taste the cheese at all, and the eggs lacked salt.

My husband had the carnitas hash, and we all agreed he had the most flavorful dish. If you are coming here for brunch, this is a solid option.

Now one thing I will say the Dearborn does well are their sweets. Both times, I was impressed with my order. The first time, they had a lemon poppyseed donut which had a deliciously sweet and citrus profile. I also absolutely loved their apple cider donuts and would strongly recommend ordering!"
4,"My boyfriend and I currently live right on top of The Dearborn so it ends up being a place we often overlook when choosing places to dine at / order take out from. Pre-COVID, we&apos;ve sat down and dined a couple times. The wait can be pretty long for the food sometimes, but the food was also really good. During quarantine, we&apos;ve ordered from here once so far and he&apos;s done their window / outdoor dining once.

They&apos;re currently offering meal kits (e.g., pizza, burgers, steak, etc.) and cocktail kits!

What we like:
- Midwest Fried Chicken (SOOO GOOD! A very interesting twist to fried chicken!!)
- Burrata (BF had this, not me because I didn&apos;t want to take my lactase haha)
- The Burger
- Oxtail Mac n Cheese (SOOO GOOD! Only avail during dinner I believe)
- Parmesan Truffle Fries (Only avail during dinner, I usually find truffle too overpowering but this was perfect!)
- Crispy Brussels
- Chicken Fried Steak (No longer on their menu)
- Beef Short Rib (No longer on their menu)"
5,"So I haven&apos;t technically eaten IN this restaurant yet (thanks COVID) but I ate on the little sidewalk patio. Never in my life have I enjoyed shrimp and grits more than these. Wow. The chicken sandwich was also incredible, but those grits? I had no idea I could love grits but here we are. Get the shrimp and grits, you won&apos;t regret it!"
5,"We had an early dinner here and sat outside. Nearly everything about our meal was excellent. My wife was very happy with her cocktail, I was impressed by the beer options, and all our food was excellent. We had:

1. Mussels. They were in a sauce that seemed to be a mix of chili paste and wine with garlic. My wife couldn&apos;t get enough of the sauce. 
2. The fried chicken. I thought it was a bit too sweet, but the hot sauce served on the side helped. My wife loved the combo.
3. The burger. I thought it was excellent, and I agree with all the other rave reviews. Definitely recommend it. 

Overall we had a great meal here. Would go back again."
4,"Seafood chowder is so fresh. Chowder tends to feel heavy but this was so light yet fulfilling. The corn, potatoes, and shrimp make a warming bite. 

The blue crab hush puppies are fluffy and crispy. There&apos;s a lot of garnish/somewhat salad on top but it is a good balance for the spice."
5,"We go every year for our anniversary/my birthday except for 2020 cause ya know, COVID but they never disappoint! They always give us a nice celebratory &quot;gift&quot; and card. The staff is so friendly too and that&apos;s why we come back every year!"
5,"We stopped in to The Dearborn for dinner as it was near our hotel. 

We shared the housemade cheddar &amp; chive milk bread as a table. It reminded me of chive bread (from an asian bakery) meeting an American roll. 

When the server told us that the fish &amp; chips (beer-battered Pacific cod with house made chips, tartar sauce and malt vinegar) was the Chef&apos;s winning dish against Beat Bobby Flay, I HAD to order it! They were pretty solid but truth be told, I&apos;m not very discerning when it comes to fish &amp; chips -- I haven&apos;t had deep fried foods that I don&apos;t enjoy!"
