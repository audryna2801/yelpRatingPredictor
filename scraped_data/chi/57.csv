5,"The best time to visit the Lincoln Park Zoo is definitely during the Zoo Lights event! Check their website for Zoo Lights event fee and reservation. It&apos;s been a while since I went but when I went to the Lights event they provided these cool glasses where you see the lights sparkle in all sorts of animal forms like penguins, giraffes, and even elves. My family and I had a blast walking through the zoo at night with all its light decor. Animal sighting may be limited at night but it&apos;s still enjoyable. Definitely bundle up if you plan on visiting this zoo during Chicago cold season. On a normal day, it is free admission! I highly recommend stopping by this zoo. It&apos;s a great way to explore a part of Chicago for free."
5,"We love LP zoo! 
Such a great option for a nice way to have some free fun in Chicago. 
Due to covid all of the indoor exhibits were still closed, but never-the less we enjoyed a few hours looking at all of the animals. The gorillas were super active the afternoon we visited and we watched them play and fight for about 30 mins before moving on. 
They are doing a lot of construction and additions that will be cool to check out next time we are in town !"
5,"We LOVE the Zoo Lights event at holiday time, and sadly due to COVID this year it was sold out due to limited reservations. Still, we went during the day on NYE just to walk around and that was nice. It&apos;s clean, close to home and FREE! We love it."
5,"Man I have visited too many times.
I love it here.
Yes it has always been free. But please consider donating or buying something at the gift shop.
I dunno just something about free worries me and you know keeping the animals safe and happy."
4,"This review is based largely on my Zoolights experience, which, for COVID times, was awesome compared to any other free visit we&apos;ve had here.

Zoolights was like $5 each and then you have to pay for specific extra experiences as well as parking (expensive on site, but not so bad if you&apos;re patient and find street parking relatively close by).

We loved the social distancing and the various light displays throughout the zoo. The seals were actually out and swimming (it was below 30 degrees when we went).

We joined the 3D maze, the enchanted forest, and the cafe for s&apos;mores. Overall, it was worth the extra charge so that the kids could be entertained, otherwise, the general lighting areas would&apos;ve been quick to get through.

For the s&apos;mores part, it was nice to be at the top of the gift shop overlooking the zoo, but for the cost we paid, it only included admission and required an extra cost for s&apos;mores. We settled in by one of the fire pits and warmed up while eating some treats.

Overall, we spent roughly $100 for a family of four, including entrance, activities, food, and parking. We were there for about 2.5 hours and we feel like it was a good value.

We will be back for Zoolights next year!"
3,"My husband, son, and I visited Chicago in November. There were several places that were closed due to CoVid, but luckily the Lincoln Park Zoo was open, so we decided to stop by.

To help with social distancing, when we went, you had to preregister and go at an assigned time slot. Even at our assigned time, there were a lot of people, but everyone was wearing masks and socially distancing. Also, due to Covid, the indoor exhibits were closed. 

The fact that I was outside with my family and there was no admission fee was nice. However, there really was not a lot to see."
4,"For it to be cold and during covid, we were able to see more than enough animals towards one side of the park in particular. The monkeys were out with their babies which was my favorite part. We also seen camels, zebras, seals and a slew of other animals out in full viewing form. 

Tickets were free, found free parking but I think parking inside was $20 for 2 hours.

The park was sparsely full with about 20 or so other patrons and family combos.

Worth a visit to take the kids"
4,"It was a lot of fun to get back here and go during the pandemic, but a few things to note:

Not everyone wears there mask correctly even though it is enforced but at least you&apos;re outside and have space to distance yourself. 

There was about a 10-15 minute line to get in but they took our temperature and made sure we were wearing our mask.

A lot of animals were out which was a ton of fun to see! And they&apos;re redoing the big cat area so I can&apos;t wait to see that too."
3,"It&apos;s a great park and at one of those great spot in the city to check out Lake Michigan and some
Of the amazing views. I am just not a fan of zoos unfortunately.


For the whole animal zoo part I have to give only 3 stars. The rest of the park itself is great and would recommend taking time to walk the grounds. Plenty of great things to check out and many historic architectural structure, sculptures and more. Visit for this.

As for the animal they just should not be locked up... it&apos;s kind of depressing to me."
5,"Still a 5 Star experience despite the COVID. 

Some things to know before you go... 

at the moment they are requiring pre registration and assigned time slots to ensure the ability to socially be distant. Go to their website to see availability and sign up. 

Pro Tip, if you are a member you have access to early entry tix and additional opportunities. 

unfortunately all of the indoor exhibits are closed at the moment, stupid virus. That said on a nice day the animals do have outdoor areas to roam around."
4,"We thought it was going to be a warm day but of course, Chicago weather can change any minute! We went to Lincoln Park zoo with the grandkids today, it was cold but we did manage to see a bunch of different animals at the zoo! You have to register online and get a slot before arriving at the zoo! You can only visit all the animals outdoors, no indoors are allowed and you must wear a face masks!"
5,"One takes the Lincoln Park zoo for granted especially if you live around here and Chicago in that order. You should not. This place can easily charge a $5 to enter and it would still be a steal. 

This is a first class zoo with No admission fee. Do I need to repeat that? The birds eye grill on top of the gift shop surprisingly serves quality food and is still open because it&apos;s outdoors. 

The zoo lights will be back But you need to make reservations and it requires a $5 fee. It&apos;s Worth It! In these times of Covid going to the zoo to see the animals or the  Christmas lights let&apos;s you escape and enjoy life like we use too."
1,"If you&apos;re considering going during COVID since it&apos;s outdoors--do the aquarium instead.

Almost all exhibits were closed down due to being inside or due to renovation, very few animals to see in an already fairly small park. It&apos;s understandable for indoor exhibits to be closed but so many outdoor ones also were (unsure why? No signs or explanation except that the &quot;cats&quot; exhibit was being remodeled). 

I would absolutely not recommend going. It&apos;s not worth the trip here and you&apos;ll end up paying to park and see very few animals quite honestly. 

I would wait and go next year instead."
4,"A free zoo? No admission charge? I have to admit, anything that is free you should not have any high expectations. With that said, I was pleasantly surprised with my first time visit on a chilly saturday afternoon on 2/29/20.

There is a large parking lot that you can pay to park in but just like anywhere else in the city, you cant avoid paying to park anywhere. If you are lucky enough, you can find metered parking on the street that is much cheaper.

I like how the lay out of the design was made. You can technically see the whole thing kind of like in an oval shape so it doesn&apos;t matter whether you go clockwise or counter clockwise. Since admission is free, there are several areas where you can enter and leave. If you refer to the map I took a picture of, you will see what I mean.

Animal-wise I was pleasantly surprised at what they had on display. They have several buildings dedicated to certain animlas like the aviary of predatory birds, a reptile building with all animals that are cold blooded, a primate building with gorillas and monkeys, a farm animal building, and some other smaller habitats like for Giraffes, Polar Bears, Penguins, Camels, a couple of others that I never heard of. One of them sounded like a description for a Chinese dish. The animal looked like a cross between a cow and a horse. The name of the animal was Sichuan Takin.

In the end, technically it&apos;s not free. You have to pay for parking one way or another if you are planning on coming here. Still I am grateful that there is no admission. I would also like to mention that when I was there, the Lion Habitat building was under construction. I wonder if they just let the lions roam around the park until it&apos;s done. Lol.

4,"A pretty good zoo so far. Really liked when the animals come up to you and be entertained of looking different kinds of animals.  A couple of my friends recommended me this place and I love it!  It was cool to see how each animals behaved as well. Even with covid, it is still a good place to check it out."
5,So glad the zoo is still open during the pandemic. We went during the Zoo lights. You need reservations and a mask. They have thought everything out and have one way paths and arrows for guests to follow. It was still very nice!
4,"Yes, certainly open during the pandemic era.

- Reservations required.  Reservations open online the week you want to go.  If you look Friday evening there are pretty much always Saturday and Sunday times available.
- All indoor animal areas are closed so no bears, lions, tigers, elephants, reptiles.  You can see the giraffes, rhinos, zebras, penguins and a handful of other things.  Tbh there aren&apos;t too many animals to see.  We walked through the whole zoo in about 1.5 hrs.
- Indoor gift shop is open.
- Free except for ridiculously expensive parking.
- Good social distancing and protective precautions EXCEPT for the long line at the entrance and certain covered exhibits (monkeys, penguins).  Mask wearing throughout."
5,"Why we love Lincoln Park Zoo -

Cool Zoo, it&apos;s perfectly mapped out so that you&apos;re not in a overcrowded exhibit. There is space to move around with strollers and groups. The botanical gardens are amazing. There is a petting farm.
There is an indoor play area for smaller kids.
There are little booths with zoo keepers interacting with the guests where you can learn more about animals, touch cool things like a flamingo&apos;s foot or pet live animals. 

Favorite must see animals here?  The polar bears. I mean I live in Chicago and have been to this zoo several times. I&apos;ve only seen the polar bears out to play or swimming a few times. The beavers. They are hilarious and love to put on a show. The ape house. ALL glass. You see mama, papa and babies up close! The giraffes - They actually come very close to the gates so you get the full experience. 

We also love the events here:  Yoga in the park, October Fest and Zoo lights."
5,"It&apos;s free! Lots of space, good animals. I would recommend getting a map though because it&apos;s a circular shape so you could end up passing the same thing over and over if you don&apos;t know where you&apos;re going! Some food options available, kid and family friendly, and a nice way to be outside for free! Don&apos;t forget to check out the most beautiful view of the city on the very south end of the park."
5,"If you are planning a trip to the Lincoln park zoo make sure you make a reservation in advance or same day if available.   The zoo has limited capacity. It was pretty busy but there was enough space to have a physical distance between parties. All the indoor exhibits were closed on the way we were there we didn&apos;t ask if it&apos;s because of precautionary limits because of COVID but one indoor habitat that was closed and being remodeled at the moment was the big cats one that is close to the east entrance. Friendly and knowledgeable staff.
