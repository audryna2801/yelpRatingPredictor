5,"I&apos;ve been a patron since the restaurant opened in 2013. So this  review has been long overdue.

It&apos;s been my go to place. Love(d) the bar there. I would often stop there for a drink before I hit the bars and clubs in the area or after work. Always good atmosphere and good crowd.

The food is great. By now, I believe I&apos;ve tried everything on their menu and all is good. My fave is ( still) the truffle mushroom pizza, the pan seared scallops and the bombolini. Best bombolini in the city for sure. You can also find them at the BomboBar at the sister restaurant Bar Sienna. 

They&apos;ve changed staff as it happens often in the industry ( I truly miss some of the bartenders), but no matter who they hired, service has always been top notch. Even at the bar area ( pre-covid times) no matter how busy they are they always acknowledge you and serve you in timely matter. 

I&apos;m glad they are still open during this covid time. I was at the bar before the &apos;no indoor&apos; dining restrictions were put in place towards the end of the year and ate there a week ago. I&apos;m happy to report that service was professional and attentive and the food was delicious as always."
5,"We came here for my birthday dinner. We were able to enjoy their heated outdoor patio, and was very surprised to see this place packed, and a lot of people standing outside to get seated. We booked a reservation and got seated in a reasonable time. 

We started off with their &quot;coccoli.&quot; It seems to be popular, a very airy crispy dough served with stracchino cheese, prosciutto di Parma, and truffle honey. The prosciutto complemented the sweetness from the honey and creaminess from the cheese.  These were good, but I wouldn&apos;t necessarily say they&apos;re $19 worth. 

My wife ordered their &quot;gnocchi.&quot; It came with truffle cream, fried sage, and crispy pancetta. This was by far the best gnocchi I have ever tried. This dish with the truffle cream was so decadent. I could literally eat this all day. The gnocchi was cooked perfectly. I would definitely order this dish again. 

I ordered their &quot;squid ink linguine.&quot; The linguine was mixed in a spicy lobster cream and topped with a perfectly grilled lobster tail. I&apos;ve had plenty of lobster tail,  but this grilled lobster tail was so delicious. It was seasoned perfectly and tasted so good. The linguine was al dente cooked and went perfectly with the spicy creamy sauce. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this again. 

I was very excited to order their &quot;bomboloni&quot; for dessert because I knew my wife would love the little bottles it came with. But unfortunately we received four bombolonis in a little baggy and with the sauces served in little bowls instead of in the little bottles. Definitely a disappointment was far as presentation goes, but they were still very tasty. It came with caramel, chocolate hazelnut, and raspberry Chianti sauces. My favorite was their caramel. 

This night was fantastic. Sienna tavern was definitely better than I had expected it to be. The service was outstanding and they made sure I left satisfied. I will definitely be back."
5,"This place has been on my list for years and I wish I had gone sooner rather than later. I visited during covid and wait staff was very polite and everything was very clean. 

I got the following:
Grilled ocotpus - get it and make sure to squeeze that lemon on top
Chicken - usually I hate getting chicken at places bc it&apos;s so dry! But this wasn&apos;t the case. The arugula salad complimented the chicken so well
Spaghetti - omg so good. It has a crab or lobster cake in it and it&apos;s SOO delicious. 

Price point is higher here but the food is so worth it. I highly recommend it if you&apos;re in the area."
4,"Ordered delivery for a celebratory dinner. 
Pros: accommodating to special requests, quick delivery, yummy food, freebie cookies 
Cons: this might be a stretch but it was little cold by the time it got to me. Such is life in delivery though 
We got the gnocchi, a half pepperoni half mushroom pizza, and the burrata. 
The gnocchi was incredibly rich but super good, and I&apos;d say the same thing about the mushroom pizza. I was glad we balanced it out with the pepperoni. Burrata was good but not to die for. 
Free chocolate chip cookies were added to our order and they were delicious."
3,"Overall 2 Stars, one additional star given due to Covid difficulties restaurants face. So i appreciate they are open and accommodate delivery.

2 single item pizzas. OK. Pretty cold by the time arrived. Luckily we have a Japanese toaster for such things and could give it some heat/crispness.

Gnocchi. OK.
Chicken. OK and way overpriced ($33)?

So 4 items at about $140 by the time delivered via door dash. Felt not so good and certainly overpriced."
4,"Came here for brunch on a weekend just as indoor dining resumed.

Pros:
First things first, I felt like there was enough social distancing, staff were masked, and there was no shortage of hand sanitizer stations. 

There were a lot of great brunch options and I had a hard time deciding my meal, but I ended up getting the breakfast pizza and it did not disappoint! If you&apos;re not good with a little bit of spiciness though, this may not be a good choice for you as they use fireball pepperoni. The crust had a good chewy texture and the toppings were solid, but I felt like maybe some honey or hot honey would&apos;ve elevated this pizza from good to great. 

Cons: 
My hot toddy came lukewarm, unfortunately, and it didn&apos;t quite live up to the server&apos;s hype; the spicy bloody mary was solid though! (Yes, I had multiple drinks; It&apos;s brunch!)

This place gets really busy and there&apos;s a reason why it&apos;s so popular! Having said that, there&apos;s not a lot of space for people to wait for their dates or posse, so we all just kinda stood there crammed between the entrance and hostess&apos;s desk... which wasn&apos;t great."
5,"Went to Siena Tavern for New Year&apos;s Eve and it was amazing. We ate outside with heaters, it was freezing but the food made it worth it! We got the special nye tasting menu for $75 for 4 courses and it was amazing. I got the ribeye for my main which was $40 more but I&apos;m glad I got it. 

The soup was delicious and very warm. 

The wagyu meatball was incredible and the garlic bread that came with was *chefs kiss*. 

The tortellaci was so savoury and the flavor was so unique. 

The steak was as good as it looks.

We got the No. 2 for drinks which was delicious and they even paid for our first round since we waited 15 min to be seated. 

A great outdoor dining experience!"
5,They have really good family packages for two. Definitely would recommend their truffle pizza.
5,"Love Siena Tavern so much! If I was reviewing it specifically for COVID accommodations I wouldn&apos;t rank it that high, but the winter elements are beyond their control and don&apos;t reflect this restaurant as a whole. We came for a brunch and it was very very cold so note that you will want to bring a coat and winter gear. The tent they have outside is not fully enclosed, but they have a lot of heaters but still can&apos;t protect you from that winter wind chill. Aside from that this place is spectacular! They have a wonderfully varied brunch menu and when we went they also had their full menu available as well. Our waitress was so friendly and accommodating and all staff were wearing masks and respecting COVID rules. 
Food was DELICIOUS. We had coffees, the lemon ricotta pancakes, and the breakfast skillet. The pancakes were delicious and flavorful. Very strong on the lemon taste but with the blueberry compote and ricotta were balanced so nicely. The breakfast skillet came out steaming hot, a very large portion, and truly felt like the perfect breakfast for a cold winter morning. We will be returning when it gets a little warmer outside!"
4,"Great location, atmosphere and food! The drinks as well there are tons of choices. 
We have been here multiple times pre covid and after... outside seating is definitely a little on the cold side even with the heaters and coats on. Another thing to keep in mind is to make reservations with enough time or even a day before. It was hard to get something just for 2 people. 
For the steak lovers you cannot go wrong with the 22 oz bone in prime rib. Comes in its skillet as well!! The presentation is beautiful as well.
The pizza is also great as they are a little on the thin crust/healthy side. But plenty of options. 
Service is good, but can be better as there is not many tables and people to attend to. Perfect location for a fun night out with friends and some drinks."
5,"I&apos;m not usually a reviewer, but felt compelled to do it specifically for this restaurant. I just want to say 5 stars all around and best dining out experience I&apos;ve had in a while in Chicago! The ambiance, food, service, everything was incredible!!! I came here for my birthday and they made it very special with the gelato chocolate cake and gelato sundae (both comp&apos;d) :) Really enjoyed my special time here and can&apos;t wait to come back!!!

COVID NOTE: Everything felt very safe as the tents had plenty of ventilation and air. There were also heaters. It was 30Â° though when we went so definitely recommend wearing a warm jacket and warm shoes if possible!! 

My boyfriend and I had the:

Apps-
Coccoli
Minestrone soup 
Grilled octopus 

Entrees-
orecchiette sausage pasta
Margarita pizza 

Dessert-
Chocolate gelato cake"
5,"We had an amazing time celebrating our engagement at your restaurant last night.  Micky went over and above to make us feel welcome during our special time.  Amy the server was bubbly and fun, gave us great drink suggestions and provided A+ service to our table of 6.  

Despite sitting outside, the tent setup and heat were done very well.  The atmosphere was fun and inviting!..not closed off and cold.

I hope that they continue to do well during these tough times and even push back against the Mayor and Governor with their egregious rules on what is deemed indoor vs. outdoor dining.

I&apos;m looking forward to going back and trying their Italian dishes soon!   Thanks again Micky and Amy!! BOoOm!"
5,"I really enjoyed my dining experience at Siena Tavern. The patio was beautiful and the food was delicious.
We got cauliflower to share and I got the Brussels sprouts and prosciutto pizza. The pizza was huge (I was able to finish only the half), but delicious. The truffle oil on the pizza made this dish even more unique. 
My boyfriend got orecchiette and he said that was really good too. 
The only negative was how the bathroom was not very clean. The floor was sticky and slippery and the paper towels were all out. At times like this, cleaning is very important so there is room for improvement here."
5,"My dining experience was amazing from the cocktails all the way down to the dessert.  Jorge waited on my party of 6 and he was super attentive as we were celebrating my friend&apos;s birthday.  He made dining outdoors during COVID especially pleasant.  

It&apos;s been a long time since I&apos;ve been out for dinner and every, single person LOVED their food.  We literally were planning for our return to Siena Tavern before we even paid for our meal!  I had the broiled salmon which was cooked to perfection - a slight crispiness on the outside, but each bite melted in my mouth.  I also got to try the prime rib that my friends got and the meat was so juicy and tender, they used their butter knives to cut their meat - They never even used the steak knives that were brought out (that&apos;s what I&apos;ll be ordering next time)!

Also, the butterscotch cheesecake was SUPERB!"
4,"This spot is a must go to when you&apos;re in need of a safe (COVID friendly) night out. The heaters placed on the patio kept my friend and I warm throughout our dinner. It&apos;s hard to find a spot where you don&apos;t need to wear your winter coat, to our surprise we were able to ditch the coats!
We started with the Caccoli which was great, light yet still the perfect appetizer. We also split the truffle pizza (amazingggg) and the carbonara. The waiter serves it table side from a jar, keeping the pasta warm, to your dining plates- wonderful! Everything on the menu is reasonably priced. The wine list is great too!"
4,"I never got around to dining in the restaurant. We ordered via Caviar a couple weeks ago when we were craving something a little snazzy. We got the wagyu meatball, the Orecchiette, the octopus appetizer and the chocolate cake for dessert. 

Everything was really tasty! The Orecchiette was maybe a little on the salty side, but it was a great comforting dish so I didn&apos;t care too much. 

The cake was BOMB, it had gold flakes on it. Except I was confused and didn&apos;t realize it had gelato inside of it, so I put it in the fridge while we were eating dinner and it melted a little. 

The food arrived a little lukewarm, but our apartment is a bit of a drive, so it was understandable. I think I should have reheated a couple things in retrospect, but we were starved!!

One thing I would recommend is that the restaurant put the cheese for the meatball on the side for delivery/pick-up. It melted in by the time we got it and I was v intrigued by its fluffiness in pics for dine-in."
5,"This was such a great experience. The food was delicious, and the service was great. We got the watermelon Feta salad, gnocchi, and truffle pizza. Everything was to die for. I absolutely loved everything I had. 

The watermelon feta salad made me feel like I was at Alinea because the presentation was so beautiful. The honeycomb on the top of the watermelon is the star of that dish. I had never tasted honey like that before (and I&apos;m a snob when it comes to my honey). It was so floral and light, I couldn&apos;t believe it was even honey. The different textures and flavors, everything worked so well together. 

The truffle gnocchi was very good! The truffle flavor wasn&apos;t over powering, and just right. We also got the truffle pizza (our favorite flavor can you tell?) and that was really good too. For some reason I thought it was going to have a red sauce but it didn&apos;t, and the truffle flavor was faint but still there. It was really good. Overall it was a lot of food, and we even took some to go. It was a great experience, and I will DEFINITELY be back soon"
5,Roberto is the best server he&apos;s amazing!! He made my birthday great! I love Roberto love love he&apos;s great order tequilas they are good
5,"Have lived down the street for years from this place and have been several times in past years. Used to go here a lot to meet clients who hung out here, and who became good friends. Some mixed results in the past, and have not been in a few years. Today was great for brunch. Absolutely great service !! Great drinks and great wine servings. Food has a BIG uptick. Wife had the  goat cheese omelet and I had the chicken with rolls in white sauce with some eggs. Prefect. Everything was soooo good today. Can&apos;t beat the location. You should try it. Always lively and fun. City place for city people. Will go back. This is a BIG go."
3,"Came here for brunch on a Saturday and it was busy (even during these COVID times...). Despite this, they did a great job  socially distancing tables, seating people outside with heaters and umbrellas, and putting up plexiglass shields at the indoor bar.  The breakfast skillet was DECADENT, featuring gooey burrata and breadcrumbs.  The goat cheese omelet was also good (my favorite part was the house potatoes that came on the side).  The reason for the 3-star review is the service.  Our server was kind and helpful, but clearly had too many tables to take care of.  It took a long time for our server to take our order, and an even longer time for just our coffee to come out.  We indulged in bottomless mimosas, but also noticed that we had to flag down a server each time we wanted a refill.  Overall, fun atmosphere and decent food, but service not to the standard of comparable restaurants."
