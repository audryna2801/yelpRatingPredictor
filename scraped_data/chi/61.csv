5,"A refreshing family friendly activity and a great way for everyone to take a break from their screens and get some fresh air!

Zoolights looks and feels a little different this year due to the pandemic. You have to buy tickets in advance and can only enter during a very specific time window. You have to wear masks and follow one-way signs around the zoo once you get inside. It is much less crowded than it was in previous years, which is nice but at the same time makes the exhibit feel a little less festive. However, the seal was putting up quite a show amidst the light display during our visit, making the entire experience very memorable. 

We highly recommend going to Zoolights this year, especially if you are stuck in town. The ticket prices are much much cheaper than similar exhibits in the &apos;burbs (even with the parking fee) and are definitely worth every penny."
4,"We love coming every year and it&apos;s part of our holiday traditions. 

This year you have to buy a timed ticket that&apos;s $5 for entry because of COVID (we didn&apos;t mind supporting the zoo but I do hope it goes back to free for everyone to enjoy). We were glad to have something outside and safe to do to get us in in the holiday spirit. The light maze ($3 tickets each) was a nice edition - it wasn&apos;t particular hard or anything but the 3D glasses were fun. It got some laughs our of our group. 

Love all the lights places but maybe they can mix it up a little one year? Some different themed decorated Christmas trees spread throughout? Or a few different staged photo areas?

I&apos;m taking off one star this year because of the lightshow that&apos;s in the middle by the cafe. This year it really seems like they were half-doing it. If it was timed to music it wasn&apos;t done very well and it was all white for the whole thing with no extra things lighting up. I wish they would go back to different themes, I loved the Alice in Wonderland year or when they did more of a Christmas rock music thing."
3,So you pay to enter the park then they ask you to pay extra to enter certain light exhibits?   It felt like a carnival.... how you pay per ride.  Plus there were zero exit signs anywhere it&apos;s 23Â° guys put some exit signs around the park!   Thank God I didn&apos;t have freezing grumpy children with me.  We were going around in circles like an IKEA! Three stars are because the seals were out playing and the bathrooms were incredibly clean!
5,"What a fantastic idea! A huge, beautifully kept zoo decorated with two and a half million lights as a visitor&apos;s oasis that&apos;s free!

We happened to go on a pleasant night that wasn&apos;t too cold. It was busy but not congested. It was easy to navigate at our own pace with ease. 

Ice sculptures, music &amp; light shows, cookie decorating, hot chocolate and Santa Claus! Absolute fun for young and old, it&apos;s very popular for good reason. 

The staff was very helpful and friendly. The snack shop was full of goodies. The gift shop was open with tons of gifts for yourself or others. Some of the animals were out and ready to host the night time visitors too!

Don&apos;t miss the singing port-o-potties!!!"
4,"Zoolights at Lincoln Park zoo has quickly become a favorite after Christmas event. This event is free to enter. There are ways to spend money once inside, there are ways to donate to the event, or you can stroll through without spending anything - it&apos;s up to you to decide.

The lights are spectacular! So well done and impressive. Several of the attractions are open and the staff is standing by to answer questions and tell you a little more about the animals. I&apos;m always impressed by Lincoln Park zoo. It&apos;s such an important part of our community.

This event can get crowded. One year we went the Saturday after new years and there were lots of strollers making it a bit difficult to work your way through the displays. This year we went the Thursday after new years and it was a bit less crowded.

Looking forward to next year!"
5,"Went here with my family and had a blast! Zoolights is free so you can&apos;t really go wrong! It can get pretty crowded and somewhat difficult to navigate if you&apos;re not familiar with the area, but there&apos;s interesting things in every corner! The ice sculpting was super interesting and the cookies &amp; cream hot chocolate was wonderful!

Definitely a new holiday tradition!"
5,"Such a magical thing to do with family or friends! The zoo does an excellent job decorating all the grounds.  So many adorable light animals and of course the light show in the middle set to music is always wonderful. This year they added a ton of hanging monkeys that were SO cute!

Some things to note - if you want to beat the crowds, the zoo offers a bunch of ticketed nighttime events that are fantastic. My favorite is BrewLights. A bunch of breweries set up throughout the zoo and you get to taste all the different beer, see the animals, go on the carousel, even visit Santa! Another ticketed event is a really great market with vendors selling an array of goods that are great holiday gifts. Tried the holiday market this year and it was so fun and a manageable crowd."
5,"25 Year&apos;s and going Strong!! Lions,Tiger&apos;s and Bears.....On My.....Lighted Lion&apos;s, Tiger&apos;s and Bear&apos;s even better!! 
Oooooooh Yesssssssss!! 
Sweet Home Chicago......
Love the City and lite up Monkeys in the Tree&apos;s and so much more here......Helicopters overhead and TV News Channels broadcasting the Festivities both from the Air and on the Ground......Kid&apos;s frolicking around and sound&apos;s of little girl&apos;s and boy&apos;s shouting &quot;Ooooh n Ahhhh&quot;!!
The glow of the happy faces and busyness of the crowd hustling about to see and hear the Zoo all lite up and Christmas music coming from all around the Zoo grounds....
Even the Musical Port-O John&apos;s doing their part to bring Humor and Happiness as spectators walked past.....The Ice Sculpturer dazzling the audience with his chainsaw making a Crystallized Character from a solid piece of Ice.....Such a Delight to see it live and have the Christmas Spirit flow throughout the whole Zoo!! 
Having the sounds of the season match the Spectacular view&apos;s makes it more the Magical......
Ho^Ho^Ho and away we go....
MERRY CHRISTMAS EVERYONE AND PEACE,LOVE N JOY FILL YOUR LIFE FOR NOW AND ALWAYS!!"
5,"Pretty lights .... aaaand a whole f ton of people. Free admission on non event days. My husband and I were lucky enough to visit Zoolights on the first &quot;real&quot; snow of the year. Zoolights is sure to bring some light to your day.

My favorite thing to do here is stand in the center area and just STARE. They are just lights but the Holidays aren&apos;t the Holidays without bright, blinking, bulbs. A lot of the sections have timed songs, where the lights  work with the song. 

Downside is that this is Chicago and people flood through attractions, like this. There are &quot;less crowded&quot; parts of Zoolights that you can get to! I know that when we went to the Kids Farm area to see the lone wolf, there was almost no one there.

Zoolights is a fun, free, and Holiday themed activity. Stay warm with some mulled wine and Christmas cheer. Tis the season!"
5,"I love Lincoln Park Zoo, and zoo lights is one of my favorite events of holiday season, starting around Thanksgiving each year, running through January 1. 
We&apos;ve brought friends and family from out of town a few times and everyone loves it.

Admission continues to be free, and even if you have to pay to park it&apos;s worth it! (Public transportation is convenient yet if you&apos;re driving you can use Spot Hero to find parking cheaper than the zoo lot&apos;s $35 rate or come early and score free parking on the street.) They have hot chocolate and adult beverages and snacks for sale, along with nice exhibits. It does get crowded so you have to have patience...especially for all the strollers which take up the walkways...

But if you&apos;re dressed warm and have that patience, come and take a stroll through the entire zoo and soak up the beautiful lights, the sounds of carolers and kids expressing their delight.  Really amplifies the spirit of the season!"
4,"Fun family event that is free in Chicago.

Went Saturday night of the last weekend. Busy yet not overly crowded. Temperature was in the mid 40s, so no snow on the ground, which I am sure would make the displays even more spectacular.

Ice carving demonstration was captivating.

Terrific spot for our out-of-town guests to experience another of the many marvels of Chicago."
5,"My friend &amp; I went to the brew lights event this past winter. It was absolutely freezing but still a blast!! 

They had such an awesome set up with the lights, it was really beautiful. They offered different things to do: the light show, the light maze, indoor section with live music, and ice sculpture shaving! The merry go round was up &amp; running which was also really fun! They had beer booths set up sporadically throughout the zoo which was convenient. 

Overall, we had a really good time!"
4,"Five stars for the actual displays, indoor exhibits, and overall holiday cheer. Minus one star for operations. 

This was my second time going to Zoolights. Last year it was extremely cold and snowing so it was busy but manageable. Our Uber wasn&apos;t able to get to the entrance so we had to make a bit of a hike from Stockton to the back side of the zoo near the ferris wheel. This year we had to walk from LaSalle because things were backed up down LSD and it would have probably been a literal half hour or more to get near the entrance. If it is even remotely nice (it was low 40s and dry), prepare to have a horrendous time getting there. 

On the snowy night it was a pleasant walk around the grounds and we were able to take it all in from the big choreographed light display in the center of the zoo to the animal houses. Being able to get up so close to the lion was really, really cool and unlike any other zoo I&apos;ve been to. 

This year it was wall-to-wall crowds indoors and out. You had to fight to get anywhere near the glass and the buildings were about a million degrees due to the masses. 

One of my main issues this year was the bathroom situation. Most of the bathrooms in the zoo are in the basements of the buildings, and lines wrapped up the stairs and out the door at every restroom I could find. Eventually we stumbled upon a couple of port-a-potties, and the lines for that were 10+ deep as well. I couldn&apos;t wait any longer so I went through the line, but the john I got was one of the grossest I&apos;ve ever encountered due to a lack of lighting. Glad I brought my phone in otherwise I would have sat in a puddle. For comparison, it was about five times worse than any music festival I&apos;ve been to in the last ten years where people drink all day long. 

All in all it&apos;s pretty magical, but you should probably avoid weekends and nice nights for maximum enjoyment."
5,"One of the best seasonal, FREE holiday attractions to see in Chicago! It&apos;s open for quite a long time, for much of December and January. The animals are transported somewhere else due to the bitter cold, but there are some nocturnal animals who might peek their head out.

The lights are phenomenal. The only other lights that you can walk through and explore are a global touring light show I believe called Winter Wonderland, but others are drive-bys and not things you can get up close and personal with. I appreciate how there are pit stops like the gift shop, cafe (they closed at 8pm when we went on a weekday), and restrooms that were heated so we could get some warmth before we would power walk to the next exhibit. Dress warmly (it was about 5F when we went), and you can park for free on the street about a block from the zoo entrance.

Hot chocolate is around $5 at the cafe. It was just a nice evening to stroll with the bf carrying some hot chocolate and looking at the lights. There are some lights that are animated with music in the background. The gift shop has 3D glasses that have different holiday characters that show around any lights."
3,"Two years ago when I went for the first time, I was stunned.... Everything was so beautifully lit up, you could tell some very qualified people put lots of thought and care into it. Last year, there were less lights, but it wasn&apos;t bad. This year, it looks like when you take your leftovers after eating out and  microwave them only to realize you burnt then and they&apos;re no good anymore- to soon it up: bad. 

I guess if it&apos;s sometimes first time going, it&apos;ll look nice, nothing spectacular, but nice. But for me, paying $8 for a cup of hot cocoa while looking at a completely half a**-ed light display in the freezing cold does not sound that appealing. I don&apos;t know what changed over the last three years or if they&apos;re just cheaping out, but there are houses with prettier lights in neighborhoods that people could look at. 

Definitely planning on giving another chance next year, but if it gets worse it stays the same, there won&apos;t be another! 

That being said, the actual zoo looks great and you can tell they put in time and effort you make sure it stays clean. You can still see lots of animals indoors, like apes and reptiles and snakes and some fish, and even though they&apos;re all sleeping, it is so nice to get to see them while warming up indoors from the cold, cold weather outside. The main cafeteria still served some foods at night and baked snacks and goodies. They have some drinks like spiced wine and spiked cocoa, and for the people that don&apos;t drink they have some amazing Peppermint hot chocolate and a couple other drinks. 

All in all, great experience, lacking in lights (they have less year after year- they didn&apos;t even put proper lights on the dancing trees this year!!) Good for kids and couples and first timers for sure! Definitely need to up their game for people who&apos;ve been coming for years though!"
3,"Pros: free zoo holiday light experience 

Cons: parent pushing their 9-year-olds in double-baby-carts that consume two-thirds of the walkway. Every 11th person posing in front of some lights while expecting to hold up foot traffic for the next few minutes while they angle for the perfect Instagram photo. (Fun game to play; photobomb every single impromptu photo session you see.)

There are a few amusements where you need to purchase a ticket. Tickets are $3.00.

And there is no parking as the local Alderman, can&apos;t figure it out. There&apos;s free parking, but it&apos;s mostly suburban vehicles that are parked for weeks at a time, so you won&apos;t get that. Then there&apos;s RPP liberally installed throughout the neighborhood, so the poor residents with $800k condos, with three underground parking spaces, can still park on their reserved street spot. So there&apos;s about 100 metered parking spots and a lot that charges $26.

Cool free Zoolights, but you&apos;ll pay in other ways."
4,"A zoo filled with Xmas lights and Singing porta potties otherwise known as Jingle John what more can you ask for. Also no cover!! 

It seems like every year they have more lights put up and since it&apos;s the zoo you can also see some animals indoor. A help when the weather is especially cold. Highly recommend you visit this place BUT be prepared to struggle for street parking. 

So why 4 and not 5 stars. That&apos;s because in the past the main draw by the park pavilion had dancing lights time to music was much better. It simply bedazzled it felt magical. Now it&apos;s just nice. Granted if you&apos;ve never seen it before it&apos;s fine problem is I have.

I apologize for beginning to sound like a jaded Chicagoan."
5,"This is a special place and wonderful entertainment during December in the city. If you read some of the other reviews you&apos;ll see this attraction gets marked down often because of the crowds...but the crowds are what tell you it is a draw for thousands each day. Yes, parking is a problem as always but this is good stuff. Don&apos;t miss one of the benefits of living in a large and wide open city like Chicago. 

This totally FREE exhibition is thousands and thousands of light displays throughout the zoo grounds, lighting up the evening. Just as the zoo is free, all the light exhibits are free. You simply stroll through the grounds and soak up the visual treats. Most of the zoo houses are also open...and many of the animals are on display and ready to delight the crowds (although some of the animals may be sleeping)...and the buildings are also a good place to warm up between walks.

Also included (but at a reasonable price) are a number of fair-type rides...we went on the Ferris Wheel but skipped the Carousel and the light maze...either way these inexpensive rides and attractions are fun for the kids and gives them a change of pace if they get tired just walking. There are a few food vendors on the grounds selling pretzels and popcorn and the like, and there is a beer dispenser for those that are thirsty. 

The porta-potties get janky over the evening, but all-in-all this light event is a treat. Come around 4 pm - just before it is dark - to make finding parking easier, and come on a weekday to avoid some of the crowds. We showed up around 3:30 pm and had an early dinner a block or so away at R.J. Grunts and then walked over...easy way to accomplish two things...had a meal and had found street parking before it got busy. 

Do this!"
4,"Overall, it was a nice experience. I love that it is free too. The zoo is covered in lights throughout and there is a small light show to christmas songs every few minutes. You can also see santa, ride a train, ride the ferris wheel, or go on the merygoround. I went on the weekend so it was quite packed with families and young kids running around. Throughout the zoo you could purchase hot drinks and very over priced beer. I was expecting to see more animals as we didn&apos;t go too late at night and to even hear some more music. The place was also quite confusing and hard to find our way out of there. It is still a nice experience to do especially if you have a family just be sure to bundle up."
5,"&quot;A free zoo in the city?&quot;  

I will start the review with four (4) stars, without a doubt.

&quot;How about a free zoo with festive Christmas lights?&quot;  

I don&apos;t care what other people say.  I will automatically render my five (5) stars!  

I didn&apos;t make it to the zoolights last Christmas, so I couldn&apos;t give my heart, Lincoln Park Zoo.  But this year, I won&apos;t shed a tear because I&apos;m here with hubby on a snowy day, walking around, visiting a ton of pokestops, and catching some pokemons.  

Speaking of PokÃ©mons, two (2) high-CP Pinsir door guards were here to greet us at the Webster/Lincoln Park Way entrance (as of 12/04/2016, it has been a Pinsir&apos;s nest).  In addition to all the light decorations throughout the place, the majority of zoo was actually open.  We went to the Lion House, the Primate House, the Reptile House, and the African House.  Just in case you need to take a break from walking or escape the cold, head to one of the indoor exhibitions.  I saw a few guests who were drying their socks and shoes in the Reptile House.  

The &quot;Santa&apos;s Photo Booth&quot; can be found inside the Primate House.  

Restrooms are located inside the Lion House, with &quot;men&quot; and &quot;women&quot; on the opposite side, respectively.  I know the cafe has restrooms available as well.  

The Ferris Wheel wasn&apos;t open, but I did snap a picture of it.  The &quot;candy cane&quot; corridor appeared to be a popular destination for photo-taking, so I would recommend all of you to be aware of the people in front of you who suddenly stop and pull out their cameras or phones.  

Hubby and I had great fun and enjoyed our night out together.  Although parking is available by the Lakeshore east entrance, I strongly suggest the use of public transportation.  I know CTA #130 and #151 have a stop at their west-end entrance.  One can also utilize #22 (Clark) bus, or walk approximately fifteen (15) to twenty (20) minutes to the CTA Fullerton Brown/Red/Purple Line station."
