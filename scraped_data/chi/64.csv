5,"Wowwww cant believe i waited so long to try this place. Tried biscuits, quiche and and tomato pot pie. Everything was 10/10. All the flavors were so amazing. The biscuits were soft and fluffy. The pot pie was another favorite with an flaky crust. 

Their covid precautions were very good and safe. Would def come back next time in town."
5,Most amazing pies and biscuits I have ever had. I love how they follow all covid regulations while providing the most delicious treats. I had the cheeseburger hand pie and I have been thinking about it so much just waiting to be able to enjoy it agai.
5,"I came to a friend of mine, who I consider to be a pie connoisseur, for a Thanksgiving pie recommendation.  Without hesitation, he said Bang Bang Pie.  During these COVID times, pickup orders are only available on Friday.  I emailed the catering team to see if they could make an exception for a Saturday pickup.  They were extremely responsive and accommodating, so I ordered half a chocolate pecan pie online and prayed that a whole apple pie (which was sold out online) would be available on Saturday for an a la carte purchase.  After waiting in line for about an hour to pick up my pre-purchased pie, I was able to grab an apple pie too.  It was a long wait, but I cannot express how worth the wait it was.  Both pies were INSANELY delicious.  They were the best pies any of us have ever eaten.

So, for Christmas, there was no question we were ordering from Bang Bang Pie again--long wait or not.  When I went online, I was disappointed to see that the Apple Caramel Crisp was sold out.  I agonized over what to order instead and went with the Maple Gooey Butter pie.  We cut into the pie on Christmas Eve.  It was very unassuming--not at all the pie I would choose if I saw it displayed in a case.

But there are no words to adequately praise the Maple Gooey Butter pie.  It had me thinking, &quot;apple what?&quot;  I&apos;m so glad we ordered it.

To summarize, Bang Bang Pie is amazing, no matter which pie you&apos;re dealt.  I am committed to them for all of my future pie needs."
5,"I came here yesterday and tried the biscuits. I cannot put into words how good these biscuits are. These are  hands down the best I&apos;ve ever had in life and my grandma is from down south. 

Customer service here is also awesome. Really appreciated the friendliness and hospitality. Will be back next time I&apos;m in town!"
2,"Ordered half a VEGGIE quiche. Looked good, smelled good while cooking, but...absolutely NO VEGGIES in it. Just a plain quiche with nothing added, which is not what I ordered (or paid for) or expected. Plain quiche is not my thing. If you&apos;re going to call it a veggie quiche, add at least one veggie, please."
5,"Homemade biscuits, chicken pot pies... you can&apos;t go wrong with Bang Bangs brunch. It&apos;s a neighborhood favorite of ours!"
5,"It sadly took my husband and me WAY TOO LONG to make it to Bang Bang. The reason: I falsely ONLY knew it as a PIE shop. While this is true, it only qualifies half of its deliciousness: biscuits, quiche, and other savory foods are specialities of Bang Bang as well...and what keeps us coming back!

One weekend morning, we wanted to bring an impressive dessert to a dinner party, so I looked up how early Bang Bang opened. To my surprise, it was open early AND IT HAD AMAZING BISCUIT BREAKFASTS!

Needless to say, we got our buns out the door to go gobble down some scrumptious fluffy/flakey housemate biscuits and house coffee. Oh, and get the hazelnut chocolate cream pie for dinner (yes, the pie was as FABULOUS as it sounds and our dinner guests were VERY impressed)!

The staff was super friendly and helpful when we came in, helping us problem solve delivery/chilling logistics between the pickup time and the actual party. They also gave helpful recommendations for new-timers!

I have now gotten several biscuit sandwiches for breakfast, and the housemate sausage biscuit is definitely my savory/flavorful delight/favorite. The bacon is also delicious. And if you are looking for a lighter fair, the farmhouse biscuit has a delicious chive spread along with a hearty and delicious mixed green salads! A great way to start the weekend!

We try to arrive before 9:45am on weekends, and that almost always guarantees seating. But, come later (especially during warmer weather), and be prepared for a line/wait!

Prices are a bit much, but for the high quality and demand, I get it!

After years of missing out, Bang Bang Pie and BISCUIT company is now on our regular breakfast/brunch rotation. We recommend it be on yours as well!"
5,We received a gift from our realtor with the buscuit mix for Christmas. Why we waited so long to try them I have no clue. These buscuits were amazing! We had them for dinner and made breakfast buscuits the next day. Hands down the best buscuits I&apos;ve ever had. I looked up the company and I didn&apos;t see that shipping was offered out of state. So I literally sent them an email letting them know how delicious their buscuits were and if they would ship out of state. I got a reply immediately and they were willing to ship out of state so we will have more buscuits soon! Great food and great service even from far away.
4,"What&apos;s better than a shop selling multiple scrumptious varieties of pie? A pie shop that also sells biscuits!

I stopped by recently in the late afternoon in search for a small bite to eat and a piece of pie to pick up before I flew home to the Bay Area. And Bang Bang didn&apos;t disappoint. While a tad pricey sight unseen, the sausage biscuit ($8) came with a good-sized patty, a ginormous dollop of pimento cheese, and a tasty biscuit that managed to be sufficiently fluffy and dense at the same time. 

A slice of buttermilk pie held up well into the evening despite the fact that I&apos;d carried and jostled it around all afternoon long. The buttermilk custard was irresistible, while there were added dashes of flavor in the form of orange, ginger, and cranberries.

Service is friendly and fast, and despite the small venue, this is a generally a quick in-and-out affair where everyone sits at communal tables and doesn&apos;t linger too long. Thanks Yelpers for a great find!"
5,"Amazing biscuits and pie!! We got the biscuits and gravy with added sausage and a slice of banana cream pie. All of the food was delicious and the coffee was unexpectedly great too.

I&apos;m not usually a fan of biscuits and gravy but the one here is so good!! The biscuit is moist and buttery and the gravy has good flavor and spice. The banana cream pie was also great, it had the right amount of sweetness and the crust was surprisingly tasty too. 

I&apos;m really impressed by the food I can&apos;t wait to come back for more! I&apos;m highly considering buying the biscuit mix so I can make them at home haha."
5,"I wish I lived closer to this place - I would honestly come here every day if I could.  Their pies are worth the hype! 

My friends and I shared the pumpkin cheesecake and honey custard.  My personal favorite of the two was definitely the pumpkin cheesecake.  We also got apple cider as well and sat outside on the picnic tables.  

Still have yet to try the biscuits but from what I saw in store, they look big and delicious. Can&apos;t wait to be back!"
5,"We&apos;ve been to Bang Bang Pie Shop a few times now. It&apos;s a nice casual place for a delicious and quick meal. Don&apos;t be intimidated by the line. It moves fast. The cashiers are almost always fun, friendly, and helpful. 

Order and pay at the register, take a number and find a seat. Outdoor seating is spacious and good for kids. Indoor seating is limited so if it&apos;s cold out, make sure to plan accordingly. Come early or go at a slightly off time, if you&apos;re with a larger group. Bus your own table when you&apos;re done eating. 

Last week, I had the chicken pot pie. It was delicious! Often, I am disappointed by chicken pot pie, but this was one of the best I&apos;ve had. The pastry crust was flavorful and flaky. Not dry. And the filling had a nice consistency and was perfectly rich. We&apos;ll probably come back to pick up some chicken pot pies to freeze for the winter. And my boyfriend wants to do a taste comparison between the chicken pot pie and Hoosier Mama&apos;s, which we also love. They&apos;re different, but both great. 

We also always get a slice of pie for dessert and those never disappoint! This past time we got the Cocoa Mint and I was floored by how good it was! The mint had a nice flavor and wasn&apos;t overpowering. The cocoa and mint were also well balanced. I could&apos;ve eaten a whole second slice! It was so good, I think I&apos;ll have to get a slice every time I come (assuming they have it)!"
5,"this place is what dreams are made of.
&amp; they make amazing dreams here.

i highly recommend to try everything if you can.

a great place to start is the pot pie, or even the potatoes.
everything is cooked &amp; baked to perfection.
not a single complaint or change i can think of to make to the menu.

*******get here earlier than you expect to, the inside of the building is small, &amp; this place is always a minimum of 10 minutes to wait to order. as they are immensely popular &amp; there is always a line out the door!*******"
5,"Absolutely delicious. I make it a point to bring out of town visitors here, whenever I&apos;m able. 
Their apple pie is OUT OF THIS WORLD. 
Check them out of Instagram. I went there with my boyfriend after seeing their Instagram story offer - BOGO. We got two apple pies for the price of one. 
I think they do special offers frequently but you only learn about them through their social. 
A must go place!"
5,"Naturally, I went with the Blueberry Pistachio Sweet Pie because there&apos;s pistachio in it. 
As divine as the slice looked with dripping blueberry sauce with actual blueberries in it and the light green pistachio cream, the pie was DELICIOUS. The pistachio flavor was subtle but present in the most natural way; it complimented the fresh blueberry sauce perfectly.

I also loved how buttery and well-balanced the graham cracker crust was. It was packed to the right density to hold everything together but not make cutting into the pie a huge mess. 

I wish it was acceptable to eat more than one slice of pie in one sitting!!

The staffs were all super friendly and attentive, giving a lively vibe throughout the store."
5,"Ambiance/Service
Its a very convenient grab to go or sit down spot. There are plenty of seats outside and inside to sit. I imagine summer to be a great time to just chill out here and eat a pie. A little of a late review as I came here in mid May and it was quite cold at that time, so I don&apos;t imagine the seats packed outside during the colder months of the year.

Food
First off, they&apos;re home made hot sauce is AHMAZING. Maybe I completely overdosed on it, but if I wasn&apos;t travelling with just a carry on, I would&apos;ve totally purchased a bottle to go. I topped it on both the scratch biscuit and the chicken pie -- the hot sauce is what really made it all for me!"
5,Each pie is incredible and their biscuits and gravy is my favorite breakfast. I&apos;ve consistently had the best experiences here. Highly recommend.
3,"I&apos;ve only tried the pies but it&apos;s definitely a hit or a miss. Key lime pie is my favorite. Sorbet pie was great too and I&apos;d recommend those two! We were so excited to pick up our pie for Christmas. We decided to try the maple gooey butter pie. The name is very misleading, not gooey  at all, the exact opposite actually super dry. For the price it was very disappointing because it tasted like a dry Sara Lee pound cake."
5,Charming little shop. A lot of seating out back for warm weather. The pies are great. Their breakfast biscuits with bacon &amp; eggs is delicious. I especially love that you can buy a pie made up of slices of all their other pie so you get to taste everything when you bring it to your gathering! I also love that you can just buy one piece if that&apos;s all you need. Attached is a picture from when I bought a Thanksgiving pie and picked it up from the truck out front of the shop.
5,"I hadn&apos;t come to bang bang in a while , but I had been here many times in the past. The menu had changed since the last time I came , which I was super excited about! I didn&apos;t get pie this time around (however I absolutely recommend getting a slice of you&apos;re stopping by). 
I got the sausage biscuit - the biscuits as always were amazing . I was disappointed in myself for not reading the menu more carefully as I didn&apos;t realize there was no egg! (The eggs are a most for any of their sandwiches). The sandwich was delicious regardless of the lack of egg. 
The atmosphere is cute , during the weekends when it&apos;s super busy it can be challenging to find a spot in doors fo sit , however the outdoor space has ample amount of seating . The staff is friendly. 
Will definitely be coming back- this time for the egg!"
