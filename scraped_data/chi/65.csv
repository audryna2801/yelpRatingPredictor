5,"Had a great time. They are doing their best with the circumstances and the limitations they have to face. They were able to provide us with an amazing service, great food and amazing energy. The staff checked in on us non stop to make sure we were ok. We did not have to wait for refills, or on anything we ran out of. Make sure you bring a light jacket because it is chilly in the out door in door eating area."
5,"A great dine in experience and also a great take out experience! 

We were craving a Brazilian streakhouse a few months ago (and always), and decided to randomly come here. We made a reservation. The  staff members practiced covid preventative measures (hand sanitizer, masks, salad bar was served by staff only, tables were spaced out appropriately). We were there for around an hour and never during that time, did I feel uneasy.

The food was worldly. I also haven&apos;t been to many Brazilian steakhouses, so I have nothing to compare it to. I&apos;m not a picky eater, but I know delicious food when I see it! I ordered the main food package, and tried everything that was offered (encourage you to do that same! It&apos;s part of the experience)! Pro tip: don&apos;t fill up right away on the salad bar no matter how tempting it is! I have to admit that I had major FOMO with the salad bar, too many good things. The name of the game is: PACE YOURSELF.

We were asked by a number of managers and servers if we needed anything extra. All the staff members worked together to accommodate the front of house. Service was memorable and fun!

Lastly, we ordered here for Thanksgiving (because everywhere else was sold out and I refused to cook thanksgiving this year). They did a traditional Thanksgiving and it was perfect! Lots of food, family style. Easy pick up and heating instructions. 

I would highly recommend this place for a family gatherings, or a romantic date (if you don&apos;t might waddling out)!"
5,"We have been regulars at Fogo for some years now. I must say, during this pandemic Fogo has really SHINED! Brian was the absolute best in professionalism, kindness, thoughtfulness and customer service! And kudos to the chefs, cooks, and all staff who assisted to make the take out orders as exquisite as they did. My take out was AMAZING!"
5,"Such an amazing experience! The whole staff is very attentive and very prompt. I was impressed by such a great selection of perfectly cooked meats, side dishes are great and the salad bar is the best I&apos;ve ever had. 
The salad bar alone would be worth the price of the whole dinner. 
No doubts! I would recommend for any meat lovers!"
4,"I&apos;ve been to this Fogo De Chao location a few times now and have always had a great experience. I did on this visit for the most part. The only issue was my table had to ask for lamb to be served literally 8 times and each time we were told it was coming right up. It actually came out at the very end of dinner and everyone was tapped out and full so we didn&apos;t get to enjoy it much (it was all my guests first visit to the restaurant). That&apos;d be the only complaint of my experience.

I will say however I love how Fogo adapted during the pandemic and the heated tent was still a nice experience. It was my birthday and I was served a beautiful and DELICIOUS cheesecake with a &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; message. All in all, I understand the transition of things and how some things are a bit more challenging due to circumstances and that it why I&apos;m not being harsh or too critical."
2,"Times are crazy, understandable however this Fogo location has been known for their food and service.
Now as they are seating outside in the tent... you will not get the full experience. If you can wait for indoors, I highly recommend it as I won&apos;t be back either.
They are not serving liquor as it is across the street. Understandable however this should be mentioned during reservations!! Not only is there no liquor, you do not have access to the whole salad bar. I asked our server and even a manager for a few things, said OK we will bring it out only to wait 15+ minutes for them to say it&apos;s not available. Once again this should be mentioned at THE BEGINNING. So many people come just to enjoy the bar &amp; no meats. 
Also, this place was packed... over packed causing somewhat decent service from servers. Our server himself managed to have us waiting over 25 minutes... no drinks, no meats .. we were waiting for plates as I had to wave at another manager. Super unorganized, sloppy for Fogo. I was upset as I come here every few months &amp; I was finally back with a few friends and disappointed. 
Not all meats will also be available. Keep in mind coming to this location if it&apos;s your first time, wait it out for indoor dining or go to rosemont!"
3,"I was just I was disappointed with the food however the server Patty made our experience great!!!
Good servers go along way good job"
4,"Tough review to put a handle on. Difficult to give them an accurate assessment during these unique times.

That being said there was some good and some well, not so good.

Dining occurs in a tent across the street from the street in a parking lot. Well lit, heated and rather comfortable. Do not understand (and I am not blaming them) how this is &quot;safer&quot; dining than eating in the restaurant as it is an enclosed tent?

Meats during the initial part of our visit was rather good. Staff was hustling, if a bit uncoordinated.

Missed out on the &quot;market table&quot; part of the experience. Slightly shocked their Brazilian stew they touted on the website was no where to be had.

After checking them out online I was deluged by Instagram and Facebook sponsored posts on my timelines. Was looking forward to the Porterhouse they teased me with. No available?

Menu lacked variety, lots of sirloin, no fish. Pork ribs were inedible. Just not meat on the bone really. Two chickens were too similar. 

Biggest disappointment? No liquor service. I get it, permitting/the city. But why wait to tell me this until I walk in the door?  Would have gladly grabbed a bottle from my cellar, particularly since it was a special occasion (Christmas dinner). Big let down.

Staff did nice work with safety protocols, service was bit disjointed. Enthusiastic, but reminded me of dining in a hotel with banquet waiters trying to do &quot;restaurant style&quot; service for a holiday.

Would I go back? Yes but only when they reopen indoors."
5,My favorite place to go . The meats are amazing and the salad bar I could eat it without the meat. The fried plantains are are my favorite.
5,"When I say the whole experience was amazing! I&apos;ve never been in restaurant like this and I loved every bit of it. 

The food was really fresh! The bottle of wine was amazing! and the waiter was very attentive!  I loved every bit of it! I will def be back again! If you are in Chicago you need to check them out!"
3,"OK, so let me start by saying that if you&apos;re not in Chicago, Fogo might be the best churrascaria you can get. I used to go to the Boston location with my wife all the time, and we loved it. But when we moved to Chicago, we found that there are better options here - simply better-quality food. I guess we didn&apos;t love Fogo specifically, we just loved the idea of unlimited meat. 

I repeat - Fogo is great, just hard to compete in the exceptional Chicago market."
5,We had an amazing experience! The food was amazing and the service. Carlos was the best! He took care of us and made our first experience delightful. We will be back for sure.
4,"Really cool experience, well executed. All of the food is delicious and the service is great - Omar was a phenomenal waiter."
5,"We chose this Steak House to celebrate my fiancé birthday and I&apos;m so glad we did. The food is amazing! The staff, including a the manager was so professional and friendly. It&apos;s clean and the atmosphere is inviting. I can&apos;t wait to go back!"
5,We had such an amazing time. The service was spectacular. Valmor took care is us like superstars! His energy was amazing and his service like no other.
4,"Went there for weekday lunch buffet during covid. It was a very delightful experience. 


First i had to say it is hard to find a place that offers all-you-can-eat during covid. And it&apos;s nearly impossible to find a buffet that provides enough safety health caution during covid. But food de chao made it.


The salad bar/ market table requires customers to wear masks. You can visit as many times as you like but there&apos;ll be a server who will pick up the veggies/fruits that you want. No one else is allowed to touch the serving plates. Plus, same variety (cheese, salad, veggies, and fruits) as pre-covid.


The meat selection is also huge. Always tender and juicy! Like pre covid, the servers take turns to bring the meat to your table. The only complaint I have is that they&apos;d skip your table if you have dined for a long time and then you have to request for a certain type of meat. But the servers are friendly and helpful.


I really like this place and I was worried about it going out of business because of the quarantine. However, for Friday lunch, the place is half filled up and looks busy (also a small tip that if you want to avoid the crowd, visit on Monday- Thur).

Lastly, I feel safe and comfortable dining in. The restaurant really takes buffet to a new level during covid. I&apos;ll visit again, but please don&apos;t skip my table:)"
5,"Wow. The service here is amazing. I think it&apos;s because it&apos;s pretty open and they can see everything. I always had a fresh plate. The candied bacon was amazing. I ate so much (⁎⁍⁍⁎) but it&apos;s hard to grab a small amount because the sugars make them stick together. 

The filet mignon was so good! At first it was a little too well done but the guy&apos;s voice is so seductive and when he came back he was like &quot;don&apos;t hold back&quot; lol. Then he plopped two large pieces. Those were great. When they say medium, it&apos;s medium not leaning rare. The ribs were good but they don&apos;t fall off the bone so I ditched the fork and used my hands. It had good flavor. The skin was kind of crispy. The lamb chops also don&apos;t smell as bad as other places. (I don&apos;t really like lamb chops so this is a compliment.)

Seating filled up pretty quickly for brunch. Their waffles were even amazing. I really liked the house special (aka salted goodness) and the filet. The rib eye was pretty fatty so not my favorite. The cheesy bread was good and the bananas were great. I like that they ask you what sides you want because I hate wasting mashed potatoes because no one at the table eats it. The fruit was also pretty good. The papayas were ripe. The pineapples were kind of hit or miss. Grilled cheese was interesting. It&apos;s like the taste of stringed cheese but warm and you can&apos;t rip it apart. 

Also, this is random but everyone smelled good, granted it was the beginning of the day. But they didn&apos;t smell like grease. I will return soon."
1,"Upon arrival we were seated in the corner. It was socially distanced.  We felt safe dining indoors. 

The service was really slow. We did the AYCE. 

At first we were served 3 meats. 

We requested more. 

But after 15 mins we haven&apos;t seen any service. We looked around and other tables were looking around waiting for their rounds of meats. 

Our server would forget to bring out our requested items like corn and beverages. Our server had dropped several items from the tray onto our table. I would suggest letting your servers have a cart or serve safely and more efficient. 

We were offered half of the items that were on the menu. 

Some meats came out and it was the same items over and over again. 

What happened to the other 7 items that were listed???

Super disappointed for $160 for two. 

Would never come back again.  It was such a waste of money."
5,"It was my first ever coming here, I must say that the service was very friendly and accommodating with everything. The food..... really delicious cuts of meat. From start to finish the food was excellent. You have all the staff with different cuts of meat come by and offer a slice of steak, or chicken, etc. I was so full by the end that I could barely finish dessert. I would definitely recommend to try it out. The food and experience are worth checking out. I would recommend arriving early if you have a reservation since parking may be a bit tough to find. There&apos;s parking outside and a parking garage nearby the downtown location."
5,"Such a great experience!
We decided to try something different for Thanksgiving. We have seen this place in Miami as well but we never visited. 
We made the reservation in the morning for 7:15PM. As expected the place was packed! We were a party of 5 (one child included). We waited for about half an hour to be seated. 
As soon as we sat the waitress came and took our orders (drinks and sides). 
Even though the place was Super Busy the attention was great! The manager approached our table and others to make sure everything was running fine.
The experience was awesome, highly recommend it!!!
The only flaw- salad bar was very small and the restrooms were very poor maintained (they should have someone to check and verify the condition of the restrooms.
Other than that, the place and experience was awesome"
