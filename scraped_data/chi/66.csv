5,"(Pre-COVID review) 

There are tons of good donut options in Chicago, and while I haven&apos;t tried many, Do-Rite really impressed me. I am a donut lover and Do-Rite lived up to the hype for me!

I came on a Friday morning around 10am, and a lot of the flavors were already sold out. Be sure to come early if you want the best pick. I got a classic old-fashioned and a pistachio lemon doughnut. I had lower expectations for the pistachio lemon given the neutral reviews about it on Yelp, but I absolutely loved it. The pistachio adds so much texture to the donut - absolute perfection. The old-fashioned was also really good. I&apos;d recommend trying both. 

There are 3 rotating flavors of gluten-free donut options, which is awesome. My gluten-free friend hasn&apos;t had donuts in years, and he absolutely loved the donut he had. 

As a FYI, there&apos;s no room for seating inside."
5,"I had some time to spare while waiting for my vehicle to be repaired in-between transferring from train to train, so I visited Do-Rite Donuts &amp; Coffee. I was surprised that it was open because there was a lot of chaos that transpired recently downtown coinciding with protesting. Many businesses windows were boarded up after being subjected to looting as the protesting went on.

I have always had my eye on this particular location because it sits along my bike route on W Randolph Street, and its donut statue always catches my eye after I cross N Dearborn Street. It is wedged in-between a Corner Bakery Cafe, and a Petterino&apos;s, but what sets it apart is its red exterior, the donut statue, and the red outdoor seats. 

For Covid-19 precautions, I had to wait outside of the door while another customer was inside ordering because its inside is confined, and solely used for ordering and pick-up. The location is beneficial to those that are nearby whether it be working, lodging within, or just looking to grab coffee or donuts while walking around downtown Chicago, but I would not count on parking unless it is just for curbside pick-up. 

As for my order, I ordered a cinnamon crunch donut w/ a coffee after briefly contemplating on the buttermilk old fashioned donut which the employee mentioned was a high seller. I did notice the candied maple bacon donut, but my taste buds just did not have any interest in it. 

The cinnamon crunch donut, as well as the coffee did not disappoint! I compare the cinnamon crunch donut taste to an old-fashion plain donut with cinnamon sprinkled all around it. Yum! And it went perfectly with my coffee. 

In closing, I had a pleasant experience at this Do-Rite Donuts &amp; Coffee location; the customer service I received was certainly welcoming and friendly which is all I can ask for. With that, along with its location sitting along my bike route a return is very feasible. In fact, I could easily get used to on-the-go stops to pick up either coffee or a donut to fuel me up on the go.

5,"Do-Rite donuts has THE best gluten free donuts I have ever had. They have a few flavors, every one is amazing. They are big, soft and to-die-for delicious. I don&apos;t let any of my friends come back from the city without bringing me a box."
5,"I&apos;ve been to a couple Do-Rite Donuts and Am Always Happy with the consistency in texture and flavor! We got the usuals, a Michigan Apple fritter, GF Cinnamon/Sugar, and a Vegan Double Chocolate. All Were Fresh and Delicious - My Son *Especially* liked his vegan double chocolate and that&apos;s Amazing to Me!!"
5,"The BEST donuts in the city! I always get a variety to share with family and friends, and favorites are the blueberry, pistachio, and pumpkin (when available). The chicken sandwiches are also fresh, crispy, and flavorful though I do prefer the donuts. Also recently tried the Nutella infused coffee which is delicious and perfect for chocolate lovers/those with a sweet tooth! Great, friendly, and helpful employees too!"
5,"Decided to stop by Do-rite for a quick breakfast before work. In initially stopping, I anticipated grabbing a donut and some coffee and going about my way but, was surprised to see that they have an array of hot breakfast sandwiches and decided to give it a try. After exploring the breakfast sandwich menu, I landed on the avocado sandwich and added chicken sausage, and of course an iced cup of joe was a must! 
I&apos;m unsure why, but I was amazed at how great this breakfast sandwich tasted. The sandwich was served on a soft and warm brioche bun (which was probably my favorite part) with scrambled eggs, cheddar, avocado, chicken sausage (which I added) and... mayo? I&apos;ve never had mayo on a breakfast sandwich but I wasn&apos;t mad at it, and it actually paired well with the rest of the ingredients of the sandwich. All the ingredients were fresh, hot, and had really great flavor! Who knew a place with great donuts would also have even better breakfast sandwiches!? Will definitely be my new go to place for a quick, hot, bite to eat, it should be yours too! Highly recommend, go get your some!"
4,"Donuts for breaky! Ordered from Uber eats and everything so so fresh and tasty! I&apos;m basic and love just cake or original glazed donuts. My kids had the sprinkles and the Cinnamon Toast Crunch donuts which was a hit! Very yeasty and fluffy, soft and full of flavor. The coconut cream and maple bacon was also a favorite! This was also my lunch and breakfast for the next morning. Will definitely order from Do-Rite donuts when we come back into town."
3,"Good donuts, fun flavors. 
They have a few vegan options. 
They were cake type donuts. I got a orange olive oil and a maple chai. 
Both donuts were really good for the first few bites, but then after that they were far too sweet for my liking. 
If you like really sweet donuts this is a good place for your sweet tooth fix. 
Also, there&apos;s no place to sit in here- you order in one small area, however, during the day you can eat in the restaurant next door (I think the restaurant opens at night, so they let e donut customers eat in there by day?). 
Service was friendly and priced were okay. 
Glad I tried this place, but compared to some other amazing donut places in other cities (like voodoo donuts in Portland Oregon) this place wouldn&apos;t be a repeater for me."
4,"Been here a few times now and their donuts are quite good, especially the non-vegan ones. No seating at all inside, though there are some benches you can use outside. 

The most recent time I went we got 4 donuts, a PB&amp;J (grape jam, to my sister&apos;s disappointment - apparently raspberry is a better combo), a blueberry crumb cake (this was my favorite - really good flavor and covered in nice, buttery crumbs - it was recommended by the cashier), vegan orange olive oil (this one was terrible and tasted like baking soda - poor texture, too and a bit dry), and an apple fritter (pretty solid). All the donuts, especially the PB&amp;J and apple fritter, were massive and in total we spent a little over $12. 

In the past I have also tried the maple bacon, valrhona chocolate glazed, and boston cream. I&apos;d say the best out of all the ones I&apos;ve had are the blueberry crumb cake and valrhona chocolate, but to each their own."
5,Omg came here for an old fashioned donut and it was incredible. The coffee was good too! Absolutely worth stopping by on a visit to Chicago!
5,"Dear God, how can you be real? The donuts you spin out are insane. The Samoa nearly caused me to pass out!! Legit good"
5,"FYI: This is pretty much the only branch that does NOT have the fried chicken sammie. :/ Learned that the hard way. 

That said, the donuts were on point! Texture is between Krispy Kreme and cake donuts (Top Pot for you PNWers). Good coffee too!"
5,Great donuts. No espresso coffee but got one right across the street. Highly recommend this place for french and tasty donuts!
4,"Good morning Yelpers!

On our way back to the hotel from breakfast I stumbled upon this small store. Upon entering I met these lovely two employees that greeted us with joy.

I ordered one pistachio lemon doughnut. That was very sweet. I do like the taste of pistachio lol. The batter is dense and soft. Not too soft. 

The chocolate glazed glazed was pretty good. The reason why I say that is because the icing is a rich hint of dark tone flavour. The batter on the other hand was plain with made a great contrast with the rich chocolate. However, the chocolate iced with the normal batter wasn&apos;t as good as the batter flavour did not help offset the rich chocolate. 

Would I return again? Of course I would! When I visit Chicago again I will definitely try it again."
5,"We have a 2-day event at my job, and this is one of the vendors there.

I chose the pistachio lemon......delicious!"
4,"Do-Rite certainly does do it right. Their donuts are reminiscent of an old-school, cheap donut joint. Unfortunately, these donuts are not cheap. $20 for half a dozen? Really? It&apos;d be more understandable if they weren&apos;t your average donut (not a bad thing by the way--average/classic is sometimes best). But I suppose amidst all of the crazy donut shops, people will pay for the classics. That being said, I was willing to pay the price and I&apos;d pay it again because they&apos;re yummy. 

The donuts themselves are perfectly fried and void of that icky, old frying oil taste. They&apos;re fresh, crispy on the outside, and soft on the inside. I&apos;m not from Chicago and I really appreciate the texture/jagged shape of the donuts. Simply put, they&apos;re fun to eat--a different bite each time!

The best ones my husband I tried were the classic old fashioned and the blueberry old fashioned...okay, the cinnamon sugar was amazing too. Aside from the classics, they have other fun creations like a cheesecake-filled. Next time I&apos;m in Chicago, I&apos;ll be stopping here. Yum!"
4,"Scrumptious donuts and a quick stop. If you buy a donut, the coffee is discounted. They even have vegan options for their donuts!

I tried the olive oil orange vegan donut and the maple bacon. Both were soft, fully baked, and excellent.

I don&apos;t have much to say about the coffee since I&apos;m rarely drink coffee. It is &quot;Dark Matter&quot; coffee, which I assume is a nearby local coffee option, but I&apos;m unsure."
5,Their donuts are amazing. The staff is so polite and helpful. The cream cheese danish is my favorite it&apos;s a mix between a glazed donut and cheesecake.
5,"MESSAGE TO ALL FELLOW VEGANS - when traveling to Chicago please be sure to check out Do-Rite Donuts!!! Literally such an amazing experience. It&apos;s very traditional American stand up counter and presents itself in the most humble of ways, yet the doughnut experience was definitely one for the books. They have typical three vegan flavors :

Double Chocolate - which tastes like a scrumptious chocolate cupcake in the form of a donut. AMAZING! 

Olive Oil Orange - which you would think would not taste very good and there you would be very mistaken. This donut was by far my favorite,  it has hints of citrus with a nice powdered cover. So delicious! 

Truly a blessing when stores begin to include some vegan options, especially because we are growing in numbers! Thank you Do-Rite, it is popular so be sure to get there early!"
4,"I really do not know what is all the hype about this place! We were looking for a good donuts place in downtown and stumbled upon this place on Yelp. Great reviews so off we went. It was a little after 11am so we had to order and eat outside in the cold. They stop seating people after 11 apparently because they use the seats of another restaurant. 
Now the donuts were okay, but certainly do not live to the hype we saw on Yelp."
