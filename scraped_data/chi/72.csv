5,"Heard this was a great brunch spot and WOW I&apos;ll definitely be returning. The customer service was outstanding, the employees were so sweet and all COVID Protocols were being followed. 
I ordered the rustic peasant quiche and lentil soup. I don&apos;t even like lentils but this soup was fantastic. Very flavorful. My friend got the honey glazed salmon baguette sandwich which was so great. 
You MUST get a baguette too. They almost melt in your mouth."
5,Came here for the infamous lemon raspberry French toast and it is worth the hype! The soup of the day was roasted poblano soup and had a kick to it but was really good with their fresh bread. The black bean bowl and omelette are really good vegetarian options that fill you up! Service was good as well and they offered sanitizer upon entering and had a good amount of distance between other tables.
5,First restaurant I&apos;ve tried in Chicago. It didn&apos;t disappoint. I&apos;m so happy they have outdoor dining to enjoy the weather. Plus tables are not that close to each other so you can still practice social distancing. The food tasted great. It was a big serving too! So you might wanna think of ordering sides because I&apos;m not sure if you can eat it all.
5,"Always had this to my list if I ever made it out north and my fabulous professor loves this place so she brought me some bread pudding. I feel like it got better after sitting a day as the flavors got to mingle and get to know each other. The bread pudding was good even when it was cold. When I heated it up, it was game over. Loved the fresh fruit added to the syrup and the sweet bread, definitely help balance the heaviness from the sweetness for the bread. It brightened up the dish nicely to allow me to eat the massive portion I one sitting ahaha 

If the dessert was this good I can&apos;t wait to try the rest of the menu!"
3,"Let it be known that, in non COVID times, I love this place!  Like five stars kind of love. Like wait in line for hours to get in kind of love.

However, my sister and I recently ordered delivery, and unfortunately it just wasn&apos;t the same. It took over an hour and a half to arrive which was probably the biggest reason. I got the bliss cakes. Although the peaches were exceptional and the sour cherries were great (delightfully fresh and scrumptious!), the bliss cakes themselves were mushy from being in the takeout container so long and all the mascarpone filling     (My fav part!) had melted down into a liquid and been absorbed - especially by the bottom cake. The top one wasn&apos;t as soaked and with the combination of the crisp oats, I did eat that entire one. 

The bottom line is I can&apos;t wait until this Covid stuff is over and I can go back to the restaurant in person to put the bliss back in bliss cakes."
4,"I&apos;ve been a few more times now and had the chance to try many more menu options, and the food here is creative and good. However, one day I was excited to try a new dish with eggs, soy chorizo, and tomatillo sauce, and they served it to me with no tomatillo sauce. I asked about the tomatillo sauce, and they said they ran out. Now, why did the kitchen serve it anyway? I don&apos;t get it. I was really looking forward to the tomatillo sauce. I ate it anyway, but I was disappointed, and the dish was definitely missing something. 

Can&apos;t go wrong with their French toasts though. So good."
3,"I biked literally over 10 miles to get here, and was it worth it? Meh.  

My friends and I got to try wine poached pears &amp; bostock french toast, drunken stuffed poblano pepper, blackberry bliss cakes, and a side of roasted potatoes. My favorite by far was the blackberry bliss cakes. It was a little too sweet, but the flavors and the oat crust made up for it. The drunken stuffed poblano peppers were also alright. This dish seemed like a good concept, but put on a plate together, the flavors seemed mismatched. This place was extremely hyped for me, so I was also slightly disappointed by how not fresh everything tasted. The french toast tasted dry and stale and the roasted potatoes were not as flavorful as other roasted potatoes I&apos;ve tried. 

The only upside is how cute the restaurant is and how aesthetic the dishes are. The portions are also huge. We shared the 3 dishes between 4 people, and we were stuffed in the end. 

We came in about 30 minutes before closing, and the host was kind of mean about it and discouraged us from being seated. However, there were still a bunch of people who were just seated or just being served. This place is honestly overhyped; there are a ton of better brunch places in chicago forreals."
4,"M Henry was just a breath of fresh air. I had bookmarked it in my brunch spots for ever ever and I am upset that I didn&apos;t go before because it was honestly so so so good. My girls took me out to brunch for my birthday and I was in charge of picking the spot. 
They don&apos;t take reservations and I guess I understand because their patio is small but the down side for patrons is that it can affect wait time. 
The place is nothing of the ordinary but whatever the place lacks, the food makes up for it. They honestly have something for everyone in this menu. If you are vegan, gluten free, a meat eater, vegetarian etc., there is something for you here. And I have to say, that everything is so creative. The food is influenced by so many cultures so I thoroughly appreciated that. I shall return my friend. Until then.

P.S. It&apos;s a BYOB spot. No big deal"
5,"Excellent brunch spot. Tried the eggs Benedict, roasted vegetable and goat cheese quiche as well as the out of this world breakfast bread pudding and all were phenomenal! Highly recommend this place. Will be coming again! 

Edited to add: since our first visit, thus has become one of our to go regular brunch spot! And indeed everything each time has been phenomenal! This last visit had the tomatoes, pesto, goat cheese Benedict which was out of this world! Salmon Benedict, veggie quiche along with fresh toast and hot cakes. Everything was superb! We tried the pineapple upside down cake which was good too and my husband is in love with the marzipans here! Would highly recommend a visit!"
4,"Yummy breakfast! 

After seeing this little neighborhood spot on multiple lists of the best breakfast joints in Chicago, I decided to venture north to check it out for myself. I stopped in for a late breakfast around 10:30 on a Friday morning and there was no wait.

I had the rustic peasant quiche, which was absolutely delicious. It came stuffed with bacon, cheese, asparagus and artichoke, with a generous berry and mixed greens salad on the side. My husband had the special omelet of the day, jerk shrimp-- who knew sweet juicy shrimp would be a good complement to fluffy eggs?! It totally worked.

As our dessert we shared an order of the blackberry bliss pancakes. The pancakes were fluffy but a little dry-- luckily the sauces and abundant fresh berries saved the dish. Service was quick and friendly.

Would definitely recommend if you&apos;re in the area!"
5,"I was very pleased with m.henry during a afternoon brunch. It was very strange seeing a few empty tables due to the virus going around but the good thing was we got a table for 4 in 5 minutes. I started off with a mochachino (hot chocolate &amp; expresso) and saw they had a few specials. I love pancakes, so I was drawn by the souffl√© pancakes and they did not disappoint. They were so delicious with the berries and mascarpone. 
Really good deserts are sold on one side of m.henry for those on the go, staff is very friendly, and the place is cozy. I will definitely be back for another brunch!!!"
3,"Pros:
* Lots of good vegetarian options
* Extensive menu, so many choices
* Seasonal specials sounded delectable 
* Very instagrammable food plating
* Recommended place to eat by friends

Cons: 
- Restaurant is very busy and servers are working at back-breaking pace. Not enough attention paid to customers between ordering and receiving meals (ex: my small water cup was never refilled the entire meal)
- The food did not taste special. We expected the salmon baguette to exceed taste expectations (the description sounded so good), but it just felt like quick to-go food, same with the killer egg sandwich. The tastes were regular, despite beautiful descriptions in the menu. 
- Toast for killer egg sandwich was barely toasted, and minimally warm. You know when bread has that post-toast squish to it? Like it once had a crispiness to it, but now it&apos;s been out and is kinda soft, but not soggy- that was my experience with the sour dough toast on killer egg sandwich. 

Verdict: Might come back here for sweet brunch because the souflees and pancakes all sounded amazing. Will not return for the savory brunches."
5,"Food was great and portion sizes are BIG. We sat in the back outdoor area, it&apos;s very cute!"
5,Always great food and hospitality at M Henry&apos;s . I just got delicious breakfast for nice start of the day. Cheers.
5,"This is a quaint and friendly restaurant that serves a variety of dishes that adhere to a variety of dietary needs (vegetarian, vegan, gf). The staff is incredible welcoming and friendly. The one of my top favorite spots in Chicago!"
4,"Super cute restaurant that offers outdoor seating in their back patio, which is so cozy! There are tables with umbrellas and those without, so you have a choice. There is also some indoor seating as well, but I wouldn&apos;t recommend inside for super larger parties (10+). 

The service was really good. Everyone was nice and attentive. 

I had the bliss pancakes and those were very good! The pancakes on top are light and fluffy! The only thing I am not a fan of is how the pancakes and French toast are like drowned in sauce at the bottom of the plate. It makes them super soggy and I&apos;m not a fan of that. 

My cousin had the French toast, and rates it the same as stated above. 

My partner had the omelet and she said it was really good and shed definitely come back for it.  

My brother had the breakfast sandwich, and thought the flavors were very unique which made it very good compared to other sandwiches he&apos;s had before. 

The potatoes were very good and full of flavor. The bacon and the chicken sausage were also very good quality. 

Also, I believe it&apos;s BYOB. 

I would definitely recommend m.henry! I would definitely come back."
4,Quick stop in tho neighborhood and spotted this breakfast place. It was so delicious and fast.
4,"Came with a group of friends after our original brunch option couldn&apos;t accommodate. The wait was only about 45 minutes, which wasn&apos;t too bad. The place is cute, not overly huge. The staff is nice, but very strict about their policy (fair enough - the whole party must be present before they&apos;ll add your name to the list). The decor reminds me of cute rustic country kitchen.

But let&apos;s get down to the nitty gritty, the food:
Lemon Shrimp &amp; Corn Cake Beneditct - the lemon shrimp and corn cake was delicious. The hollandaise was also very good. The egg was perfection. A good portion of salad also accompanied it, which was nice. 
Out of this World Bread Pudding - this was amazing...great for yourself or for sharing.

TLDR: definitely worth checking out for brunch. Better for small groups (we had 7, but they can accommodate. BOYB (but there&apos;s a store next door/on the corner)"
5,My favorite brunch place.  Great menu and great service.  Be sure to get there early.
3,"Our wait time was less than 5 min for a table of two on a saturday afternoon. It got pretty full within the next half hour. 

- Eggs benedict: the poached eggs and hollandaise sauce was good for a traditional eggs ben., but i really  wished my english muffin was toasted. The toasted muffin wouldve added more warmth and texture. I enjoyed the roasted potatoes that came with for the flavor and crisp.

- side order of  Apple maple chicken sausage. I would not get this again since it didnt satisfy my cravings for sausage ;) Definitely tasted off to me, and i usually look for a good snap on the bite which was missing from all 4 links. 

- lemon~raspberry brioche french toast
I cannot consider this french toast. Each slice (3) was completely  dry  in the center and was barely toasted. There wasnt an ounce of warmth on this dish. I understand the sauce has to be cold but the bread should be toasted. There needs to be some sort of crunch/crisp edge. Ive always preferred a slightly moistened center for french toast and it just wasnt there. 

 Tea Drinks
- hibiscus tea &amp; hibiscus lemonade: both are slightly  sweetened and were refreshing drinks. We both preferred the hibiscus tea. 
- Henry special: unsweetened tea

Service was alright since it was busy. We werent able to get a refill of drinks during the ~25 min wait before our food arrived. After we got our food, i had to flag down our waiter to get refills for the drinks. Our water was never refilled and we only got 1 refill for our teas which we finished before finishing our dishes. Our server  didnt check up on us during the meal.

Will i come again? Yes, but to try other food items. Im hoping the japanese souffle pancake will be available."
