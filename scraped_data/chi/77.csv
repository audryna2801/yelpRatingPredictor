Overall  5

I love Small Cheval!! The burgers are amazing and half the price of Au Cheval, with MUCH less of a wait. They&apos;re consistent on their delivery and pickup orders which has been nice during the pandemic. Definitely my go to place for burgers. I will also say this location has the best fries; not all locations are the same. The fries are some of my favorite French fries in the city. They&apos;re somehow complex for a piece of fried potato. They also have great beer deals, even for pickup/delivery during the pandemic. My boyfriend swears by the aioli sauce here, it&apos;s his favorite!

A must try!"
5,"10/10 such a good burger.  Seriously one of the best that I&apos;ve had in Chicago. Burger is fabulous, their special sauce takes it to another level and the fries just wrap it all up in a delicious package. I didn&apos;t actually get a picture of the burger because we ate them too quickly! 
Only outdoor seating and service is pretty quick. Very small menu but it just means everything they do they do well! Would also be a great takeout option."
5,"Definitely one of the best burgers in Chicago. For the price, I&apos;d say it&apos;s my #1 go-to. If you have lived in Chi for more than a few months and you&apos;re not vegetarian, and you haven&apos;t tried one of these, you should really think about the places you&apos;ve eaten instead. 

Listen, the menu is basic. Burgers &amp; fries. But the burger is so juicy and delicious. The sauces are great too, I&apos;m a big fan of the garlic one. The fries are solid and pair nicely with the burger, though I wouldn&apos;t come here just for those.

Do yourself a favor and try one of these. There are several locations and their takeout is quick and easy. If you are just visiting Chicago for a short time, I still would suggest you try this.

I&apos;ve never been to the OG au cheval which I&apos;m sure is great and all, but here you usually won&apos;t have to wait hours to get one and it&apos;s cheaper. Just stop reading this and do it. Thank me later."
4,"Finally got to Small Cheval to do the contrast and compare to mama burger shop Au Cheval. At Small Cheval, you just go up to the window to order then grab a seat. Outdoor seating only but there&apos;s a pretty good amount of patio seats. There&apos;s almost always a line but you won&apos;t wait the hours you would at Au Cheval.

There isn&apos;t an extensive menu, but it&apos;s for the best here. What they do have, they do well. Fries are really good here and the dipping aioli is bomb. Now is the burger as good as Au Cheval...nearly...almost...but not quite there. It&apos;s a tiny notch below it. However for the price and shorter wait times, it&apos;s definitely worth checking out."
4,"Almost as good as Au Cheval!! I actually always order the kids burger because the regular is really big. I like that you can customize it and add lettuce and bacon. 

I loooove the aioli that you can order with their fries."
4,"We grabbed a burger here on our way out of Chicago. We stopped during COVID but they made ordering and eating safely easy. We ordered from an app on the phone and then picked it up inside. There were large picnic tables outside at which to sit. Patrons were well spaced out. 

The burger was simple yet delicious. It was what I expected or hoped for based on its reputation. I had realistic expectations based on it being a burger and nothing mindblowing. We would definitely go back here next time in Chicago if we craved a burger."
4,"What. A. Burger. 

Since the lines for the actual Au Cheval are unnecessary for just a burger... we decided line up for the smaller line for the infamous burger. It was bearable, although I wish I could have been sipping on a beer during the wait. The limited menu makes the line go faster. I ordered a double cheeseburger with golden fries and paired it with a beer. 

Definitely some delicious fries and burger, but I was even more impressed by the variety of available sauces: THAT AIOLI THOUGH. Perfect for dipping bites of your burger and fries alike.  

Burger was simple but solid - perfectly juicy, meaty, cheesy, slightly saucey... the whole shebang. Golden fries were crispy and delicious. 

Small Cheval is definitely worth the wait and even worth a visit when coming from out of town!"
3,"I had been to Au Cheval before trying small cheval, so maybe my expectations were a little high,  but I was expecting a lot more from Small Cheval. Yes it was really good, and I&apos;d definitely go back, but I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had. I thought Au Cheval was the best burger I&apos;ve ever had. 

The bacon on this burger was good, but it wasn&apos;t thick cut and cooked to perfection like at Au Cheval. I think I&apos;ll have to try Small Cheval again before judging it too much. I have faith that this could have just been an off day or something."
5,"Great outdoor seating and seamless ordering process give you the Au Cheval burger but minus the 3 hour wait.

Definitely a high value and reasonably priced option in a generally overpriced Wicker Park area which is really appreciated."
4,"Hmmmm. Small Cheval. Where to start? Their food is amazing, yes. It&apos;s a staple in Chicago. However, our group&apos;s entire order was wrong, including my specific ask for no bun. This might not seem like a big deal, but I have a gluten allergy, so this made my meal inedible. We also decided not to go back for a replacement because the wait time when we ordered the food was already long. I waited outside for quite a while even though I ordered ahead for pickup. So yes, their food is always delicious. But it&apos;s frustrating when an entire order is wrong... and items are forgotten."
5,"Quality is top tier, fast, and reliable. Foods always on point. Fries are cooked golden brown all the time. Gotta couple it with the garlic aioli -- won&apos;t regret it!"
5,"Favorite burger spot especially right now during COVID with their outdoor dining space. Again it&apos;s a fast food joint compared to it&apos;s sister restaurant Au Cheval. And the way it works now is you order on your phone, sit down if there is space available, and then you have it delivered to your table. If any condiments or anything is needed the workers are more than welcome to bring them out. 
Burgers are amazing, as well as their crispy golden fries but to top it all off.....try the AIOLI sauce. It&apos;s a game changer!
Beware that this place is busy!! So don&apos;t get confused when waiting with others for just online pickups. There is a host at the front in case you have any questions.
Overall I really enjoy this place in Old Town!"
5,"I really enjoyed this spot! 

My favorite part was the cute outdoor seating and lighting. It was very spacey, and had many suitable options for the quarantine.

Tip: Order online first. The line outside was just for online pickups. We accidentally waited in line for 20 minutes before we realized...HA!

I also suggest you try the Kensington Ketchup. It tasted less processed than the normal Ketchup, with more of natural tomato taste. 

I ordered the kids burger and fries- it was just a single patty, and it was plenty big for me. I have been to the larger Au Cheval before, and I will admit it is not the same experience as the original. It is definitely great, but it isn&apos;t the same caliber- I would also suggest trying Au Cheval.

Overall, this is a lovely spot to try. Although you may hear the occasional train passing by, it can be a comedic relief when gobbling down burgers."
5,"Aww! We ordered our burgers and drove in from the burbs because Small Cheval makes the best burgers in the Chicagoland area, the best fries and Bailey&apos;s shakes (gotta order 2, one to freeze for tomorrow ). Got caught in heckin&apos; traffic and arrived about 45 mins late for our pick up. 
When I went to get my burgers, they wouldn&apos;t give them to me! Insisted on remaking all our food!! Who does that? The excellent staff at Small Cheval Wicker Park! Thats who! XOXO"
5,"Best burger, no question, nothing else comes close. Ordered the cheeseburger with the classic toppings: dijonnaise, pickles, and onions."
4,"Had this for the first time, and due to the shelter in place, I ordered via DoorDash. Super easy to order and I went with a double cheeseburger with bacon and fries. Everything was fresh, delicious and super filling. 

I did ask for no pickles, yet I found 4 in there :(. Would love to visit in person once the shelter in place is over!"
4,"We ordered Small Cheval today for The Great American Takeout to help support small businesses. Caviar was offering free shipping and $5 off if you downloaded the app so we did. We knew getting a burger and fries delivered was risky because it may not hold up but we&apos;ve wanted to try Au Cheval for a while so we thought what the heck!

Overall, we were very pleased. The food arrived quicker than was scheduled. The fries were warm and the burger was room temp. Even though the fries weren&apos;t hot, they were delicious! 10/10 for me. I didn&apos;t try the ketchup because we chose garlic aioli for the sauce but unfortunately... we didn&apos;t get it. We were disappointed being there was a specific option for one.

My burger was a little over cooked but it may have continued to cook a bit on the way. I got the single patty and my fiancé got the double. I asked for the sauce on the side bc I don&apos;t like Dijon. After trying a bite of my fiancé&apos;s, I was happy with that decision  but I don&apos;t like mustard. Unfortunately, that left my burger a little dry so I ended up adding mayo. Admittedly, I&apos;m not a HUGE burger person, I&apos;ve had less than 10 in my life after going 25 years without one so I may not be the best critic but I&apos;d give it 6.5/10. I liked the bun and the bacon was solid but the single patty was a little thin and overcooked and the raw onions were a bit heavy for me.

My fiancé rated it an 8. He said it was really good but he would need to try it fresh to make a true decision."
5,"Great burgers and fries (and nothing else  - makes ordering easy!) 

They have pandemic operations down to a t!   Very efficient."
5,This was one of the best burgers I have had in my life!  Everything about the burger was perfect from the golden crisp buttery bun to the sauce on the cheeseburger!  I will be coming back here ASAP when I have another hankering for a burger
5,"Burgers come with a double patty?? You got it
Fries are hella crispy?? Even better
Milk shakes are nice and thickkkk?? Da Bomb!
Beers $5 or less?? Daaa BEST!!!

What more can you ask for?! Honestly hits the spot every time! Will definitely be a regular here! 

Also got a nice divvy station right across the street!"
