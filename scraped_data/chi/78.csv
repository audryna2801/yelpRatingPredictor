5,"Always a fan of bbq, so was super excited to try Gyu-Kaku. It did not disappoint!

Although the seating is all indoors, we were pleased to find that the staff takes Covid seriously. Tables are quite spaced out. Our server (although I didn&apos;t catch his name) was one of my favorite parts of our lunch! He was so energetic and fun, really appreciated his energy. 

The food was so delicious! We ordered the Ninja combo for 3 people and left absolutely stuffed. All of the meats were pretty great, and it even comes with smores for dessert. We also ordered drinks - my lychee mojito was great. 

Japanese BBQ is definitely a fun activity with family or friends, and it&apos;s nice to be able to cook the meat to our liking."
5,"During covid, my husband and I have been taking long weekends downtown to just get out of our house. We work from home and leave our house maybe once a week so we look forward to our long weekends away. 

We have never had Japanese BBQ. So when we saw this place one block away from our hotel, we needed to try it! We chef special that included a bunch of different proteins and it was absolutely delicious! The steak literally melted in my mouth.

To top it off, s&apos;mores were included in the special as the dessert! I have not had a s&apos;more in year so it was a great end to the dinner. Highly recommend. I honestly cannot wait to go back!"
5,"Loved loved loved this place! Food was amazing, service was even better despite Covid measures."
4,"I love this chain, and was introduced to Lady M&apos;s matcha mille crepe cakes here! The atmosphere is boisterous and fun, with a communal feel as everyone is cooking over the barbecue at each table. 

Fun place to check out and awesome desserts!"
4,"Fire up your grille for Japanese-style BBQ course with something for everyone (...except maybe vegans). Our party ordered the &quot;Yakiniku&quot; and the food just kept coming! Quality cuts of meat, delicious sides, delectable sushi plates. If that isn&apos;t enough finish it off toasting a s&apos;more. *I will say is they were a bit skimpy with that chocolate for my estrogen-rich blood.*"
4,"We can&apos;t go wrong with Gyu-Kaku anywhere.

Currently reservation only. Easy to make one via open table app.

They check your temperature upon arrival and ask you to wear a mask when interacting with server at the table.

They don&apos;t offer all you can eat during this time but modified menu offers plenty of options to fill you up.

Be sure to save a room for dessert. I always get s&apos;mores. It&apos;s just fun and sweet way to end perfect dinner.

Sever and a manager was very friendly and nice. Although they had to operate at limited capacity, they were doing the best they can to accommodate hungry customers."
3,"I think I would have liked this place more if I had dined-in as opposed to ordering out. I&apos;ve passed by it when walking, and when I was craving some Japanese BBQ I figured it was the perfect opportunity to try it out! I ordered through Postmates and everything came promptly and correctly. 

I ordered an Umakara Beef Bowl with a side salad and some Karaage Chicken. Everything was fine, but I just didn&apos;t enjoy it all that much. The chicken had a pretty good breading, but the sauce it came with did not taste good! I was so surprised that dipping the chicken actually made it taste worse in my opinion. The beef was better, and it was a hearty portion of meat and rice, but it also didn&apos;t blow me away. I really enjoyed the marinade, so I would recommend it, but the beef was quite stringy, fatty, and at times very chewy. 

I wouldn&apos;t dissuade people from trying this place out if they&apos;re curious, but it wouldn&apos;t be a top suggestion from me. Again, I&apos;d be super curious to dine-in here, but delivery just didn&apos;t blow me away."
5,"We really enjoyed the experience. We&apos;ve been to Korean BBQ basically everywhere, but it was our first time trying Japanese BBQ in Chicago. 

We saw that they needed reservations, so we made one on Yelp and came in at 11:35am on a Sunday. 

After confirming our reservation, the host/server took our temperature and got us seated at a table near the door. 

He offered up a couple of suggestions for what we could eat, so we ended up ordered the Chef&apos;s Favorite ($80). We also ordered some Takoyaki ($6) and a couple of drinks. We could&apos;ve ordered individual entrees of meats (especially at the happy hour price), but we were too lazy to pick and choose what we wanted. 

Pros
- Best items were definitely the Takoyaki and the Gyu-Sushi. 
- Filet Mignon was delicious (cook for 90 seconds), take some more time for thicker pieces
- Prime Short Rib - tastes like Korean Bulgogi 
- Umakara Ribeye - marbled to perfection, really great piece of meat
- less smoky than Korean BBQ
- Shrimp Garlic was great! 

Cons
- Not sure if this is cultural, but the fire wasn&apos;t as strong as Korean BBQ grills, on the flip side, nothing was too (temperature) hot when eating 
- Pork Belly wasn&apos;t that great
- Skirt Steak was whatever, especially compared to the other meats 


TLDR - Solid dining experience, and a fun interactive date place!"
4,"Great spot for both dine in table side grill and take out. In my most recent experience at this location I ordered take with some garlic chicken noodles, Japanese fried chicken bites and beef fried rice.

The garlic chicken was the winner. It had the right amount of flavor with delicious thick noodles.

The fried chicken bites could be bumped in more quantity given the price but taste was good. 

The fried rice lacked a little flavor but overall good."
5,"This place is so much fun for groups. Never tried yakiniku? It&apos;s an entire experience, and essentially Japanese meat that you get to grill yourself at your own table. You order the types of meat and vegetables you want, and then they come to your table raw. Your server turns on the mini grill at your table and you use the table tools to cook it to your liking. Everything cooks very quickly and it&apos;s a blast to make. 

We ordered a ton of meat - skirt steak, &apos;Harami in secret pot&apos; steak, Angus beef, and hanger steak. We were light when we ordered the first time, but had to order more halfway through our dinner when we realized we were still hungry. We also got the assorted vegetables, garlic noodles and bibimbap to share. All were delicious. 

Gyu-kaku is a chain, but not one I&apos;d been to before. The interior was fun, with multiple levels and an energetic vibe. Located in downtown Chicago, it seemed to be continually bustling. I&apos;d definitely go back!"
1,"I went to this location last night for my daughter&apos;s birthday, and it was NOT good!! For starters, it was like walking into a scary alley . Then the food portions were so small, no one was full and it&apos;s very overpriced for scraps. I will not ever do this again. Very disappointed spending $260 to leave and still have to feed everybody"
5,"This place is a fun place to go with your family or friends. Their endless amount of food is super overwhelming at first but once you get the hang of it, it&apos;s really easy to navigate. The ambiance of the restaurant is very nice, it&apos;s a good cozy feel. You don&apos;t hear other peoples conversations and you don&apos;t come out smelling like bbq which isn&apos;t a bad thing but I know some people don&apos;t like that smell. The food is great and you can cook it however you want which is nice! I recommend once it&apos;s open again!"
4,"My dinner crew decided to hit this place up for a weekend lunch and we were happy to find they had a Brunch Menu. It&apos;s not what you may usually think of when it comes to brunch, but it&apos;s a nice discounted menu with a few mix-n-match options. It comes with a Half Gyu-Kaku Salad, Miso Soup, Rice (you can upgrade to Bibimbop for more money) and then your choice of 2 or 3 meats.

I started the meal off with a Geisha cocktail. It was very tropical and tasty, so I recommend it. Then we split a few Appetizers: Spicy Tuna Volcano (I wished it had been spicier) that had good flavor and was filling, Fried Cheese Wontons (super hot, so watch out!), Edamame, and Garlic Noodles.

For my meats, I went with Angus Beef Rib (Sweet Soy Tare), Pork Belly (Shio), and New York Steak (Garlic). They were all very good, but the Angus Beef Rib was by far the best, in my opinion. They were all very easy to cook on our personal grill, too, and I appreciated that our server gave us suggestions on preparation.

There were six of us seated at a table for 6, but the booth was a bit cramped. It was only enough room for ourselves and we were pretty cozy, so get comfortable! I wish we&apos;d had a table for 8, because all the plates started to add up and it was crowded."
3,"Full disclosure: this was my first experience at a Japanese bbq establishment.  Safe to say from this experience, i don&apos;t think I&apos;m a fan.

We went with one of the prebuilt packages which offered some appetizers, salad, veggies, rice, beef, chicken, pork and we then added on some calamari.

My first problem was you use the same tongs to cook all the different cuts with.  Something didn&apos;t feel right about raw chicken then raw beef then cooked meat.  It all seemed so wrong.

Also they come at you with all of these things that require different cooking times and it all becomes  overwhelming fast.  The grill is small so you can only cook so much at once which requires some patience.

All in all, the flavor of the meat was good, which is why this gets three stars.  We did get the chocolate lava cake for dessert and it was delightful.

I think I&apos;ll stick to restaurants that do the heavy lifting for me and bring the food out prepared and delicious."
3,"Came across this place as it was close to our hotel. They have a decent happy hour menu, sPecials for combos and proteins. wait was quite a while, I recommend putting your name on the wait list and then shopping around the area while you waIt; we had to wait 1.5 hrs for a table!!

Upon entering, the restaurant is a little small and has a musty atmosphere. Floors were a little sticky and booth chairs were dirty and greasy- very unappealing. We opted for the all you can eat option. ManY choices of appetizers and sushi. Meat marinade could have been more flavorful- a little bland and portion sizes are huge. Don&apos;t order tooo much on an empty stomach because you may not finish it all! The chicken karaage is tasty, definitely recommend that and the crispy sushi! Not sure if I&apos;d return to this location. They also have an app you can downnload to earn points for free menu items. We got a free side of edamame for registering on the app!"
1,"Ever since there is a change of manager the food is terrible. Here is why


1. Portions are significantly smaller. 
2. I don&apos;t think they adhere to covid safe distancing policy
3. The new menu takes away some favorite of mine and the food just doesn&apos;t taste as good.

Highly recommend people to avoid it until covid is over"
5,"I looove Gyu-Kaku! Every time I come, I leave super happy and stuffed. Since this place is generally quite popular, I&apos;d suggest getting a reservation beforehand--I&apos;ve never had an issue getting one, even on the same day. 

The (not-so-hidden) gems on the menu are their group deals. For two people, you can share a $60 set that comes with miso soup, edamame, fried chicken, salad, SIX types of meat, AND dessert. If you download their app and check in on Yelp as well, you can redeem the app credits for another plate of meat, the check in credit for more edamame, and collect more points (not that worth it imo). We also got a huge 24oz beer that was only $8!

Our favorite meat was the hanger steak and toro but generally the meat quality is very good here. One thing I highly recommend are the Lady M matcha crepe cakes. I don&apos;t think they&apos;re available anywhere else in Chicago, and they are such a tasty special treat! Service is also great and I appreciated our waiter periodically changing our grill before they burnt."
5,"I like Gyu-Kaku, so much so that I&apos;ve eaten at locations in Chicago, Boston and New York City. In Chicago, all of the booths were separated by clear plastic sheeting and the staff were masked and gloved.

We thoroughly enjoyed cooking our meal on the well-ventilated grill and the unfiltered sake was sweet. The green tea 20-layer cake with ice cream had as many calories as a Big Mac, but was totally worth the indulgence.

I&apos;d stop by for another meal at this or any other of the Gyu-Kaku locations. Kampai!"
4,"It was pretty good. They have lots of options, so ordering it is a little confusing. The waiter, Kevin was super helpful. I think the value is okay for happy hour. My favorite sauce is the spicy one and my bf really liked the ponzu sauce. The beer prices aren&apos;t bad. Since we went during HH it was $4.50 for Asahi. It tasted like a Corona. For some reason, the meal wasn&apos;t really filling though.

The grill kind of sucks for shabu meat since the meat sticks on there and sometimes falls through. The garlic rice and the harami skirt steak was good too. The garlic pieces are very big though so you might bite into a very garlicy piece. We ended up ordering a la carte since the packages didn&apos;t have some of the meats we wanted to try. We got the bacon chips and they were pretty fatty and it was different. It&apos;s served with salt and lemon, but not for me. The New York steak was eh, it was super fatty for some reason. Filet mignon was good, the shabu meat tasted good, and the bistro hanger steak was really juicy.

It was pretty dark inside but the lamp above the grills are super bright. It also seems pretty popular, so I&apos;m glad I made a reservation. It was a little cold inside, but the grills are supposed to keep you warm I guess. The bathrooms are a little gross."
5,"Oh my goodness! There food is so so so good! You cook your meats yourself. They season everything extremely well. The drinks were much and tastyyyy!!! 

They accepted our reservation and they allow walk in. They were very quick and courteous! Highly recommended for groups of people!"
