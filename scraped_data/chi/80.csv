4,"You win some, you lose some - that was my experience ordering delivery from 90 Miles. I have recently started getting into Cuban food so I knew I had to give this place a try, and overall I am really happy with everything I got, however, I wish I knew more about Cuban food so that I could have ordered an entree I enjoyed more. 

I ordered:
-Croquettes
-Fried Yuca
-Seasoned Fries
-Vaca Frita

I thought the croquettes, yuca, and fries were fantastic!! I am in love with the 90 Miles aioli that came with the croquettes and I thought it tasted great with the yuca too. The yuca came with some type of garlic sauce but I wasn&apos;t a fan of it so I opted not to use it. Everything arrived crisp, flavorful, and delicious. 

The vaca frita is a different story though... I don&apos;t want to hold the fact that I didn&apos;t like it against the restaurant because I just didn&apos;t really understand what I was ordering. Crispy fried beef sounded amazing, but vaca frita is more like beef jerky shreds in reality. It was so chewy and the meat itself was so dry and quite flavorless that I was incredibly disappointed with my order. Plus there&apos;s something about the way it looks with the onions that&apos;s just downright unappetizing. It comes with rice and black beans and the beans had lots of great flavor but it couldn&apos;t make up for the meat. I wish I would have tried something else, and since I did like everything else I ordered, I plan to opt for another entree in the future. 

When it comes to it, this place had great appetizers/sides, and I&apos;m sure they have some great entrees too, I just didn&apos;t end up having one. Would love to visit in person when it&apos;s safe to again."
4,"Best. Cubano. Came here on a cold wintery day to get my Cubano fix and wow was I blown away. Loved the option between the front and back patio. We were in the back and loved the ambience. Our server immediately greeted us, but we found it a bit strange that we weren&apos;t served any water. We were given bottles of water halfway through our meal once we had asked. 

I ordered the Cubano with chips and was pleased to find both potato and plantain chips. The Cubano was sublime. The pulled pork married so well with the tang of the mustard and the thinly sliced pickles provided a nice acidic bite to the rich meats. The bread was the closest I&apos;ve ever had to the Cuban pan I found on Calle Ocho in Miami. 

The S.O. had one of the frita burgers. Fries were on point, but the burger itself left a little to be desired for. The onions were so deliciously jammy and sweet, but we found the patty to be pretty underseasoned.

Just fair warning, when going up to the bathroom, I guess they left one of their Halloween decorations up and there was a terrifyingly ominous looking mannequin in costume that scared the absolute bejesus out of me. 

Overall, had a great time with some really great food. Definitely coming back for another Cubano soon!"
5,"Love ourselves some 90 mile. The pork in the lechon is soo amazing. It&apos;s salty and briny which pairs nicely with the black beans and rice. Add a Maduro in there and it&apos;s heaven. We held back and split an entree which left us in a good spot for coffee and flan. Highly recommend 90 mile, either location is amazing. 

Normally we byob but if not, still amazing. Very clean and covid precautions in place like distances tables, mask requirements and digital menus. Keep up the great work!"
5,"Finally trying 90 Miles was a great way to kick off 2021.

We got a whole feast for under $50, but the stars of the show were the cubanos (duh) and the goat cheese and chorizo empanadas. The empanadas were fought over. 

Glad we found a stellar Cuban place nearby!"
4,"I can&apos;t believe I am now finding this spot. I loved everything about it. It&apos;s BYOB, so bring wine, beer or liquor (they have mixers like sangria, margarita, etc). The patio is so fun and open. The food makes me think of being in the Caribbean again (I know, it&apos;s Cuban, but the food is similar). This is now one of my go to spots. Bring some drinks, order some plantains and sit back and enjoy the patio!"
4,"When ordering the Cuban sandwich, opt for the chips rather than fries!! And ask for the aioli for dipping! I understand the Cuban sandwich is what they are known for but it was overall too salty for me. I typically need texture in my food as well as a balance of greasy with fresh. 

I had ordered the tuna ceviche for appetizers and I wish I asked for it to come out with my sandwich. The acidity would have been a perfect pair to help with the salty/heaviness of the sandwich! 

There is a very large outdoor seating area in the front and back end of the building. Curtains between each seating area for extra safety. Highly recommended if dining out for covid."
4,"This spot has always been so conveniently close to me and yet, I&apos;ve still not made it there until now. Thank god for their patio because it made dining during COVID feel a bit safer. 

You can make reservations online (highly recommended). The staff always has their masks on. They put up partitions between the tables. They have a patio. The place is BYOB so your drinks are up to you anyway. If you go inside to use the restroom, mask up. 

The staff is amazing. They are very attentive, but not in your face. The manager even came around, Orlando. They all checked on us and at the end, thanked us for dining with them. My friend has left his wallet at home by accident and they didn&apos;t have Apple Pay, but they were able to work something out. 90 Miles Cuban was very accommodating, very welcoming and overall, just very nice.

The food: 
Calamari (in squid ink) - it was good
Empandas (variety) - these were fantastic. loved the chorizo with goat cheese and shrimp best. oh, and the mozzarella is how mozzarella sticks should all be.
Churrassca - really good, really tender. the potato is a little gummy or just a slightly dense texture. the rice was good.
Lechon - the lechon itself was amazing. the rice was good as well as the potatoes. it was a big serving of deliciousness that was just as good the next day.

TLDR: definitely check them out. the food is fantastic. the staff is amazing. the service is great. the patio is awesome."
5,"15 of us met up for a graduation party. They had no problem accommodating us.  No shortage of outdoor space here and the food is superb.  They have two outdoor patios. One covered and one wide open.  Great
Cuban. Had the salmon A La Plancha, amazing grilled salmon with this mango sauce, ceviche and one of the guys had the snapper. 90 Miles is amazing. Wait staff was on point, friendly and got a free desert for checking in on Yelp. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
5,"As someone who has spent considerable time in Miami, this is great Cuban food in Chicago. Fun atmosphere. Just go."
4,"Such a good authentic Cuban restaurant. They have a great outdoor patio that can fit a lot of tables, even during COVID times. They had a live guitar player playing authentic music to set the mood. The sopa de cherna  is hands down my favorite thing on the menu. It was HUGE and had so much fish it in, it was delicious. The empanadas were good, but came out a little too hard on the outside for my liking."
5,My wife and I are new to the neighborhood so we knew we had to check this place out. Best Cubano sandwich I have ever had and great service! Our boy Guy Fieri was right. This place does things right.
4,"We&apos;ve been coming to 90 Miles for such a long time, and this review is long overdue.

90 Miles has both indoor seating and an outdoor patio.  During COVID times, they have set up dividers between tables that cannot be 6 ft apart. 

The environment and people-watching is very mixed.  There are times that are friendly with families and large groups of every type of Logan Squarite enjoying a meal with friends. These the most fun days.  Then there are the times when it&apos;s very pretentious; lots of attitude from costumers (not the staff) and very much &quot;see and be seen&quot;.  During these days I feel rushed like they want to get in as many people as possible.  

We&apos;ve had almost everything on the menu over the past 10 years and can say everything is delicious.

Empanadas- these are offered in both sweet and savory flavors.  All of the savory empanadas are filling.  Our favorite empanadas are the snickers and the guava and cheesecake.

As appetizers and/or sides we usually get a mixture of the following:

Maduros- so delicious and I am always sad when they are finished.

Papas Fritas- standard french fries that are delicious to dip into sandwich drippings and/or dinner plates.

Tostones- a savory type of &apos;ship&apos; garlicky and good with sandwiches. 

Yuca Frita/Yuca al Mojo de Ajo- another crispy treat to enjoy with dinner. 

Most dinner plates can also be made into sandwiches.  We&apos;ve tried:

Cubano (ham, roast pork, swiss cheese, pickle, mustard).  This is a good Cuban sandwich but I usually can&apos;t finish it.  It&apos;s delicious and can be shared. 

Ropa Vieja (shredded beef, onion, pepper, creole sauce. With the choice of plantain chips or fries).  This is my go-to when I want a served dinner (the sandwich is delicious too). 

Media Noche (ham, roast pork, swiss cheese, pickle, mustard,
toasted sweet egg bread. With a choice of plantain).  If you like pork this is a sandwich to try.  

Guajirito (steak, romaine lettuce, tomato, grilled onions,
swiss cheese, chimichurri, on green plantains).  This is my favorite sandwich.  It is a large portion and can be shared. I love the sandwich but, by the nature of how the steak is cooked and how the plantains are fried, this is a greasier sandwich.  

Vaca Frita (crispy shredded beef, onion, mojo de ajo. Served
with white rice and black beans).  This is a good option if you are new to Cuban food and want a taste of the island.

90 Miles House Salad (mixed greens, tomato, onion, hearts of palm, and house balsamic vinaigrette).  Standard house salad with hearts of palm.

90 Miles is BYOB for your drinking pleasure; you can bring wine or rum and purchase pitchers of starters. The Mojito Mixer (32 oz Non-alcoholic: Lime juice, sugar cane, mint) is pretty good. Bring the good rum. 
The Sangria Mixer (32 oz non-alcoholic: fresh orange chunks,
pineapple chunks, peach chunks, lemon, and Jupina). Delicious starter, I recommend a white wine.

If you don&apos;t want to imbibe, their teas are SO.GOOD. I recommend their Passion Iced Tea (raspberry tea mixed with passion fruit &amp;
strawberry puree served chilled over ice) or the Salida Del Sol (Earl Grey tea mixed with mango puree).  While I love the teas, I have to say that they are small and are not refilled.  I would rather pay more for the tea and continue to be refilled (which probably means people refill once or twice).  Otherwise, it a small portion."
5,"I like this restaurant each dish packed with a punch of flavor !!! 
Pricing is not too bad"
5,"I can&apos;t think of anything more perfect that the best Cubano in the city, salsa music, and patio season! 

But honestly the pictures speak for themselves!  

Ambiance: 4/5
Service: 5/5
Food: 5/5"
4,"Really loved the vibes here and it&apos;s BYOB!!! Went on a hot day and wanted to sit in the patio to enjoy the sun with my party of 4 for a late lunch. We luckily got seated with just two of us right away and waited for our friends to join our table a little later. It was nice that there were banner size separators for every table to promote social distancing. The server was very kind and helpful. My boyfriend and I ordered the tuna ceviche appetizer and Cubano sandwich with chips which was delicious. We also pitchers to make palomas and sangria with our tequila &amp; red wine we brought in, which were AMAZING! Really great service and I wish we made the reservation for dinner time since we saw live music getting set up. The bill for four of us was $135 plus tip, would love to try more of their authentic food!"
5,"Back here on New Years Day 2020. We got the Calamar/Tamal and Tostones great as usual. Got the cortadito coffee-  freakin excellent!! There&apos;s something about that sugar cane that kicks up a notch. 
Below is my previous review 

Excellent food overall. Great vibes inside/out and BYOB (bring your own booze). I highly recommend the Tamal (different from Mexican) Tostones Rellanos (fried unsweetened plantains with shrimp in tomato sauce) and Calamari Crillo (squid in ink).  

The Calamari Crillo is an adventurous choice but I implore you to try it. It&apos;s the reason why I keep coming back. You have to try their mojito. It&apos;s great with or without your favorite tequila or rum.  The vaca fritas and the empanadas were OK.

And the place itself. Get outdoors seating if you can. Indoors eat out back in the garage. The back looks like a garage in Cuba with the sloping roof, clothes line with clothes! roofing material as part of your wall. The music blares and you have fun."
3,"Pandemic precautions: 5/5 Temperature was taken prior to entering. Indoor seating was allowed, with curtains between tables. Outdoor seating was also allowed.

Customer service: 3/5 It took a while for us to place our order; he said he would be back in a few minutes and did not come until 10-15 minutes later. Lunch special was non-negotiable; I asked for yellow rice instead of white rice and he would not allow it even though the price for rice was exactly the same on the original menu. One of the orders was wrong, so we had to wait for it to get fixed. Empanadas came after the entrees. When I checked into yelp, it offered a free dessert in which he said he can only offer flan with that coupon.

Food: Empanadas were decent, I&apos;ve admittedly had better. Tilapia lunch special was good but was unaware it was deep fried. Cuban sandwich was the main reason we were there, and it was good but a bit small for the price. There were also more fries than needed for the small amount of sandwich.

Would I go here again? Probably not."
5,"Never had an issue with service.  Love the fact that they were able to anticipate my needs.  Hardly had to say anything. One of the things I was noticing was how well they took care of my dog giving him more water during my stay there. The live music available was a definite nice touch.  You just can&apos;t go wrong.  It was also nice that it wasn&apos;t blaring into my ear. This coming from a guy sitting right in front of the performers within 6 ft away. If you have the room, get the chocolate flan.  You&apos;ll thank me. I now have a new standard when ordering flan. Looking forward to coming again.  Thanks for you"
4,"This was a date night. Food was good. I personally enjoyed the empanadas the most. The chimichurri is delicious. 
I like that it&apos;s byob. We had the sangria pitcher &amp; really enjoyed our meal al fresco. It&apos;s just what we needed given the current situation in the world.

Also, if you check in on yelp you get a free dessert! We had the chocolate flan. It was delicious!"
5,"I ordered 90 Miles Cuban Cafe for Yelp&apos;s Big Night In. I have heard great things and had been wanting to try it for myself. I got the beef empanadas and french fries. The empanadas were crisp on the outside and delicious. The fries are the seasoned kind and were amazing. My friends were equally happy with their meals. When restaurants open back up, it also looks like this is a very fun place to sit outdoors on their patio."
