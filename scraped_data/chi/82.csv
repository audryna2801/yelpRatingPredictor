4,"I went out to Frontera Grill today where they offered indoor seating (due to the new Chicago guidelines). On a Saturday night it was pretty full, so I would recommend making a reservation on their website before going.

The food was great at a reasonable price and the service was excellent. 

We got the Friday/Saturday special which was baby back ribs with grits and mango slaw. The seasoning on the ribs were great but it was a little dry. I also thought the grits were a little too sweet. I also tried their little gem salad which was fine but nothing special. We also tried the cheesecake with grapefruit on top which was fantastic. Perfectly sweet, tangy, and sour. The cheesecake was the star of the show!"
5,"Let&apos;s be honest, this place doesn&apos;t need my review. And let&apos;s be real. You don&apos;t need my thoughts on this place either. This is Rick Bayless. This is Frontera Grill, an icon of the Chicago restaurant scene. There&apos;s a reason why this place deserves all the buzz, notoriety, and press it receives. It&apos;s damn good Mexican food, soulfully prepared and meticulously executed. 

During the pandemic, Frontera has perfected the take out game. We had food delivered and didn&apos;t feel the quality suffered in the least. Smoked chicken taquitos to start - I warmed them in the oven for 5 minutes before slathering on the salsa and chihuahua cheese. We split the arabis-style taco plate, which was grilled spiced pork, carmelized onions and cucumber, finished with spicy chipotle salsa and creamy jocose sauce. The order also came with delicious black beans and grilled flour tortillas.  The descriptor on the menu says serves 3-4, but honestly it&apos;s the perfect amount for 2. 

If you&apos;ve read this far, you obviously are not a Chicago local or new to the area, because any one who dines out in this town knows this place is high quality and not to be missed. Book your dinner and prepare for awesome."
5,Always a great experience at Frontera.  The food and drinks are spot on.  The service is amazing!  They are adhering to COVID-19 protocols and are open for limited indoor dining.
5,"Great food !   Frontera&apos;s has a program where they let you order food and then on a certain day they deliver it to the northern Chicago suburbs for you to reassemble in their dinner kit.  We did this and got our bag of food yesterday and it was great!

We started with tostadas (pictured here) and they were easy to heat, assemble, and they were fantastic !!!  We would definitely get this again.  

Next we got the short rib enchiladas and they were really good.  I didn&apos;t take  a picture but it was great.   

Lastly we got the  topolo margarita and it was very good.  They don&apos;t include any salt but we had some so no worries. 

It was a great experience and the instructions were laid out well and easy to follow."
5,"Rick Bayless who introduced America to the Oaxacan  kitchen still runs this awesome source for excellent dining, very causal, still very good and still standing strong. During Chicago&apos;s much stricter protocols than Los Angeles, FG is open for outdoor covered and aerated dining (one side of the rectangular outside dining room is open, facing the restaurant -- less chance of frigid wind blowing in).  Other restaurants are following suit. 

The travails of the restaurant scene in Chicago can be sensed here:

We had the smoked chicken tacos (a signature treat), guacamole, salmon, carnitas and much to our expectations the food was as I remember: original, delicious and authentic (Rick Bayless was an anthropologist studying in Mexico when he was smitten by authentic cooking history and products).  For a non-native I appreciate his respect to authentic Cooking traditions. 

Loved the food, loved the service. Muchas gracias Se√±or Bayless for staying consistent and serving food I can revisit over and over again.  

Tip: Adjacent to  Topolobampo.   He opened a causal tortas, churros, joint next door to that called  Xoco that serves signature tortas at his outpost in ORD.  Love the churros and tortas here also."
1,"Omg they managed to get even worse. Our server disappeared for 30 minutes while we waited for our entrees. I finally had to tell the hostess to please bring our check because we were leaving. Five more minutes went by before she brought it. She was nice enough to comp our apps but never again. Avoid this place like the plague. The really sad thing is that no one will even bother to read or respond to my review. They don&apos;t care about locals who visit a couple times a month because they get so many tourists who will come here once and never show up again. Rick, that&apos;s a crappy business model you got there.

Almost forgot: The sopacitas seem to be a little bigger, addressing my earlier complaint but the bacon/black bean tamale was stone cold. I&apos;m not sure why, but tamales seem to be an achilles heal at Bayless places. Also, I thought ordering two margaritas would get me a full pour in my glass but it still stopped a good half inch from the top of a very small glass. Sigh................... We still love Xoco and will go back there as long as it remains top flight. I recommend you do the same."
1,"I came in with my 10 lbs Medical Alert Dog to the restaurant. It was a raining evening. The hostess checked us in, then said she needed to call her manager.

She didn&apos;t ask if my dog was a service dog. I did mentioned to her when I made my reservation and when I arrived.

She didn&apos;t ask what kind of service my dog provided to me.

She got off the phone and told me we cannot sit inside. She asked for my dog identification. 

I got my doctor documentation out that I&apos;m allowed to travel with my service dog because of my conditions. She never CARED to look at. 

I didn&apos;t want to make a scene at the point. I was very upset and felt discriminated or is it because I was Asian? I don&apos;t belong in this part of town? 

It&apos;s unfair with the treatment to a person with a disability like myself. It&apos;s an embarrassment in the public.

I filed a complaint with Chicago ADA office today.

Although the food was solid, I lost my appetite. They offered limited menu, less than a a handful of wine option only.

Watch out: they ADD 20% TIPS &amp; still suggested tops below, be careful with your receipt, always! 

Service was good by our server.

My friend and her toddler daughter, my husband and I had to sit while raining outside, and they have no heater in their patio. 

I don&apos;t care how famous and kind this chef company is, but his staffs need to be trained and that manager needed a major training."
5,"We are in a staycation and are thrilled that during Covid Rick Bayless&apos; restaurants have HEPA filters, so we can eat inside- and enjoy the fabulous food! We&apos;ve been to Frontera twice in less than 24 hours, and will probably be back. 
We also like that that are committed to responsibly sourcing their food, and during the pandemic they are charging 20% extra in lieu of tip to support their staff. The service was excellent- so we gave them extra."
4,I accompanied a little gathering from a difficult day and left with extremely glad individuals. Get the tortilla soup on the off chance that you haven&apos;t had it previously. Most likely get the tortilla soup regardless of whether you&apos;ve had it each other time you&apos;ve been there.
5,"Can&apos;t say anything negative about this place. Mexican cuisine in Chicago and by the wonderful Chef Rick Bayless, count-me-IN!

The husband and I ordered a variety of dishes and non disappointed a Mexican hungry lady like me. I had to of course order a topolo margarita then I later ordered a fresh grapefruit paloma. Both were perfect!

Foodwise we ordered one order of the ceviche trio to be able to taste a little bit of all the ceviches. It consisted of a tuna tropical ceviche, shrimp and scallop ceviche verde (I&apos;m not even a fan of scallop and yet this blew me away), and the classic frontera ceviche. All were fresh and bursting with flavors. 

I also had an order of the fresh corn tamales veracruz style. So buttery and moist, topped with fresh home made cream and cheese. Inside filled with roasted poblano slices. My mouth waters just thinking about it.

Highly recommended. I would love to come back. Hopefully I can make another trip to Chicago for this. Chef Bayless, if you are reading this- You&apos;re my man!! Huge kudos and props for the wonderful experience, lovely customer service and unforgettable food."
4,"I enjoyed my initial visit to Frontera Grill-can&apos;t believe it&apos;s taken me this long to go, but the legendary difficulty in getting a reservation made me plan well in advance.   Upon arrival I didn&apos;t realize it&apos;s so small, but didn&apos;t impact the experience at all.

The food is quite good-terrific sauces, great creativity for sure.   The hits were the classic ceviche-terrific tuna and all ingredients were fresh and the cheesy grits side that came with my ribs-could eat that for breakfast, lunch and dinner!  The other biggest hit was the plantain side dish-perfectly cooked with ideal ripeness.

The carne asada was good-again the sauce was the hit there-and pork rib special was interesting.  Sauce was a perfect blend of sweet, tangy and glazed but the top half of the served ribs were meaty but a bit chewy and the bottom ones were less meaty but perfectly cooked and caramelized.

Attentive service and a decent drink menu for sure round out a good experience at a place worth visiting."
4,"Took advantage of restaurant week and enjoyed lunch here. Pleasant atmosphere, outstanding quick service and wonderful food. Shared the salsa and guac and started with ceviche... flavorful! I opted for the chicken mole poblano... DELICIOUS! My partner had the beef enchiladas which were slightly disappointing and lacked flavor-blah and lacking dish. Ended with the tres leches cake...unique and perfectly sweet! Partner had coconut pearls...a light desert with fantastic texture. 

We will definitely be back! Bar area was colorful and fun...might try seating there next instead of dining area."
5,"We ordered the game day package for the SB and it was perfect! The ceviche was divine. My husband who is not the biggest fan of fish ate most of it. The queso fundido was delicious. The salsas, guac and tortillas and chips were all great. The small touches like the recipe, playlist, and instructions for heating the food were great. I&apos;ll never use any other method to heat corn tortillas. Will def &quot;be back&quot;."
4,"Date night at Frontera! 

I had been in before but this past weekend was my husband&apos;s first time. We&apos;ve also been to Topolobampo and loved it. 

We debated which ceviche to start with then realized we could go with a trio and try all of them. I&apos;m glad we went that route because our favorite, the shrimp and scallop one, wasn&apos;t the one we were originally leaning towards. Definitely a must try! 

I&apos;m a creature of habit and I got what I always get: carne asada brava. It&apos;s just so so good. Everything about it is amazing. 

My husband got the ribs that are the Saturday special. We both agreed that it&apos;s something we wouldn&apos;t get again. Definitely not worthy of being a special. That being said, the cheese grits are AMAZING and I wish I could get that as a side for everything ever. 

What is going on with the service though? The servers are brisk at best and inattentive and grumpy at their worst. It&apos;s a real bummer because the food is so good. Rick! Get some servers that appear to like their jobs!"
4,"This has been on my list to try for awhile, so I decided to go for lunch during restaurant week. Lunch appeared to be a good value. 

The Mexican hot chocolate is delicious. I will probably get this every time I go! It&apos;s not overly sweet. 

I had the fresh corn tamale to start. It&apos;s not stuffed with anything. I like that you can taste the sweetness of the corn. On top is creama, cheese, and poblano peppers. The toppings makes it perfect! 

For my entree I had the shredded beef enchiladas. I like that they came with a  lot of beef in them. The meat quality was great. On the side was mashed black beans. 

For dessert was tres leches. The top is marshmallow fluff, the middle is a light wet cake, and the bottom is similar to a chocolate graham cracker. Everything worked well together.

Service was great. Ambiance is just ok. They were busy and it&apos;s more of a casual atmosphere."
1,"Never ever order delivery from here. Placed an order for delivery and 30 minutes AFTER it was supposed to be delivered, I get a notification saying they can&apos;t fulfill my order."
5,"Winner of the best fish tacos in life. Everything we had was brilliant and delicious, full of care and bold flavor, and a fish taco platter that made me want to cry from happiness.

Before I died and went to fish taco heaven, we had guacamole and chips to start- fresh ingredients, perfect ratios, yummy tortilla chips. My margarita was delicious, and our ceviche trio appeared shortly after and did not disappoint...all different, all so good!

From our 3 main courses: fish tacos, carnitas, and steak,  the fish was the star.  Perfectly fried to a crisp golden brown, excellent tortillas, and sauces so good that I wanted to take home by the gallon. SO much wow.

Service was attentive and efficient (and all business, which I am totally down for) and dessert was probably the least memorable.  So much so, that I forgot what we had. I think some kind of cake? With chocolate-something? Not sure exactly, but I&apos;m very sure I was unimpressed. Soooooo maybe skip desert and use that room for a bigger lunch/ dinner...and a few more margs..."
5,"Itis the sister of Topolobampo, but a bit more affordable. I have eaten here any times and appreciate theuseof locally sourced foods. From meats to veggies and greens, the meals here are thoughtfully prepared and will leave you wanting more. Get the ceviche trio and the guac. Best ever. Oh and a margarita. Or two. 
I would highly recommend this place. It is abit noisy, but the food is worth it. 
Make a reservation first."
4,"We&apos;ve been wanting to eat here for a long time and finally had the chance to try their brunch.  We had a 1:30 reservation on a Saturday.  We arrived and were seated immediately.  We were brought water and some spicy peanuts and pepitas very quickly. It took our server a while to get to us but we weren&apos;t in a hurry. We ordered the guac and a couple drinks.  My husband got a spicy drink that looked like a Bloody Mary.  I ordered the horchata con piquete.  My husband said his drink was strong but mine tasted like a very milky horchata.  When we received the bill I found out they brought me the virgin horchata, no wonder I didn&apos;t taste any rum.  

The guac was delivered about 10 mins later along with two salsas.  We enjoyed the guac and I loved the verde salsa!  For lunch/brunch I ordered the chicken tortilla soup and we shared a tamale.  My hubby ordered the chicken with mole.  My soup was really hearty and tasty.  But my hubby&apos;s lunch was so good.  He said it was the best mole he&apos;s had.  The tamale was decent but I prob wouldn&apos;t order it again.  Def check out the bar area, it&apos;s really cool looking."
5,Wow!!! All I can say is wow!!! Every single aspect of our night was perfect. The food was to die for. All the flavors just went together perfectly. The service was absolutely top notch. We will be back very soon!!! Thank you Frontera Grill!
