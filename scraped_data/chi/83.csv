5,"Came here last night with friends, haven&apos;t been back in town for months since I moved away pre-Covid. 

We spent the better part of two hours, catching up and enjoying what ended up being a fantastic meal. 

First off, our server was Kyle and the person assisting at the table was Pepe. Both were on top of everything, and there was never anyone at the table who ever needed to ask for anything, because it was automatically done before anyone would ever think of it. Top level service. 

We started with two orders of the bacon. It was glorious, in all ways. Thought it would be too sweet, with the maple syrup and chocolate playing a larger role, but it was not as prevalent as one would assume. One piece comes with an order, and we definitely struggled to eat it all because we knew apps and entrees are coming soon. 

Bread service- simply glorious! Popovers, with a butter that was seasoned. Crazy tasty, and addictive as hell. It was hard work not asking for another round- I wanted to but I then had the French Onion soup come out. Another person in our party had the crab cake and I got a bite of it. Really tasty, not much filling at all, let the crab meat do its thing and shine. 

The soup? SO GOOD. Broth was unreal, the cheese and crouton kind of got in my way but I am broth addicted so I dealt with it. Difficult to finish the entire bowl, it is a hearty portion. 

I got the filet special, which was 3 medallions, one with horseradish, one with bernaise, and one with blue cheese. I literally was stuffed and only dug into one. Perfectly cooked, super tender, and so flavorful. 

As for sides, we went with the potatoes Au gratin, again SO GOOD! We had so many drinks and I had a few too many so I don&apos;t remember the other side, haha. 

We headed out after so no desserts or coffee. I imagine it would be just as good as everything else. So nice to have a chance to catch up, and enjoy a wonderful meal after being cooped up for so long. The food was excellent, the service was spectacular, many thanks to the chef and the line, Kyle and Pepe. Memorable and a new place I will place on my &quot;having regrets moving from Chicago&quot; list. 

Now I remember-we got the roasted corn. I never tried it, but I remember my buddy loved it."
5,"Back out after a long while for Valentine&apos;s Day! We requested outdoor seating but were inadvertently sat indoors, we rolled with it. They have pretty good spacing with quite the crowd on this particular Saturday. They did a great job of covid protocols. I really liked how they took the entire order upfront and spaced it well within the 90 minute window. 

Be ware the covered outdoor area is not enclosed so sub zero temps will be cold even with a jacket.

My favorite was the thick cut bacon...just pure fatty joy in rich chocolate and syrup. The lemon butter sauce on the stuffed shrimp plate was lickable. The Aged Bone in Rib Eye was near perfect...good temperature, moist, and good sear. I like how they cut it for you also. Pork chop was succulent with a kick. Mac and cheese was ok, more like a cheesy pasta salad. No stand out cocktails. 

All in all a good premium spot with good service...a bit on the pricey end for what you get. It won&apos;t rank number one for Chicago steakhouses but makes a play for top 5, definitely top 10."
5,"I ordered the Thanksgiving takeout meal for my whole family and I&apos;m really glad we chose Prime &amp; Provisions. I ordered 2 meals for my husband and I and I delivered another 2 meals to my parents. The turkey was moist, all the sides were delicious and the portion sizes were generous. It was nice to have turkey and all the fixings you can ever want for only two people without having to do any preparation. I highly recommend Prime &amp; Provisions for holiday to-go meals."
5,"Last night I had the best steak of my life! 
Prime and Provisions certainly delivered the best of the best Chicago steakhouses have to offer. We were seated at a bar area booth which was super cool, great ambiance! (Although my boyfriend found it a little loud).
The wine selection is extensive, you are sure to find something perfect. For our meal we ordered a bottle of the Turley Zinfandel- Rich and Jammy, just right for our taste. 
We ordered the lump crab cesar salad, and though it was fabulous.... unfortunately there was no crab meat in it. We could not get the attention of the waitstaff to let them know, but the Cesar was so good on its own we ate it anyway. 
Our steak was next level. Center cut porterhouse for the win! It was melt in your mouth deliciousness. Served with some seasoned salt and roasted garlic, it was amazing. Loved that it was pre sliced for us too. For sides we ordered mashed potatoes whipped to creamy buttery perfection. Brussels sprouts come with pancetta - absolute heaven. I would definitely recommend, I know I&apos;ll be back!!"
4,"The tomahawk was cooked to the perfect temperature. The meat was tender to the bite. It paired nicely with the lavender salt they had offered to dip it in. I prefer it without though.

The Mac and cheese was really creamy and rich, but it wasn&apos;t too filling. You would keep wanting to come back for a few more bites in between.

You can&apos;t really go wrong with Brussel sprouts and bacon. The bacon were thicker cuts too. I like the contrast of acidic flavors from the Brussel sprouts and the saltiness of the crispy, salty bacon. If they just give me bacon on the side, I would be happy.

The crab legs were sweet and nothing notable about it really.

The only issue I had was where we were seated. Granted, we could have asked to be moved; however, we didn&apos;t think the AC would be blasted by the time we got our food. Every thing came out and it looked amazing. Within 5 minutes, our food got cold and not as enjoyable. Nothing we could have done by that point, it seemed like too much of a hassle to have asked to move ALL of our entrees and side dishes."
4,First things first they definitely follow Covid restrictions. We were dining outside in 40 degree weather. Yes they have heat lamps but I couldn&apos;t enjoy my food because I was freezing my tail off. I stopped a waiter that was walking past to move an extra heat lamp closer to our table but it still didn&apos;t help. Please get more heat lamps for outside dining and some type of covering for bad weather. It started raining on us as well. So we rushed to finish our meals.  I didn&apos;t have a very good experience here though the food was pretty good from what I can remember. I would definitely love to try again after the pandemic is over.
2,"Unfortunately no longer serving Halal.... They used to have creekstone farm steak cuts, but no more, now that get their meat from a different supplier. Went their today, and they were trying to be sneaky, when I didn&apos;t see creekstone farm on the menu, which they had previously, they said their streaks now are Halal rated and not halal certified, when I asked the difference, they said they meat is from beef, which is humanely fed and kept, but are not halal slaughtered. Even though they knew I was a Muslim but they tried to get past the halal rated terminology, ended up eating fish there which frankly wasn&apos;t what I wentt there for.... So after few years of halal delicious steaks, we now have no Halal option."
4,"Finally got out of the house and it was a great night out!! The ambiance was nice even being seated outside. Initially I thought it&apos;d be weird to sit outside in the cold but they had warmers everywhere. Beautiful place, great food, great drinks. 

The only reason I give 4 stars instead of 5 is because I wanted to stay and keep ordering but they needed the table."
5,The best place for fresh oysters in city. Steaks are so delicious. Service top notch. Love theirs happy hours deals.
4,"Came here for my birthday dinner and it was amazing! With Covid going on they had outdoor seating but there were space heaters and it literally felt like we were still done in. We made reservations one hour prior and were seated right away. The staff was on top of their stuff and so friendly.

We ordered the porter cut steak which was enough for my bf and I and it was like half mignon and half New York strip. We also ordered whipped potatoes. The steak was zabiha halal and the meat is provided by creekside. 

We also got a smores dessert on the house and it was soooo good!"
5,"1st things firsts, ask for Nate (Nathaniel) He is the best! Arrived on time for our reservation but we had to wait for about 20 mins before we were seated. Despite that it was a great experience, food was perfect, service was amazing! They even gave us extra popovers to take home to bake! Will definitely be back!

4,"Valentines day table of two-great porterhouse, wine and sides. The restaurant has an amazing ambiance which makes great for a romantic night out!"
4,"A traditional Chicago steakhouse atmosphere. 

Great service and cocktails plus a very nice wine list.

The French onion soup and wedge salad were terrific, as was the broccoli side dish.

Unfortunately, I found the bone-in Kansas City strip to be a bit disappointing.  It had a lot of fat and gristle. For the price point, I expected better.

They sell cigars and have a smoking area outside where one can enjoy a stick and a scotch. (A great scotch list, by the way.) This time of year its pretty chilly despite two propane heaters, but it was nice to be able to smoke a cigar and enjoy a dram after dinner."
3,Excellent ambiance and service but I must agree with some of the other posts... the meat was just not that good as other steakhouses in Chicago. The scallops looked good were subpar. The man cheese and sccalopped potatoes were excellent. The house bread got hard quickly. Thank you for a fun experience with my wife and kids. We did enjoy our time!
3,Excellent prime rib steak cooked to perfection and the whipped potatoes and Mac n cheese were phenomenal. However the outdoor dining experience was very uncomfortable. It&apos;s basically a large tent with heaters and plexyglass shields between tables. It was also way too crowded and tables were not 6 feet apart per pandemic guidelines. The food got cold within a few minutes. Wrong orders were brought or misheard. I would like to go back someday but for indoor dining only.
5,"Mac and Cheese - yes
Broccoli - yes
Bruleed Sweet Potatos - yes
Roasted Corn - yes
Tomahawk - yes
Service - YESSSSS


I was visiting from New York and my local friend suggested this restaurant and I&apos;m SO glad he did.  Emily, our server, was amazing...very attentive and very personable.  I love that you can see the steaks aging in the restaurant.  I couldn&apos;t even rank the food items if I had to....they were all equally delicious.  And the Old Fashion was *perfect*.  I can&apos;t wait to return (after the lockdown is over of course)!"
3,"Just browsing through delivery apps as a pass time these days when I stumbled upon to this spectacular dry aged burger. Big fan of dry aged so had to buy.

The fries and cookie was quite a nice surprise, the burger didn&apos;t say it those came with it so that was a bonus.

Burger was pretty good, it was a classic American burger with tomato, onions, and pickles. The dijonaise was fantastic, had a lemony note that added a nice touch to the burger. Not sure if they seasoned the patty but we felt it was under seasoned. Once we added salt, it all came together. Brioche bun was nice and soft, definitely gave aucheval a run for it&apos;s money. Personally, not a fan of this thiccness but patty was juicy and not tough and I feel like you like thicc patties then you&apos;ll be a big fan of this if was properly seasoned. Also I didn&apos;t get that much dry aged flavor so I wish I had a bit more of that and my roommate said his was bitter so not sure what went wrong there.

Overall I think it was a solid burger but not sure if I&apos;d pay 18$ for it again."
3,"Sounds like brunch is the way to go. I&apos;ll update my review after checking out, but for now 2.75 stars. The two point seven five stars are mostly for service and the non-steak options like the Clam Chowder, Chopped Salad and Chocolate Caramel Cake. My Dry Aged Kansas City Trip wasn&apos;t very good in terms of prep, flavor or texture. Clearly this is a steakhouse and I was expect an amazing steak.

I boxed up nearly the entire steak to repurpose at home (tacos). I know. .. blasphemous for a steak at this price point, but I had no other choice. I couldn&apos;t let it go to waste. Service was provided by a familiar face that I recognized from another steakhouse I prefer. No complaints. He was attentive and did a great job.

I&apos;m a huge steak lover and after two visits I can&apos;t say that I&apos;m enamored with Prime &amp; Provisions. Maybe that&apos;ll change if I try brunch :-|"
4,"Alaskan King Crab Legs - very good I enjoyed every last bite. 
Hand-cut Filet Mignon 10oz- Kind of dry for being medium cooked.
Macaroni and Cheese - VERY CHEESY, loved loved loved
French fries- can never go wrong with some yummy fries."
5,"BRUNCH ALERT! Omg! Went for brunch during Chicago Restaurant Week. When I saw that they were listed as a brunch option, I literally called the restaurant to ask if the experience was going to be the same as regular brunch at $24, as opposed to $59 on other Sundays. Sure enough, hostess confirmed and so did my bill. We booked reservation a month in advance and couldn&apos;t wait!

I first knew about this brunch from a social media influencer (also my Yelp friend) who attended and posted on Instagram. P&amp;P- your marketing intention worked! I immediately bookmarked it and was trying to pick a special occasion that&apos;ll have me go downtown and spend $$$$ on a brunch. What do ya know, Chicago restaurant week was a perfect time! 

The experience is everything you see in photos, but so much better. I&apos;ve been here for dinner so I knew what it was like for steak night out. Brunch is different; it&apos;s a buffet. There&apos;s a chicken &amp; waffle station, prime rib, egg omelette, maybe Mac &amp; cheese (but I missed it), cold seafood bar (colossal shrimp cocktails, oysters, and crab legs), smoked salmon, hot breakfast items, oatmeal, granola bar &amp; fruits, pastries, desserts, and infamous dessert Ferris wheel. They have just about everything you&apos;d look for in brunch. 

I don&apos;t get to eat crustaceans so much because I&apos;ve got a diningmate with allergies so this was my opportunity to have some! I remember paying $$$$ for just a few pieces for dinner but during brunch, it was UNLIMITED- well, limit yourself to all you can eat haha. I remember how much I enjoyed atomic horseradish previously and it was a real kick to the meal! Although I love shrimp cocktails, to my surprise, I actually liked raw oysters better. I&apos;m quite a picky oyster eater and I must&apos;ve gone on a good day because these were the sweet oysters, I&apos;m guessing from the East Coast. They were smaller in size, but plump! It was not briny. 

I got to eat several items from the hot food station such as bacon, egg benedict, and breakfast potatoes. They were all good. I&apos;m still a newb to chicken &amp; waffles. But let me tell you, these were good. If every chicken &amp; waffles were supposed to taste this way, I will order it every time! It was the perfect world of sweet and savory, AND buttery! That was a highlight towards my end of the meal and I&apos;m glad I&apos;ve waited in line for it! 

The music set the perfect mood for dining- great job, DJ! The violinist performing added a fancy twist to it. I came at noon when it was prime brunch time- people walking in and also the ones that were toward the end of their meal. By the time I walked it at 2, there were many empty table, no more oysters so it needed to be refilled, plates constantly running out so people had to wait. If you&apos;re paying $60 for a meal, come before noon when it&apos;s at the busy beginning. 

I ordered pomegranate mint. It&apos;s alcohol free and it was delish! Next time I&apos;ll get a cocktail from there. So far my favorite brunch buffet in the US."
