5,"I LOVE THIS PLACE. Definitely a more up-scale dinner but awesome for a date night, work dinner or special occasion. 

The cocktail shrimp is my boyfriend &amp; I&apos;s absolute favorite! If you like horseradish, you will love this cocktail sauce. 

Lobster Mac &amp; cheese is my next favorite and have ordered it as my meal multiple times.

They also have great covid measures in place and I am looking forward to coming back! 

Also - service is amazing! I think the manager has served us a couple times now &amp; he&apos;s great &amp; even remembered us! I feel terrible I don&apos;t remember his name but you &amp; the staff are awesome!"
5,"Incredible seafood, service and drink list. I&apos;ve never had branzino and the fresh bread was so good with a hint of sea salt. Indoor and outdoor seating. Parking meters are nearby, I went on a Saturday after 5. I&apos;m in love. Can&apos;t wait to return."
5,"I had a random craving for oysters on a Tuesday evening so after some Googling and reading reviews, I settled on this place. I had a reservation for outdoor seating but after seeing how relatively open and spaced out the tables were inside, I changed my mind and went with inside seating instead. The staff were able to accommodate, which was great. 

I ordered 6 oysters, all of which were great. My boyfriend went with the fish and chips and we split the lobster Mac &apos;n cheese. Food was delicious. Service was good too. This is a bit pricey, but the ambience was nice and I felt comfortable dining inside even with COVID. They made sure to space out the tables and everyone had masks on. This is probably more of a splurge-y place but I would come back if I&apos;m in the area or if I am craving oysters again."
4,"My wife and I were looking for a new dining experience for our night out and we chose this place based on the reviews. The restaurant is very nice. It&apos;s obvious that the staff has taken every measure to ensure every inch of the restaurant is clean.  All Covid requirements were in place and being followed with little disruption to the dining experience. GT does have a time limit in place. You have an hour and 45 minutes (for a party of 2) from the time you are seated to complete your meal. At first I thought it would feel rushed but Hannah our server did an amazing job of taking orders and bringing everything out in a timely manner which allowed our experience to flow nicely and even allowed me time for an after dinner drink and an espresso for my wife. 

The food was all fresh and well prepared. We ordered 2 dozen oysters. On this day they offered two from the east coast and two from the west. The shrimp cocktail was top notch. The pinch of fresh dill was not something I had on a Shrimp Cocktail before but was definitely a pleasant surprise . My wife ordered the Branzino served with pickled red onions and a pea puree. She enjoyed it but she wished it was served with some type of rice. All entrées are served A la carte  and it wasn&apos;t available as an option. I was not incredibly hunger after all of the oysters and shrimp so I elected to have the clam chowder which was really really good. Many times clam chowder is overwhelming fishy, but this particular version was not. The Chowder was very fresh, clean and tasty. I would go back just for this clam chowder. 
Overall our experience was enjoyable. There was nothing extraordinary  about it which is the reason for 4 stars. But we will definitely return and give them a chance to earn that fifth star."
5,"Amaze! Everything from the food, service, drinks, and ambiance is all perfetto. You can pretty much point to anything and trust that it will be good. I&apos;ve been here twice and tried the Hand You&apos;re Dealt and Honey Thyme cocktails and they&apos;re both excellent. For food I have tried the tuna poke, Thai coconut soup, french fries, and a couple other items. The service is above and beyond. Even if it&apos;s a bit chilly, opt to sit outside; they have heaters that are quite toasty! Can&apos;t wait to return soon!"
5,"Amazing food and service!
Cheers to this establishment and GM Jasmine Perales, 
And in particular Bryan who went above and beyond to give great service. Prior to coming, I spoke to GM Perales who generously offered to make the Birthday weekend special for my wife and group. We arrived on a really busy Valentines evening and was a bit concerned with the wait as my young adult kids had another venue to visit this All Star Weekend. Cue to Brian who basically took over from very pleasant Ethan and assured us we would enjoy great food, service and be on time. Sure enough as soon as we were seated, treats started coming over  with a round of Champaign and nice spring bruchetta appetizer on the house. 
 
The meals were exquisite, the winner being the scallops in a cauliflower puré and zucchini. The gnocchi was a close second. Just as we thought  the meal couldn&apos;t get better, we got the desserts that literally &quot;takes the cake&quot; here!! Amongst the chocolate cake, cheesecake and carrot cake (all given with homemade sorbet), the carrot cake really took the cake- carrot cake on top of whipped cream cheese icing with vanilla sorbet ice cream. BTW Bryan very generously paid for one of our desserts which is really rare and is a sign of an exceptional restaurant and staff when this is done (we tipped as if everything was included). So delicious were the desserts , they should win an award!! Would highly recommend coming here for the food, service, and especially the deserts!!!
 
My complements to GM Perales and her staff. She came around frequently to check on us. GM Jasmine and Bryan YOU ROCK!!!"
5,"Was so impressed by this place!  Seafood was so fresh and delicious.  Portion sizes were great, service was excellent and the food tasted amazing!  It had a great romantic ambiance and I&apos;m so glad we saved it for our last night in towns dinner."
5,"Such a pleasant experience on New Year&apos;s Eve with the family. Every dish we ordered was delicious and yummy! 2 dozen oysters , salmon crudo, shrimp bruschetta and salmon filled deviled eggs to kickstart the evening with awesome cocktails and  non alcoholic beverages.
Main course was mussels, lobster roll, fish tacos, Mac and cheese. Fish and chips and whole trout fish . It was a feast fit for the royals. I was so stuffed but kids and hubby kept at it and ordered key lime pie for
Dessert.  It was roughly about $100 plus dollars/ person with tax and tip.  I was so full that I decided to walk home even though it was bitter cold evening just to
digest the gigantic meal. Great way to wrap 2019 on Yelp!!"
5,"This place came well recommended and I see why. It&apos;s voted as one of the best restaurants in Chicago. The hubby took me here for my birthday and we had a FANTASTIC time! 

Our server was super friendly and very attentive. 

[Drinks] 

The drinks were delish! Full of alcohol and interesting flavor. They are well worth the cost as I only needed one to feel right! 

[Appetizers]

We ordered various oysters and a wedge salad. The wedge salad had the classic bleu cheese dressing, but tasted homemade. The bacon was INCREDIBLE! Fresh, crunchy and TASTY! I&apos;m not that big of a fan of raw oysters but these were beyond incredible. 

They were super fresh! I was also allowed to choose a grilled oyster and it was so flavorful! 

[Meal]

My salmon was very very good. The lobster Mac and cheese was a nice hit, but I do think the cost is pricey. However, the food is good, ambiance swanky, and service superb! 

The restaurant is newly opened I believe, so they gave us a gift card for a return visit. We returned the next day for happy hour and had their $1 oysters (various kinds), wedge salad and wine. 

The happy hour is a great deal considering oysters range from $3+ during normal dinner service top notch, so it&apos;s well worth the cost."
5,"{first time dining here} What a lovely experience! Originally, we had made our reservation to dine outdoors; however, the Chicago temps have been unseasonably cool for August, and I called about three hours before I reservation to ask if we could be seated inside. &quot;Absolutely. No problem,&quot; was the response over the phone. Great start!

Upon arrival, it is clear they are taking all necessary precautions to make diners feel safe &amp; comfortable: masks, frequent cleaning, socially distancing, and so forth. I will say the inside of the restaurant is really lovely &amp; comfortable (though the lighting is a tad dark for my taste). 

We had a great experience - from the attentive, stellar service, to the amazingly delicious food (their crab cake and the mac &amp; cheese? not to be missed!) - I really cannot praise this restaurant enough."
5,"I&apos;ve visited this restaurant for both a full dinner and happy hour. This is definitely a great seafood restaurant to try in the River North area. During my first visit for my birthday dinner last year, the restaurant was super busy and seated us after our reservation time. I barely noticed that they were running behind with seating us, but I appreciated the acknowledgement from our server and the high level of service they gave us during our visit. 

The prices are in line with most other seafood restaurants in this neighborhood. You will likely spend a good amount of money here, but it is worth it. The seafood is of high quality and fresh. I love the Thai coconut soup and oysters. The oysters are half off Monday-Friday from 4pm-6pm."
5,"This is one of the first times I&apos;ve ventured out during Covid-19, and I&apos;m very glad I chose this restaurant to do so at. The staff were all extremely sanitary, wearing gloves and masks to keep things clean and safe. I didn&apos;t feel worried at all. They kept a 6-foot distance in between tables. Like many restaurants, they have the menu available through a QR code you scan with your phone&apos;s camera. Thank you for all of your efforts in keeping your customers safe. 

The food:
My husband and father ordered a selection of oysters and both loved them. My father also ordered a smoked fish dip (that myself and my 1-year-old daughter loved), and a shrimp cocktail. He enjoyed all of those. My husband ordered the fish and chips - loved the chips and had to have me taste one - and the lobster Mac and cheese. The lobster Mac had lots of lobster pieces and was delicious.  Myself and my mother ordered the shrimp bruschetta which was very light and refreshing with grapefruit used as an ingredient. We also ordered the Alaskan halibut. This wasn&apos;t my favorite. The fish was a beautiful texture, but I just didn&apos;t like the flavors around the plate. It was a little too pungent for my liking. 
I would recommend ordering an appetizer, main and a side if you are very hungry. The fish and chips is a larger portion, but our Alaskan halibut was not - which was a perfect size for me.

The restaurant is decorated lovely. It&apos;s got that dark mood lighting, but doesn&apos;t feel dingy or too dark in the place. It has a nautical theme that is very classy. The waiters were very attentive and well-versed in the menu.

I will be back to this restaurant"
5,"Went to Chicago for my birthday and my friend took me to this restaurant for my birthday dinner because he knows I LOVE oysters.  When first arriving to the restaurant, I liked the atmosphere--dim lighting and seemed a bit upscale.  Of course we started with oysters for the appetizer!  Our waiter recommended 3 that we should definitely try, so we had 2 of each.  I do not recall the names of the different oysters except for the &quot;Big Cove&quot; because that was my favorite--definitely try!  

For dinner, my friend had the Duck Leg Confit, I had the Gnocchi with Shrimp and Squid, and we ordered a side of Mac n Cheese.  Everything was SUPERB!!!  I literally still think about the Gnocchi and how tasty it was.  To end the night, I was presented with a birthday custard of some kind in an oyster shell, which was unsurprisingly tasty as well.  

This was my first time visiting Chicago and first restaurant I visited.  I always hear that Chicago is known for the food and for this to be my first dining experience while being there, the bar was set for the rest of the trip.  If you are ever in the Chicago area and love oysters as much as I do, check this place out; you will not be disappointed!"
3,"I have to say I was such a naysayer when I was presented with the menu and seeing the exorbitant prices. It was pretty shocking and pretty much had my mind set that at these prices the food better knock me off my seat. It didn&apos;t. 

There were 2 separate dining areas and when you enter there&apos;s a large bar area with high tops and regular seating. We had 9:00 reservations and the host tried to seat us smack dab right at the entrance door. Obvi we asked for a different table and were then seated in the main room which was definitely more convivial. I don&apos;t get host mentality.

Other than the slight hickup, Service-wise everyone was excellent especially our server Katie. 

Started with a dozen oysters and for 6 bucks an oyster I was expecting to find at least a pearl in one of them. No such luck. Shaw&apos;s still has the best and freshest oysters IMO. 

Also had the deviled eggs at 8 bucks a pop. They were probably laid by a golden chicken. Presentation was excellent and the egg was indeed delicious so I have to say this one was worth it.

Wedge salad too was very delicious.
Clam chowder was delicious but Shaw&apos;s has this one beat again. 

My entree was the sea bass and it was good but didn&apos;t quite blow me away. Others got the trout and another gnocchi. All the entrees were delicious but definitely not worth the price point.

We came here for a special occasion and it worked out fine but probably would not dine here again until I win the lotto."
4,"Went here last night with my husband. I would rate our experience a 4.5
First, outdoor dining is available. My husband reserved our dinner online and was able to select outdoor dining during the process. 

COVID - Previously, masks can be removed when seated. But, with the new health guidelines, customers are now asked to put on their masks when an employee approaches your table when orders are being taken or food/drinks being dropped off. This kind of got annoying because you respectfully rush to put your mask on mid chew and conversation when your waiter/waitress comes to your table while he/she stands there awkwardly. This is certainly not against the restaurant; merely a FYI of what you will expect during your dining experience. Otherwise, the staff was masked and had gloves on. However, I am not sure if they change gloves between customers. Just a thought..

Food: (1) house bread with butter was great! Not sure if this is supposed to be requested by the customers or automatically served because we had to ask for it.. I knew this was being served from Yelp and noticed it on every customer&apos;s table as the hostess walked us to our table as well. So, no biggie. (2) Clam chowder was great! The hot sauce drizzled on top along with the house made crackers were delicious! (3) We ordered 6 oysters; they were plump and juicy! (4) Husband ordered the lobster roll and had nothing but nice things to say; especially the onion strings that it is served with! (5) I ordered the mussels for my entree- the red sauce was very tasty! Only comment I have regarding this dish is that the 4 large pieces of toasted bread it was served with was too oily to my liking.

Overall, it was a great dining experience. Service was great all things considered. It certainly caters to the area well and is worth the try."
5,"Amazing experience and food! Went here on their first night of indoor dining and felt absolutely safe and comfortable. They have done an amazing job with covid-19 restrictions and the ambiance is lovely! We had fresh oysters, seafood cavatelli, and the mussels, all were delicious! Our waiter Alex also brought us complimentary oyster po&apos;boy sliders which was a pleasant and yummy surprise! Alex was such a gracious server and we will definitely be back, congratulations GT on a great first night back indoors!"
5,Scott and Hanna are the best. We had seabass and trout. I&apos;d say the trout had more flavor but both were wonderful. We couldn&apos;t pass up the lobster Mac and cheese or their French fries. Oooooo the fries dipping sauces were a delight!!!! The service was spot on and the food was great for our 20th wedding anniversary. Enjoyed the cocktails a little too much but still loved the food.
4,"My cousins and I came here on December 30th because T felt like eating seafood. I&apos;ve been meaning to try the lobster roll here so thankfully it wasn&apos;t busy! 

Ambiance: Fresh and modern with white walls and bright lighting. We also sat by the window so the natural light was A+. I quite enjoyed the quote about what fish and men have in common haha 

Service: There wasn&apos;t too many people when we came in for brunch so the service was pretty fast. There was one lady serving waters, one waiter taking our orders, and another guy; they all seemed to bunch by the cash register near our table (in the middle of the floor), and when they&apos;re all mumbling and randomly looking at us, it does seem like they&apos;re talking about us. I mean, I know we took a lot of iPhone and Polaroid pictures but we were just commemorating our Girls Day Out. We looked cute and felt cute. We were also the youngest customers so maybe they&apos;re not used to it. They at least could&apos;ve stood somewhere else (again, pretty empty). 

Food: We ordered the Shrimp and Grits, Mac N Cheese, and Maine Lobster Roll. Shareable portions and they all tasted pretty good! They were kind enough to split our roll into 3 pieces, but if we were to come back, we would get the warm lobster roll with butter rather than the traditional preparation. Traditional was the waiter&apos;s suggestion but we didn&apos;t like that it was made to be cold. 

Overall a nice venue and good food but probably won&apos;t come back."
4,"This is a classic Chicago restaurant. You should go if you like seafood.

We had a bit of a wait which was strange considering I saw open tables, we had reservations, and it was a weekday. Idk. And it was a bit chilly inside. 

My friend got scallops (yummy but small portion) and a few oysters. Yum.

I got the restaurant week menu. The shrimp bruschetta was small but really good- there was a delicious green (avocado?) spread that really pulled it together. Second course was the wedge salad (I would&apos;ve preferred the clam chowder but they couldn&apos;t remove the bacon). The wedge salad was ok, I just don&apos;t love bleu cheese dressing...  

Main course was the lobster roll, which was delicious but not worth the $18 upcharge. Oops, I should&apos;ve read the menu closer. 

For desserts we got the chocolate layer cake- beautiful presentation and textures. My friends dessert- the flan tart- was to die for. Goat cheese mousse and blood orange passionfruit sorbet- these are a few of my favorite things! Warning- probably too tart for most people. 

Will definitely be back. I need to take advantage of their fresh oyster selection and seafood tower."
5,"First off, I want to talk about the oysters here.  They were the smoothest and cleanest oysters I have ever had.  I imagined that they went to a spa, had a good massage and a scrub down and then got plated for my enjoyment.

Secondly, the service here was incredible.  The wait staff was attentive, but not overbearing.  I dropped a fork and as soon as I tried to reach down to pick it up, someone came by to swoop it up and hand me a new fork.  My water glass was always filled.

The scallops we ordered were perfectly cooked, meaty and not mushy.  The seafood here definitely outshine the veggies and other stuff that accompanied them on the plate.

We ordered key lime pie for dessert and I thought it was a nice touch that they used powdered chocolate to spell out &quot;Happy Anniversary&quot; on the plate.
