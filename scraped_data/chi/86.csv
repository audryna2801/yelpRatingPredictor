5,"When restaurants reopened, my fiancé and I were excited to eat out for Valentine&apos;s Day and try Tanta for the first time. We opted to go for a brunch and enjoyed everything we ate!

We had chicken empanadas to start and split two brunch specials: the shrimp and grits and the steak and eggs. All the food was delicious! We actually couldn&apos;t finish it all so we brought it home. The steak and eggs were still very good the next day.

We got mimosas for the table which came with two juices - traditional orange and a purple Peruvian one. Very yum. 

Staff was friendly and covid compliant. We will definitely be back once it warms up to try out their rooftop for happy hour!

Thanks for an amazing Valentines Day meal!"
5,"My FAVORITE restaurant in Chicago! Authentic tasty dishes from Peru, everything on the menu is delicious ranging from their fresh cebiches to their savory empanadas. Some things to highlight on the menu are: 

Nigiri pobre - bite sized taste of heaven with wagyu beef topped with a quail egg! Highly recommend this scrumptious appetizer 
Arroz con mariscos - lovely seafood medley paella, not too salty just right 
Lomo Saltado - classic Peruvian stir fry dish with tender beef and fries 

Tanta has nice booth seating downstairs and also a nice patio upstairs. Don&apos;t forget to check out their cocktail menu. El chignon is their famous tequila/mezcal drink with a fancy round ice ball made with chili pepper so if you like spicy margaritas would recommend. And one of my favorite drinks is actually the Chicha morada which is a purple non alcoholic Peruvian drink that is very refreshing and made from fermented purple corn. 

I always have an amazing time at Tanta, the dishes are so good I could eat them time and time again. Also a fantastic place if you have friends or family in town because it will never disappoint!"
5,"I am obsessed with Peruvian food and equally as obsessed with Tanta. I live a few blocks away and have enjoyed every meal I have had there as well as takeout. Their rooftop in particular is phenomenal and cant wait for warmer weather to enjoy it again. Make sure to get the El Chingon and an order of the chicken empanadas, you won&apos;t regret it."
4,"I came to Tanta with my girlfriend and a friend of ours during one of those 0 degree days.  We had the option to sit upstairs inside, or upstairs on their patio.  The patio actually would have been doable because there were a ton of heaters, but we opted for inside.  The ambiance is really cool regardless of where you are.  I thought the service was pretty good as well.

We ordered a bunch of dishes to share.  Honestly my favorite way to eat.  We got the Cebiche Mixto,  a couple empanadas, the fried yuca, the Tallarin, and the Saltado.  It was all pretty good!  The Tallarin was super creamy and delicious.  Similar to a cacio e pepe.  The fried yuca was also really good.  I would strongly recommend making sure you get the yuca.  The Cebiche was good as well, you can&apos;t go wrong with cebiche, and I thought Tanta&apos;s was pretty good.  It didn&apos;t blow me away, but this place is definitely worth a visit."
4,"Been spending this week hitting as many happy hours as I can If you all are thinking of hitting one today try out happy hour at @tantachicago. My experience was good and the food was unique. I gave 4 stars only because some of the items were a bit too unique for me. Overall really good!

Pictured : tequenos de lomito, empanada limena, anticucho de pollo, and the la guapa cocktail!"
4,"Another Sunday, another brunch. We land at Tanta from a friends recommendation and I&apos;m glad we did. The food is amazing! Since it was our first time we just order a few things and shared, starting with the mimosas for the table ($30.00). Next we had the pork fried rice, very flavorful! The cooked Ceviche, not sure what that sauce is made from but it&apos;s a must and the grand finale was the Fried chicken and fresh donuts- a show stopper. Our waitress was very helpful with selecting our meal and the food came out pretty fast. If your in the mood for a Peruvian brunch, this is your place."
5,"I&apos;ve never had the opportunity to say I had Peruvian food until I dined here this year. I went on a blazing summer afternoon, so I opted out of the rooftop option. The indoor of the restaurant had a modern sleek vibe to it - black walls, wooden furniture, and cool light fixtures. The server we had was extremely helpful in suggesting what to order. We ordered the arroz con mariscos, fried yuca, and ceviche. I thought this was quite filling for two people. The flavors were well spiced and remarkable. I loved them so much! My favorite was probably the ceviche. The next time I go back, I want to try the special where you pay a fixed amount and you get to try a variety of things on the menu. 

The drinks are unique and tasteful. I tried some of the pisco sour and la rosita - both amazing. I also drank the chingon, which was different. There&apos;s a pepper ice cube in the center that makes the drink spicy; kind of threw me off in the beginning, but I ended up liking it a lot. 

Great service with amazing food served in a fun environment. Highly recommend !"
5,"First place that Brianna J. and I want after indoor dining reopened in Chicago (!!!) and it did not disappoint. This place is HUGE--upstairs, downstairs, and a heated patio. Would be perfect for a big birthday brunch, lunch or dinner. Our server was eager to give us the deets on all the Peruvian inspired drinks and dishes. All of our drinks were yummy and bright-- they used fun and unique ingredients like egg whites, cinnamon and bitters. My fave dish were the yucca fries, which were hot and fresh and, of course fried! The empanadas were also good and 1 per person was plenty. Both came with sauces that emphasized the Peruvian roots. Our server was also a mixologist which was very impressive and she mixed us up some convenient drinks to take to-go on our 2-block journey to dinner. Can&apos;t wait to come back for a full meal!"
4,"I first heard about Tanta from a colleague who said they have amazing food, but that&apos;s not all they had. Tanta also has a great happy hour special from 4-6! 

I brought a group of around 6 people here for happy hour. We were excited to try all of their happy hour treats and bites. We ordered all of their appetizers too and got full lol. 

The cocktails are only $10 each during happy hour and they were delicious. I&apos;d recommend anything with Mezcal.

Can&apos;t wait to come back here for happy hour again!"
4,"Look, if I have to go to Chicago for Peruvian food, so be it ! Gosh I wish GR had a Peruvian place, GR Yelpers please share if you&apos;ve found one !! 

Everything we had was delicious!! Everything! Now I will say that there was a lot of spice in these dishes. I&apos;ve been to a few Peruvian restaurants in Miami and don&apos;t recall so much spice. I&apos;m not sure if that&apos;s native  to Peruvian cuisine, but it was still very good. 

My favs- 
Fried yuca, oh my goodness ! Do you know what love is? It&apos;s fried yuca, that&apos;s it lol ! They purée the yuca first then fry it, genius! 

Ceviche, wow! Perfect! Cooked well, flavorful, and hearty! They didn&apos;t skimp on the seafood but also made sure to put the crunchy and soft corn. It was very good! 

The seating area was also very cute! You can&apos;t go wrong with roof top dining. The music was all Latin favs so really got me vibin. Great experience overall, I will definitely be back to try some other mocktails and dishes !"
5,"What an amazing restaurant and such a great experience we had!

A few months ago we were enjoying our weekend in Chicago and I was suggested by a Peruvian friend to visit this place and have the best of his cuisine in the US.

Well, we knew this place was going to be pricey but thinking about it sometimes you spend a lot of money and get either a bad experience or food that is not worth it however this place is definitely worth it.

The place is amazing, their decoration, their ambiance everything made our evening very delightful.

It was a group of three people and we decided to try as much as we could and we enjoyed every dish.

Check my photos so you can link with the following description:

Lomo saltado- stir fried meat (super tender) with red onions, tomatoes, garlic, soy oyster sauce, cilantro served with potatoes;

Arroz chafa- this is a fusion of peruvian-Asian cuisine, pork fried rice, shrimp omelet, veggies, scallio lons and spicy Nikkei sauce;

Fish anticuchos- chefs selection fish, potatoes, chimichurri and cebichera sauce;

Cebiche- this version of cebiche is an different way of regular ceviche as it has crispy corn kernels and interesting taste;

Causa peruana- this is a traditional recipe as potatoes are the thing in Peru so it was what fed soldiers who endure the battle so it was for the causa or the reason; anyway this dish is a foamy mashed potatoes with ají.

In addition to help digest my dinner (yeah right haha) I had a couple of drinks with pisco which is their traditional drink and they were the bomb!"
4,"We came here in the height of Covid for takeout and had a bad experience.  We ordered our food and drove to get it only to find out they forgot some items.  When we called back they were not even apologetic but simply told me we would get. A refund    

This would be my message to the owners, the management, and the chef who likely work hard at what they do ....: this food is not inexpensive and it is wildly unacceptable to simply leave stuff out.   Someone has to be checking orders as they go out the door. 

All this said.    The food was flipping amazing.    It really was."
5,"I was in Chicago for a work project. 
My colleague and I decided to eat here one night. I have had Peruvian food in Miami but it was my colleagues first time having this genre.
Everything we ordered was fantastic!  My absolute favorite dishwas  Arroz con Mariacos. The combinations of of seafood, rice, and rocoto aioli made this Peruvian style paella a dish to remember for years to come! 
I have had Ceviche before and the Cebiche de Esquina did not disappoint. 
I also enjoyed the Nigri Pobre a lot. The qual egg added the &quot;umpf&quot; needed  to make the rice and steak bite delectable.

The atmosphere was trendy. 

I was impressed with the restaurants COVID-19 protocol. We had a time limit  and were required to wear masks when staff was around. All staff were also wearing face coverings.
The staff members were friendly.
My only minor complaint is that the arroz dish took a very long time to come out. My  colleague and I were worried that it wouldn&apos;t come out before our time at the restaurant was up.
But everything worked out luckily.

I would HIGHLY recommend TANTAS to anyone visiting the Chicago area.
My colleague was quite impressed with Peruvian flair and she is looking forward to trying the cuisine in other cities."
5,Beautiful restaurant with an amazing rooftop. We did the Tanta Experience for dinner and it was worth every cent. Both the salmon and the steak were excellent. To top it all off the chocolate mousse dessert was one of the best I have ever had! Awesome restaurant that I will visit again &amp; again
5,"Wow! Wow! Wow! We came here to enjoy the mini course meal for our one year anniversary. We left more than full and satisfied. Our meal included anything from octopus and seafood to steak and potatoes and many other things in between. Our waitress came to our table and explain each of the meals including how to eat it and what flavors to pay attention to. The food came out very quickly and was prepared deliciously. We were shocked with the price as well for such a elegant, extravagant, many course meal, it was very reasonably priced! I recommend going and trying!"
5,"We absolutely loved Tanta and can&apos;t wait to go back. Our server, we forget her name was super. Friendly and informative and always knew when to check in.  My first cocktail, El Chingon was killer- gotta love Tequila. Then when I thought it couldn&apos;t get better, the bartender happened to walk by and check in our drinks and he offered El Macho. Such a great bourbon. A perfect 10. The ceviche mixto was so delish. Zero complaints. We shared the arroz con mariscos. Pretty good over all but the beef tenderloin was ridiculous. Seriously so good. We ended happily with the coffee chocolate mousse which I&apos;m not usually a fan of but in this case was pleasantly surprised.  Great experience there!"
5,"My bf took me here for my birthday and we had such a great dinner. We had a corn empanada, a chicharrón bao, the pulpo anticucho and tallarín con lomo al jugo (steak pasta) everything was so good. Our waitress was extremely friendly and attentive. The only downside was that we felt like the pulpo anticucho was a bit over priced for the portion $18 for only two small pieces (shown in picture). Other than that everything was great"
5,"enjoyed happy hour drinks and bites here. loved their chicken empandas, but I didn&apos;t care for their Yuka fries lol my friend loved them and ended up taking them home to enjoy the next day (reheated well). they offer togo drinks!! we took advantage of them and enjoyed them on our walk. i recommend this place. so spacious and beautifully decorated. very friendly and nice staff."
5,"(tourist review) 

What&apos;s Good: here&apos;s what we got for the 2 of us and it was an amazing meal: Pulpo Anticucho (octopus) &amp; Cebiche Chalaco to start. Any of the Cebiches is a must, in fact - delicious. Lomo Saltado &amp; Chaufa Aeropuerto (pork fried rice) for entrees. Share everything. Pisco Sours to top everything off. Couldn&apos;t be happier.

Other Notes: Located at River North in the middle of the nightly hustle and bustle, so it&apos;s easy to find a bar for before or after. Parking is typical downtown parking, in other words, cab it."
4,I&apos;ve been wanting to visit this restaurant for a while. Glad I finally went last weekend. The arroz con mariscos was so good!
