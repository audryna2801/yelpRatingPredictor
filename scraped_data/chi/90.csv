4,"There is street meter and lot parking. There is a cool mural of monroe on the side of the building when talking towards the front entrance 

Got seated immediately but I am sure this place was slammed before the pandemic. Host was friendly. Must say the ambience is very swanky and unique, very cool. 

Ordered calamari as an app and the senator chicken. I was with friends so I had some of their dishes as well. 

The salmon and steak dishes are excellent but the chicken I had was cooked right, as juicy but not flavorful at all..., not even seasoning. The chicken was stale. If the chicken was decent I definitely would have given this place 5 stars, but overall good experience. Our server was great and the desserts street tasty."
5,"Exceeded expectations! I always saw this place like a spot out of towners would go to. Maybe so but it definitely has great food, drinks and vibes. Due to COVID we sat outside on the side patio, less noisy but some odd smells with the wind. However, the food and service was great. We got the gaucho steak, lobster mac and cheese (tons of lobster meat), skirt steak (great rice), and cigar dessert (great presentation)! The Cuban was a delicious drink, more like a tiki drink."
5,"Definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. To start I always have to get their cotton candy martini, it&apos;s perfectly balanced and soo fun to watch them pour it in front of you! My girlfriends and I usually share a bunch of dishes because we can&apos;t pick a favorite. Everything is prepared perfectly, so much amazing flavor, and the service is top notch! Even through this pandemic they continue to impress!"
5,"I avoided Carnivale for over a decade.  I would see it from the highway and it just seemed loud looking and gimmicky.  It is a blast of colors. But man, did I miss the mark on this restaurant.  

This place is aging well.  You look at the pictures online and it looks like a circus.  But once inside, it&apos;s like being transported to something truly authentic and magical.  Definitely a first date good impression place.

Every single thing we ordered was perfect, so I don&apos;t really know how to give a review on specific dishes.  

I truly hope that Carnivale makes it through the upcoming challenges for restaurants in Chicago this fall and winter.   Great restaurants and access to culture in general are why we live in cities.  Places like Carnivale deserve our dollars.  

Will return soon!"
5,"Okay, the decor at this place just may be one of my all time favorites! The food was sensational (see photos) and more importantly, service was fabulous! We were lucky to have Ricardo by the bar and Maya in the dining room - I would highly recommend them both. I can NOT wait to come back here! My personal favorite dishes of the ones ordered were the coconut shrimp appetizer and definitely the paella. Thanks for having us!"
5,"Food was delicious, staff was great! We went here to celebrate my friend&apos;s birthday. The food is of good quality and everything was in good portions. They gave my friend a cotton candy type of dessert for her birthday. Pricing is average for Chicago, drinks a bit on the pricey side but they have some good cocktails."
4,The service was incredible! The orders were ready in time. The food was ok and cocktails were all kinda sweet. It is a bit pricey but it&apos;s a good place to try something different from the usual.
4,"Hadn&apos;t been here in a couple of years and actually came in as party of 6 and got a table with out reservations. I always love how bright and welcoming Carnivale is! We had guacamole as our appetizer , in my opinion it lacked flavor. I had a Mai Tai which is always strong &amp; a coconut mojito which i would recommend if you&apos;re a coconut person. For dinner I had pork on a bed of arroz con gandules which i enjoyed to the last bite 9/10!  
Since we were celebrating two birthdays we got a birthday slice on the house along with a song.
That slice of chocolate cake was very delicious and the raspberry tang really compliments the sweetness of the cake!"
5,"This place is great! Great atmosphere and just a fun place to come for a date night, or with a group of friends. I came with a group, and we shared a few dishes.  I really like salmon, and we ordered the Faroe Island Salmon and it was fantastic!   We also had the the Arrachera Wood-grilled skirt steak,  with congri, cherry, bacon sofrito, balsamic onions, and chimichurri and it delivered as well. The Peruvian Chicken was good, but I preferred the Salmon and the skirt steak. I had the plantains and sofrito rice and both were very good.

The coconut shrimp and the calamari satisfied, and I also liked my Caesars Salad. I am not a big dessert guy, but I had a small bite of the Cuban Cigar, and was was very tasty.  Of course I had a few mojitos during my experience, and they went perfect with my meal.

Everyone in my group enjoyed our experience, and I cannot wait for my next business trip to Chicago so I can come back to enjoy the Carniavle.

Stay hungry my friends..."
5,"When I walked in, I was astounded by the fabulous decor. Although dimly lit, the scenery is full of great art and creativity everywhere. We were welcomed by an energetic waiter who improved the mood of our party. We had an attentive waiter who was very polite and focused on our needs. We never had a moment whereas we were trying to figure out where the waiter went. I stayed hydrated with the endless supply of water. 

My choice from the menu was the lamb chops. They were tender and well spiced, with a lamb empenada in the center of the dish. There was enough meat to fill two people. Tender vegetables surrounded the lamb. For sides, the guacamole had a perfect flavor of sweetness and spiciness. The coolest dessert was the the gigantic organic cotton candy. It looked like a pink wig placed on top of a glass of caramel popcorn, but tasted delicious. I can&apos;t forget to mention the rich and decadent chocolate cake dessert that could feed three people. Lastly, the take out bags are recyclable paper bags, with a separate bag for each person."
5,"Made reservation for 4 This last Saturday and we were seated prompted. The place is beautifully decorated. Ambiance is great. We had to use QR reader for the menu. Although the menu is limited, they have great selection of food. Our waiter was excellent and we were constantly being taken care of. We ordered senator chicken, paella, steak, and salmon and they were all delicious. Also got their desserts and they were delicious too. Definitely will come back."
5,"Wow..I&apos;m really not sure where to begin.  I could use a bunch of different words to describe this place. I could use a lot of different adjectives or compliments. I will stick to one basic term... GREAT. My dining experience was GREAT. In fact everything was terrific here. 

My girlfriend and I came here on 11/08/19 for a celebration dinner. We each had progressed in our respective careers and decided it was time to celebrate those achievements. We booked a reservation through Opentable and eagerly awaited our meal. 

First the basics, this is located directly off The 90 and there isn&apos;t a ton of street parking. I didn&apos;t see a parking lot, but there is Valet and they were very quick to help. We we running a few minutes behind and one of the hosts , I think it was Zoe , took my call to say I was a couple minutes late. She was extremely nice and very professional.  The entire front of house staff was very professional! 

When you get here, you walk up some stairs and enter. It&apos;s REALLY cool open decor. We were seated in the main dining room and I loved the layout. There was a Sax player and some dancers which were incredible. Our server was Gustavo and he was a great server, professional and polite.

Okay...now the food and drinks...seriously one of the best glasses of Sangria i have ever had. My girl had a Spanish G and T which was also amazing. The shrimp ceviche was fresh and had a nice little
Kick. She had the Salmon and I had the Paella. Both dishes were really good. Paella is a tough dish to pull off and they nailed it. This is NOT just flashy decor and good drinks but bad food. The food was just as good as everything else.

Do yourself a favor and come here. You will love it."
5,"I love this place! Been there a bunch of times now for different occasions: birthday party (7 people), date, a fashion show (yes, a fashion show on a second floor), and Carnivale did not disappoint once. Delicious and fresh food and drinks, amazing show and dancers, great decor. 
My favorite appetizer so far is coconut shrimp (calamari would be my second choice), baby greens &amp; pear salad is very good and refreshing, and for main course I would go with Salmon (Quinoa, Iron Creek Farms squash, black trumpet mushrooms, brown butter crumble) or Filet mignon (10 oz). From drinks I enjoy Caipirinha (of course). And desert that was to die for was chocolate cake. I also recommend to try after dinner drinks (it&apos;s like two in one desert and drink, so win-win situation I would say). 
Lounge area is a perfect spot if you are on a date or just want to enjoy each company in a relaxed and intimate atmosphere. They offer appetizers and if you decide to share ceviche is the best choice, in my opinion."
4,"One of the best days to visit is Mardi Gras Day otherwise known as Fat Tuesday! Live dancing and music add to the lively and festive decor. Special menu itwms include andouille and chicken gumbo, shrimp gritz and tres leches king cake. I tried the gumbo and it was highly seasoned. The milenesa which is steak and argula salad was more to my taste. Tip: come early before it gets crowded."
4,"We came here to celebrate our anniversary, and had a really great experience. We were immediately seated, and felt very welcomed. The interior is very lively and colorful. And our waiter was fantastic. He explained his recommendations with a smile and very persuasive. He was great the whole evening, checking up on us and making sure we left satisfied. 

We started off with a couple drinks. My wife ordered their Mayahuel. It consisted of Avion tequila, Cointreau noir, lime, agave and orange bitters. A very tasty tequila drink, with a hint of sweetness. She also ordered their cotton candy martini, and surprisingly wasn&apos;t as sweet as I thought it would have. The presentation is pretty cool as I&apos;m sure most of you have seen in the videos posted here. I ordered the sangria, which was tasty, sweet but refreshing. 

We ordered their ropa vieja, and it tasted phenomenal. You get five of these little tasty fried plantains,topped with braised beef, pickled onions, aji Amarillo aioli and quest fresco. They were so delicious and addicting to eat. I would come back just for these if I had too. We had an order of their daily ceviche. It was served with chips on the side and was also tasty. The ceviche had avocados in this citrusy green sauce. 

For my main entree, I ordered their Paella de Mariscos Espanol. The dish itself was delicious, but I probably wouldn&apos;t order it again. You get saffron bomba rice topped with shrimp, mussels, clams, octopus, and tomato sofrito. It was cooked and seasoned perfectly, but I didn&apos;t get bang bang pow taste. 

We finished off this rare night with dessert. We rarely save room for dessert and knew this night we had to. Fortunately for us, we ordered their chocolate tres leches and it was truly to die for. Not really sure why we don&apos;t order dessert more often. Same thing with this dessert, the presentation is cool. You get this ball of chocolate, stuffed with tres leches cake and mascarpone fondant, and they pour Mexican hot chocolate on top to melt the chocolate. The espresso tres leches soaked genoise, was very soaked just how tres leches should be. It was all very chocolaty, and came with raspberries, black and blueberries. I loved this as well and wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order it again. 

Overall I had a great experience and wouldn&apos;t mind returning. The service was great. The inside was beautiful and the food was very tasty. I&apos;ll definitely be returning."
5,"My love has said that she has always wanted to dine at Carnivale.  This past Friday evening we went to Carnivale for a celebratory dinner, and I&apos;d say it was a wonderful dining experience that was a welcome reprieve from the snowstorm taking place outside.

Carnivale has been open since 2005 on Fulton Market in the West Loop.  Its western wall alongside the Kennedy Expressway is basically a big billboard for the restaurant, and Carnivale sports very colorful interiors and a lively atmosphere to match.  Definitely try to visit the lower level washroom to appreciate some more design aspects.  We were seated not in the massive central dining room but in a secluded side dining area, which was great for conversation and digestion.  
  
We started our dinner with the ropa vieja appetizer, and what a delicious start this was to our meal.  The assemblage of braised beef, pickled onions and crumbled cheese atop slices of sweet plantains was absolutely delicious.  I am surprised that the menu does not offer an entree version of this outstanding ropa vieja.  We also ordered some crunchy onion rings.  My love&apos;s order of Seafood Paella was loaded with shrimp, octopus, clams and mussels.  If you are a seafood lover like her, then you will probably enjoy this dish too.  Our server described one of the dinner specials, so I went with the &quot;Matambre a la Pizza&quot; - a grilled flat iron steak topped with provolone cheese, sliced tomatoes, and arrabiata sauce, along with a side of fries.  This is supposed to be one of the featured dishes for the upcoming Chicago Restaurant Week.  Although this is playfully titled &quot;a la Pizza,&quot; perhaps it should be labeled more accurately as a steak version of a parmesan dish.  Overall this was a tasty entree, though some of the bits of fries were far too hard to eat.  The &quot;good&quot; fries were yummy though.  

I ordered the Xingu beer, a Brazilian dark lager that was slightly and satisfyingly sweet.  My love was treated to a show by choosing the Cotton Candy Martini.  Our server took the shaker of vodka, lime, and grapefruit and slowly poured the drink over a puff of pink cotton candy until it sort of disintegrates into the martini glass.  This bit of showmanship added some fun to our meal, and the martini itself was strong and tasty too.  

Overall the service was spot on, and our water glasses were replenished without fail.  On Friday evenings there are periodic performances that break out in the main dining room.  We did manage to catch glimpses of dancers shimmying in elaborate Carnivale costumes (yes THAT kind of Carnivale - the one you might come across in Brazil), and we wondered what other intriguing performers we would miss after we left for the evening.  All in all, our memorable dining experience at Carnivale was lively and delicious with a Latin flair."
5,"Carnivale was a a fantastic venue. A group of us rented the private room with a private bar, appetizer, and networking started us off. From there we had an amazing dinner followed by deserts. Everything was impeccably delicious and the staff didn&apos;t miss a beat. I&apos;d definitely recommend it."
5,First time here on a restaurant week with my best friend. The menu have a variety of choice. You able to chose meat or vegan. I love this. The drink I got a flight of tequila delicious. The portion size of the i would say it&apos;s great. I would want to come back here.
1,"This is the first time and also evver for the lastt time   For all  twelve of us to this restaurant. We had heard so much  about this and had been so disappointed for both the foOd and servIce. We ordered the most expensive steak $54 it I is not tender and juice, the skirt steak with the nice iss very salty, the flavors are not there. The place is colorful and the bathroom is very far away the service is very poor and we goo charged for 20% she barely have time too come and CCUC&apos;s on ya and when you called other server tThis is not southern american food, it is a Mexican restaurant. So everything is based on Mexican taste and even the servers. Very small portion for all appetizers, it is not standard portion. The Paella is tasteless and the seafood is not fresh enough to carry the flavor of dish out. 

Do not bring a cake they charged $2.50 to serve per person it ended up more expensive then the caKe itself
They are very empty inside. And you do have to wait a very long time for food to be serve, especially between apertizers and meal. 
We spent $753 dollars and it is so not worth the experience and the food. 
I onlly will give 1 star because both food and service is over priced. 

Just for the name is so not worth."
5,"Everything absolutely delicious.

The highlights - steak and lamb were cooked perfectly medium rare. Plantains were sweet, solid not mushy. Pastry of empanadas was baked perfectly flakey and soft. I was impressed with how tender the octopus was in the paella. Overall, paella could use some heat flavor. Desserts were wonderful - cakes (Cuban cigar and banana pecan toffee cake) deliciously moist and flavorful. I&apos;d like to taste more rum flavor in the aged rum ice cream. Nothing was over the top sweet. Roasted cauliflower could use seasoning.

Server was on top of checking in on our table and very nice."
