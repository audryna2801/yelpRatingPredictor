5,"We got take out from here and it was awesome! The Korean tacos (pork and beef) are such a fun twist on traditional Korean food, and the jap chae and bibimbap were excellent too! I ordered on Yelp and they called immediately after placing my order to let me know they were out of white rice and offered the black rice instead. It was delicious and I appreciated the quick communication! It was ready in about 30 min for pick up. The toppings on the bibimbap were amazing, and I hope they add a dolsot (hot stone bowl) option once they reopen for dine-in service!"
5,Love this place for a fresh twist on bibimbap and some Korean fusion dishes. I always get their bibimbap w/ beef and the spicy pork paratha tacos ~ really really delicious (I&apos;m Korean so my standards for Korean food are pretty high lol). Indoor space is cute and always clean which I appreciate.  Parking is usually pretty easy on Damen. Service is friendly and professional.  Definitely one of my go-to places in Chicago for fast fresh Korean food!
5,Been here a few times and have never been disappointed or still hungry. The tofu bibimbap with the spicy sauce is an amazing combination of flavors. Did take out with covid and came with a large amount of food and perfect amount of all the ingredients. Highly recommend!!
5,"This is by far my favorite restaurant in Chicago. It comes down to two things- 

Price - 
It&apos;s only $8 for two tacos and they are quite large so that&apos;s basically a full meal. Instead of chipotle, try to mix it up for less money and get more flavor 

Taste - 
Their tacos are insanely flavorful, i especially love the spicyness. The shells are so soft and perfectly hold the meat and toppings 

This is a must try in the Wicker park/ bucktown area!"
5,"This place is terrific! I&apos;ve been wanting to try it out for years but now that I live closer, will frequent this places
It has a small menu - paratha tacos, bibimbap, sashimi bap, and a few appetizers like dumplings and japchae noodles.

I tried their pork and beef tacos - they are pretty sizeable and I was stuffed from two tacos. The shell is flaky and delicious A- reminds me of a Chinese scallion pancake without the pancake. Each taco order also comes with a spicy aioli which was delicious - spicy with a hint of sweetness. 

My husband and I both preferred the beef over the pork because the pork texture is more broken up, whereas the beef is more distinct pieces of bulgolgi. The spicy pork was also pretty high on the spices, which we usually enjoy but it meant we couldn&apos;t use as much of the aoili. All in all, both were good and we will definitely be back! Only suggestion would be to add some items as appetizers like kimchi fries."
5,"This is my go-to quick dinner spot. They have fast service and the tacos and bubimbap are my favorite. The cashier is so nice and always greets you with a smile and hello. When I lived a block from there - I&apos;d eat here at least once a week. Never disappointed, constantly delicious."
5,"Food: excellent 
Service: quick

Counter service spot with a few communal tables that has been in this same location for many years. Love how fresh the ingredients are - the bibimbap bowls are delish and their tacos are so, so, SO GOOD. THE &quot;tortillas&quot; are fried or something and it makes them flakey and extra delish. Two tacos is plenty of food for a meal. The pork is my favorite meat there but is a bit spicy so buyer beware. Have been coming here since 2014 and will continue to!"
4,Went in for the galbi Jim with cheese. Very spicy so perfect for those who want to try a spicy challenge but you can ask for less spicy! Don&apos;t underestimate it! Service was great and you can ask to mix the remaining sauce with rice to finish it off! I would save some meat to throw that in the mix! Would recommend!
5,"The serving sizes were pretty decent besides the kimchi. The side of bulgogi was more like a rice bowl and the sauce for the bulgogi fries were great. They didn&apos;t put sauce in the bibimbap sushi burrito but it had a great assortment of things like imitation crab meat and avocado. It doesn&apos;t come with a large amount of sauce but it doesn&apos;t really need it. I ended up just putting it in a bowl with the kimchi and the sauce so that I could mix it all up. I got this delivered, so not sure what the restaurant experience is like."
5,"Like this place! The menu consists of unique dishes they execute very, very well. 

My go-to dish here is the sashimi bap,
which is essentially a salad with tons of fresh/pickled/marinated veggies, chunks of sashimi, and served with rice (go for the brown rice!) and choice of sauce (go for the gochujang for something a little spicy).  Mix it all together, and voila, you&apos;ve got the best rice bowl in Bucktown. So good!!

When I&apos;m in the mood for something more decadent, the paratha tacos and mandoo are fantastic.

En Hakkore is right by the 606, and folks who run the place are always super friendly :-)

If you&apos;ve been there, you already know this place is legit. If you haven&apos;t, be sure to give it a try, you can thank me later."
5,"I&apos;ve been here twice now, and plan to come back again soon (I HOPE)... 

These Paratha tacos are so good and tasty, you can&apos;t go wrong with either BBQ Beef or Spicy Pork. I eat these so quick, because they are so good when fresh and hot out of the kitchen. 

I&apos;m not a food chemist but... 
Crispy, slightly chewy, sweet: Paratha
Salty, sweet, spices: Marinated Beef/Pork 
Fresh, crunchy: Slaw

I think that hits all the corners of sensation to unleash an amazing combination that simply hits the spot so good when you&apos;re craving asian food/spices."
5,"It looks cool, It feels cool, and It taste great. I had the spicy pork and beef taco. The pork is a touch too spicy but I&apos;m not complaining others might and the full effect of the spice takes about 5 seconds to bloom. The Beef is great. Now I have previously stated Del Seoul has excellent tacos - they still do. What this place has is tons more atmosphere. Look at the pics Thanks to Nick G for leading to this place 

Excellent tacos as usual 032619 had the beef, pork and tofu it&apos;s spicy- be warned.  The bimbimbap plates was good but I much prefer the Tacos."
3,"Middle of the road. Not bad, not great.

I&apos;m thinking the tacos might really be where it&apos;s at, but unfortunately I had the Sashimi Bap with a side of paratha bread and didnt have an experience that is really worth talking about.

The paratha bread was really good, and that&apos;s what they make their tacos with. The sashimi bap was a huge, half-filled bowl that consisted mostly of shredded cabbage. Very small portion of rice, tiny portion of sashimi, no sauce on it (though there were sauces on the table). 

Once I put sauce on it, it was tasty enough, but I felt like I paid $11 for a bowl of raw cabbage. Probably would not order again. There are many other places that do poke better, even though this was not called poke.

The service was very surprising. One cook, one clerk, and a bustling neighborhood of hipsters and millennial moms dining in and everybodyntheymama ordering delivery. 

For some reason my paratha bread came out 10 minutes before my meal...*shrug*

This place is also really small, offering cramped communal seating. And since so many people are crammed in a small space it is really loud.

It is a personal pet peeve of mine when a place has a tip option on their checkout if I have to place my order at the counter and bus my own table. The girl walked three steps to bring my meal. I feel like a jerk if I don&apos;t tip when it is an option, but if I had not been prompted to, I wouldnt have even given it a second thought, since it was mostly self-serve.

I might give this place another shot and try the tacos next time, but I dont really have high hopes for my opinion changing."
5,Tasty food with a fun twist. A constant crowd pleaser for when I have visitors! Love the menu and all the different dishes. Highly recommend.
5,Delicious!! The menu is not very extensive but you won&apos;t be disappointed. I love the salads and the tacos.
3,"The beef paratha tacos are worth visiting this place but the pork one is a tad too spicy. 
I would skip the bibimbop as the rice was a bit dry and meat / protein proportion to the rice was underwhelming."
4,I&apos;m not a fan of bibimbap just because of all the veggies but I can&apos;t deny the freshness and presentation. My friends all liked the mandoo and tacos which I feel like would have made more sense for my palate and I should have gotten instead.
5,"This is fusion done right! They make paratha tacos that are this smooth, silky, and buttery like taco that is also crispy. It has a soft crunch before it gives and the taco just melts in your mouth. 

The spice level is great - it is hot, so beware of that! But it lets me enjoy my food really slowly and really take in the flavors of the pork. I also tried the beef and it is quite a competition for #1 between them. They are both so good. If and when I come back to Chicago, this will definitely be one of my first stops! Also for $4 a taco, this is such a great deal because it is so buttery and filling. I had a larger breakfast that day, and one taco was enough for me. As a meal by itself, two tacos would probably be best but I can see how one is adequate. The sauce and flavoring of the meat was to die for I really can&apos;t wait for the day I come back!"
4,"The paratha tacos are very dependent on your protein (or lack thereof). The beef and pork were great! Although I will warn against delivery as it can get a little soggy. The veggie and tofu tacos should be avoided at all costs. Vegetarians can find better options elsewhere. These tacos were so bland and basically carrots in a shell. The tofu did not have any sort of marinade.

2 tacos for 8.50 is a good deal for their size. I was full off the pork and beef. Can&apos;t say the same for veggie and tofu."
4,A great Korean fusion place! The Paratha tacos are unique and I have not seen that offered at other places. Using the Paratha bread as a tortilla is SO GOOD! The beef taco is great but the spicy pork is a little too spicy. Overall a great spot to grab a quick meal!
