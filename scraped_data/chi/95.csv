5,"I enjoyed coming here with friends. We sat outside on the back patio. They do a job job of enforcing COVID safety precautions. They take everyone&apos;s temperature before they enter and provide hand sanitizer.

The complimentary coffee cake was amazing, as was the fruit cup. I ordered a Denver omelette that tasted pretty good too. Overall, it was good for the price.

The restaurant is cash only, but there is a atm on site if needed."
5,"Just met a few of my Chicago friends here and I have to say this place is delicious! We sat outside the patio and although I wish seating was more spacious especially with social distancing, I do like that customers and staff must wear a face mask for service or work respectively. We had a friendly waiter who catered to us in a timely fashion. I ordered the Portland Omelette w/ an English Muffin on the side. The butter for my English muffin was almost creamy and rich and wow it tasted so great! My omelette and hash browns were great as well! I will definitely come back once I&apos;m a resident in the Chicago area!"
5,"Our favorite boozy brunch spot and a neighborhood staple. Friendly and kind staff giving wonderful service, and excelling at making their guests feel comfortable, even during these strange times. They were even kind to the Karen creating a scene over handsanitizer and temperatures being taken. They have great drinks and fabulous veggie, vegan and GF options. We love Tweet!"
5,"Always my neighborhood fav! Everything here is just delicious! 

We also got the at-home mimosa kit- and it was the perfect ratio  a full bottle of champagne and a 7oz (small) bottle of orange juice!!"
3,"I used to come here all the time and their food&apos;s always amazing. Service and ambience is always on point. However, Covid19 sadly changes many things, especially with regard to quality control. Restaurants have no choice but to skimp on ingredients or take shortcuts. 

I ordered a few waffles to go on Saturday and the quality of those waffles has gone down drastically. It used to be airy, full of flavor and slightly spongy on the inside yet golden brown encrusted on the surface. This time, it was flour heavy and tasted like stale bread on the inside. I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if they reduced the amount of egg and milk in the waffle batter. It was so unpleasant that I just ended throwing away my second waffle. 

To be fair, they gave me generous portions of fruit and the coffee cake was decent. Nevertheless, I&apos;m looking forward to coming back here when the pandemic is over."
5,"Wow, bring your appetite for the place! Huge portions and a huge menu so you may end up with many doggy bags! Such a cute little cafe with many vegan and regular options. The complimentary bread is awesome, drinks are fancy and delish, but the entrees are outstanding. 

I felt a little bad getting the turkey sandwich but the waiter talked it up and it did not disappoint! Juicy turkey, flaking croissant, crisp veggies! And the lox plate is so big-- it could feed two for sure. 

Can&apos;t wait to come back to get another lunch surprise!"
5,"I took myself out for the first time in like a year and had such a lovely brunch. The crab cake Benedict is absolutely delightful! Amazing and friendly waiter. I&apos;ve been here several times, and will always be coming back. One of my favorite places for brunch in the whole city!!"
5,"Walked in and was greeted with a piece of sweet bread and sat immediately. The place was large and super funky. Lots of awesome fun decor. Very LGBTQ friendly.

I was super happy to find so many vegan and vegetarian options on the menu that felt intentional and not put together as an after thought. Our server Braulio (I am so sorry if I misspelled that) was very helpful in helping me make a decision and steered me away from something I almost got. After ordering he offered to move us to a slightly larger table as we were at a high top and would be getting several plates. Our food came out very fast . I loved his recommendation and my friend inhaled her BLT. 

We left around 11:30 and they were definitely starting to get busy, so I&apos;d recommend getting there not at a peak time if you can, my friend lives nearby and said on the weekends it can be a very long wait."
5,"We love this spot for brunch. Love the quirky decor both in Tweet and Big Chick&apos;s. Food is generous, abundant and delicious!"
3,"I&apos;ve had many vegan brunch items including the burrito and tacos, but something about their vegan brunch is off. It lacks flavor and varying textures. I asked for cheese on my burrito, and they placed a slice atop the burrito instead of inside. This is the second restaurant to do this, and it is disgusting. It also means the burrito is not made to order. Nice friendly environment and staff though, and the free sweet treat is vegan and tasty."
5,"One of the best neighborhood spots in Uptown! Breakfast is always solid, just wish it wasn&apos;t cash only."
5,"Had the burger Cook medium with Swiss,absolutely delicious brioche bun with crispy french fries.
My friend had the Walter salad(everybody loves Walter) with a side of tater tots absolutely delicious.
So happy to finally return to one of my favorites. As per usual the staff was wonderfully accommodating and friendly.
Owner Michelle Fire is a Chicago treasure and we owe a lot to her for making our neighborhood such a great place."
5,"Packed | Service | Portions

PACKED: We went right before the Sunday Brunch Rush at 11am and it was already packed. They do not take reservations so you need to be prepared to get there a little earlier to make sure you get your name on the list. What makes the experience of waiting nice is that the restaurant is divided in half. With one side been for brunch and the other side being the holding bar. On the bar side you can get little snacks, water, and coffee while you wait for your table. 

SERVICE: Given how busy it was the service was OUTSTANDING. There was never a moment where we went wanting. Between waters, coffees, drinks, clearing the table, boxing the meals, they were EXTREMELY attentive and available. This is rare during rush hour brunch where service can be lacking. 

PORTIONS:  You need to be ready to eat when you go. Given the price point to size ratio, you definitely get your money&apos;s worth. I was thoroughly imppressed by the options on the menu. It is a bit intimidating with all their inserts and substitute options. They have a good mix of vegetarian hot and cold Options.  I had the Belgium waffle with a side of hash browns and I was full for the rest of the day. 

Pro tip: Parking around the Resturant is limited. But it is free on Sundays."
4,"Tweet is a classic breakfast restaurant that does simple right. I mean that as the highest compliment. I&apos;ve never ordered a fish I didn&apos;t enjoy. The food is made with love and the owners are on sight ensuring each guest feels at home. When seated they&apos;ll start you off with complimentary homemade coffee cake. It&apos;s often warm and always delicious. I&apos;ve dined in and ordered takeout. ..you can&apos;t go wrong. Tweet is definitely worth trying if you&apos;re within 20 mins. They are CASH ONLY so keep that in mind. I tend to forget, lol. Enjoy and let me know what you think."
5,"Monica&apos;s ~T.A.S.T.E.~ Test

Taste: They start you out with complimentary coffee cake, both vegan and regular. The vegan one was a little dry and crumbly without much flavor other than sugar, but the other people in my party loved the regular kind. I had the #7 burrito which is vegan and is incredible. Super large and comes with a side of fruit, total bonus! Great flavors and the chipotle vegan mayo is a must.

Atmosphere: This place is awesome for brunch. Great attentive service and you don&apos;t feel rushed. They have a bar area and 2 different seating areas, so you don&apos;t feel packed in.

Service: Our waitress and servers were amazing at refilling our coffee/waters, plates were cleared as soon as we were done, and everyone was friendly.

Tab: The bill per person was around $20 a person after tip for brunch, so very reasonable.

Extra wow factor: They have so many options here for both vegan and meat eaters alike. I love being able to choose from more than just a salad!

Does it pass the T.A.S.T.E. Test? Most definitely! This will be on our recommendation list!"
2,"So I called this morning to see how long the wait is and the lady that answered the phone answered a few questions I had. When I asked how long the wait was she said she didn&apos;t know. I asked if she can at least give me an eta timeframe and she said there is just a lot people there, which doesn&apos;t give me a timeframe. I asked again about the eta and she still wouldn&apos;t answer me. 

Her tone of voice appeared to be annoyed and I just wanted an eta timeframe for the outdoor patio. 

First of all I worked at a lot of restaurants as a server, host, takeout order, runner and backend. So I know how the restaurant works. My question should be easily answered. 

This lady refused to give me a eta time and she gave me an attitude on the phone and wait for it....hung up on me! I also had a question on one of their dishes but didn&apos;t have the chance to ask seeing she hung up on me. 

I never been to this place and really wanted to check it out but after that experience I will never dine at this establishment. Managers make sure you hire customer friendly workers. I don&apos;t care if the lady even lied about the time frame at least be friendly about it, you work in customer service!!!

I don&apos;t like giving bad reviews but this experience gave me no choice."
1,"I&apos;ve been to Tweet a few times for over the last 5 years and the food is usually good and service is great. However, I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s because it has been awhile or what but today the experience is different. First, when called in to ask about if they open for dining and wait time, the lady sounded rude and wouldn&apos;t give a eta for wait time and before we can ask another question, she hung up. Who does that? Even if you&apos;re that busy... anyways so I ordered my pancake as usual but it didn&apos;t taste as good as before. Prices is on the higher end compared to other breakfast so would expect to taste better but it&apos;s not. I like their orange juice though. Anyways, don&apos;t think I would come back. Over Easy Cafe is waaaaaayyyyy better and they never disappoint.."
4,"This place did a really nice job of social distancing during phase 3 , they take your temp when coming in and then also give you hand sanitizer . We sat on the patio and I felt most tables had about 6 feet. The staff all had gloved and face masks on. 
Now onto the important stuff - I have no idea what was placed on the table prior to us sitting down but it was some delicious cake tasting thing . I could have eaten that 20 times over. The food came out really quickly - the food was a bit bland overall , could have used some more salt. I also recognize restaurants are getting back into the swing of things . 
Over all I&apos;d definitely come back to give this place another shot"
5,"I had one of the best meals ever here this past weekend. Tweet is cash only, but it sure is worth it! My beau, best friend, and I chose this spot as our final breakfast on our Chicago trip. We didn&apos;t have a wait and were promptly seated. The music was great! The coffee was better! They started us off with dessert! What more could we have wanted, right? We had some of the freshest, most picturesque fruit cups that I have seen outside of a magazine photo. Neither of us wanted to eat it, but when we did, we realized that the photo only captured the beauty that the eye can see, but couldn&apos;t capture the taste! 

We ordered the pork chop and eggs, a breakfast burrito, and the vegan polenta with soy-rizo. Those dishes didn&apos;t disappoint either. The burrito was the best my BFF ever tasted. The pork chop and eggs were cooked exactly to my beau&apos;s liking. The polenta and soy-rizo was the best meal I ate while in Chicago! 

This place has solidified itself on our short list of must haves when we come back. I&apos;ve already mentioned it to others! Remember, bring cash because if you don&apos;t, you may have to wash dishes!"
5,"**Vegetarian/Vegan Friendly**

Great brunch spot in Uptown with a massive menu that I didn&apos;t know where to start! It is a first come, first serve restaurant. They have indoor and outdoor seating - and the inside is very spacious.

Absolutely love that they serve the daily coffee cake while you wait for food. The flavors change daily, and they have a vegan option! AND they serve you a cup of fruit! 

It is CASH ONLY, so come prepared with $$! There is an ATM inside. 

PS: Tweet is about a 10 minute walk from Foster Beach. Such a great post-brunch activity."
