5,This is an excellently restored hotel with fascinating architectural details. I live across the street. However they keep their Madison Street ballroom lights on all night ever since the place has been closed for the past year due to covid. Just wondering if they might want to look into turning off the lights and save themselves a bunch of money.
5,"LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION! This hotel conveniently near &quot;Â°The Loop&quot;. The hotel was built in 1893, and has a lot of character.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. Our room was good size and the hotel was quiet. All staff were very accommodating. The hotel invited us to check in early, and our room was ready by 1p. The bed was quite comfortable with good air conditioning in the room ( it was quite warm when we visited in July.  Our room was 0917. The view from the windows wasn&apos;t the best, but other than that, we were very happy with the room.  
The hotel is within  walking distance to MANY things, including shopping,  restaurants and the subway. The 
Hotel is right across the street from Millennium Park. Highly recommend this hotel for a stay in Chicago!"
5,"We end up in this building only by coincidence since it was in front of the cloud gate.

I&apos;m glad we made it here. 

A huge and beautiful building with all the memorabilia of the different sports teams that used to be in this club a long time ago.

They have an amazing restaurant at the rooftop and that&apos;s where I went later on that day."
4,"If it was a bit more affordable, I&apos;d go 5 stars. I was in town for the marathon &amp; even with the group/race price it was almost $350 a night. That being said, the bed was incredibly comfortable, housekeeping was fantastic, the bathroom was huge, and everything was so clean.  

The hotel itself is classy and unique.  If you are a guest of the hotel you get a key card that bypasses you up to the rooftop restaurant. It was always crowded &amp; kind of pricey but again, I was there on a peak weekend.  

No microwave in the room.  There is a mini fridge full of $$$ things, but they were cool with us rearraging a bit to fit our own bought soda cans.  No ice machines either, you have to call the front desk &amp; room service brings you a bag.  

All the athletic touches are amazing. Loved the pommel horse, blanket, boxing style robes, and key cards with famous athletes were so fun.  

The view from our room was just of other rooms &amp; an odd roof - I think you have to Shell out more $ for any kind of a view. Also, AT&amp;T cell service &amp; the hotel WiFi were awful. There was a full room service menu with plenty of options.  

We hopped into to game room bar when they opened &amp; had such a great time. So much fun, we asked for a late check-out and the Athletic was happy to grant us that. Checking in and out was both automated via e-mail/phone and so easy. We arrived a bit early and our room was ready.

The location is Ahhhh-maze-inggg. I was literally across the street from the start and finish of the race, plus the subway and L-line are around the corner."
5,"Amazing building,  architecture,  and piece of history built in 1893.  I came here for a wedding and it was so beautiful.   We were in banquet rooms on the 8th floor of the building.  The ceremony was in the smaller of the two rooms and the reception in the larger room, but the entire area was reserved for this wedding. 

Both rooms had old wood floors,  perhaps the original but that&apos;s pretty old so I&apos;m not sure.  There was amazing wooden trim that was hand carved most likely from when it was built.  I took so many pictures because it was so interesting and beautiful. 

I can&apos;t say enough about how wonderful it was.   I know there is much more to this building though.  I have been to Cindy&apos;s restaurant on the top floor which I highly recommend.   There are other restaurants and bars in the building I have yet to try. 

We couldn&apos;t get a hotel room, but the bride and groom did and I heard the rooms are really nice but still have that old / original charm. 

Just go and check it out."
5,"What a fun and engaging place. 

Whatever setting you&apos;re wanting to enjoy, you&apos;ll find it here. 

There&apos;s an area for coffee and tea.  There&apos;s a games area.  There&apos;s food. 

It&apos;s a great place to hunker down and get on your laptop, meet with pals, for a business meeting or even go on a date here. 

I just love this place and I think I&apos;m obsessed."
5,"I stayed here over St. Pattys day weekend and I was beyond impressed with the hotel. The staff is friendly, the rooms are spacious and very clean.

They have multiple restaurants on site for you to grab food at (Shake Shack even delivers to your room) as well as an on-site coffee ship. Cindy&apos;s Rooftop is here as well and that&apos;s a perfect date night spot.

The architecture is perfection all over the hotel. The check-in process was very smooth too.

I&apos;ll for sure stay here again! I can&apos;t say enough good thins about this place."
5,"I was spending a weekend staycation in Chicago and had the opportunity to stay here. Valet parking at the hotel is $69 per night, ouch, but this is Chicago. Since we were from the suburbs, we just took the Metra down and walked to the hotel. The location is great right off Michigan Avenue across from Millennium Park. The hotel is located on the second floor of the building away from the hustle and bustle of Shake Shack and other businesses on the first floor.

We checked in just after 3 PM with a very friendly receptionist who explained the hotel to us. We also were told that we received a complimentary room upgrade, score! 

In order to get to our room, we needed to walk behind the bar to get to a different set of elevators. No big deal, but it is interesting. The room is decorated with a plethora of different sports themes such as boxing robes, end tables made out of old rackets, etc. It was definitely unique and a nice throwback to when the hotel was an athletic club.

The public spaces were gorgeous. We enjoyed a beverage in the hotel lobby and eventually made our way to Cindy&apos;s on the rooftop. 

Overall, this is an awesome hotel in a great location. I will definitely be back when staying in Chicago in the future."
5,"I enjoyed every aspect of my stay here.  The history of the building, the charming interiors, the cleanliness, and the proximity to everything made this an ideal place.  Staff were nice and overly accommodating.  I appreciated them throughout my stay.  I appreciated how much they helped me out without even pretending to want a tip.  Classy.  

I love that it had the Game Room and Drawing Room on the second floor for quick bites to eat or drinks.  I never made it to the rooftop restaurant nor did I order from the burger place at the ground level.   The speakeasy was the cherry on top really.  Those are all your options which is a lot in addition to being so centrally located.   

The room was great.  I loved the clever postcards and pencils. It was clean and charming.  Good wifi throughout the building."
4,"This review is really only for the 8th floor reception area of the hotel. We had an event here and the staff and service was great. The area was spacious and the view of nearby Millennium Park and the lake was nice to stare out of the window for. There is a fire place that gave the overall place a nice ambiance, in my opinion. Overall, everyone was pretty professional, courteous, and pleasant.

BATHROOM REVIEW: Just outside and down the hall, the bathrooms were definitely fancy shmancy. Everything was impeccably clean. The paper towels next to the sink was nice and thick, quality hand drying material. The toilet stalls had ceiling to floor doors, so you can rest assure full privacy is met. The urinals themselves were chest level to floor height, so no risk of missing. Sit or squat? Sit!"
5,"5 Stars for a building that reminds you the craftsmanship that used to go into architecture and how much better it is when everyone gets to take a look inside.

Having started as a private members-only club, the Chicago Athletic Association was an &quot;escape from the city&quot; for folks around the time of the World&apos;s Fair. Seeing the potential of the space as an adaptive reuse project, it re-opened as a fully-restored hotel in the 2010s. In this new use, it&apos;s open for all to walk in- guest or not.

I wasn&apos;t a guest at the hotel, for example, but I went in to take in the beautiful interiors and head up to the cocktail bar upstairs. It&apos;s incredibly ornate and, again, open to anyone who wants a beautifully crafted cocktail. 

I look forward to staying in the hotel in the future, but for now, this building is on my must-visit list of Chicago!"
5,"I absolutely loved the architecture and vibe of this hotel! From the moment we pulled in, we were greeted and assisted with our bags. Check in was smooth and the room was designed with a lot of fun elements! Also, we pre ordered breakfast and scheduled it to arrive at 7:00am and it literally came at 7:00a on the dot! 

More than the wonderful amenities in the hotel, we picked it because of the location! It is literally across the street from cloud gate and the art museum! It was so convenient and made walking around the city so easy!

I would definitely stay there again and highly recommend you do as well!"
4,"This hotel is so cool!! I was super excited to be staying in a more boutique style hotel while out here for work. 

The rooftop bar is rated one of the best in the city and it does not disappoint. It is truly beautiful! The game room is super cool too and the library vibe in the hotel lobby is a perfect place to get work done while waiting on your room to be ready. 

Now for the cons: the room was really small and the elevators took FOREVER!"
3,"Very cool and well located hotel but two major flaws, especially for how pricey it is:

1) Thin walls and connecting doors. Someone on the phone next door felt like they were in my room.
2) Thin windows. It shouldn&apos;t be hard to fall asleep on a Monday night from City noises from the 19th floor."
5,"What a beautiful building and hotel. The architecture and design is just a dream, if you&apos;re into that sort of thing. Everything, from the lobby to rooms was just so beautiful. Walls a little thin if you have an exterior facing room - I was there during Mexican Independence Day celebration, and well, we couldn&apos;t sleep. :( It was SO LOUD. Fortunately it was just a couple days, and I was really tired, so I fell asleep eventually, and it&apos;s nothing the hotel could control anyway, so that&apos;s not their fault. 

Room Service is delicious. The room also had a full mini bar in the fridge, a safe, iron &amp; ironing board, terry robes too. Bath amenities provided by C.O. Bigelow, Black Pepper scent is universally masculine and feminine, I&apos;ll admit to being a Ross (from Friends) and taking as much as possible with me (lol, i totally dumped my stuff to get this home instead). 

Bed is soft and comfy, I could have used extra pillows but I didn&apos;t bother to call for them to be brought up. There&apos;s a desk and chair in the room, and no other table or chairs, so that made it a little awkward for room service food to be placed. 

I always had a bottle of water with me and the staff noted that my water was empty so they gave me a complimentary bottle on my nightstand. 

I enjoyed my stay and would come back if given the chance to visit Chicago again. My room had a view of the Bean too. Location is great next to Millennium Park."
5,"This is a must-stay hotel if you are visiting Chicago. It&apos;s directly across from the Bean and the park, and it also has a great restaurant and bar with Ana amazing view of the city. The bar inside has also great games and many people just come to hangout. The service was friendly and the history of the building is really cool to explore."
3,"This place is your standard typical bar in the downtown Chicago area. The space is beautiful and there are a lot of places to sit. 
It does get crowded fast. 
The drinks are the usual downtown Chicago expensive but they have a fairly good list. 
The service was good and efficient. 
It is generally a place a lot of people go after work for happy hour. 
You are going to run into a lot of employees from the businesses in the area. 
This is a place you want to get to by Uber, CTA, or walking - garage parking is super expensive and street parking is expensive too and it is difficult to find a spot to park on the street."
4,"We had our wedding here in 2004 and boy has it changed. Used to be this quite little old
Men&apos;s  club that needed business to stay alive. Now this is a hopping young hang out location with a bar in the pool. The lobby and ground lever was packed with young kids. Hotel rooms were small but loved the old hotel feel."
4,"Great place to grab a cocktail. Explore the architecture. The &quot;not very mini&quot; mini bar, full of local drink options. Rooms are unique though they can run NYC small. Service is good."
4,"A fun place to spend an afternoon. You can read or study with a nice cup of coffee in the second floor lobby, go to the rooftop to check out Cindy&apos;s, play bocci ball at the game room, and admire the ballrooms and their views of Millennium Park on the 8th floor."
