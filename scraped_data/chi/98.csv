5,"I stumbled upon this place after exploring Michigan Avenue and was looking for a place with an outdoor patio plus open on a Monday for lunch. Somehow this restaurant caught my attention which they featured their menu right outside the restaurant doors. The one thing that caught my attention on the menu was the gator on the appetizer portion and I knew right away that I found my lunch spot.

I&apos;m a visitor of Chicago but fully aware that there&apos;s a vast options of food that can fit anyone&apos;s palette. Apparently, this particular day I wanted food that I hadn&apos;t eaten for several years that reminded me of a visit down to Florida. At first I was confused if it was open since the restaurant exterior looked extremely nice but there was no one in sight and given the fact that Yelp had great reviews. I popped my head into the restaurant and asked if they were open which they quickly replied yes and I was seated outside on the patio with my little dog.

Once seated they instructed me to use the QR code to bring the menu up on my cell phone. They gave me complementary well seasoned chips and pickled pickles&amp;peppers to munch on while I decide on what I wanted to eat. Plus they gave my little pup a gingerbread man dog treat and a bowl of water. I decided to order one thing on the menu which persuaded me to have lunch here.....gator. The staff told me it was gator tail....the best way to describe the breaded gator and the side of dipping sauce was true happiness in a bite. After eating everything from my plate I settled on the Smoked Corn and Black Bean Salad which the waitress helped me decide from the salad options. This particular salad reminded me of a side that people in KC area call Cowboy Caviar that I enjoy.

I did ask the waitress why it wasn&apos;t busy since the food was really good. She replied that it&apos;s a hit or miss due to current times with COVID and it being a Monday lunch hour. I&apos;d recommend this place and come again if I happen to be in the Chicago area with a itch for Floridan food."
5,"Not going to make this a long review, small but still lovely patio, great service, friendly people, and excellent food.

Did a split of mac &amp; cheese for an appetizer, which was creamy but not overly so with nice cheesy bite, perhaps some sharp cheddar. A brisket sandwich that comes with three sauces, bbq, spicy bbq that has a bit of heat and sweetness to it and a mustard based one. Btw, those sauces would go great on their chicken sandwich, and if I had fries I&apos;d be dipping in those instead of ketchup. Amply portioned I took half home for dinner, still being full at dinner time it will be tomorrow&apos;s lunch. I chose the coleslaw for my side, also an ample portion and really tasty. It wasn&apos;t your average slaw shavings in a little paper cup.  

Definitely worth return visits."
5,"Helped my girlfriend move just down the street so we went here to get some food afterwards. 

Went on Yelp and forgot I&apos;ve been wanting to try this place forever and have walked past it numerous times and remembered how cool their outdoor patio looked. 

Got there just in time for brunch so we each got the Brisket Benedict and her mom got the pulled pork sandwich. Everything was excellent and highly recommend. One of the better BBQ places I&apos;ve had in Chicago."
4,Ok ok ok.  This place is maybe 35-40 feet from my apt.  I loveeeee this place.  Sat on the patio. Had the pulled pork ... loved it!   I realllly love the service too.  Thanks guys. Had a GREAT night!  I wish I remember the name of the gentleman who was my server.   He nailed it!   I took one star off only cause the prices are a tad tad high for the product in my eyes.   But where else will I get this kinda food with this atmosphere.
5,"Omg the most incredible bbq I&apos;ve ever had!! 

LOVE the house made chips and pickles, couldn&apos;t get enough!

All four of us got the pulled pork or chicken sandwiches with a side. INCREDIBLE and very filling! Right down to the yummy buttery bun they serve it on. 

The Mac n cheese is super creamy and cheesy and Brussel sprouts are soo good!! 

Husband said the old fashioned was one of the best he&apos;s had."
5,"Wow, I didn&apos;t know my neighborhood had good food. This place really can stuff you. It looks like a pretty house on the outside and the inside is so much larger than it looks on the outside. It is pretty classy for a bbq place.

The people there can seriously do no wrong. The service is superb. James B was our waiter and he was super knowledgeable. His humor may be too advanced for me, but he was super nice! This place is probably what Boston&apos;s Sweet Cheeks Q strives to be. Anytime anyone passed by, they would refill my water. The ribs are huge--the full rack was longer than my forearm and it was so thick. It came with fries. They have 4 sauces that you can experiment with. My favorite is the spicy and the classic bbq one. There was a vinegar and mustard option. The mac n cheese was pretty big for a side. I got the happy hour tacos and those were already filling. They were very meaty, especially the beef brisket.

And they come with bbq chips that they probably make themselves and sweet pickles. It didn&apos;t have any pickle taste, just the texture. (But it has the pickled burn when it goes down the wrong pipe.) And they give you more when you&apos;re done. The chips are not super crunchy and crispy but the seasoning is great and it&apos;s nice to not stab your mouth. We got cheesecake to go because we were stuffed but wanted to try it. It had an Oreo base with some swirls and strawberries on top with a strawberry sauce. It was fluffy and not too sweet. I would rather go here than Magnolia&apos;s for the cheesecake.

The detergent they use on their towels also smells great. The portions are enormous, so I recommend coming with people who are comfortable with you loosening your belt mid-meal."
5,"Came in on a Wednesday evening on our first night in Chicago, we were tired from our flight, damp and cold from it being rainy; on a 2 hour time difference and starving as we had walked around the city before deciding on dinner. 

From the outside, Chicago Q seemed warm and welcoming and it was beautifully charming and cottage like, I was a little worried we were underdressed, but a quick peek inside assured me that we weren&apos;t. 

After being seated, our server Jamieson came over and was sweet, attentive and extremely helpful with the menu. I would describe the ambience as warm and homey.  His helper was on top of water refills and chip refills- just all around stellar service! 

I have to start with the complimentary chips. These aren&apos;t just any old chips, they&apos;re housemade potato chips and perfectly crispy and seasoned, we may or may not have had 4 bowls. Lol They put out a small bowl of housemade pickles which were also delicious, garlicky, salty, and a little sweet. 

We tried two cocktails. The first cocktail was called the Seventeeth Letter ($12): Hendricks gin, (my fave) luxardo, lime and chartreuse, and the Smokey Jalapeño &apos;Rita which had jalapeño slices floating in the drink and a tangy bbq seasoning on the rim, unexpected and delicious! ($12) 

Our server Jamieson, recommended the Prime Brisket Burnt Ends ($12) appetizer. These are an absolute, absolute must if you love bbq! The burnt ends were well seasoned and melt in your mouth tender, both my husband and I could&apos;ve just ordered a couple of these and a few sides and happily called it dinner. However, we did end up ordering the Q2 which comes with your choice of two kinds of bbq and a side- we chose the Brisket and ribs, the mashed potatoes and ordered a side of the corn bread.  I&apos;m so glad we ended up sharing bc it turned out to be more than enough food for two. 

Everything was fantastic from start to finish, just wish we had had more time to come back for brunch, hoping to come back someday soon to do just that!"
5,"Came here for a birthday - we made dinner reservations very last minute for 8 people and the staff was super accommodating. 
The food is amazing and huge portion - the Mac and cheese is an absolute must , flavored to literal perfection , just cheesy enough
I was skeptical on the alligator (as I&apos;ve never had it) and it was really good too - tasted pretty similarly to chicken, would definitely recommend. . 
The prices are a little steep - but the portions are really large making it worth it . 
The drinks are also to die for. 
Overall amazing experience and the ambiance is great, I will definitely be coming back."
4,"Come here if you want brunch without waiting an ungodly amount of time! My party of 3 walked in around noon on a Saturday to an almost completely empty restaurant. 

The actual dishes we got were good, but the best parts of the meal were the freebies -- fresh potato chips and pickles. Those pickles were possibly the best I&apos;ve ever had. They were sweet, tangy, crunchy, had some mustard seed. We were even about to order more before finding out that each extra serving costs $5 lol.

Prime Brisket &amp; Eggs Benedict -- 4/5
Solid benedict. I wanted to try some of their BBQ along with my brunch dish so this was the best option. Might have been slightly too heavy/salty with the brisket, hollandaise, AND cheesy biscuit bottom (hence why it&apos;s not a perfect 5/5) but I still ate the whole thing. Next time I want to try the pulled pork benedict.

Buttermilk Fried Chicken -- 4.5/5
The waiter really hyped this one up. You get basically half a chicken on the dish. The crust was a good medium density/crunchiness, and the chicken itself was hot and juicy. We chose to get mashed potatoes as the potato side, which was the best part -- I enjoyed it more than the chicken!

Pulled Pork Shoulder -- 4/5
Solid meat, no real complaints thought maybe it could have been a taaad bit more tender. I thought their sauces were pretty unique too. There was a sweeter one with a bit of a spice (cardamom? clove? cinnamon?) kick at the end. The spicier one had a smokey flavor infused. Both were on the thinner side, consistency-wise. I think these will be hit or miss depending on the customer, but my party enjoyed them.

Mac and Cheese -- 4/5
It&apos;s mac and cheese, what can I say? I love mac and cheese so this hit the spot.

Overall, I had a great meal and will be back!"
4,Got a Chicago Q combo to go a couple days ago. Everything packed up well. Good Smokey brisket and solid bbq ribs. A little pricey but I would still order again
4,"Yum! 

I had the rib combo - half rack each of baby back and St. Louis style ribs, along with cole slaw that included some kale for an interesting difference. 

We topped off the meal by splitting a slice of deliciously rich chocolate cake!"
5,Delicious food and awesome service. All employees wore masks and tables were socially distanced. We sat outside and went during the happy hour (3-6pm during the weekdays) Highly recommend the mashed potatoes and mac and cheese as sides.
4,"I probably had passed by Chicago Q dozens of times with a mental note to stop inside and finally had the chance during restaurant week(end) 2020. Interior has a cozy feel even though it&apos;s a spacious place. Staff, for the most part pretty friendly. 

Upon being seated, freshly made BBQ chips and homemade pickle chips came to nosh on and Ohh My I have this obsession for pickles and they were incredibly good! Seriously I could have had a BBQ &amp; Pickle Chips Sammy and been a happy camper but those come compliments of the kitchen and I&apos;m gonna confess, I asked for more after they quickly disappeared into my belly.

The standard menu had many options but I chose to keep to the set menu for restaurant week since it&apos;s only offered 1x a year. Was very happy I did too because it was plenty of food!! Now I will say not being well educated on BBQ and a first timer the menu was mostly just lacking in explaining what exactly I was getting. For example, I asked my waiter (who seemed really impatient with my indecision) what exactly was a fried green tomato. His response: &quot;It&apos;s a couple of slices of tomato, fried in a batter&quot; mmmmm ok dude, that part I figured out but fried in what kind of batter? Is it flash or deep fried and is the oil vegetable or corn? If it&apos;s a green tomato is that going to be bitter? I only know red and yellow tomatoes (is my West Coast roots showing too much?) He didn&apos;t have a clue!! Lols so I gave it a try anyhow for sheer curiosity. Thankfully the GM made his rounds at my table to bring by these curious fried tomatoes. He asked if I wanted more chips and pickles (heck yeah!!), refilled my water, and if I needed anything else. He answered all my questions and explained what Panko was since I had no knowledge of that batter before. He also brought me over another side dish of fries that I didn&apos;t even order which I thought was pretty generous.

Now onto the ribs! Yeah that was really confusing me because the &quot;Award Winning Ribs&quot; and the &quot;Tender Babybacks&quot; were not on the menu I chose but again I was curious to know what I was getting. My waiter &quot;yeah, you are just getting our basic ribs, not the award winning ones and there&apos;s no sauce&quot; uhmmm okay dude... well, I can confirm they were anything but basic. I thought they were nicely sized, pretty meaty and easily came off the bone. Tasty things! Like really tasty. Another server came over to check on me, she asked if I might like a refill of my drink and would I be interested in sampling a few of her favorite barbecue sauces... yes, of course I loved that she asked! For the record that gesture alone made me a satisfied gal. I really liked the original sauce and the sweet one too... the spicy was just too much kick for me. Nonetheless it was much appreciated and made me feel like some of my earlier curiosity over the rib selection was addressed.

Lastly, dessert! Oh how I love a good carrot cake... and I saw one from the corner of my eye sitting at another table. It looked yummy and big so being quite stuffed from my meal, I requested my waiter (yep the nonchalant dude) to send it home with me for a treat to enjoy later on. I&apos;ll say he did as asked but it was totally mashed into a small round container and was a fraction of the size of the one my eye caught a look at on the table near me. I was a bit disappointed in that. 

Overall though I felt the value was worth what I spent and I will definitely stop in again."
5,"Broke out the impressions pretty early into the meal

First I did my Trump.  &quot;Let me tell you something, we have struck a fantastic, tremendous deal with these buffalo wings.  The most outstanding, phenomenal wings this country has ever seen.  I am going to eat these wings faster than anybody has ever eaten wings.&quot;

Then I slid into some Obama. &quot;Uhhhh these hush puppies...uhhh they sure silenced me.  Mmm Mmm Mmm.&quot;

Hank Hill added, &quot;these ribs taste like they were made using propane and propane accessories I tell ya what.&quot;

Finally, Jon Gruden made an appearance.  &quot;Whoa this brisket man is blowing my mind.  Thats some good meat man.  Knock on wood if you&apos;re with me.&quot;

5 stars"
4,"My boyfriend loves BBQ so he&apos;s on a mission to try all the BBQ places. We ordered and had this place delivered via Uber eats. 

We got the sliced brisket with spicy sauce and original sauce, Mac n cheese, honey buttered cornbread, coleslaw. 

The brisket was tender and savory. It has a nice Smokiness to it. The cornbread was delicious. It was dense and huge. We ordered two thinking they would be tiny but honestly one was enough. Mac n cheese was definitely cheesy but could have had more seasoning. Coleslaw was on the healthier side with kale bits. It doesn&apos;t have carrots but still flavorful. 

The portion sizes are HUGE! Definitely enough for seconds"
4,"We happen to be downtown and craving some really good BBQ food so the hubs found this place and we decided to give it a try. Parking is street only  and kinda difficult to find. 
The place is super cute, much fancier on the inside than I would expect, especially for a BBQ spot. The service was nice and attentive, no wait for dinner and plenty of tables in front with bar and in back. 
We sat in back and had a booth to ourselves. The free chips and pickles were tasty, they brought us more, but we didn&apos;t need it. We ordered the combo plate with brisket, pulled pork, and pulled chicken with a side of corn bread. We got a side of mashed potatoes as well. And all of that was plenty for two starving adults. 
The meats were delicious and perfectly cooked. They came with a bunch of different sauces (I loved the spicy bbq and the mustard). The mashed potatoes were sooo creamy and yummy, and the corn bread had real corn and was so tasty with butter. 
Definitely a goood find! We will be back in the future if we happen to be craving some BBQ downtown again!"
5,"Fresh off a trip to Texas, I feel that Chicago q more than holds its own. I really like the concept of table service and chairs that have backs at a barbeque restaurant. A lot of other people seem to feel the same way.

I went with the half chicken and q burger. Both were excellent. I feel that in some respects the q burger was overpowered by the blue cheese but it featured a scrumptious beef blend nonetheless. I&apos;m really glad restaurants are starting to move away from generic freezer-ready beef blends. The half chicken was served intact and it was perfect.

Feel like I&apos;ve been giving too many five star reviews recently but, honestly, what more could you want from this place. Worth mentioning that it seemed to be very child-friendly during our 6pm seating."
5,Wow!! Classy ambiance and great food! I also thought the prices were reasonable and was actually expecting it to be more expensive! Tried something new and exotic with the alligator. Salty and good!
5,"I love the brisket and fried alligator. The servers were excellent

A reservation is a must during COVID"
5,"The St Louis style are our favorite, meaty, nice smokiness and the spicy barbecue is delicious. The must try list includes the baked beans with wagyu beef, and when possible the beef ribs (you can call ahead to reserve your order)."
