5,"My friend and I came here in January... The food was really amazing and the service was great (Attentive, engaging). I loved the overall atmosphere of this place (Bright, well-decorated) and wish I could go back soon (I&apos;m looking at you 2021! Here&apos;s hoping for a pandemic free new year). Truly one of the BEST (Albeit last) dining experiences I had in 2020. 

We started with the whipped feta which was so fluffy and the bread was 10/10 (And I have to admit something blasphemous: I don&apos;t like bread). I still think about this whipped feta and bread often. I got the mussels and they were very good (Pictured below). 

We ended the meal with their dessert froyo covered in sea salt, honey and olive oil. Definitely a unique combination. My friend needed some convincing to order this but our server was very adamant that we would like it... And we LOVED it! This place really knows how to make things you would never think work together really really work!

P.S. The cocktails here are a must!"
5,"Every single dish that I&apos;ve tried here is outstanding! From the bread that comes with the dips to the falafel itself, the food here is amazing and Ema will always be my favorite restaurant. I&apos;m so happy that carry out is available, I am always craving something from the menu."
5,"I dined at this restaurant over the summer. The food was amazing, the service was just as great! 

My server was able to make me a mocktail even though there weren&apos;t too many options on the menu. She asked me for what flavors I enjoyed and surprised me with the drink and I was very impressed! The food is incredible as well. This is such a cute place to catch up with friends and also perfect for a romantic date night! 

The restaurant took multiple precautions in order to make us feel safe. Temperature checks, outdoor seating, social distancing, all employees wearing masks etc. 

I definitely recommend this place for both dine in and carry out!"
3,"I used to pass by Ema and it was always busy with a waitlist but now that the weather has gotten cold as they are not allowed to serve inside (due to the pandemic) decided with a heat lamp over the table to have a light bite on my way home. The waitress suggested the squash soup and a warm nutty hummus with lambs meat served with soft pita. The soup was just so so and was not even hot. It tasted like a pumpkin purée actually. I really liked the hummus dish however. I guess it&apos;s a seasonal item so not sure how long it will be on the menu but I&apos;d come back to have it again. 

Service was meh at best which is shocking since I was only one of two tables seated. The inside vibe was really nice, just sadly we are not allowed to dine in right now.

Yelp tip: EMA is part of LettuceEats so be sure to claim points or use points when you get the bill."
4,"Grilled Chicken Kebab
Spicy Hummus
Grilled Octopus
Brussels Sprouts

The Spicy Hummus was excellent. I wish we had more pita bread with it though.

The Grilled Chicken Kebab was about what you&apos;d expect, nothing special. It&apos;s grilled chicken.

The Grilled Octopus was delicious.

The Brussel Sprouts were the best I&apos;ve ever had."
5,"So fun and fresh!! Great light atmosphere- I&apos;d say this would be great for lunch or maybe pre-game tapas and drinks. Food was pretty outstanding actually- the best was the spread sampler: we got hummus (I&apos;m a hummus LOVER and thought this was soooo tasty), almond and garlic spread (also surprisingly incredible), and the eggplant (our least favorite of the three but still tasty! Very smoky flavor). We also got the Brussels sprouts which are a total must. The crispy potatoes were good! Wish we tried the cauliflower!
Pro tip: our very kind waitress told me the pita bread is made with yogurt and I&apos;m lactose intolerant- so she brought us some herb crackers and they ROCK. really really good with the spreads. We had a great night!"
5,"Oh, I&apos;m over the moon! This place should be added to your must-visit list. Undoubtedly, good value for money. If you want to diversify your daily routine and go out for dinner somewhere - be sure to come here. 
Many thanks to the chef! Everything he touches turns to gold. My absolute favortites are charred eggplant with house yogurt, lemon, olive oil and crispy potatoes with mizithra, rosemary, scallion crema. The eggplant was served with warm pita. A red spice gave it a tangy chili lime flavor.  What to potatoes, they were so crispy and served with yogurt cream sauce. 
I wil definitely come back here! The food were so impressive appetizing!"
5,"One of my top restaurants in all of Chicago! It has great ambience and decor, but the food is where it&apos;s at. All of the apps are good but my favorites are the brussel sprouts, the crispy potatoes, and the labneh with their homemade pita. The pita is so addicting. If you go for lunch, I highly recommend getting the sampler so you can try all of their dips."
5,Best brunch place in the city!!! The food is savory and has incredible flavor. The staff are courteous and prompt! Even the cocktails are spectacular.
4,"We were here recently for brunch. We got biscuits and hummus as starters. The biscuit with cream and fruit sauce was so good. The seasoned pita that comes with the hummus is really good. I got the chicken kabob and my friend got the lamb shashuka. The rice that comes with the kabob is pretty plain, needs some flavor. The honey pie was good, pretty sweet. Overall we liked the food. The server was nice but they need to remove the plates from the tables quicker. It was not busy when we were there."
4,"Date night here and it was super cute! 

First, we sat on the patio. It was all fun and games until the rain came. I didn&apos;t feel like catching a cold so I asked to go inside. We did. They found us a table, kinda. Then the downpour came and everyone came inside. Why am I mentioning this? The rules and regs stipulating full restaurants can be due to the current situation....SO PLAN ACCORDINGLY or head in once the first droplet falls...everyone for themselves! 

The meal was decent. The standouts were the waiter (great personality and great hair) and the Brussels sprouts. 

Seriously, best Brussels sprouts I&apos;ve ever had in my life. If you ever come back, don&apos;t you dare even think about not ordering the Brussels sprouts.

The spicy hummus was decent.

I also love how most things could be veganized or made gluten free. Of course, that only applies if you have a smart waiter. Luckily, we did. 

Parking is available in the lots nearby.  The restaurant is pretty and the vibe is generally positive. Kudos to the GM for remaining calm while 10+ patrons, in various stages of soaking wetness, ran in simultaneously demanding to be seated. He was polite, cool headed and still complied with the rules.

Definitely give this place a shot!"
5,"My second trip to Ema was possibly even more amazing than the first--the socially distanced outdoor space they&apos;ve set up works out well. You really can&apos;t go wrong with the classic or spicy hummus! And the seasonal ones are delicious and fun to try as well. The unlimited pita that comes with the hummus dishes is soft, warm, the perfect appetizer for a fall night. Service was ast and attentive! I highly recommend ordering a bunch of things and sharing, because everything I&apos;ve tried here I love."
5,"One of the best meals I had in Chicago!

Hummus trio - eggplant one is my favorite, classic is delicious as well as the cheese one. most importantly the bread was so good. 

Chicken kebab - delicious!! chicken was sooo tender and juicy. sauce was so good too

Mediterranean salad - refreshing! 

I would def go back for more chicken kebab and hummus!"
5,"An odyssey through the Mediterranean
Delicious flavors
You&apos;d assume the chef&apos;s Acadian

Looking for a fusion twist?
This Californian inspired menu
is one you don&apos;t want to miss

Green Falafel, who would have known?
Winter squash risotto
You&apos;re mind will be blown.

A little fruity, a little tart,
The Dreamsicle G&amp;T
is off the charts

The GM Adam was truly a gem
10 out of 10
I totally recommend."
5,"This is likely my favorite restaurant in Chicago. The outdoor seating during COVID is top tier! Heat lamps + very well spaced out seating. Ema never fails! I generally am not as impressed with their kebabs but all other small plates and meat entrees have blown me out of the water! Although I came for the grilled octopus, it was not on the menu (I was told it would return soon). My favorites are the Brussel sprouts and regular hummus. The braised short ribs on the carrot purée was so good - we used the pita to wipe the bowl clean of the purée!"
5,"I love Mediterranean mezzanine and am quite picky about the quality. But Ema has moved my standards to the next level! I love the texture of their dishes and the flavors are just right. BRUSSELS SPROUTS ARE MUST GET. Their pitas have zaatar seasoning (which was a new experience for me). I would love to try all of their dishes, even if I have to go alone. Great staff and pleasant environment. Can&apos;t wait until I go back!"
5,"LOVE Ēma! Food was fantastic and simple. Everything was beautiful &amp; wasn&apos;t over priced. The lighting is perfect inside. The bars are first come first serve and have a full menu. I can&apos;t wait to return. 

And that&apos;s all I have to say about that.

5,"My first time i came here during restaurant week and it was one of the better deals for sure. Definitely will come back any other night as well just because the food was delicious, great atmosphere, and awesome service. 

I had the Brussel sprouts. Perfectly crispy as they should be. The eggplant hummus was just ok. Not sure if I would get it again. Their roasted potatoes, omg can this just be my entree?? I got salmon kebabs and it was perfectly cooked with the charred ends. My friend got grilled octopus. It was just ok, not the best not the worst."
4,"The aesthetic of Ema was so adorable! It&apos;s decorated with lots of greenery and the windows are open so there is a lot of air inside. The Mediterranean small plates are pretty good! I loved the Whipped Feta! In addition, I ordered the Beef and Lamb Kefta, which was good. I thought a couple spreads and two kabobs were enough for two people. Unfortunately, the service wasn&apos;t great, but I still enjoyed the food that I&apos;d come back!"
4,"We came here for a friends birthday and really enjoyed ourselves! The atmosphere and interior design was modern and warm while they followed all COVID regulations. The food was also very good. We got their Brussels sprouts and crispy potatoes as appetizers and shared several entrees. The Brussels sprouts were amazingly seasoned and soft, easily one of the best dishes. The potato&apos;s were pretty typical crispy potatoes so you can&apos;t really go wrong there. The best entree was definitely the grilled octopus. It was cooked to perfection so it was soft and not too chewy while also being seasoned extremely well. The keftas were okay. I thought the lamb and beef kefta was definitely better than the chicken Kefta because it had more flavor and seasoning. The rice was fairly bland and I would have liked some more seasoning or something extra to give it a unique flavor. My absolute favorite dish was the dessert though. We all shared the sticky date cake and wow it was so unique and tasty. It had a nice crunchy texture and subtle sweetness to it. My only complaint was that it was much too small! I apologize for the lack of picture, we devoured it so quickly I completely forgot to take a picture!"
