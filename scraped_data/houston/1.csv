4,"Great experience, store&apos;s were not overly crowded. Mask policy was enforced. Higher end store&apos;s took temperature&apos;s. 6ft rule was enforced in food Court area. Still I have seen few ppl running around without masks"
4,"The Galleria is lovely at Chrismas.  I was on a mission to Saks to Fragrances, Dior&apos;s Rosewood Oud,  but wanted a Macaron for Macarons by Patisse...Out of the Goat and Fig.  Took the joy of my shopping!  Anyway lines were long at so many stores, social distrancing tried to be enforced. Some people can&apos;t follow directions or read signs.  

I am curious as to how these young people most in baggy pants...the grunge look? can afford the drop high $ to LV, Ralph Lauren. Yurmin etc.  

The mall was beautifully decorated and Iove that trees decorated in blue because the Jewish  Holiday was during the time as was Christmas.    

Sad to see so many stores closing or closed and inventory so low.  Someone&apos;s said they are not  ordeing as much... this is hard seeing this happening and for the businesses and employees."
1,"I avoid this place like it had the plague. The traffic, parking and prices make it undesirable unless it&apos;s the only location. 

Today we were at the Simon owned Galleria Mall on Westheimer. We parked in the ground level purple garage to go to a restaurant 

We dropped over $300 at this restaurant at the edge of the mall.  

Walking from the garage to the restaurant....Simon you should be mortified. With the prices in that mall which I am sure is due to rent, you should keep the place clean.  

I didn&apos;t take pictures of all the areas but right behind the bushes at Fig and Olive more disgusting trash that could be seen if you were eating outside. 

Seriously SYRINGES???? Am I in a bad part of San Francisco???


Now add a4th reason to avoid the galleria!"
1,"Aside from being one of the grossest malls in the US it&apos;s also the most dangerous. They are not enforcing any type of Covid protocol, putting so many people at risk. It&apos;s shameful. 

Please stay out of that place and stay safe."
5,OVERALL I really liked this huge mall! They had an ice skating rink inside with rentals. Beautiful huge Christmas tree. Fancy high end stores. Cheesecake Factory! Also there&apos;s a food court if you want faster food.
4,"The largest mall in Texas! 
This place is vast. It&apos;s a huge, huge mall. One of the top 20 largest malls in the country. You can get seriously lost up in here. There&apos;s a central atrium that runs most of the length of the mall, with kiosks and a ice skating rink in the middle of the place, which is pretty cool. 
There are lots of parking garages that surround the mall. They can be a bit serpentine to get in and out of, but there&apos;s enough parking for a structure this large, I suppose. 
Most of the shopping mall spaces seem to be pretty upscale. There&apos;s a Neiman&apos;s in here, and a Saks Fifth Avenue anchoring this place. There&apos;s also hotels, restaurants, and office space in here as well. Overall, there are 2.4 million square feet of rentable retail space in this mall. Impressive!"
5,First time ever in Texas. This was my first stop. Loved the environment. Huge mall. Lots of variety and a nice family friendly skating rink.
1,"Went to the Galleria on Saturday, November 28, 2020.  There was a mask requirement to enter. However, many shoppers and kiosk operators were not wearing a mask (or wearing it uselessly under their chin).

The Galleria has clearly chosen not to enforce this rule, which renders it pointless.  Whether you agree or disagree with masks, a rule is a rule, and for those who feel safer with a mask, then it must be respected out or courtesy to them. That the Galleria chooses NOT to enforce it makes the Galleria irresponsible and distrustful.  This is something they have in their complete control - point being, they were allowing kiosk operators to flaunt the mask policy.

Well, I shall not be shopping at the Galleria as long as the pandemic continues as the Galleria simply does not care."
5,"This place is amazing. 

Love the parking spaces. Lots of variety of great quality department stores and restaurants. From authentic and sit-down restaurants to easy-to-grab dessert stands, you can eat til you throw up   and yes, you can show til you drop too! 

I like that they have lots of security personnel&apos;s around and they are visible. It adds up to the feeling of security to shop in peace. 

Restrooms are clean too! Definitely will come back to shop, or just to window-shop with friends and family! 

And If you like to ice-skate, come and check their rink out too!!!!"
4,"Checked out this mall, one of the best in Houston.  What can I say?  This is amazing in terms of their offerings and state of art tech from giant touchscreen directories, to the most powerful global brands, this mall has it all, including an indoor ice skating rink. 

Fabulous and phenomenal."
4,"I&apos;m writing this from the point of view of a mom with toddler twins.  I have been bringing my kids here since they could crawl because I needed to get out of the house but I wasn&apos;t ready to commit to any mommy &amp; me classes just yet.  The Galleria has a &quot;Little Galleria&quot; play area that my kids loved when they were babies &amp; still love today at 3.5 years old!  I get to grab a coffee/snack &amp; watch them play.. it&apos;s a one stop shop!  They also love to watch the water feature in front of Macy&apos;s, they find it fascinating!  Also, going up &amp; down the escalators is something they could do all day.

A parking secret is to park in the red garage off of Hidalgo (entrance on McCue).   The traffic near the Galleria is the reason it doesn&apos;t get 5*... it&apos;s just horrible, which is why I prefer to take the kids early in the morning."
5,This is pretty much the go to mall in Dallas other than north park. It&apos;s very big and pretty upscale. There is an ice rink on the first floor. There are also dining options such as Mi Cocina and Grand Lux Cafe. So you can shop dine in and have a cocktail.
1,"Love the environment because i love go to the mall, but still cannot believe that i got rob here in the most crowded parking lot ( i parked in the most crowded spot right under forever 21 ) in brought daylight! Horrible experienced! They stole my 1200$ worth of shoes! I hope the police and the mall will sorts these out! If not i may not go to this mall again because of this awful experienced"
5,"This by far is one of the cleanest, well lit, beautiful expansive malls in America.  Go at night and during the week so you can take in all of its beauty.  This mall is a mix of very high end to fast fashion such as Zara. Unlike Mall of America in minneapolis, Galleria does not have cheap or low end stores like Marshall&apos;s or Rainbow .  

I am a mall connoisseur and this one right here is top notch."
4,"Not a bad mall. Kind of disorganized for a galleria. The Galleria in Dallas is much more user friendly. The stores we did visit tho, had pretty friendly employees. The guy that sells the HUGE cotton candy was the best one. He was funny, and super down to earth. Plus the cotton candy was delicious! I recommend the banana! Yum. 
I have to say this mall was kind of basic. Yes it has a skating rink. That&apos;s something most malls don&apos;t have. I just wasn&apos;t over the top excited once inside. 
I&apos;d say I&apos;d go back if I needed to, or if the kids wanted to go, but other than that it&apos;s just not worth the mess with traffic and location. Nothing too bad to give low stars for but I just can&apos;t do 5*..."
4,"The Galleria is the biggest mall you&apos;ve ever seen! 

This is not your usual mall, the Gallery had multiple hotels which are directly connected to the mall. They also have numerous restaurants varying from your typical chain restaurants to some really high end options. The galleria also has an ice skating rink in the middle of it, and much more! During the holidays they also have a really beautiful christmas tree near the ice skating rink. This mall can get very crowded, specially during holidays and weekends so I would recommend for you to get here early. The parking can also be a little tough to find, so be patient when trying to find a spot. 

PSA: They have multiple screens around the mall which serve as maps to find all your favorite stores. Make sure to use them because it can be very overwhelming to walk this mall for the first time."
4,"This was my first time visiting this Mall. And I can say I was actually overwhelmed. This mall is Huge. You need 2 days to be able to shop through the whole place. I mean we had to stop multiple times to ask for directions or use the digital maps to find the store we were looking for. Now the digital maps are amazing. You literally can search for a certain store and it will give you accurate directions from your current location to the store you are trying to get to. Any store you can think of shopping&apos;s is probably somewhere in this place. They have a ice skating rink...,that&apos;s right you heard me.....an Ice skating rink in the mall by the food court...so you can drop the kids and the Hubby off there then shop to you drop...
Until next review 
Kisses"
4,"The Galleria is the largest mall in Texas - 300+ stores, an indoor ice rink, two Westin hotels, and office buildings. Gerald D Hines Waterwall Park is within 5~15 minutes of walking distance and there are plenty of free parking lots (e.g. Saks Fifth Avenue lot and Macy&apos;s lot). This mall reminded me of Beverly Center in Los Angeles with tons of upscale brands (most of them are located near the Saks Fifth Avenue / Neiman Marcus areas), electronic stores (e.g. Samsung Experience Store, Apple Store, Microsoft Store, etc), Telsa Store, and apparel shops you can commonly find in other malls (Banana Republic, Express, Forever 21. American Eagle Outfitters, Lululemon, etc).

Are there any stores that I can only find here and cannot find in LA? Not really, but it is still convenient that all stores are gathered in one spot.

P.S. - You will not find Nike, Under Armour, Calvin Klein, and Tommy Hilfiger, MUJI, and UNIQLO here (as of June 2019)."
5,"This is the best mall in Houston. I was born and raised here so I&apos;ve been here numerous times. It&apos;s only gotten better throughout the years. There are three levels and it is connected to a great hotel, and two restaurants. There are more stores than you can imagine. This is a great place to visit if you are new to Houston."
5,The Galleria Mall is an upscale high end mall in Uptown Houston. The mall has a ice rink skating area on the lower level.  Really nice mall. Three levels of stores. There is a nice size water fountain that pours out water from the top to the bottom. Very cool to see. Everyone is super nice. Houston has such great energy and hospitality. Be sure to wear comfortable shoes because you will get a good work out walking around this mall.  The mall is so huge that I needed 2 days to explore. I&apos;m pretty sure I still missed a few other stores.
