5,"Heard of this breakfast spot through Yelp and just had to try it. With this many amazing reviews? I had to know the hype. 
I&apos;m from San Diego, California and this was one of the many spots I was for sure gonna try. 
With COVID regulations, they did an amazing job. Social distancing and mask enforcement. 
I came on a Wednesday at around 7:30am and there was no line. We interacted with three different employees and all were more than friendly and kind. 
We got the wings and waffles and the French toast with eggs and bacon. Also a coffee. 

The wings and waffles were so amazing and complimented each other so well we would get this everytime, even if it wasn&apos;t an option together. Wings had a good spice and juicy. The waffles were moist, fluffy, and crispy on the outside. 
The French toast was crispy yet fluffy on the inside and the strawberries were fresh also. The bacon was perfectly done and the eggs were also a good choice. 
The coffee was strong and flavorful. 

An older gentleman (I&apos;m assuming the owner) came by and thanked everyone for coming in and supporting the business through this rough time. He asked how everything was and you could see the big smile through his mask. 


10/10 deserves all the hype and more."
5,"Lives up to the big hype! 

Everything about it was well organized.  

Arrived around 9:30am with a line that wasn&apos;t too bad.  Within 10 mins after arriving the line behind me formed down the block.  So it was very good timing on my part.   It was a lady working the line.  Keeping everyone social distancing and reminding everyone to look up the menu with their phones.  She was very friendly and firm at the same time.

Got to the front of the line in 30 mins. Had the options to sit inside or out.  We picked inside.  She told us to be ready to order at cashier when it was finally our turn.  So basically you pay first.  Order all food and drinks at the front cashier.  They had premade drinks in bottles for order too i.e lemonade, mimosas etc.  After paying you get a number tag to put on your table.  Also they have a table for all condiments, napkins, spoons, knives and forks.  

Food arrived so quickly!! Probably a 5 min wait time.  Food came hot and soooooo good!

Fried catfish and fried chicken were seasoned and fried so nicely!  So much flavor and crunch! Cheese grits, eggs, waffles, biscuits all so good!  Big huge portions too!  Definitely a must have when in Houston!  

I&apos;ll be back!"
5,"I was visiting Houston from Oakland, CA and a friend took my brother and I to this restaurant. He told us we needed to be up earlyyyyy to get in line to go eat here. We arrived at 8 and the line wasn&apos;t too bad. About ten minutes the line was down the street. So we got there just in time. 

So if just like to say the hype is worth it y&apos;all!!! The food was sooooo good. I&apos;m pescatarian so I got the French toast with cheese eggs (which were PERFECT and not all soggy) and gave my brother my sausage patties (which were huge btw). He and his friends ordered the chicken and waffle plates. The chicken looked sooo good. And apparently tasted good too. My brother and his friends were raving about the chicken and my brother enjoyed the sausage patty as well. We dived into our food so fast I didn&apos;t get a pic of anyone&apos;s plate except mine. 

The staff here were super friendly and the manager checked on guests to ensure they were enjoying their dining experience. The restaurant did ensure covid precautions (staff wearing gloves and mask, diners/tables were 6 feet apart or more, drinks were in to go bottles vs cups, staff passed out condiments, etc.). There will most certainly be a &quot;next time&quot; for us going back."
5,"Omg...I just love this place.   It was such a pleasure to have such great service from Norman and Gail.  Such a blessing to have strong service like that from our people 

We can&apos;t wait to come back down and spend more time at The Breakfast Klub."
4,"You can&apos;t be mad at The Breakfast Klub. It&apos;s not a forgettable experience. 
I&apos;ve been there several times and there hasn&apos;t been a point where it wasn&apos;t a line - but that&apos;s not necessarily a bad thing. 

In terms of hospitality - top notch. The lovely women that work there are those aunties that make you feel &quot;at home.&quot; - when the line has gotten rowdy in the past, they know how to bring the energy back to &apos;1&apos; without there being an issue.

It&apos;s a bit since my visit to The Breakfast Klub and it still pains me there&apos;s no drink that&apos;s priced to sell. But in any event you have to get it because you&apos;re already there and life is not that serious. 

Why 4 stars? I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been there without feeling the need to do a cleanse after the fact. Maybe I need better portion control and it&apos;s a personal problem - I&apos;ll have to work that out with myself I guess. 

I digress. 

In any case, there&apos;s no such thing as an uneventful visit to The Breakfast Klub. Any visit to Houston isn&apos;t complete without a stop here."
1,"The food looked better than it tasted.  The catfish had way too much flour and not enough cornmeal, plus the seasonings were off tasting. Fried wings weren&apos;t any better, again there was something off about the seasoning. Grits with cheese (not enough cheese) weren&apos;t at all creamy. 
Customer service wasn&apos;t great either. Told the person at them counter taking my order it was my first time eating there and my comment was met with a blank stare.  No suggestions, etc.
It&apos;s a no go for me. Been there,  tried it, didn&apos;t like it."
5,"It doesn&apos;t matter what time &amp; day you go, it&apos;ll always be busy. The parking is horrible but luckily we came while the restaurant was just steady. I really wanted to give this place a 5 star but unfortunately my experience left me giving it a 3.5 stars; luckily I&apos;m pretty nice so I&apos;ll round it up. We came around 10am and the lady at the door treated the customers in front of us with so much care but when it came to us she just shooed us to the side, but whatever it is what it is. 

Now on to the food, I ordered the Chicken &amp; grits with eggs &amp; toast. While the chicken was seasoned well, it was a bit on the greasy side &amp; I didn&apos;t like how the battered just disintegrated everywhere before putting it in my mouth. Idk if it was the grease or how they prepare the batter but I like being able to enjoy the crispy outside with the chicken. The grits were creamy &amp; buttery, my eggs were cooked perfectly to where I can pop that yolk and dip that mf toast into it. Sadly, the toast was probably my favorite as it was so buttery &amp; yummy. 

Overall the food was decent but it was a bit heavy for me, I did like the service from the cashier to the food runners but -1 for the lady at the entrance &amp; -.5 for the greasy chicken. Will I come back? It will be a while but yes I&apos;ll come back and try something different.

Updated 1-25-2021: originally this review was a 4 star but I am changing it to a 5 star because Terri (GM) called me to make things better. He was very apologetic &amp; he listened to my feedback. Terri was very caring in his approach to the situation and for that he gave you guys your 5 stars, you embodied customer service. Terri also invited me back &amp; I&apos;m looking forward to it. Thanks once again."
4,"I was absolutely floored by how amazing this chicken was fried! Whew, it was wonderful! The customer service was nice and the atmosphere was cool. 

I had the catfish which is the only reason why I didn&apos;t give 5 stars, it was very fishy tasting which isn&apos;t the best taste. Everything else was immaculate and I&apos;ll definitely be back to try other menu items! If you&apos;re in town, I suggest going in early because the lines but it&apos;s most definitely worth the wait."
5,"I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever had catfish this full of flavor!! Everything was delicious and the portion sizes are huge, so come ready to EAT! 

We ordered online and they have the most synchronized car delivery system I&apos;ve seen since the pandemic. We got a call making sure we were in the vicinity, they asked for our car details as well as checked our drivers license to make sure it was us. Now that&apos;s an extra layer of security I can get behind!"
5,"This is the ABSOLUTE BEST breakfast joint I&apos;ve ever been to. I could not believe how impressive everything was. 

When we got there, there was a long line and the parking lots are both small. Though the line was long, it moved quickly. We probably waited about 30 minutes, but it seemed to go by faster.

Inside, the music is loud and everything moves REALLY fast. You need to know what you want before you get to the counter to expedite the process. Their mimosas are prepackaged and cost $12. They have a wide selection of coffee to choose from and, due to covid, you let someone know what condiments you&apos;ll need, and they get everything together for you.

The food came out quickly and was very fresh. It tasted so good, lol - I really can&apos;t say it enough. Perfectly seasoned, and the right ratio of crispy batter to tender meat. The staff were friendly, efficient, and helpful.

The only downside (and it was minor), was that bc the music was so loud and upbeat (absolutely loved the oldies they played) and there were so many people, I did feel a little rushed to finish my meal. By no means was that the fault of the staff, though, just how I felt. I also recognize, though, that maybe that&apos;s intentional due to the volume of people they serve. I&apos;ve decided that any time I&apos;m in Houston, I will go to this restaurant.

TL;DR - VISIT THIS PLACE, YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED. Support Black-owned business!"
5,"From start to finish the experience was awesome. When you get there, there are a couple of designated places to park surrounding the joint. The restaurant is pretty small and very popular so expect long lines. The line was wrapped around the building but it moved so fast. They were organized in their process. They had amazing, friendly staff and the food was beyond what I expected."
5,"I went to The Breakfast Klub on a Thursday morning around 11:15am. There was a line wrapped around the building. We almost left, but decided to stay. The line moved fast and we enjoyed the music playing from the speaker while waiting. We waited in line for 30 minutes. Once getting inside we ordered our food and paid. Before getting seated, we were led to a table of condiments. One of the workers was there to get you syrup, napkins, ketchup, forks, etc on a tray before you got seated. This was a very nice touch. 

My food was coming as I was getting seated. WOW, I just ordered not even 5 minutes ago. I just knew my food would be warm and not good. To my surprise, my food was piping hot! I ordered the chicken and waffles with a side of potatoes. I also ordered a mimosa. I loved how they had the mimosa pre-packaged and it was still tasty! My food was so good and flavorful. The fried chicken was seasoned just right and crispy! 

I&apos;d like to thank The Breakfast Klub for providing a safe Covid friendly eating environment!"
5,"Nothing but awesomeness!!!! I was a little frustrated when I was dropped off by the Lyft driver because the line was literally 2 blocks long. However, my friends &amp; I waited patiently. Once we got up to the entrance, we were greeted  by a friendly older lady that gave us the run down since we&apos;ve never been there. I placed my order for grits, fried chicken wings, eggs, toast and orange juice. We sat outside and waited for our food to arrive and when it did....BABY BABY..,,,it was nothing short of awesomeness!! EVERYTHING had flavor, I almost lost a finger because the food was finger licking good!!! The customer service was exceptional....the manger and the general manager came out to ask us how was everything and offered us free mimosas. If you want some good brunch I would DEFINITELY recommend the Breakfast Klub."
5,"Listen... If you are in the area, and don&apos;t stand in line, you are missing out if you skip it. I get the wings and waffles.. I am a lover of wings. These are THE BEST fried wings you will ever eat. I do believe God is in the back battering, breading, and frying these juicy nuggets of heaven. 

The cheesy grits.... forget about it, they are so dang good.

Make the stop, wait the wait, you will be happy you did."
5,This place was perfect!! From the service to the food. Everything was superb! Took my family here and the wait was not long at all. The chicken and waffles was banging. The pancakes were amazing the sausage and eggs OMG!! Visit here!
5,"BELIEVE THE HYPE!!! Food is hot fresh and seasoned to perfection!!! Literally taste like someone&apos;s granny is in the kitchen cooking! My favorite breakfast place!!! Staff is friendly and welcoming! Price is reasonable! Resultant is always clean and well kept. Only down side is parking can be an issue, and lines for entry do get long. But I&apos;m telling you this place is worth the wait!!!"
5,"Food was fresh, experience was welcoming, a solid process in place to service clients.  Highly recommended, plus drinks were good too!"
5,"This place always has a line from what I&apos;m told. We did have to wait but the line moves very fast. I like the way they have things set up so you can get in, eat, and get out. You order and pay when you walk in and they give your assigned numbers to bring to the table. Yeah have a contactless space for you to get condiments and utensils. The food was absolutely amazing. I would recommend the chicken and waffles as well as the katfish. They have bottled mimosas and margaritas. If you want a light buzz go for the mimosas, if you want something heavier go for the margaritas. You will be sleep on the way home!"
5,"I have nothing but good things to say about this place. The Breakfast Klub is known as a Houston Staple and it is well deserving of its recognition.  We must&apos;ve lucked up again with another Houston restaurant, because we waited little to no time to be seated.  We arrived around 7am because we were told to go early due to the possibility of a crowd and long lines. We were fed and back ready bed at 8:25 am lol. We ordered the Chicken and Waffles and Fish and Grits. The highlight was the chicken -  it was honestly the best fried chicken I&apos;ve ever had, and I&apos;ve had my share of fried chicken all over the world lol.  Seriously, it was FRIED PERFECTION. My gal friend was kind enough to share her chicken with me.  I ordered the fish and grits. It was good too, but that chicken was unmatched. Okay, moving on.....

I appreciate the mimosas that they are now serving. I believe the bottles were around $12. Service was phenomenal.  The flow of placing your order, getting your plastic cutlery/condiments from assigned staff, to sitting down was pretty smooth."
5,"I love this restaurant they never disappoint, from the chicken and waffles to the fish and grits. It&apos;s always packed but the wait is so worth it!"
