5,"Delicious and tasty tacos. We were glad to see 4 different vegetarian taco options on the menu (more options than Torchy&apos;s), that had fusion ingredients such as tofu, paneer, falafel and the beer battered cauliflower. We ordered the paneer, falafel and cauliflower tacos and devoured each one!! The falafel one is in a lettuce wrap, but you can sub it for a flour tortilla. Service is fast. A lot of people were coming in for pickup. 
The location can be revamped as it does look outdated/slightly ghetto. 
The place gets crowded, so I recommend coming in a bit earlier to beat the crowd and get parking. There wasn&apos;t much social distancing being enforced."
5,"Moving to Texas turned my love for tacos into full-blown obsession like a crazy-eyed person infatuated with their crush.  My friend recommended this place after hitting up the driving range.  After coming here, this has become one of my favorite taco joints in HOU.  

Sadly since we&apos;re doing social distancing, take out is the only option. It&apos;s got a hipster vibe when you walk in with a killer menu and taco specials on rotation.  Also beer/margaritas is available since those wash down tacos perfectly.  I ordered the brisket and Nashville chicken tacos to go.  Also ordered a beer which they let me sip while waiting for my food which was nice of the them.  After I finished my beer, I decided to order the salmon and the Korean pork to go.  After getting home, I went to town on all four tacos savoring each bite.  No favorites as I loved all of them for different reasons.  Proteins were tender and soaked up the juices/sauces/dressings that topped them.  Also loved how they used to go trays to pack them instead of foil wrapping.  Made the tacos more fresh when I got home instead of soggy/wet.

Can&apos;t wait when they open fully for dine in.  Plus they are open late; what&apos;s better than late night tacos after a night of debachury!?"
5,"The shrimp and Grits taco is to die for, this is the gourmet of tacos. The staff is so friendly and so helpful. They are very virus friendly. They do have outdoor seating and the inside tables are set at social distancing. The menu is wide and has a tad bit of variety for all."
5,"Some of the most unique tacos in the game. Whatever your taste/flavor palate is, they&apos;ve got something for you. Being Indian-American, I am partial to the Indian-Style chicken and paneer tacos! But, the classics like Baja fish and chicken tings are also great. 

Make sure to try their awesome sides! The Thai curry queso is very unique and super tasty."
2,"Velvet taco has always been my tried and true but tonight it probably was the worst experience I&apos;ve had. I ordered some food togo at this location in store and I was the only person in the store besides the staff and maybe one table outside. I was thinking it would take no time to get my tacos. So on the ticket it had 7:44 as the order time and two other parties came and ordered food after me. I patiently waited for my food and both parities received their food before I did. I went to the register to ask where my food was and they seemed like they hadn&apos;t even prepared it yet. Apparently it was left under a lamp to sit until I went up and asked for it at 8:15! 

I only live about 5 mins away and by the time I got home my tacos were cold. The &quot;new recipe&quot; falafel had no flavor and was dry. The beer battered cauliflower taco, which I ALWAYS recommend to anyone who hasn&apos;t had velvet before. Didn&apos;t have a single cauliflower and it was all tortilla and no filling. Honestly surprised that seeing that they restaurant had no other tickets they would at least put some effort into our order."
5,"Me and my girlfriend met here for lunch recently for our first visit . We each ordered 3 because we both felt like we were starving when it was all said and done 2 would have been enough . We wind up taking one of them to go. I ordered a Cuban one , Nashville chicken , and chicken and waffles . And the chicken and waffles taco was both of our favorites never had a Taco of that sort before so flavorful and delicious! Can&apos;t wait to visit again and try others on the menu ."
4,"For years I&apos;ve been claiming that Velvet taco is overpriced and not that good- but I decided to come back after a friend suggested to. Still overpriced but very good, better than I remember. We got the spicy tikka, Cuban pig and shrimp and grits. All were good but the spicy tikka was the best. But so overpriced which is why it is a four stars.... I mean the shrimp and grits tacos is $5.75- like are you kidding me? This is Houston for goodness sake haha anyways here is my review- in summary, great tacos, really unique but pricey!"
5,Fantastic tacos. Great service. Really love this place. You can not go wrong getting food here!
4,Very solid tacos! A bit pricey but worth the try! Got the spicy tikka chicken and the slow-roasted angus brisket! Both were good! The spicy tikka chicken wasn&apos;t too spicy and had a nice aroma. My favorite was the slow-roasted angus brisket! Omg the textures of this taco was brilliant. The soft taco had a glaze of cheese on the outer shell which gave it a nice crunch. The brisket was tender and juicy! The toppings balanced everything out. That taco was just wonderful!
4,Came here last night after a night out glad I came the chicken Tika tacos where amazing. Don&apos;t sleep on the elote great place
5,"Wow, I can&apos;t believe I didn&apos;t try this place sooner! My experience at Velvet Taco was a 10/10.

First of all, there are so many unique tacos on the menu that it was very hard to decide what to order. My friend and I both went with the spicy tikka chicken and shrimp &amp; grits. I was so excited to taste a chicken tikka masala and taco hybrid, and it did not disappoint. This taco was delicious with the perfect amount of flavorful sauce! I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the shrimp &amp; grits taco as well. There was a good amount of cheese in this one which really added to the flavor.

I can&apos;t wait to come back and try more tacos! The chicken &amp; waffles and Korean pork are at the top of my list for next time."
5,"We love velvet taco... We usually go to the location in Dallas Texas but we recently moved to Houston... It never disappoints we get the chicken tikka, red velvet cake,... And sometimes we get there margaritas! You also cannot forget the queso cream of corn... It&apos;s all to die for. We sat outside is a beautiful day... Very clean environment and they had high chairs available for our daughter."
2,"This is one of the few times the star description fits the review perfectly. Meh. I&apos;ve experienced better. 

Long ago this place was pretty good, but now Velvet Taco isn&apos;t the pick of the litter in my book. And this isn&apos;t the staff. Service is still good when I go, but the food quality is down. 

My recent visit was probably my last.Went for the kobe burger, fish &amp; chips, &amp; spicy tika tacos. My tacos fell apart before I could even pick it up. I&apos;m not sure what&apos;s up w/ the tortillas, but they taste like a store brand tortilla. Nothing special. 

All 3 tacos were cold. I know the sauces aren&apos;t steaming hot, but why was the meat in the taco cold like I&apos;d driven across town? I ate out on the patio. The kobe burger was very dry as well. 

There are too many options when it comes to tacos in Houston, including in the immediate area."
5,Back again for the WTF WEEKLY TACO FEATURE.  Sweet Chile Shrimp is A HUGE HIT... I ate this taco twice at both locations... that&apos;s how this WTF hitting.   Something HARD.
1,"Food is solid. Not amazing. At least the chicken waffle was too sweet to my taste. The entire time we were there, the staff didn&apos;t clear any of the table that people finished dinning in. Saw so many people sat down at tables with used cups and napkins still on. Distance is not enforced. Guess the management expects customers clean up after themselves. Will definitely not be dinning in anytime soon. Will only consider to-go orders"
3,"Tip top spot make sure to get a piece of red velvet cake if you go, they give you a huge slice, best red velvet cake I&apos;ve ever had especially if you drizzle carmel on it sheesh taco was decent I jus felt like there wasn&apos;t enough in It so ima put it under torchys. 
Danrates: 7/10
Shrimp &amp; grits ~ $5.75

5,"Love the fish, shrimp and grits the Kobe burger!!! All really good. Ordered online and picked up at their window outside. Very convenient..wish they were in southwest Houston"
5,"Unbelievable menu, with great choices.   Quality of a Torchys Taco but better variety.  Always a great choice and fast service."
4,"I&apos;ve only had Velvet Taco while on call, but whenever it&apos;s decided we&apos;re having Velvet Taco, I&apos;m happy, because their tacos are fun and mad yummy even after being shuttled across the city.  Nuked in the microwave, they&apos;re mouth-burningly mind-blowingly delicious!  

The menu is always being updated with a new &quot;wtf taco&quot; of the week!  You can also find &quot;fusion-y&quot; tacos too-- had the #9 Korean Pork - pulled pork (not the type you get at Korean bbq) with super flavorful &quot;angry crema,&quot; an ever so slightly spicy sauce that made the taco super!  They accommodate requests with ease-- swap the corn for flour tortillas, opt out of the aoli, etc.  Never a problem.  I like how the tacos come in little cardboard taco holders even when delivered or for takeout.  Someone else on my call team got the tater tots topped with a beautifully fried egg-- totally getting that next time (can&apos;t say I didn&apos;t steal a tot)! 

Only downsides are that most of the menu includes fried stuff + and a lot of the flavors come with the sauces they use, and they&apos;re generous with drizzling them on (my #9 taco was drowning in sauce), but you can always ask for them on the side or omit the mayo madness.  

Solid tacos elevated by (sometimes too much) sauce-- I&apos;m looking forward to our next call dinner with Velvet Taco!"
4,"Always good solid food, never have left disappointed. Tacos and sides are good as is the service"
