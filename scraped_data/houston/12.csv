5,"Oporto is the perfect date night spot! My boyfriend and I came here for Valentine&apos;s Day and had a wonderful experience. Service was exceptional, food and drinks were amazing, and the restaurant was well laid out for social distancing and covid precautions. 

We started our night with the Classico and mango chili pepper caipirinhas which were both exceptional. The Classico tasted very similar to a margarita and the mango chili pepper had the perfect amount of sweetness with spicy seasoning on the rim. 

We then ordered four tapas for our main dishes which were the perfect amount of food for the two of us. Everything we ordered was bursting with flavor and something unique to try. We could not have been happier with our experience! 

The polio com batatas (grilled octopus and potatoes) was delicious. The octopus was cooked perfectly and did not have an real fishy taste which we enjoyed.

The lamb ribs Mediterraneo was my boyfriends favorite of the night! The lamb was fall off the bone tender and the red sauce, beans, and chorizo it was served in was to die for! The sauce and topping on the ribs was definitely one of the highlights of the night! 

The pao com chorizo (house bread filled with chorizo and potatoes) was my personal favorite! The bread was so fresh and perfectly crispy on the outside but still warm and fluffy on the inside. Will definitely have to come back for this one again! 

Finally we ended with the scallop farrotto. The scallops were very large and a the risotto was very flavorful and well cooked! The tumeric seasoning in the risotto paired exceptionally well with the scallops and was another good pick of the night!"
5,"I&apos;m so glad their terrific food is still available!  We usually curbside their meals and order on the very easy to navigate website.

Their grilled octopus is the best in town, great portion and the potatoes are tangey.

Wow, we had always wanted to order their seafood paella, but were reluctant because it&apos;s just the two of us, but the to go portion has so much yummy seafood and beef and the rice and peas is the perfect complement.

Their seafood soup, which I ordered for the first time, had great taste and good amount of seafood.

We were happy that their two currys are available -the spicy one and the seafood.

Their chicken empanadas are crispy and nice filling.

We adore their pastels de naita - crispy on the outside and creamy filling on the Inside.  Just like the ones we ate in Lisbon!

We always get a to go sangria bottle which is do aromatic and addictive.

We think we will need to get the Capirinhas the next time.

We also got a cool t-shirt today with an octopus!  Hopefully, they get more colors, would love to support them more!

Highly recommended!"
5,"After eating at Oporto, I just might have a new favorite date night spot! This little restaurant is trendy, intimate, and upscale... all the while being really affordable! I went for my boyfriend&apos;s birthday in a larger crowd and we were all very impressed by the attentive and friendly service. Almost all in attendance were Brazilian, and they simply loved the authenticity and flavor of the Portuguese tapas dishes! The favorites of the crowd were the lamb ribs, chorizo bread, fried cod, and grilled octopus. Honestly, my mouth is watering as I remember the food and write this review! The wine selection was vast, and there were quite a few very reasonably priced (and delicious) bottles of wine. The whole restaurant was very Covid friendly inside and outside. I&apos;m already looking forward to my next visit to this adorable and fun spot!"
5,"Oporto is one of those few places that has like 1500 reviews, maintains a 4.5star rating, and actually lives up to this hype! I must say, we went in with a healthy dose of skepticism but left extremely glad that our other restaurant choice had been closed that day. 

Let&apos;s start with how it works. It&apos;s a tapas style restaurant with dishes that are on the smaller side (as expected). However we were surprised to find they were reasonably priced and I would say ordering &quot;#of ppl + 1&quot; dishes would be enough to fill most ppl up. 

My personal favorite was the polvo con batatas (octopus w/ potatoes. It was cooked to perfection and was one of the most tender octopus dishes I&apos;ve had in a while. A very close second was the lamb ribs, which were once again cooked to perfection and just fell off the bone. They also had a delicious sauce to go with. Everything else tasted great as well, but these two were especially tasty.

Lastly, we had no complaints about the service and the restaurant atmosphere set a good mood as well. Apparently they have a great happy hour, which I will certainly be coming back to try!"
4,"We had a large weekday work lunch and sampled a decent portion of the menu since no one in the group has been here before.

It&apos;s located in the Midtown area; parking situation obviously isn&apos;t ideal. There looks to be some outside seating but we went inside. The interior is somewhat rustic yet and there were maybe 4-5 total tables that were occupied during lunch. Service is good; our server was very informative, just wish he came by more often to refill and whatnot since they weren&apos;t very busy.

Things we tried but I can&apos;t remember the exact names of...

Octopus- really tender and flavorful 
Curry chicken empanadas- pretty good, 3 to an order
Fish fritter- those were alright
Crab and avocado on toast- alright as well
Meat on a stick- tender, although slightly overcooked.  
Brussel sprouts with cheese- odd combo, not a fan 
Peri peri chicken with fries- well cooked and tender chicken. The fries were solid. 
Paella with steak and seafood- pretty damn good as well, seafood is tender and steak is cooked nicely 

Overall the food was interesting and tasty. Bang for the buck is not very good. Definitely would put this as a $$$ location. The tapas style apps are all pretty small portioned into 3 or so pieces. Definitely better than expected for trying for the first time, and worth trying other dishes in the future."
4,"HAPPY HOUR is a must! Weekday through 6:30pm

This is a tapas and family style place so sharing is definitely caring. Our waiter recommended about 2-3 dishes per person for sharing but we all have a big appetite so ordered more . 

Drinks: they have some drinks and cocktails on HH. Including house red, rose, and white wine, as well as sangria and the caiprihina (spelling? Lol). - ~$6

Food: we shared
- Batatas bravas: the best of everything. The potatoes were saut√©ed in this unique piri piri sauce and comes with garlic aioli. 
- scallop farroto: scallops was seared beautifully, and the rice/risotto with it had the slightest hint of curry that wasn&apos;t overpowering (not on HH menu)
- croquettes: stuffed with cod, it was filling and crispy
- sardines: grilled nicely but comes with this mint chutney that I personally didn&apos;t think meshed well.
- chicken wings: crispy, nothing different from other wings 
- calamari: over cooked/fried, very chewy. The bread it came on was VERY good 
- hangar steak sandwich: not pictured but the steak was well cooked and the bread was also good 

Overall, their normal menu looks good but some of the price Points are a bit high. If you wanna check it out, come to HH."
5,"Excellent and beautiful restaurant! Oporto is the best restaurant I&apos;ve been to in Houston so far. Finally, a tapas restaurant with portions for people, not ants! Wine selection was awesome.  We went to celebrate my birthday with my friends, and it was awesome! Delicious food, reasonable prices, excellent service and beautiful place!"
5,"I was very happy with the food and service at Oporto! I ordered the prego with sweet potato fries. My friend ordered some amazing curry! I will definitely get that the next time I go. 

For drinks I got the sangria which was sweet and good! The bread was also warm and delicious! 

Came here on a Friday in the afternoon and it wasn&apos;t busy. Was able to get seated right away. The inside of the restaurant is nice and I liked the atmosphere!"
4,"Oporto is definitely one of my favorite spots in houston. Since it&apos;s a Portuguese tapas restaurant, I&apos;d definitely recommend to go with a small group so you can try a lot of dishes. The menu is a little bit different from Pre-COVID but most of my favorite dishes are still there! Definitely some must tries are the batatas bravas and polvo com batatas. There&apos;s just something magical about the potatoes at Oporto that always makes me want to come back for them. The octopus is also always so tender and never chewy. Any of their bread/pizza choices are also solid. There are a couple dishes I personally would avoid, but the majority are all good. Service for me has always been exceptional and I&apos;ve never had a bad experience."
1,"Unfortunately I can not comment on the food from my recent experience. I have been to this restaurant years ago and it was decent. I came to get a table for two on Saturday night and the hostess explained how they are only 50% capacity and there will be a wait. I asked could I sit at the bar and I was curtly told that there is no available seating. (not even a slight suggestion that I can wait a while until a seat may possibly open up at the bar.) 

After I attempted to suggest anything else available the hostess then tells me that I could put  my name on a waitlist, it&apos;s a 50min wait and I will receive a text. I provided my number and name and assumed I&apos;ll hear back from them in roughly 45mins or so. My friend and I head down the street to a nearby bar and waited. Well, over an hour later I never received a message for the reservation I had made and no notification ever that my table was available. At that point I was not interested to even bother calling this place to get the run around again and be placed on another sham hold from the hostess."
3,"I was so hyped to come here because of all the great reviews from Yelp and from my local friends and family. overall the food was just okay to me. I think we just didn&apos;t order the right things!! 

Favorite - octopus (such a staple for this restaurant) and the Batatas bravas
Least favorites were the curry empanada and the tomato bread. 

Overall I want to come back during happy hour to try more of their dishes. Maybe I came in with two high expectations?"
4,"I&apos;m surprised I haven&apos;t yet written a review for Oporto considering how many times I&apos;ve been here.  I even celebrated a birthday here one year!  (Although side note - I didn&apos;t have a cake, but if you want to celebrate a birthday here and bring a cake, I think Oporto charges a cutting and plate fee per person.  This information is per my friend who tried to have a birthday dinner here.)  

For you vegetarians and vegans, there is a healthy amount of veggie options!  The menu denotes which items are vegetarian and you can ask the server which items are vegan or veganizable (the menu also indicates gluten-free items).  You can simply ask for the cheese or dairy component to be removed (or put on the side) for a lot of the vegetarian items and this makes them vegan.  One of my favorite dishes is the Feijao con Fideos.  It&apos;s hella hearty and delicious, although the last time I had it, it was disappointingly watery and sparse with Fideo - hoping it was a fluke!  I can&apos;t say I&apos;ve ever tried something that I didn&apos;t like, to be honest.  

Service has always been pretty decent and prompt.  The wine selection is clutch (not that I know anything about fine wines) and the servers are pretty helpful with suggestions should you in an undecided type of mood."
4,"I feel like I&apos;m missing some awesome ambiance by ordering Oporto on UberEats. But it&apos;s Covid times so hotel room dining it is. Had the polvo com batatas. Very good, and a very generous portion of octopus. I added a naan to the order cuz I knew the octopus dish on its own wouldn&apos;t be enough. Weird combo but I&apos;m full. Will probably order again tomorrow to try their scallops. It was a tough choice tonight."
3,"Food was great and the ambiance of the restaurant was too.  Rated a little lower based on service.  Had reservations and when we got there they said there wasn&apos;t one, even called earlier in the day a second time to confirm and was told yes so frustrating on that part.  

Service was just meh, they kept forgetting about us and at one point, who we thought may be the mgr asked if we needed anything else and we could order w him, so we did but then maybe 15 min later our server came over and said did you need anything else, to which we explained we ordered with the other guy.  He said he&apos;d check on it.  Maybe ten minutes after that, he said are you sure because there&apos;s nothing ordered?   Then said did you still want it. ‚Äç

All in all we liked the place.  Great company makes the experience better so we enjoyed it, just expected more from the service. 

Covid wise: masks were worn.  Social distanced etc.  good job with that stuff."
4,"Great outdoor seating, will say surprised how many people were inside dining in during COVID . Had the lamb squid mussels and tiramisu. If you want something different and tasty I recommend this place . I do think it&apos;s a bit expensive for the portion s but most tapas are like that. They were busy so took them a while to get us our second rounds of drinks but the waiter kept us updated"
4,"Exciting menu with tasty food! Loved that most menu items were tapas style which made the double date night more fun and collaborative. Also enjoyed not having to commit to one dish. From the scallops, to the lamb chops, to the mussels, to the paella, everything was very flavorful and cooked well. The only down side was that it didn&apos;t seem like the restaurant was taking social distancing too seriously like other places. Almost all of the tables were full which made myself and the rest of our party a little uncomfortable. Other TJ&apos;s that, highly recommended!"
5,"Dining here was amazing and covid safe! They have screens installed between each booth/table. I was eating with a friend and we each ordered 2 appetizers which was more than enough food for the both of us! The lamb was really good and was so tender that it easily fell off the bone. I loved the curry chicken empanadas - so flavorful, well seasoned, and I loved the curry spice in it. The Prego was also really good but next time I could do it without the fried egg. Really reasonable and good portion sizes compared to other restaurants this caliber! It&apos;s definitely leaning towards upscale but still casual. I think their menu items are well-priced. I definitely left here really full and we only had 4 appetizer-like dishes that we shared. Their menu consists of shareables and it makes it enjoyable to try different foods. They&apos;ll also validate your parking if you parked at the parking garage behind their building. I can&apos;t wait to come back again!"
5,"I went to Oporto for Friday Happy Hour. It was an early birthday celebration for me. I have been here many times pre COVID19. The service and food have always been amazing. 

We were greeted when we arrived. We didn&apos;t have reservations, but reservations are probably a good idea due to the restaurant insuring social distancing. We were seated and a very friendly waiter/mixologist came over to take our drink orders. We ordered the white wine sangria. It was light, sweet, and refreshing. The waiter answered various questions for us regarding the drink and food menu. 

So we started with the caprese salad. The flavors of the basil pesto and the balsamic reduction are amazing. Many other restaurants jus put basil leaves only, but the pesto makes the flavors pop. 

We then had the spinach and artichoke gratin crostini. It was warm and creamy on top of a perfectly toasted baguette. 

We ordered batatas bravas is s crispy potato in a spicy tomato sauce with garlic aioli. It is the perfect amount of spicy.  We also had empanadas  Oporto. They filled those with piment√≥n-spiced beef, pinenuts, and golden raisins. The pastry crust of the empanada is thin and crispy. They serve it with a apple cardamom chutney made in house.

I have been to Oporto many times and I love the fact that they are consistent. I know my service, food, and drinks will be phenomenal everytime I go. I have eaten at both location and both are always consistent.  

This restaurant is perfect for any occasion. Also a great date spot. 

Resturant Health and Safety: Everyone in the restaurant was seated with a safe amount of space away from others. Staff at the restaurant did have on face masks. There was hand sanitizer at the hostess station and before going to restroom area. 
 
Parking: Street metered parking"
5,"After several times here for take-out during the pandemic we are pleased that they have been able to maintain their quality.  One reason we like this place is you can order a bunch of small, different plates.    We have been here many times and not sure we have had the same thing twice.  Well, maybe a couple of favorites.  We started off with the Pao Com Chorizo which is a chorizo filled soft bread - very good especially with the spread.  We also had the roasted veggies, the brussels sprouts.  I had the Polvo com Batatas(squid in fried rice) and my wife had the scallops which were done perfectly (often over done at restaurants).  Our order, which was statused via text was neatly packaged and ready to whisk to a nearby park for a lovel picnic."
5,Wow.  This was our first time at this restaurant and the experience was awesome!!!  When we walked in we were greeted with a smile and warm welcome.  Nifa came ove and welcomed us.  She was very knowledgeable of all the food.  She asked us questions about what we like and offered several choices.. I can honestly say we enjoyed every dish.  We will come back..
