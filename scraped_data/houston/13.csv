5,"I haven&apos;t been to YoYo&apos;s since they were off Morningside. This is probably the most irresponsible thing a person or couple can do during a pandemic. Get in a huge ass line with mostly young people who don&apos;t really care about social distancing or properly covering their faces with their masks. Got in line at 9:15pm, 1 hour and 45 minutes later I got some hotdogs and still gave a large tip. Interesting fact; they&apos;re people that will pay for your hotdogs just so they don&apos;t have to stand in line to get their own. I got asked to get two extra hotdogs and the person asking would pay for mine and theirs. I said no because I feel like you got to stand in line to get your part of the deal. Funny thing is, just by a whim, we decided to go to the Rice Village Farmers Market the next morning, turns out the market is in the same location as YoYo&apos;s.

Long live YoYo&apos;s and Rice Village."
5,"Yoyo&apos;s never disappoint. I&apos;ve been coming here for awhile now (UH days). Their hot dog always tastes amazing. The only downside is the long wait on weekends, but always worth it. 

I stopped by Saturday night, as usual, the line was really long. No one was practicing social distancing, everyone was super close and no one in line was wearing a mask."
5,"D e l i c i o u s !!
So worth the wait, and very satisfying  FULLY LOADED is the WAY TO GO! 
**Enforcing social distancing, as well as taking temperatures!"
5,"First impression: reminds me of the set up they have in LA/Hollywood after the clubs where you&apos;re drunk and ready to eat anything greasy and warpped in bacon before going home to crash/call it a night. There was a long line but it moved fast. The husband/wife (?) team were KILLIN it... they moved fast and efficient and it was our turn in no time. Came here after a night of country music and two steppin/line dancing at Wild West. Perfect way to end the night. There were also small grouping of plastic chairs available to sit and eat, but I saw plenty of people just standing around or eating in their cars and then leaving once they&apos;re finished 

Food: The everything: Since I&apos;ve never been here before, talking to the other people in line this is what they recommended. Thick juicy hot dogs with grilled onions, crispy fried onions on top, spicy mustard, curry ketchup, mayo and sriracha. Not sure what else they put on it but it was sooooo good. I&apos;m glad my sister and I each got our own because I definitely did not want to share. 

Conclusion: 10/10 worth the wait in line. It&apos;s fast and it&apos;s DELICIOUS in the end... would definitely fly back to Houston for another one of these Yoyo hot dogs... (and to visit you dad! lol)"
4,"Excellent hot dogs! I&apos;m not usually a fan of hot dogs, but these were really good imo. The added beef on top and the sauce drizzle add well to the overall flavor of the hot dog. The line&apos;s a bit long, but it goes by fast. They&apos;ve got a pretty nice process flow going between the employees, so theyre really efficient. Worth the wait. I definitely want to come back next time I&apos;m in Houston! 

Only issue I had was that it wasn&apos;t the most sanitary, but it&apos;s a food truck outside, so you cant be expecting incredible sanitation standards."
5,"Man let me tell you my most hated American food: Hotdogs. I can never eat them. Never until I met YoYos, 

Yoyo&apos;s hot dogs made me rethink my priorities in life. It made me reconsider the true meaning of hate. I took one bite and realized that I do not &quot;hate&quot; hot dogs. In fact I love them. Ladies and gentlemen I love them because of Yoyo&apos;s hot dogs. These babies were not only flavorful but well cooked, very filling and the perfect combination of flavors. If every hot dog was like this, I would only eat hot dogs. I love it and highly recommend 

Each hot dog is so filling and honestly with a line as long as it racks on the weekends, you are better if buying some for the road. This restaurant is very pleasant and one of my top redteraunts in Houston"
4,"Great late night spot especially during cold weather  Love the dogs here. However, I personally would prefer the dog to be less salty! Other than that, everything else was so good! Bun smells amazing, topping is crunchy and everything goes really well together. Line is super duper long. My bf and I arrived 7:35pm on a Friday night and wait till 9pm. They open @ 8pm tho. Still, when I looked at the line after we left, looked like a 2hr waiting for me however it&apos;s worth it. Plus they play cool music so you can vibe in line with your friends while you wait"
5,IYKYK :) It&apos;s very rare for you to show up and see a short line but it goes by relatively fast. He served a looooaded hot dog with no substitutions. His recipe is perfection so you shouldn&apos;t try to alter it. This was my friends and I go to spot after a night out.
5,"The best hot dog in town. Worth the long line, worth the drive, worth my life. Lol jk. No, but seriously. I don&apos;t know how I have never come out here. I have tried Yoyo&apos;s a few times back in 2018 when their truck would come to Sugarland. But that truck no longer comes to our side of town. Yoyo&apos;s hours are 8PM-2AM. We ended up getting there at around 9:30PM and waited until about 10:45PM to place our order. Honestly, long line but worth the wait. This hot dog was absolutely delicious. I had no words per usual. The loaded hot dog which is 100% beef was so freaking good. My husband and I went back to our car and just inhaled our food in silence because we are truly fat and enjoyed every single bite. The hot dogs toppings included homemade honey mayo sauce, curry ketchup, sriracha, carmelized onions, crispy fried onions, warm cream cheese, and finished perfectly with pepper. So fresh and good. You will not be disappointed!!! Try it for yourself, you will come running back."
5,Best hot dogs in Houston! This is place a hidden jewel! Hot dogs are exotic and worth trying as they come without substitutions.
3,"What in the world did you deliver, order 5 regular 6 veggies get the 5 beef, i got one with no label that was beef, 3 boxes labeled beef, 2 boxes labeled be66, 1 labeled bebela...wtf is bebela....they all were beef."
4,"Really good hotdogs I do have to agree but not worth the one hour standing in line for.
Maybe I will have again one day when someone else waits for me lol."
1,"The hot dogs are great, but it&apos;s also pretty frustrating when you&apos;ve waited in line for 30 minutes and random people will just cut in front of everybody and try to ask for their order. It&apos;s even more frustrating that the people running this don&apos;t do anything about it and go ahead and take their order anyways. What&apos;s the point of getting in line if that continues to happen to customers?"
4,"What a great little late night snack. They&apos;re located in a parking lot and only during evening hours. The most fun is waiting in line with your buddies. Most people are coming from some kind of gathering so it&apos;s fun to just people watch. This little gem itself plays good music so you can&apos;t help but jam while you wait for your dog. 

They take both card and cash and are fast at getting orders our. They have a whole system and it&apos;s fun to watch. 

The dog itself is pretty darn good. They run $4 per dog and comes topped with crispy onions, honey mayo, grilled onions, sirracha, Curry ketchup, spicy mustard, and cream cheese. You can of course opt out on any of the toppings but fully loaded is definitely the way to go in my opinion. 

Tip don&apos;t share, I made the mistake of sharing and I had to get another.... so do yourself a favor and get one full one for yourself."
5,"BEAST MODE ALL THE WAY if you haven&apos;t been to Yoyo&apos;s then are you even in Houston?!?? The Line moves quick &amp; is worth it at any length. Homie hooked it up with 6 hotdogs like a boss the other night on Halloween. Literally you can swallow these they&apos;re that bomb. Pull up for some proper street style hot dogs made with that htx love that clutch city heart iykyk, enjoy &amp; eat on!!

5,If you&apos;re ever craving a hot dog and willing to wait in line then you came to the right place! YoYos Hot Dogs are delicious and truly worth the wait. I highly recommend them.
5,"My aunt and I waited 1hr 15min in line for these in the cold. Would do it again. Best hot dog ever. But not traditional as you would think, no chilli or cheese. Just a balance of flavor."
5,great effing glizzy worth the wait for his h-town staple.
5,"I am not usually a huge fan of hotdogs but these are incredible!!! The sauce &amp; toppings that they put on them cannot be beat! The owner is also so kind. The line is always way down the street, but it&apos;s worth it. During COVID it&apos;s a treat spot to go to since it is all outdoors and the staff wears masks! Only downside is you usually have to stand and eat, sit on the curb, or take it to go (but I would recommend eating it fresh). They also have vegetarian/vegan options!"
5,"One has to wait about 1 hour to taste the best hot dog in Houston. It opens only 3 days a week also, but the hot dogs are so good, and the wait is worth it."
