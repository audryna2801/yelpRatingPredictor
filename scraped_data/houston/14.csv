5,"The whole purpose of my visit to River Oaks District  was to go to the Stella McCartney store. The location in Dallas closed awhile back so I&apos;m Stella deprived.. unless you count the two purses sold in Neiman Marcus. We don&apos;t even have a Saks in Dallas, WTH! Okay it sounds like I&apos;m almost reviewed Dallas at this point, and it&apos;s not looking good... ;)

Any-who, I LOVED the River Oaks area! Super clean and ritzy. Lots of great stores and eateries. An overall fun place to walk and people watch, unless of course it&apos;s the middle of Houston summer.  Lots of parking throughout (I did go on a weekday so that statement may not be the case with weekends). I really loved the vibes here and I wish we had something like that in Dallas."
5,"Love the atmosphere here. So lux but very chill. Came here on some random weekends and they had popup events. There are a lot of luxury brands here like Dior, Hermes, Harry Winston, Hermes, etc. I love Hopdoddy Burgers here. Some restaurants have outside seatings which is really nice. There&apos;s directory stations around so it&apos;s easier to navigate. Surroundings are nice and clean and there&apos;s always security guards here."
4,"River Oaks, named after River Phoenix, has this fancy shopping area.

Good shopping center with insanely high prices and some high-end stuff - and I&apos;m not really sure why this particular shopping center gets the off-the-charts reviews when there are a few issues with it, but generally I haven&apos;t had too many, and unless you&apos;re looking for discount shopping you&apos;ll have fun browsing around here like we usually do."
5,Tupac and I LOVE COMING HERE! He is always welcomed at the D&amp;G store with fresh water in a huge bowl and given thousands of kisses by the employees and random customers. I love walking him around the shops and am able to bring him into all of the retail shops. The galleria isn&apos;t as dog friendly although several department stores in the mall allow them.
4,"What a beautiful place to shop and eat.We started off at several of the shoe shops. Very, very pricey but one of a kind. We also visited Cartier. We love this place but again very pricey.

The concierge service is exceptional. We pulled up and were promptly greeted by the concierge. He opened our door and greeted us with a smile. He then escorted us to our first shop. Super friendly and helpful. This is something we thoroughly appreciate.  It&apos;s customer service at their finest. 

There is fine dinning and casual dinning available. Check out the places on line. 

We&apos;ll be back."
5,"Love the restaurant​, shopping Tom Ford &amp; Stella McCartney​ !
The upscale apartment living is excellent as well."
5,"Definitely feeling the Cali/Beverly Hills vibes when you come here! Be prepared to come here and spend some money because the moment you step into a store you know your wallet is going to be itching to spend chunks of money!

Parking: They have a parking garage and it&apos;ll tell you how many spots are available and if you didn&apos;t pay attention above the empty parking space will be a green light and occupied with be red. Neato right?

A couple of my favorite stores are:
-Alice + Olivia
-Planet Blue
-Dior
-Cartier
-Hermes
-Dolce &amp; Gabbana
-Giuseppe Zanotti
-John Hardy
-Oliver Peoples
-Intermix
-Tom Ford
-Harry Winston

If you don&apos;t want to shop and you just want to hang out here they have a couple of great restaurants here and the best movie theater I&apos;ve ever been to iPic! 

Great customer service. I&apos;ve never had an issue with any of the sales associates."
5,"I&apos;m so elated that Houston finally has such a special retail/dining/activity center. I love what&apos;s been done with the district so far and can&apos;t wait for the rest of the stores and restaurants to open. You could even just come and window shop to enjoy yourself, but the restaurants are all so different and fun to try. 

So far, I&apos;ve been to them all except for HopDoddy Burgers, but I hope to try it soon. iPic I think is now the best spot in Houston to watch a movie. And, I&apos;ve even been there to meet friends for drinks. I didn&apos;t stay for the movie, but enyoyed lounging in the comfy couches and nibbling on the tasty foods. 

Now the shops... they are all so exclusive or so unique. You have the uber designer stores, which are amazing! But, you have Saint Bernard, which is like an upscale Anthropologie, and Alice &amp; Olivia that are more affordable but special. Then Jo Malone, Nars and Diptique! Just so much fun. 

I&apos;ve been taking visitors to walk around and enjoy the sitting area in the plaza near Dior and valet. Sometimes people have dogs out there, making it a nice spot to relax and enjoy the evening. Can&apos;t wait for Le Colonial and Bella Rinova!"
5,"This shopping center has so much to offer! Only a few stores are open now, but construction is still ongoing and hopefully it will be fully fuctional soon. It&apos;s more of a high end center, but that shouldn&apos;t derail anyone from coming to window shop or browse. 

If you don&apos;t want to shop, I would definitely recommend going to the theater and enjoy a movie. It&apos;s a completely different experience! There will be more restaurants opening up as well. I&apos;ll be waiting in anticipation."
5,"Beverly Hills, CA meets Houston, TX.. that is the best way to describe this outdoor high end luxury shopping center.

After almost two years of construction the River Oaks District is finally open for business welcoming fashion designers from all over the world.

Nothing you see here comes cheap, this is the shopping center where the rich and bougie AF people come to shop or want to be seen at.. the wanna-be A-Listers, the Real Housewives of blah blah blah. That is what this place is.

What stores will you find here that are so damn high-end and expensive that it will make you wish you had not one but TWO sugar daddies? I&apos;ll give you a rundown:

Hermēs
Dior
Tom Ford
Dolce &amp; Gabbana
Cartier
Harry Winston
Roberto Cavalli
Etro
Jo Malone
Saint Bernard
Vince.

And those are just some of the stores! It&apos;s also anchored by the only Equinox Luxury Fitness gym in all of Houston and an iPic Movie Theater that is more expensive than your traditional movie theater but supposedly the seats here are big AF to the point where you can spread your legs wide open and totally worth the price.

I for one love to drive by this place, even though I would only be able to shop here probably once a year after I save my shmoney and allowance. It&apos;s a beautiful addition to Houston and provides huge competition to the Houston Galleria which is right down the street."
2,"Lots of high-end fashion stores scattered throughout an outdoor walking mall. The layout of the mall is a little bit odd and can be difficult to navigate on foot or by car (due to all the one way streets). Navigation is more challenging when 2 out of the 4 electronic directories that we used were not functioning properly. Definitely a place where the rich like to congregate via restaurants with outdoor patios. You kind of get the impression the place is a private country club (and you&apos;re not a member). Overall, if there is a particular store that you need, it might be worth while. But if you&apos;re looking to browse different stores, you&apos;re better off going to the Galleria."
5,"Ok folks.  I&apos;ve lived I  this area since August of 2015 for work; having lived in the Capitol Hill area of Denver for work before moving here.  I will be moving back to the Chicagoland area on the 29th as my work here is done, Grasshopper.   All in all, I have to say, this is a very nice area of Houston and if I had to return to the city, I would come back here.  Lots of shops and restaurants in the area and its about as walkable as Houston can be due to the heat and the sprawl.
The Galleria is within walking distance of my condo, as is the St. Regis hotel.  The bar there has a fireplace that gives it a welcoming feeling on damp winter evenings.  There are a lot of empty or partially empty office buildings yet they are constantly building new; guess it&apos;s cheaper to put up a new one than retro fit an older building.  But that can make the area a bit spooky if you&apos;re out walking at night...way too many abandoned parking shelters.  Other than that...come on down to the business end of River Oaks."
5,"Do not mistaken this for Highland Village or River Oaks Shopping Center. This is River Oaks DISTRICT, and it&apos;s currently the premiere destination for luxury shopping in Houston.

River Oaks District is located off of Westheimer, in between the Galleria and Highland Village. It is easy to miss if you&apos;re just going down Westheimer, as there are really no shops facing the street. Most of the stores here are out of budget for me, but it&apos;s a great place to window shop, especially when the weather is nice. It&apos;s absolutely magical here during the holidays - the storefronts are decked out, and the lights in the courtyard are beautiful.

It&apos;s easy to spend a whole day here and drop some serious cash, with stores like Van Cleef and Arpels, Hermes, Dior and Cartier. Davidoff of Geneva is fantastic if you are looking for a fine cigar or high-end Dupont pen for your guy. 

I also can&apos;t say enough good things about the restaurants here. We love Steak 48 and Le Colonial, and Amorino has some of the best gelato in Houston. I&apos;ve also been spoiled by iPic, I don&apos;t think I&apos;d ever watch a movie anywhere else.

I can&apos;t wait to see what new stores and restaurants River Oaks District will roll out in 2017!"
5,"Equinox, IPic theaters, Hermès, Tom Ford, Canali, it would be awesome if they had a vilbrequin! Oh wait, they have one. Guess who is going to buy the sexiest bathing suits ever?

In all seriousness, this shopping center was well needed in Houston. They have the best movie theater with extraordinary reclining seats, the best gym in Houston, as well as some of my favorite stores!

It&apos;s almost as if I was back in Monaco! Houston suddenly became less boring!"
5,"When you want some designer ish this is definitely the place to go! This is basically rodeo drive meets Houston. Every designer you can think of plus more being built. Get ready to spend nothing less than 1K if you&apos;re coming to shop here (High Rollers only). They also have a couple restaurants that are actually really good and priced well, nothing too over the top. They also have an amazing theater as well that&apos;s perfect for date nights or just to go. I do love this shopping centre because it&apos;ll never be over crowded and their is plenty of parking."
5,Ready set go bring out your credit card and Shop. This place is less crowded during weekday so avoid coming on weekends.
5,"I just love it here...a beautiful upscale outdoor shopping plaza with fantastic restaurants, shops, and a luxurious iPic movie theater. The winter/holiday season is my favorite time to be here with all of the gorgeous lights, complimentary horse drawn carriage rides, live jazz music, and complimentary cookies, cocoa, and pudding for patrons. This plaza has such an elegant ambiance and good energy all around. Fabulous shops include Hermes, Cartier, Chopard, Van Cleef &amp; Arpels, Harry Winston, Patek Philippe, Dolce and Gabbana, Tom Ford, Etro, Stella McCartney, John Lobby, Diptyque, Alice and Olivia, Dior, Roberta Roller Rabbit, and Bonpoint...and that&apos;s not even ALL of them! For dining options, Toulouse, Le Colonial, Steak 48, Hopdaddy Burger Bar, SumoMaya and Amorino Gelato are all conveniently scattered throughout the plaza. There are some curbside parking spots and if those are all taken, a parking garage or valet are available, too."
5,I love the atmosphere in the environment and the beautiful scenery down over here in the river oaks shopping strip reminds me of something out of a movie.
4,"I love that Houston has so many diverse cultures and restaurants. I love the theater in this hot spot. If you&apos;re in the area, check it out."
5,"Very cutesy but elegant shopping district. Everything here is high end. Hermes is one of them. Where there is Hermes, there is luxury. The iPic theatre is just as fancy, if you want to splurge and be pampered for just watching a movie."
