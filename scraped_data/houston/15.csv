5,"This place has become one of my fave restaurants in Houston. I really enjoy the entrees and nigiri.

What I usually order and have eaten pretty much each time at kata:
Wagyu sando
Yellowtail and quail egg nigiri
Foie gras and scallop nigiri
Yuzu salmon
Miso marinated black cod
Amberjack foie gras
Bone marrow 

Lobster Mac and cheese is pretty good too but I gotta be in the mood for it.

Service has always been efficient. Atmosphere has always been nice. They keepin up with the covid times. Make sure you make a reservation!"
5,"Walking in, your greeted by a sweet host wearing a mask. We had reservations so we where guided to our table right away. 
The vibe is lovely, modern yet homey and sweet. Beautiful buzz of chatter in the background yet your still able to hold a conversation from across your table. 
Now the food! Just spectacular. 
My absolutely favorites :
The tropical roll
The yuzu salmon 
We ordered the whole menu every item was delish! I&apos;d fly back to Tx just to visit"
5,Let me start off by letting you know that Katie Velez was a great server. She made sure that we were comfortable and ready to take our order. When we walked in automatically greeted as it should be always. We love this place for the food and ambience. Social distancing rules enforced as well as mask which was great. This day we wanted to try the Wagyu sando which we&apos;ve heard only great things about it. They also have a lobster version on the menu. Since they have real Japanese Wagyu we had to get some of that before we left. As a dumpling lover I had to try the Wagyu Shumai as well. If you haven&apos;t had Japanese Wagyu you are missing out. La pièce de résistance was the Wagyu nigiri that just melts in your mouth. Our final item was dessert. We ordered the banana crème brûlée with extra Nutella foam. This place has been in my top restaurants choices for years now.
5,"Kata is literally my top sushi place to go to in Houston. I&apos;ve been going here for years and they never disappoint! Every time I&apos;ve gone I literally get all these dishes and spend $$$ but it&apos;s worth it. 

The bone marrow with uni and ikura was a special they had for a few months, but they&apos;ve taken it off their menu now. However their miso bone marrow is just as good!

The wagyu shumai is still on the menu currently, but I prefer the pork shumai over the wagyu one though. 

Their lobster sando just melts in your mouth. The sando bread is so buttery and tasty. Their wagyu sando is also delicious but it can be a little heavy.

The Japanese amberjack, yuzu salmon, hamachi w/ jalapeños and uni king crab spoon are definitely my go to favorites here. I have to always get these dishes no matter what!

My favorite dessert by them is the green tea cheesecake with the red bean ice cream. I can&apos;t handle a lot of sweet food and this dessert it perfect! It&apos;s not too sweet and just the right amount of green tea flavor. Definitely have to try if you like green tea!"
4,"Wagyu katsu sando : tasty but not that impressed
Sushi platter : their seaweed used in rolls is well seasoned and fragrant. amazing! All sushi pieces were really satisfying - literally melts in your mouth
Salmon + black truffle + quail egg : not that impressed
Nagasaki Champon ramen : broth is really good!! Plenty seafood in there - next time would request to cut ginger topping in half"
5,"Favorite sushi restaurant in Houston, hands down. Make sure to make reservations at least a week ahead of time for a realistic time to eat, especially for a Friday or Saturday night. 

Anything with the spicy Tuna is absolutely great and their drinks are very good/strong. You won&apos;t be disappointed."
5,"Went for my birthday! The wagyu skewers were my first time trying wagyu beef and they were so, so melt-in-your-mouth buttery, rich, and flavorful. The Shishito mojito was my first ever drink (!!) and was flavorful, punchy, and a great recommendation from the server.

The sashimi bowl had a fantastic assortment, and every cut of fish was so fresh and was everything I expected from a high end place, for a surprisingly affordable price! The dessert of red bean ice cream and green tea souffle cheesecake was so creamy, and the hot with the cold was a party for the taste buds.

Also, loved the naturally lit seating area at the back of the restaurant!"
5,"I love Kata Robata!! I&apos;ve only tried this place once but it is now one of my favorite sushi spots in Houston! My sister and I were starving so we ordered A LOT.

Items we ordered:
1) Uni pasta
2) Uni nigiri 
3) Toro uni caviar sushi
4) Kinmedai (Japanese golden eye snapper)
5) Foie gras and scallop
6) Wagyu A5 nigiri
7) Akamutsu (Japanese sea perch)
5) Lobster and crab ramen
6) New Zealand salmon
7) Tamago Castella 
8) Toro &amp; Ikura Roll 
9) Texas Hamachi Roll
10) Rising Sun Roll

Overall, everything was delicious! The quality of their fish is amazing and fresh, definitely top notch. My favorite item was the toro uni caviar sushi. You get blue fin tuna with sea urchin and caviar on top. Ugh soooo good. I thought the uni pasta was just okay. It had more of a mushroom flavor that was overpowering, and I wish there were more pieces of uni in it. I probably wouldn&apos;t order the uni pasta again. Anyway, I can&apos;t wait for my next visit to Kata Robata!"
5,I had a great experience. Was told this was the spot to go to when driving through Houston. Service was great. She made excellent recommendations. I left fat and happy =)
5,"Great atmosphere and excellent EXCELLENT sushi. The customer service was amazing here. I love the thoughtful gestures  included in the service. For example, after we received our fresh spread of sushi, we were offered to have the shrimp heads deep fried (Do NOT refuse this, trust me). Our underage drinker in the group had an (underage lychee martini) , which had a really nice presentation and taste for a mocktail. I could say so much about this restaurant, and all of it is great. Definitely recommend"
5,This place is hands down one of the best sushi spot in town! I am a true fan! Fresh made ingredients daily and made to perfection. Customer service is excellent! I&apos;ve tend to over order but why not? You can&apos;t go wrong with any on the menu.
2,"TLDR; Food poisoning in two separate orders of the DIY handroll kits. Avoid at all costs. 

I wanted badly to write a positive review for Kata Robata. I&apos;ve dined in on a few occasions and usually only have good things to say about the fish; most of the other small plates or hot dishes are also quite good. My Sunday dinner, however, was drastically different. My party of 4 ordered two sets of the DIY handroll takeout kits, each of which comes with 10 sheets of nori, rice, tempura crunch, spicy mayo, avocado, cucumber/jalapeno strips, and fish (tuna (akami), toro, yellowtail, shrimp, and salmon). For only ~60$ for a two-person kit, it definitely isn&apos;t a bad deal, as the amount of fish is pretty generous for that price point (though I wish they provided a little more rice).

The surprise, however, came after when all 4 of us got severe food poisoning. Considering it was from a place established (and expensive) Kata Robata, where the fish typically tastes quite fresh, I was extremely surprised and disappointed. There&apos;s no discerning if it was just something in the fish, or if it hadn&apos;t been kept at the proper temperature, or if it was due to sanitation issues at Kata Robata, but during COVID, the possibility of contracting any type of illness from food (and paying 60$ to do so), isn&apos;t worth the risk of dining here again and figuring it out. Because this place really has impressed me in the past, I&apos;d be willing to visit again later on, but I would really recommend staying away for the time being.

I guess this is why people say not to eat sushi on Sundays :("
4,"Kata Robata rarely disappoints me. The interior is really cozy and chic. Our server is super friendly, professional and knowledgeable. He recommended a lot of good stuff. I love foie gras here. Doesn&apos;t smell weird like other restaurants I&apos;ve had. Uni is rich and flavorful. I don&apos;t really care for the rolls tbh. Omakase was standard. I had the matcha cheesecake for dessert and it was bomb! A++ for the food decoration. Would love to go back and try new things on the menu."
5,"I&apos;ve been waiting months to come here! My sister was visiting from out of town, so we made reservations the night before. Menu is kind of difficult to see since it&apos;s all through the phone. What we ordered:

7 sushi and roll ($22 + $5 for king crab cali): Amazing deal that&apos;s part of their lunch. Great selection of nigiri, and i was quite surprised how good the king crab cali roll was - definitely worth the upgrade.

O-toro premium fatty bluefin tuna ($12 per piece): veryyyy fatty, and delicious. ate it before the wasabi arrived, which would&apos;ve made it much tastier

Foie gras &amp; scallop sushi ($17 for 2 pieces): BEST. THING. I. EVER. TASTED. it was melting in my mouth and had soooo much flavor. i would order this 1000x if i could afford it. 

Wagyu sandos ($20): super super tender. so hearty and helps to get you full in combination with the sushi/sashimi"
5,"Finally tried Kata Robata after so many recommendations, and it did not disappoint.  Had really good service and good food, and the ambiance was great.  Definitely cannot wait to come back to try their other items!  Also, it seems as if the menu changes seasonally.

We had the following:

Texas Wagyu Katsu Sando
Lobster Mac
Kobe Beef Skewers
Miso Crusted Bone Marrow
Japanese Amberjack Sashimi with Foie Gras
Hamachi Kama"
2,"I&apos;m just disappointed

I come here a lot and to be denied my food cause I used QuadPay with proof of purchase.

My bf sat outside one day while I sat and ordered my food to go, then used my boyfriend&apos;s card to pay and was asked if he can come in and show proof of I.D.

I know losing a lil ole faithful customer like me doesn&apos;t matter but I can keep spending my money here to be discriminated against."
5,"Great sushi spot that we love coming to! Fish is always fresh and love the options they have for both lunch and dinner! Be ready to spend quite a bit but it is totally worth the delicious fish and the service. 

Will definitely be coming back to Kata Robata many times!"
4,"We went back, this time for a 2 person dinner date. We got papaya salad and some sashimi for apps, and rolls for entrees and some drinks. The food is still decent but service definitely was not as good as when we had a larger party. Obviously Kata is still on the pricier end compared to other sushi joints but you get what you pay for to a degree. The service this time was a bit slow, our request to be moved because it was super cold due to the AC was totally ignored by our server. 

Food 4/5
Service 3/5
Ambiance 4/5"
5,"Everything we ordered was amazing! 3 girls spurlged on a nice dinner and left extremely full. That night, unfortunately, they did run out of Foie Gras. SERVICE was on spot. Our water glasses were always filled and the food came out in a timely manner. 

COLD 
- KATA FRESH CATCH MIXED CEVICHE ($15): BEAUTIFUL presentation, the taro chips added a nice crunch texture to the dish 
- HAMACHI &amp; JALAPENO SASHIMI ($15): 6 pieces of hamachi, very citrusy. The LEAST MEMORABLE dish but still delicious 

HOT 
- MISO CRUSTED BONE MARROW ($16): Pleasantly surprised because it was a bigger serving than we thought it was, served with a side of crusty bread. We needed more bread but forgot to ask for it. Very RICH &amp; BUTTERY 
- MISO MARINATED BLACK COD ($18): About FIST SIZED, mild fish flavor but so SOFT &amp; FLAKEY. Can&apos;t go wrong with black cod. It&apos;s almost always delicious 
- MISO LOBSTER MAC &amp; CHEESE ($19): Oh my lord this was one of my favorite dishes! Big chunks of lobsters, 3 different types of cheese, and the miso adds this addictive UMAMI flavor. Seriously I would get this every single time I come to Kata 
- TEXAS KOBE BEEF SKEWERS ($18): The order comes with 2 skewers and each skewer has 3 MELT IN YOUR MOUTH pieces of beef 

SUSHI 
- SAKE / NEW ZEALAND KING SALMON ($4/$6): I believe each order comes with 2 pieces so we did 2 orders of each. The salmon was fresh and high quality. The King salmon in comparison had more fatty marbling so it was softer. You can see in the photos. 
- CHU TORO ($10): Medium fatty tuna
- SPICY CHOPPED SCALLOP ($4)
- UNI ($9): Sea urchin isn&apos;t everyone&apos;s cup of tea but it&apos;s literally the OCEAN&apos;S BUTTER. Good uni gives you this clean briny sea flavor that is so refreshing. Uni doesn&apos;t taste good everywhere but Kata definitely has good uni 

SPECIALS
- UNI PASTA ($35): My other favorite dish! The noodles were al dente, the sauce was DECEDENT, CREAMY, &amp; SAVORY. It was just an amazing experience. 5/5 would definitely get this again

For drinks, we had the KOKONATSU LYCHEE ($11). We were so full we couldn&apos;t order dessert but I know their desserts are amazing. The next time I come back I&apos;m definitely gonna have all the Foie Gras dishes since I missed out of them this time."
5,"1st: To the previous customers who wrote 1 star because they didn&apos;t think they didn&apos;t have time to eat or someone was rude. Please do not return. Giving a 1 star for 1 problem is not cool. But! On the bright side, this allows more space for me to return! :)

The food, service and staff were amazing!!!
I am new regular. 

Order: King Lobster roll, Duck Breast Ramen. All freshly prepared, huge shout out to the kitchen. 

Staff: Edward was great! Very knowledgeable and friendly, he made the restaurant feel like home. Thanks Edward!"
