5,"In short, this is an authentic Italian restaurant serving up house-made pasta with fresh ingredients and well-rounded flavors. The moment you walk in, the aromas of the kitchen will fill your senses and you will want to order everything on their menu. 

The ambience is warm, inviting, and transports you to the Italian countryside. Only downside is that it can get pretty loud, otherwise this place is good for dates and groups alike. The service is impeccable, and they have an open kitchen where you can watch their craft. Highly recommend this place, and I can&apos;t wait to go back."
5,"My first time to experience North Italia was a few years ago. I just dropped in to meet with my CPA over coffee. The place was busy, and I honestly didn&apos;t pay much attention to the menu. Present day, Yelp lead us there because we were looking for a kitchen open past 9pm on a weekend (semi hard to find these days). Their kitchen is open until 11, first off. 

From the food to the service, we were completely impressed. Yes, it&apos;s a chain, and it was out of our way as we were coming from the East End, but pizza, salad and wine -- great way to do a casual dinner date night. So yes, believe the hype. Believe the reviews. The food is really good: I highly recommended the grilled cauliflower, arancini, arugula and avocado salad, margarita pizza and wine recs. Our server Everette was great and we really appreciate the entire staff working so hard to try to keep things as normal and safe as possible during these effed up times. 

Looking forward to trying their brunch. Patio seating available. Face masks are required and also provided."
5,"The first thing the waitress asked was if we had any dietary restrictions, which I felt was really nice and thoughtful. She offered some suggestions since we were first time guests. The Zucca chips are really good as soon as I saw them I thought no sauce, but to my surprise they were perfect! Our waitress recommended the Ginger Blossom Margarita and it was really refreshing and good. The pizza was crisp and I loved the cheese I will definitely order again. My friends both got the Spaghetti Bolognese, it was fresh pasta and the sauce was so good I almost regretted not getting some, but they were kind enough to share with me! The manager came near the end of our meal and was very kind and made small talk. It was very nice to come out during COVID and have such an amazing experience."
5,"To start, I would like to state that I am not an Italian food kind of person. I can find something to eat at an Italian Restaurant, but it&apos;s not my favorite. 

With that being said, it was delicious! I even got leftovers and the pasta still tasted great the next day. 

The zucca chips were in fact &quot;yum!&quot; Just as advertised. 

Will be returning! 

The only con, it was a bit noisy in the establishment. It&apos;s a smaller restaurant and the kitchen is basically out in the open. (Which was cool to see all the chefs work and make the pasta!)"
4,"My first foray into outdoor patio dining during the pandemic was an interesting one. Last Friday after a round of particularly grueling exams, my friends and I were longing for some pasta to drown our sorrows. We decided to make the trek to the Galleria area to North Italia after calling around 5 pm and confirming they would have space for 6.

Z and I were the first to arrive and we were happy to be led to a secluded table on the side of their outdoor seating area. The restaurant looked quite busy inside but the activity had not yet picked up outdoors. As a few others arrived, we began placing orders - we opted for the white truffle garlic bread to share, and Z and I split an order of the funghi pizza and the squid ink malfaldine.

The bread was the first to come out, and suffice it to say it was gone within a few minutes. Seriously, I&apos;m salivating thinking of it right now. As our entrees arrived, I was most excited for the pizza, and with good reason. The crust had just the right crunch level and the mushroom-onion pairing was divine. Unfortunately, the pasta didn&apos;t quite hit the mark for me. My friend enjoyed the mint flavor which I found unique, but the chili and fennel were overpowering and my throat was a little irritated. That being said, the seafood and black pasta combination was quite interesting and I&apos;m glad I tried it.

Generally a very pleasant meal for a hungry bunch of students. While definitely on the more expensive side for my budget, I enjoyed North Italia and would definitely try it again if I find myself in the area. I would love to try some of their other pizza and pasta offerings, and you can bet that I&apos;ll be getting multiple orders of that delicious bread!"
3,"Full disclosure, I&apos;m and old toot, and this place is for my grandchildren.  The clientele are much younger than my wife and I.  I did like the music they were playing, and the waitperson was one in a million.  If I were still in the workforce I would hire this young lady to sell something.  She made the visit for us.   

For my meal I chose the Chicken Parmesan (my bell weather for an Italian restaurant).  I was really disappointed.  First the dish had tempura breading on the chicken- which i really don&apos;t like and the menu made no mention of it..  Then the amount of sauce for the dish was rather Spartan, shall we say two thimbles full.  Thank goodness our wait person brought extra upon request.

While there I did see some great looking pizzas going past the table, unfortunately none stopped at mine.  But, I really liked the atmosphere and we WILL GO BACK, but at that time I will order the pizza."
4,"Return with my son shine,  in celebration of receiving my 6th ROTD today. Yay!  
Kam ordered the salmon fettuccini alfredo (not a menu item) I ordered the chicken pasta dish came with mushrooms and spinach.   It was excellent.  

Extra sauce with your dish is a $2 charge... wasn&apos;t the same previous visit.   I had e a pet peeve when folks charged for ketchup and extra things as such.  Ugh.  
Service was great through,  Matthew is fantastic."
3,"I was a little surprised that my review wouldn&apos;t be better for this place considering the amount of stars that it had. I cannot say that the food was bad it just was not the best. I ordered the margarita pizza and the pesto chicken pasta. The margarita pizza was mediocre it definitely could&apos;ve had much more basil on it. The chicken pesto pasta was okay it definitely needed salt and the pasta was a little overcooked. They should serve this dish a little more al dente and definitely needs more salt. I ordered through DoorDash, so maybe I&apos;ll visit in person and give this place another try."
5,"Been on here on multiple occasions and have never left disappointed. My recent trip here was for a Sunday brunch and everything was fantastic. Their soup of the day was a crab and lobster bisque which was OUT OF THIS WORLD. Sadly... it was for the day only and we asked the waiter who said he doesn&apos;t know when it&apos;ll come back :( 

Other than that this place is always good. Can&apos;t go wrong with the truffle garlic bread as a starter. Super rich and crunchy bread with a truffle cream to slather on top. 

Their pesto chicken pasta was also great! Super refreshing and light. 

Their chicken parmigiana is delicious. Served with an Alfredo pasta instead of a red sauce which is a nice change. 

We also tried out their breakfast pizza which was surprisingly great. It was a gravy base with scrambled eggs and meat on top. Delicious. 

I also got the short rib hash which was Good not great but enjoyable nonetheless 

Can&apos;t wait to go back!"
5,"Returned to North Italia and they continue to deliver the food and service goods.    We arrived on a Saturday before 5 and thought we would be ok without a reservation.  They were busy and already booked so there was about a 20 minute wait.  We took outside seating as it was the quickest available and a nice day.

We ordered the Beef Carpaccio starter and it was amazing (toasted pine nuts took it over the top!) paired with their grilled bread with olive oil.
For mains, we ordered the Squid Ink Malfadine and Bolognese.  The Bolognese was excellent (again!) The Malfadine with an abundant amount of shrimp and squid and a slight spicy kick didn&apos;t disappoint.  Enjoyed with a draft Peroni!
So hard to believe this is a small chain!
Servers from beginning to end (again) took great care of us!"
5,My Favorite place everr!!! I come here every time i get a chance because everything is literally to die for! My fav is the roasted salmon. everything on this dish is well balanced and very tasty!
5,"North Italia is one of my all-time favorite Italian restaurants. Today&apos;s visit was my first since being diagnosed with a severe gluten allergy. They have several gluten-free options, and the manager came to my table to go over the measures they take to prevent cross-contamination. He also told me the Caesar dressing has gluten in it, so we opted for the oregano vinaigrette (which was divine). My husband and I split the chicken Parmesan, and the GF pasta tasted incredible. 

The kitchen also changed their gloves when handling my order, and I didn&apos;t have any symptoms of accidentally being glutened. 

Their drinks are also extremely refreshing, and the staff is extremely attentive. Service is consistently wonderful, and the food is always hot and fresh."
4,"Delish.

Calamari was new. It was lightly dressed. Which I&apos;m so used to heavier saucey calamari.

It was a nice touch.


Chicken parm was nice. I jus wish the sauce on the chicken parm was a bit more flavorful.
Butter pasta on the side was a nice balance.


The squid ink pasta was amazing. The only issue I had with the dish was that the flavor in the sauce was amazing! But!!! The flavor should have popped more. It was too light. It needed more strength!! The flavor, as amazing as it was kinda gets lost within the dish."
5,"Amazing! Ratings on point, customer service excellent and food even better. Thanks and hope to stop by again when in town next time!
I had the Chicken Parm and for appetizer had White Truffle bread that was out of this world! My son enjoyed his cheese pizza (well he added pepperoni) kids meal!
Parking available at the garage right around the corner from restaurant."
5,What a wonderful first impression! I ordered a half salad and should have gotten the full size because it was so delicious!! Everything came out fresh and correct; our bartender Nicholas was super friendly and engaging; the vibe was just right! I will be returning with friends :)
5,"3 years later! I still love this place! The margarita pizza is my fav! Best in the city hands down. Thank you Tanner, Ray, Matt and Dustin. I always have a great time when I come here! Keep up the great work!"
5,"Great pasta, great wine. Good atmosphere. Ended with limoncello. Perfect place to have a romantic evening or a night out with friends."
5,Eddie was our server was wonderful!! Garlic bread was so good and so was the tiramisu. Yum!!
4,"It feels good to sit outside now. With a heater!

Very recommendation Squid Ink Mafaldine!!
Love spicy  love it~

Zucchini Chips are a little oily. They&apos;re not a healthy choice."
5,The service was spot on! I came late but the waiter noticed immediately and came to get my order. He quickly recommended a few dishes since I didn&apos;t have much time to look at the menu. His recommendation turned out to be a great one! The bolognese and meatballs were delicious and I would have again! I will say the serving sizes are a little small for me but what they serve is delicious!
