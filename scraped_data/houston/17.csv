5,"Their menu is *DELICIOUS*! Support this business! 
The sandwiches, the salads, the sides, the entr√©es, the soups, and their desserts! I can&apos;t stop bragging about them!

Sandwiches:
Top 1 favorite ever: garden sammie. As a sandwich or a salad. Bread or no bread? I&apos;m not a vegan myself, but this ingredients combo is soooo delicious!
Favorite alternatives : crunchy chicken (that mystery sauce and crunchy chips!!) , banh mi, egg salad.

Favorite salad (if not converted from the sandwich) - Asian chicken.

Want something warm? Fall power bowl. Again, not a vegan, but how can you say no to greens at this point?!

Soup - posole all the wayyyy! Spicy kick and *happy dance*

Sides : seasonal! Makes it so exciting and always new things to try. Don&apos;t forget to try their homemade chips! 

Cashew queso - unfortunately, not my taste..

Dessert - that choco chip cookie.... Get it, even if you&apos;re full! 

Generous portions, locally sourced ingredients, best COVID handling I&apos;ve witnessed and still holding up their standards after 7 months (masks required from the beginning ever, hand sanitizer available, social distance, table cleanup right after you leave), very very consistent food and service from my almost weekly visits. They have a really big and pretty patio! I love this business, you should too !!"
5,"I love love love Local Foods! During the pandemic, many restaurants have slipped when it comes to quality and service, which of course is understandable, but this place has even stepped it up! 

I ordered via their site and my order was ready on time with an easy, limited contact pickup. I got the crab and shrimp sandwich and substituted for pretzel bread which comes with two sides. Another plus is that their meals travel well since I don&apos;t live close by. This is definitely my go to for the time being."
2,"Why is everything here is soooo salty??! Last time I ordered the salmon dish to go it was so salty I couldn&apos;t eat it. Unfortunately same thing today potato soup &amp; winter power bowl was so salty can not eat it. 

Im giving it 2 stars because the staff is friendly and the restaurant is nice,
but the food is inedible. 

Salt to taste might be a good move? 

Will miss this place I live in the neighborhood and use to frequent this place weekly. 

Why market this as healthier option when it&apos;s sodium content is so obviously off the chart. 

I wont be back :("
4,"Great healthy food.  Love the vegan options.  I do miss the vegan frito pie on the menu as that was a favorite. I hope they will bring it back.

I recently tried a few of their new menu items - vegan power bowl and vegan spinach dip.  The spinach dip was so amazing!  The vegan power bowl was also a really good portion and good vegetables. 

I like that they have outdoor seating and its quick service.  This is a great place for my vegan friends who are wanting more variety of options!"
4,"Local Foods is always a fresh take on lunch or brunch. The outdoor atmosphere is really nice and with the wonderful Houston weather it&apos;s always a great place to grab a bite.

The vegetarian and vegan items were really good, and was a nice break from all the meat and carbs. So having a bite that&apos;s flavorful but not as heavy. As always, highly recommended for a lunch in Upper Kirby. We got the Vegan Meatball Sandwich and the Market Veggie Sandwich."
5,"Who doesn&apos;t love fresh food that supports the local community? Local Foods just does that! 

ABOUT LOCAL FOODS: 

With a total of 5 different locations in Houston and Houston only (Austin location is coming soon), Local Food gives, &quot;Flavors So Fresh, You&apos;ll Swear Our Food is Flirting With You&quot;.  Local Foods partners with local communities to help supply their fresh ingredients every day. Local Foods takes pride in making sure the best ingredients are given to its customers while helping the community. &quot;We believe crave-worthy meals begin with great, local ingredients. Bringing together great food with great people does more than just create great meals, it has the power to create lifelong partnerships and inspire greatness, &quot; Local Foods website. 

MY EXPERIENCE:
Fresh ingredients and they mean it. This was my second time coming to Local Foods (went to a different location last time) however, I already knew what I wanted without even looking at the menu again. When I first came to Local Foods with a friend, she told me that there was a sandwich I needed to try. I ended up being a little skeptical but she&apos;s right, I needed it. Before we talk about what I had, I want to quickly talk about the menu (I do not have a photo because we had to use a QR code to get the menu). Each location is different due to the fact that there are different suppliers for different areas. One thing I think is really cool is that they cater to everyone and I mean everyone! Vegetarians, vegans, and those who have gluten allergies are welcomed here! You will find something that will make you feel good.

The Gulf Sandwich is literally my go-to at the Local Foods. It contains blue horizon shrimp &amp; blue crab, tomato, pickled onion, and green goddess dressing on ciabatta. The combination of all these ingredients is so refreshing. The chunks of shrimp are very refreshing. For the sides, I got the red potato salad and broccoli quinoa. The red potato salad is really good. Last time, I got their fresh house-made chips. 

I would recommend going to Local Foods if you want something refreshing and light. I promise you that when you&apos;re done eating, you will not feel &quot;heavy&quot; or tired. I&apos;m very excited that I know where to take my friends that are specific with their food choices!"
5,"A buddy of mine from high school who I follow on social media always post this place. The food always looks delicious and he never has a complaint, so one day on my day off I decided to take my grandmother and my two kids to try out their food and let me just say that I was not disappointed at all. I love the outside seating and the inside seating is just as great. I love the little shopping sections that they have where you can purchase certain items, I think that&apos;s a really cool thing that they have that and also kind of makes you want to spend more money because their products are so well-made. It&apos;s healthy food that taste great."
4,"My favorite egg salad sandwich with Parmesan cheese! These best seasoned pumpkin cheese and fresh kale salad. I like the house made chips too, but they are on the greasy side."
5,"10/10 would recommend! 
Very good vegan options with a cute ambience!

Cashew Queso - Out. Of. Sight. You wouldn&apos;t believe it wasn&apos;t cheese!

Vegan Breakfast Sandwich - again, OUT OF SIGHT! Between the plant-based meat, cheese, and just eggs, I couldn&apos;t control myself!

Vegan Blueberry French Toast - it&apos;s so hard to find vegan French Toast, especially very good ones. Well look no further! 

Vegan Power Bowl - you will feel strong, healthy, full, and happy after this very hearty and flavorful meal!"
5,"The vibe I go for is a chill one! I love stopping by @localfoodshouston because no matter my mood I&apos;m NEVER disappointed!!! One of my favorite go to dishes is the Crunchy Chicken with Chicken Posole Soup! The staff is AMAZING SAUCE &amp; Vinny aka Vinno always has me smiling with great convo and laughs while keeping busy! He never forgets to check in 

*@localfoodshouston (Houston, Tx) 
 *Crunchy Chicken Sandwich, Chicken Posole Soup 
 *Passion Fruit Mimosa &amp; Winter Margarita"
5,The food is amazing I had the gulf seafood sandwich and it didn&apos;t disappoint and if your feeling really in the mood to cut the carbs you can make any sandwich into a salad! Yummy food overall definitely will be getting this for work now! Don&apos;t forget to ask for a side of their spicy sriracha sauce omg so hot but soooooo good!
5,"Very filling salads and tasty sandwiches! 

Tried this place for the first time and i was very happy with the food and ambiance. I really loved how big the salad was and liked how they seasoned the Brussel sprouts. I would definitely recommend getting any of the sandwiches! My favorite part of the sandwiches was how great the pretzel buns tasted. 

Food also came out surprisingly fast. I don&apos;t think I had to wait more than 10 minutes. 

Will come back :)"
5,"Upon moving to Houston, a few of my friends sent me lists of the best places to dine around here, and Local Foods was on every one of their lists. We came here for lunch/brunch, being told to try the chicken sandwich and banh mi. We ended up getting the sandwich and salmon poke, and saving the banh mi for a future time. The sandwich was definitely all it was chalked up to be, and the poke was divine. So many flavors! The fish was super fresh from a local market, and I loved that they added melon to the poke...unexpected and a delicious addition. We also had their watermelon lemonade and a pressed juice, both great, and free refills on the lemonade! 

We couldn&apos;t leave without perusing the packaged food section. They have tons of items like olive oils, pastas (gluten free or not), condiments, snacks, wine, and more. A lot of vegan and gluten free options. We left with a bottle of Texas-made truffle honey, which was incredible! 

Great service and great casual spot for any meal!"
5,"I love this place! Food is always so fresh with moderate portions. Walking in you must order at the register, a number is given to you, and then you self-seat yourself as you wait for your food. Prime time is lunch time and I&apos;ve seen lines out the door but it does move quickly so don&apos;t be deterred. There is both indoor and outdoor seating (dog friendly outdoor seating I must add) but again during prime time- you need to be a ninja and stalk people finishing their meal. 

My go-to favorites:
- Crunchy chicken sandwich which I usually turn into a salad (which is an option for each sandwich). Pro tip: if you make it into a salad, ask them to add avocado on top!
- Avocado BLT
- Fall harvest salad with chicken: my most favorite! I love the Brussels sprouts and the salad is always so fresh (no wilted lettuce here) with portions adequate enough to keep me stuffed (way better in size and quality than the salads at Sweet Green IMO)

The negative to this place is that the parking lot is always full during prime times but there is a garage behind it with more spots available. Definitely worth it in my opinion!!"
5,"Local foods has some of the best vegan options in Houston! They often add or rotate the vegan options which I think keeps things interesting. They used to have a Buffalo cauliflower burger that was really good! I recently ordered the quinoa burger with chips &amp; chowder. The chips were pretty greasy but everything else was great!! I had a few questions about how their food is prepared and the manager Bobby got back with me quickly, answering all of my questions. I look forward to what comes up next on their menu :)"
1,"Love the garden sammie (on a pretzel bun or as a salad), but today they substituted the Brussels sprouts w/ eggplant! I mainly get it for the Brussels! At least tell me when I order on the phone for pick up! They were small brown pieces, I thought it was some kind of meat at first. It was overcooked and very salty too. Also not much cauliflower either. Disappointed this time around. I normally would go to the Heights or Tanglewood locations."
4,"Local Foods has always been a go-to for a quick, delicious meal! The Asian Chicken salad is always one of my favorites to enjoy."
4,"Stopped at this local foods location for lunch today. Not crowded around 11am during the week but  looked It was getting packed when we were leaving around 12. 

Ordered this seafood sandwich and it was soo good! The chicken posole soup was also not bad but id give it a 3/5."
5,"Wow! Words can not express how much of a pleasant experience I had! This was my first visit... I was starving after my SoulCycle workout and I noticed this wonderful looking restaurant next door, so I decided to pop in and I&apos;m sooooo happy I did! What an experience! The cashier was very helpful and kind! I had the BLACKENED SALMON CUCUMBER &amp; WATERMELON SALAD, MINT, BLACK SESAME, RED ONION, PONZU. IT WAS AMAZING! (Pic attached, ZOOM IN) Very refreshing! My goodness... it was heaven on a plate, no lie. Not to mention... the GM, Vinnie came over to check on me. He was so kind. As we are all still adjusting to the &quot;new norm&quot; friendly service is always a blessing. Thank you all over at Local Foods for such a pleasant first visit. I will be back! xx"
