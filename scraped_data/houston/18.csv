5,Wonderful environment! The tap selection is always great! The service is also great between the bartenders and the staff that comes around to clean/pick-up tables. My second time visiting and even through COVID this is a perfect chill spot to grab a drink and chat with friends. Highly recommend if you&apos;re looking to hangout with people in a safe and open environment.
5,Love love love this place! And I have so much more respect for them after seeing the way they helped out during Harvey and how careful they&apos;ve been during covid. This place is always fun with a good beer selection and occasionally have live music.
5,"Great drinks and great vibes! We hung out here on a Saturday afternoon for a few hours. Kind workers, smart covid precautions, and fun dj spinning decks!"
5,"What is there not to love about Axelrad? Live music, access to a pizza shop, beer and other beverages, and food trucks. 

This is a great hangout space with lots of space to spread out to maintain distance.  The hammocks and projector are always big fun."
5,"My friends and I love Axelrad. 

It has a ton of hammocks and the vibe is immaculate. There are games as well if you just wanna sit at your table and play a round of Clue with your friends. 

They also have a huge projector where they play music videos or the big game if it&apos;s on, as well as a stage for live music. 

10/10 would recommend"
5,"We were came here late night for drinks &amp; ordered a pizza from the back and it was one of the best pizzas I&apos;ve had ! 

My boyfriend created a large pizza with pepperoni, pickled jalapeños, and mushrooms for the four of us and we finished it so quickly ! The jalapeños were the best part - they are quite spicy so if you&apos;re looking for a kick, make sure you add them to your pizza order ! 

As for the drinks they have a good selection but I&apos;m a sucker for frose ! My boyfriend ordered one for me after my beer and let&apos;s just say everyone else ended the night with froses as well - mind you I was with a group of 3 other guys haha !"
4,"Gave this place another shot because my boyfriend really liked coming here and its close to home. We made another reservation and unfortunately we&apos;re still placed in a corner, this time away from the hammocks but closer to the bar. My tip would be to come earlier than 9pm to get a good spot even if you have a reservation.. reservations are also still encouraged to avoid any waiting.

Unlike last time, we didn&apos;t have a server so we were able to just walk up to the bar and grab drinks whenever we were ready.. there was usually a line but it did go by fast. 

They had a DJ playing which I felt gave the place a fun vibe.. I would&apos;ve loved to have seen this place pre-covid. While on the topic of covid, masks &amp; social distancing is enforced here.. they ask that you don&apos;t move tables and when not with a drink in your hand that you wear a mask. 

They don&apos;t sell food here, however, there is a fun pizza joint connected with their backyard. So when feeling hungry, you can take a short walk to the resturant and bring it back to your table."
5,"I love supporting small businesses and if you decide to stop by here because of the reviews and agreed with them, please leave a review! So on to the bar, overall I love it. I mainly come here when they have an event, just because it does get crowded (pre-covid). Their drink and tap selection is great. They have a great selection of beers and the bartenders will help you figure out which one you would enjoy. I prefer their cocktail selections though they occasionally have something fun and on par with a theme. I love it! Overall I highly recommend it!"
5,"Pros: wonderful atmosphere, full bar, plenty of space to sit, board games, food trucks, good music, good vibes. Absolutely loved this stop!!!! 

Cons: Small restrooms, they could be better maintained on busy nights, at different points of the night there was no toilet paper or soap. Thankfully I always carry hand sanitizer and tissue paper with me, so I shared with the ladies!"
5,"I came to Axelrad for the first and only time as COVID restrictions were starting to lift. I chose Axelrad because they had just opened up that day so I knew it wouldn&apos;t be crowded and I liked that it was outside. Thank goodness I was right, they were empty and I&apos;m thankful for that. My friend and I sat on the swings and it was so relaxing! We were able to order through the app but there were SOOOOO many choices that we ended up just ordering through the server. The service was great! 

Do note that you may have to pay for your straw if you get a froze....they gave mine complimentary which was nice but just FYI."
4,"Such a fun place to come to! Probably one of the top 3 places in Houston for day drinking. Also have a lot of activities at night. Love the concept of openness and having different options for drinks and food. This is such a perfect set up because you can order Luigis pizza and bring it to your table or swing. Luigi&apos;s pizza is some of the best pizza in Houston! Axelrad is kid and dog friendly as well and they have tons of board games to play. Love music, friends and outdoor fun is something you can pass up! Try their pura vida drink, you can thank me later!

Giving 4 stars because they could use more bathrooms for the amount of people here, and the trash situation gets a little out of control fast!"
5,"I went to axelrad on Sunday at around 4pm to try Sinfull Bakery&apos;s vegan style Bob&apos;s burgers. It was nice and cool outside. There were quite a lot of people but still space to sit on the second floor. The atmosphere was really nice; there was a dj playing remixes, and the place gave an overall chill vibe.  

The vegan burger was probably one of the best I&apos;ve ever had. I usually done like  the impossible burger because sometimes it&apos;s not cooked for long enough. But Sinfull made a great burger with curried cauliflower on a pretzel bun."
5,"If you don&apos;t want to drink a delicious drink, chill in a hammock and listen to some live music then I don&apos;t want to be your friend. I have visited here many times with friends. I strongly recommend a frosé or one of the many beer options. There are usually guest appearances of different food vendors and live music. There&apos;s also a delicious pizza place next door. Give this spot a try!"
5,Best bar hands down if you just want a really good drink and to relax and chill my husband and I had a great time and are drinks were very refreshing I wasn&apos;t crazy about the music but other than that it was great!!
5,First time and won&apos;t be the last. The drinks were good and the pizza from luigis we so good!! The service was great and everyone was so friendly. It&apos;s a kid/pet friendly. I really enjoyed this place and look forward to coming back!
5,"Honestly... such a neat place to come and hang out. I love the concept, feel, ambience and vibe of this place. Definitely D-Bag central but hey.. what eclectic spot isn&apos;t nowadays?
Hammocks are a great touch. Cool array of beers and you can watch movies on movie nights. Never go wrong on a date night."
4,Love the atmosphere. Really chill and relaxing. Wasn&apos;t a fan of the mixed drinks. I did live the heated restrooms.
5,Such a cool unique bar. This is a local hit and you can always find a comfy spot. Worth it if you love hammocks and relaxing
5,"First and foremost, I&apos;d like to say a few words to the owners: I&apos;m so sorry your business has to be closed due to the ongoing pandemic. I hope you all are doing well and surviving despite not being able to make money right now! I pray this pandemic is over soon so you all can open back up and continue providing a welcoming atmosphere for every one of us! I love this place!! I suffer from depression, and this place always puts me in better spirits! I&apos;ve brought everyone that I know to this place, and I will always recommend it as a hangout spot! I used to live like 13 minutes away, so whenever my suicidal thoughts would kick in, I would drive down here and float in the hammocks and let the tunes from the live band or movie calm me down. I would consider this place to be home because that&apos;s how it feels. It doesn&apos;t feel like a bar or a club; it feels like grandma&apos;s house, and all of the grandkids are hanging out. It feels great to exist in such a large space with many people, and I feel like I can connect for once! I&apos;ll be coming here even when I am old and gray! Surprisingly, I don&apos;t take many photos here because I&apos;m having too much of a good time, but here are a few!"
5,"We came right around sunset in the winter. The vibe was very hip and young. Dog friendly area. The backyard with the swinging chairs was definitely the highlight and the nicest area to relax with a small group. Backyard area is shared between the bar and the pizza place. 

Plenty of beers on tap and also bottled ones as well. Large variety of flavors so not too difficult to find one you like. 

Live music started after sunset. Left soon after that since it was too cold in the winter."
