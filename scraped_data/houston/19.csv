5,"This place was/is by far the best steak house I have been to. Third time&apos;s the charm, I always say - and I say this because I have made 2 reservations prior, but had to cancel for differing reasons. The first time being because I had COVID. The second time being that it was canceled due to the sudden winter storm that came through Texas. Third time around was when I was able to finally have dinner here.

It&apos;s in the River Oaks District and is upscale. They do have a dress code, so dress nice. This place is perfect for a date, to celebrate anniversaries, birthdays, etc. Which is the case for why I made reservations here. It was my birthday and they take good care of you for the special occasions. It was a fantastic experience from the moment we pulled in through valet to the complimentary birthday dessert at the end. 

Came in and the ambience was very romantic. White linen cloth, candles, secluded rooms, the entire vibe was perfect. Our server Daniel was on top of everything and was just wonderful in providing a run down of the menu, recommendations, and made sure to take care of me for my birthday when it came to dessert. You start off with complimentary garlic herb bread, then move on to salad or appetizers depending on what you ordered. I ordered the braised pork belly over creamed spinach which was so tender incredibly tender and had that perfect melody of sweet and a hint of spiciness. Decided to skip on the salad and move forward to the main entree - the butchered cut wagyu ribeye. I ordered it medium rare (the only way to order a steak) with truffle butter on top. It was absolutely delicious, buttery, and tender in my mouth. I loved every bit of that steak. For sides, I ordered the creamy mac &amp; cheese, brussel sprouts with bacon, and au gratin potatoes. Two of those were recommendations from Daniel. I also forgot to mention that I started off this entire meal with a specialty cocktail - the strawberry rhubarb. Fruity and fresh! I was beginning to get full and since Daniel said to save room for dessert, I had to stop eating my steak because I really wanted dessert. 

He said I could order whatever dessert option that I wanted on him for my birthday (Thank you again Daniel!) And I went with his recommendation - the caramel cake. Every recommendation he&apos;s made has never been a bad one because that caramel cake was amazing. It was just... I can&apos;t even properly express the words at how delicious that cake was. I&apos;m glad I went with his recommendations throughout the evening because each one was top notch. I definitely would recommend this place to anyone that wants to celebrate a special occasion or just enjoy some amazing steak dinners. For sure coming back! 

Thank you Steak 48 staff for making my birthday a memorable one!"

My friend raved about this place and we finally ate here together.  This may be the best steak place I&apos;ve been to in Houston so far and I would put it up against a lot of other steak spots.

First, service is outstanding and sets the standard for restaurant/bar service.  I forgot our servers name (Brian?) but he was awesome and on point.  Very knowledgeable and gave us good recommendations.

Second, ambiance.  It&apos;s a dark but festive setting that&apos;s perfect for an intimate fancy date, a best friend experience, or with a crowd.  The interior design with the polished walls and fireplace give a nice relaxing vibe.

Third, the food.  That&apos;s why you&apos;re here right!?  The meatball appetizer is large and filling with a lovely marinara for dipping.  Also enjoyed the shrimp cocktail; while pricy, it&apos;s the perfect texture for shrimp fans with the sauce tray that comes with it.  As for the steaks, the KC bone-in strip i had was melt in your mouth perfectly cooked medium.  Also added the foie gras addition.  First time ever having foie gras; I&apos;ll be adding it every time.  Added a side of corn creme brûlée for a well-rounded perfect meal.

Fourth, the drinks.  Gotta have beverages before, during, and after dinner.  Started with the Ol&apos; fashion.  They make four different kinds of them.  I forgot which one I had but it was smooth and refreshing.  During appetizers, we had gin martinis, shaken and not stirred; perfect drinks that had just the right pour.  And for the main course, wine.  We went with a Paso Robles red bottle; loved it so much we ordered a second bottle which nearly put us out!  And after dinner, finished with some grand marnier in a snifter glass.  A perfect finish to a wonderful meal!

And to think we are here during COVID.  I can only imagine what this place is like before that.  No doubt I will be returning.  And hopefully I&apos;ll experience the true feeling when things return to normal!"
5,"Came here for my wife&apos;s birthday and loved it! 

Food was delicious and service was terrific. We got the steak with shrimp and it was incredible. Definitely recommend trying the shrimp that&apos;s on the appetizer menu (can be ordered as a side with the steak as well). 

COVID Precautions: all staff was wearing a mask. We were initially seated in a somewhat crowd"

5,"Ok I have been wanting to go here forever!!!! So my son and I went for my birthday today and let me tell you it was so much fun and outstanding customer service better than I&apos;ve ever received anywhere else.  

The waiter was named Keit and he was such a descriptive person when it came to the menu.  He could describe the menu so well and I would definitely recommend him if you come he&apos;s fabulous...... 

We had the bread it was really good but didn&apos;t want to eat too much of that and fill up on that.  We had the meatballs they&apos;re really huge they were pretty good and the shrimp deviled eggs oh my goodness those were so delicious I probably could of ate them all by myself if I didn&apos;t share with my son.  We had strawberry lemonade that was really good and I liked them water we drank also.  I&apos;m not really a drinker so I didn&apos;t partake in any alcoholic drinks because I had to drive home and I don&apos;t believe in drinking and driving.   Another funny thing was is the Wi-Fi password is mediumrare that was hilarious to me.  


We had  the tomahawk pork chop and I had the bone in ribeye medium rare that was 22 ounces it was really really good I loved that the plate was 500 degrees hot and they served us the sides alongside our food. I definitely like the crème brûlée corn that was yummy and we had the au gratin  potatoes those weren&apos;t very good to me they were so nice they didn&apos;t charge me which I liked so much.  We also had the crème brûlée corn that was really freaking delicious I really enjoyed that. 

They gave me a choice of whatever I wanted for my birthday dessert.  I had the caramel cake it was so good and it was really good I so enjoyed it."
5,"I absolutely love this restaurant when I came to Houston the customer service is absolutely amazing and it mirrored the type of food that you will receive the follow up call for my experience was a cherry on top I was still enjoying my leftovers the next day.
I would definitely be bringing my husband back I was in town for a conference as a matter fact I am making plans to visit some of the other locations as well"
5,"There is NO better steak restaurant in Houston and it&apos;s surrounding area. The attention to detail and customer service is unparalleled. I will come back here over and over again. Surprisingly for I never do this, but I suggest that anyone wishing for an outstanding steak experience halt by here."
2,"I love the food at this restaurant but I must say... I had the worst experience here Saturday night. Let me preface this by saying, I am a Physician and many times we come to this restaurant for meetings and seminars etc. I have never had a problem, service has always been impeccable, but now I&apos;m not sure if it were that way because of the fact that we were eating out as a group of Doctors. I&apos;ve always wondered if we would get the same graciousness and compliments from the chef if we were dining here as regular guests whom you could not know our &quot;worth&quot; or capability up front.

My question was answered.

I came for a dinner, a friend&apos;s birthday dinner on Saturday night. I&apos;m not sure if it was because we were all women? Or what? But the service was completely and utterly horrible, there was enough infantilization to open a 24-hour Daycare. I am not one to complain, I usually make excuses for my waiters, but this was bad all around. Our waiter ignored our table for most of the night while he catered to grey-haired gentlemen across from us.

The preference was clear. He was rushed when he interacted with us. When my dear friend ordered the Wagyu, he didn&apos;t even describe it to her, she may as well have been ordering a steak from Applebee&apos;s. You don&apos;t pay this type of price for this kind of treatment. I can make my food at home, it will taste better and I will live longer with more money in my bank to show for it.

In the end, he was still serving a table full of successful, ambitious, driven and wealthy women... he just didn&apos;t know it. And for that... I cannot expose myself to a restaurant that judges and makes assumptions on appearance instead of treating every patron like a VIP."
5,Pretty great place. If you are looking for a fancy dinner place this has plenty of options and a lot of zabiha halal options!
5,"I love a good steak house. My friend suggested we have my birthday dinner at Steak 48 while I was visiting Houston. Let&apos;s start with the ambiance. The dim lighting and fresh flowers throughout was very sexy and sophisticated. Perfect place for date night with your significant other. 

The service was amazing. We started our meal off with the braised pork belly and crispy shrimp deviled eggs. The pork belly was sooooo good. The honey and sweet Thai chili sauce and the bed of sautéed spinach was a great blend of flavors. The braised pork belly was  surprisingly tender. 

My main course consisted of the bone in rib eye cooked medium. My steak was cooked perfect and had just enough marble to my liking. I decided on the corn creme brûlée and brussel sprouts. Both were good, but the brussel sprouts had to many bacon pieces in it. The bacon over powered the brussel sprouts. I would&apos;ve preferred more brussel sprouts then bacon.

Our lovely waiter surprised me with a birthday desert and it was to die for!! The warm butter cake, carmel, and ice cream brought tears to my eyes. 

The next day I received a call from Steak 48 asking about my experience. Talk about top notch service!"
5,Best steakhouse in houston service Is outstanding and  friendly upscale and pleasant atmosphere valet parking tip what you want prices are very reasonable for amounts of food and the food is so delicious and tasteful definitely my all time favorite in houston #1 for everything great for dinning  and celebrating all occasions dress code enforced
5,"We are most definitely coming back! I went this past Friday with some friends for a birthday and it was perfect. We made reservations so everything went smoothly from the valet parking to the staff bagging our food to go. The steak melts in your mouth like butter. The salmon is also cooked to perfection. I have a new favorite side dish, which is the praline pecan sweet potatoes. You must try them! They are to die for. I would also suggest trying the creamed spinach. Long story short, everything that we had on the table was delicious. We are most definitely returning soon. Do yourself a favor and treat yourself here you won&apos;t be disappointed."
5,"We chose Steak 48 for our first dinner of 2021 and it set the bar extremely high for dinner for the rest of the year. 

First, I want to note how fantastic the staff is here. Everyone from the valet to the servers and chefs were extremely pleasant and helpful. The chefs brought out some of the dishes we ordered, which was a great personal touch to the whole dining experience. 

We ordered the shrimp deviled eggs and oysters as starters. Both were delicious. For our entree, I had the petite filet mignon with truffle butter, and my friend had the chicken. For our sides, we had the au gratin potatoes, creamy Mac and cheese, and Brussels sprouts. The Mac and cheese was very basic to me, and unimpressive. I could have did without the Mac and cheese. Disclaimer:  I&apos;m a huge Mac and cheese fan so I may have an abnormally high standard for Mac and cheese in general. 

We were told the au gratin is one of the top sides at the restaurant and I can see why. Super cheesy, served piping hot with melted cheese falling off your fork on each bite. The Brussels sprouts were cooked crispy, to the point that it was charred. It was divine. My steak was made perfectly, but the truffle butter made that entire meal. My friend said she enjoyed her chicken. The portion size of the entree was huge. They said the sides are actually individual size but we shared all of our sides between the two of us and it was more than enough. 

Now, while this entire meal was very good, the red velvet bread pudding was honestly the best part of the night. I&apos;m positive they serve this dessert in heaven because it was sooooo good! It comes in a little cup/bowl with ice cream on top. It was amazing. I couldnt believe they perfectly combined my two favorite desserts. 

Overall, I would highly recommend the restaurant and all of the above items."
3,"Ever since I moved to Houston, I heard a lot about Steak 48.

Yesterday, my husband and I went on a date and came away disappointed in our experience. In a way we could be partially to blame for setting our expectations so high for the number one rated steak restaurant in the city. 

NY strip - pretty plain. I&apos;ve cooked better on my grill and I am not afraid to say it. 

The potatoes au gratin - should have been much creamier and softer, instead they resembled chopped baked potatoes with cheese. Far from the ideal.

Lobster Mac &amp; Cheese - had very aromatic cheese that overpowered the whole lobster flavor. I would advise changing the type of cheese and adding more to the dish.

Corn brûlée - the best of the side dishes but there is no unity of taste.

Pork belly - very tasty.

King Crab &amp; avocado stack - Something between ceviche and spread for crab chips. In general, this could be substituted for any salad on the menu as the size of the portion was large enough and turned out to be a satisfying snack.

Chocolate dessert - was beautiful but the most delicious ingredient were the raspberries in sauce)) It is a large portion loaded with sugar. Not recommended for those without a sweet tooth.

Cocktails - the old fashion (walnut 46) was good but the rest of the cocktails were not of high standard. The name of cocktails sound beautiful but the taste primitive and very strong. I can&apos;t complain about the heavy pour )))

The pork chops - incredible and the best item we ordered on the menu. I will have to say - Bravo! Very well served with delicious chardonnay capers sauce. The meat was very tender. The meal comes with two chops and can be easily shared.

Lastly and a side item but it is very dark in the restaurant. Romance is nice with the candles but not when you have to use your phone flashlight to read the menu. 

In conclusion: I say if you do want to go show off, get dressed up and brag about where you ate, go to Steak 48. But in my opinion if you are going to spend that kind of money you&apos;re better off going to @trulucksrestaurant in The Woodlands, the best restaurant in Houston."
5,The service was amazing. It&apos;s perfect for date night. Valet is tips and make sure you make a reservation. We got there a little early and were seated right away. Erica served us and was amazing start to finish. She helped up pick a very nice bottle of wine and also helped with the serving size of apps and sides for the table. I couldn&apos;t ask for better food or a better experience.
5,"Steak 48 is certainly one of the most lavish &amp; luxurious spots out there. One of the few places that offers a Halal Steak, the Domestic Wagyu Filet. I have to admit their food matched the level of their gorgeous presentation. The meat is exceptionally tender &amp; exquisite. The way the sides complimented the entree was impeccable. Unquestionably a must try.

3,"I&apos;ve been coming to Steak48 for years now.. 
Theres something about the ambiance that we tend to Gravitate too..as well as the red velvet bread pudding. 
There&apos;s no other dessert in the world that&apos;s worth the calories. 

I always get the Wagyu filet (medium) with crispy shrimp on top and for some reason I always have to send it back because it&apos;s over cooked! I would triple check with the waitress/waiter on the temp so they Can double check with the kitchen before wasting your time
For a correct Steak."
5,"Our dining experience was beautiful! The food was perfection! Our waiter Dominick was fabulous &amp; his recommendations were on point. 

To start we ordered the calamari &amp; shrimp w/ a glass of red wine (recommended by our server) and a peach ginger mule. We got fresh baked garlic bread that was warm and fresh from the oven. This. Got. Me. Full! Lol. By the time my main course came out I was done. Haha!

For my main entree I ordered ribeye steak cooked to perfection (medium rare) w/ lobster. My husband ordered NY steak strip w/ shrimp... our sides... creme brulee cream corn (Yassss), brussel sprouts with bacon and asparagus fries (I could have done with out the asparagus)... 

The food was perfect. Came out piping HOT on their 500 degree plates. 

Our waiter hooked us up w/ an anniversary cake! We were able to choose from their full size menu so we ordered their chocolate cake w/ chocolate ganache and raspberries. Delicious. The cake itself was good but I wasnt too fond of the icing inside. The cake to icing ratio was off. However the chocolate ganache made up for it... yes! 

Over all our dining experience was extraordinary! Food was on point. Servers were amazing!"
4,"Went here for my husband&apos;s 40th birthday. When we checked in they handed him a handwritten birthday card. Very sweet. Then we ordered a ton of great food and drinks. I had a Ginger Peach off their cocktail menu and it was really great. He had the Walnut 46, one of their 4(!) old Fashioned cocktails. Very good. I got the beet salad and he got the superfood one. Both were very good. For apps we got the &quot;pb&amp;j&quot; and the deviled eggs with crispy shrimp. The PB&amp;J was a fig jam with Pâté with crisps to spread it on. It was a little off putting color wise, but it grew on me. I think I would&apos;ve enjoyed it better if the pâté and jam were separate. It was tasty though. The deviled eggs were a nice vessel for the amazing shrimp. Just skip the eggs and get the crispy shrimp by themselves. They are fantastic. I had the grass fed Strip and he had the ribeye. Sides were creamed spinach, hassleback potatoes, asparagus fries, and he had a loaded baked potato. I didn&apos;t care for the creamed spinach. Way too much going on with it and it was more like spinach dip in consistency.  Not good. The hasselback potatoes were awesome. It was a good sharing app too. Pulling off those crispy slices of potato and dipping in the sour cream and chive. So good. The loaded baked potato was typical. The asparagus fries were good. My husband loved them.  Asparagus isn&apos;t my favorite but if you like them it&apos;s a good side to get. Steaks were excellent. I had the Oscar crab on top and it was one of the best things I ate. Grassfed beef can be a little tough sometimes but it was aged well and very tasty and not tough at all. The ribeye was perfect. For dessert we got the chocolate cake and to our surprise it was complimentary as a birthday gift. They also wrote happy birthday in chocolate on the plate. Nice touch. And it was really great. I was so full before we even got to dessert that we boxed up half the meal and I still ate most of the cake. The cake was really mostly mousse and ganache and was so light. We had a lovely night. Service was great too. If you&apos;re looking for a good steakhouse and a special night, I would recommend Steak 48."
5,"Steak 48 is incredible!! I went this past weekend with my bf for date night. Our server was so friendly and knowledgeable. The ambience was great (even though it was very cold in there! Would definitely recommend bringing a jacket if you get cold easily). Our drinks were delicious - especially the stone fruit and blood orange martinis. I love how they leave the drink shaker on the table so you can refill! 

I tried the oysters, shrimp, brussel sprouts, and truffle potato. I have celiac, so it was really nice that the menu was labeled with food allergies. Our server was also really helpful with my GF diet! The truffle potato was definitely the star of the night, and I was blown away. The truffles on top were out of this world. I will probably dream about that potato for the rest of my life. I loved my seafood dishes as well. 

The food was delicious, and I would definitely love to go back again. Sooo good!! Would highly recommend - especially for a date night!"
