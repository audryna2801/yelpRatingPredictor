5,"Our group of 6 arrived and were seated quickly thanks to online reservation. Super convenient! Indoor dining is open and each table is sectioned off with a clear divider for safety. Doesn&apos;t look awkward or anything since it looks like part of the restaurant :)

Menu is online through QR code and there&apos;s so many options! Tons of holiday specials as well

I got the Benedict to share which is perfect because you can choose two different Benedict&apos;s, and they can bring it out on separate plates too. Also got the pancake flight to share and it was perfect for a sampler of multiple pancake flavors"
5,"We were a group of 9 people seated on 2 tables due to covid. Everyone loved their food. I ordered garden harvest omlet and it was delicious. I could only eat 1/2 . Pancakes, French toast was good too. 

Things that didn&apos;t meet expectations 
- hash brown had a really strong after taste and was greasy in taste. I would say worst one I had ever had."
5,"I got Snooze takeout and had a wonderful experience with Habanero Pork Belly Benny (Egg Benedict) and Pineapple Upside Down Pancakes. The Egg Benedict was super delicious and not overly salty compared the egg benedict I had in some other brunch places. Although it didn&apos;t look like a large amount of food but it turned out to be surprisingly filling. The pineapple pancakes is also quite a lovely experience. It was not overly sweet but definitely still satisfied my sweet tooth for the day. Also, if you are planning to do a long hike later in theday like I did, the calorie per dollar ratio for these pancakes is definitely the way to go!"
5,"You can definitely almost always expect a long wait here, but that&apos;s how you know this place is GOOD! It&apos;s honestly a little pricey too, but this is one of my favorite brunch places that I don&apos;t mind splurging on every once in a while. This environment has a very busy and social vibe. It&apos;s great for catching up with friends.

One of my favorite menu go-to items is the Benny Duo (5/5). I&apos;m indecisive and I can&apos;t decide on just one of the eggs Benedict dishes, so this allows me to pick 2! I get the Chili Verde Benedict + Benny Goodman. Also one of my favorite things about this dish? It comes with a large pile of hash browns that I just LOVE. Pro trip: ask for hot sauce to eat with this dish too for a nice little kick and extra flavor! 

I came here with a group of friends and we also tried the pancake flight (5/5). We all wanted to try something sweet too but didn&apos;t want to commit to just 1 dish of sweetness, so we all split it. I definitely recommend this if you&apos;re coming here with a group of 3-4 people who want to split some pancakes. We got the pineapple upside down pancake, chocolate chip, and blueberry pancake. (We ordered this on top of our own separate dishes.)

The most recent time I came here, I wanted to order something different, so I tried the sweet potato bacon smash up (5/5). This felt like a slightly healthier dish, and it was honestly VERY filling and delicious. I also smothered it with hot sauce to give it a nice kick. I would recommend this dish!

Their coffee is also really good too! I get the vanilla iced latte when I come here."
5,"The place is super cute and cozy. I love the orange colors and vintage cafe vibes. 

Came in Saturday morning and thought it&apos;d be packed but they didn&apos;t have us wait at all. 

The parking is accessible everywhere. 

I ordered the chai latte with oat milk and it was delicious. It was strong and didn&apos;t taste overly sweet like the usual syrups they use and I appreciated that. 

I personalized my avocado toast and added soyrizo and it was bomb. I want to try the vegan pancakes next time. I liked that they had vegan options. 

My mom and sis ordered the veggie omelet, and pancakes and they cleared they plates out. 

We were all so quiet eating at the table because we were all focused on the food. 

I&apos;m definitely returning and am so happy with their incredible service. Our host was super kind and even though we were in a rush, he was understanding and constantly came to our table to check on us."
2,"I typically enjoy eating at Snooze, particularly this one. I tried the online system today, it took them 48 minutes to get some blueberry pancakes out, when I asked why the order was taking so long I was informed that their online system only releases orders to the bar once 6 orders have been placed. I spoke to the manager about how ridiculous of a system that is, why should I have to wait til there&apos;s 5 additional orders before my order gets ticketed and released. She was completely condescending and uncaring about this situation, I regret not asking her name. She&apos;s the African American lady with round glasses and blonde ombré hair, giving ppl a dead stare while they voice something that could be better for your establishment is a real bad look. She could have at least offered a fake apology to go with her condescending demeanor about it taking 40 minutes to make some blueberry pancakes.   

Just call in the order for a timely service."
5,"This is my favorite brunch spot in Houston TX I Fully Enjoy EVERYTHING about this restaurant. Service is always on point, food is AMAZING, location was easily accessible, and the environment is comfortable and clean.
Go to snooze and make sure you ask for Gabriel. He was one of the best servers I&apos;ve ever had. He had great suggestions for options on the menu and was extremely personable."
5,"We decided to Door Dash Snooze for breakfast! We know we didn&apos;t make a mistake because the food was awesome. At first I was really skeptical because it was saying that it would take over an hour to deliver, but it took less than 40 minutes to get our food after delivering. I was so impressed at the time of preparing and actually cooking. 

Once we got our food, just by opening it, I was impressed. They package their food in compostable containers and to keep things not soggy and warm, they also have tin foil wrapping. 

I ordered the Spuds Deluxe with bacon and onions with the over easy egg. It was delicious. The bacon chunks were huge, and the onions were sautéed to the point where it wasn&apos;t the sharp bitter onion-y taste. The cheese was such a great pair to the potatoes as well. I would totally recommend going here if you have the time or even Door Dashing if you don&apos;t!"
4,"Sorry for the photos. Food was too good to not eat before snapping a photo. The food was amazing and so fulfilling! The mimosas were great and did its job. My fiancé and I really enjoyed ourselves. This location is practicing social distancing. I thought it was really cool when you pay your bill you&apos;re given this digital tablet like thing and you take care of it without waiting for your waitress to pick up your card and return your receipt to sign. 
Highly recommend dining here."
4,Cute breakfast spot with good amount of tasty options. My friend suggested this place as it was my first time visiting the area. I wanted something sweet so i decided on the pancake flight which offered 3 different pancakes from the menu and it was customizable. I got the traditional flight and the danish was my favorite hands down followed by the sweet potato. It was absolutely freezing and the caramel latte was warm and refreshing. Would definitely recommend this place.
5,"Came here with some buddies and all I can say is WOW. We ordered combo pancakes for the table , a burrito, porridge and garden omelette 

Everything was exceptional including the service - perfect breakfast !"
4,"COVID first.  Masks required. Social distancing enforced. Tables sanitized between guests.  Waiters wore masks. Some wore gloves.  But what really stood out was plexiglas shields between tables.  The menu is QR based, so bring your mobile phone. 

Now that that&apos;s out of the way, Snooze utilized a &quot;waitlist&quot; feature.  We &quot;logged in&quot;, checked in when we arrived and got a text when our table was ready.  We had 13 folks ahead of us, and somehow got seated within 20 minutes.  Due to COVID, Snooze doesn&apos;t offer free coffee while you wait.  

We were seated and promptly greeted by our server.  I started with grapefruit juice.  Fresh. Cold. And reasonably priced. My wife ordered a spiked, spiced apple cider.  A shot of rum and you&apos;ve just kissed $9 goodbye.  By comparison, most entries are about $10-$14. 

The corned beef hash had chunks of corned beef mixed with hash browns and topped with eggs made your way.  Word to the wise here. If you ask for &quot;over easy &quot;, they&apos;ll be served with a very runny yolk.  Ask for &quot;over easy medium&quot; for a little more firm center. Great flavor.  

I ordered Spuds Deluxe.  Again, 2 eggs over hash browns and I added bacon &amp; jalapeños.  I should have specified sautéed jalapeños, they were raw and very, very hot.  I thought the hash browns were a bit under done. I&apos;d prefer them more crispy.  I&apos;m sure there was bacon in there.  But it was chopped up rather than an actual slice.  Still, very tasty.  And portions were perfect.  Satisfying without distressing. 

There&apos;s a ton of servers roaming the floor.  And that led to some breakdowns in service. Our meals were delivered and the server (not our original order taker) took off like the Flash.  We sat for 5 minutes before we found our original waiter and reminded him we asked for honey, and that we needed salt, pepper &amp; ketchup. He took off and another 5 minutes passed before a third server brought the condiments.  So, a 10 minute wait equals lukewarm food.  A tasty meal that could have been even better with more aware servers.  

Finally.  Parking can be a challenge.  You can take a chance parking in private lots across the street.  Or, just circle til something opens up.  At the end of your meal, they hand you a tablet with your bill and you pay at your table.  Very efficient."
4,"Was on the way to the restaurant and decided to check if they had an online waitlist. Thank God they did because we &quot;skipped&quot; the line and went straight to being seated. Use this feature! We got there and loved the vibe! I went during brunch with a friend and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. The playlist was a hugggeeee factor in our dining experience. I ordered the avocado sweet potato hash. It tasted great. I wanted to try something different and that dish did the trick. We also ordered the flight (?) of pancakes. Our favorite was the pineapple upside down cake. It was greeeatttf. I will definitely be ordering that the next time I go. Overall great experience, I&apos;m excited to go back!"
4,"I love to try different breakfast spots, mostly because I&apos;m not a fan of breakfast style food , I like more of a brunch . This was a good spot for sure. I had the tostada tacos. And a singular pancake. The pancake was ok but the eggs were really good. My kid had some good hashies too.The negative is that the location in montrose area has terrible parking options. I will probably not come back to this onw"
5,The French toast was everything!!! I wonder if they&apos;re affiliated with Snooze in San Fran. Either way I loved the food.
5,I really enjoyed this Montrose location is Snooze. I hate that I didn&apos;t get the waitress name. She was awesome and gave us a free pancake for being great guests! I&apos;m definitely putting this spot on the Hot places to go to for brunch! Our guests from out of town loved it as well!!
5,"This place is super busy for brunch on weekends but definitely worth the wait. Thankfully, we joined the waitlist online before we headed over and only had to wait about 15 minutes (about as long as it took to find parking) once we arrived. Our waitress Erykah was awesome and made great recommendations. She was so friendly and welcoming, made sure we were satisfied with our meals and engaged with our daughter to get some giggles out of her. My husband had eggs, chicken sausage, grits and Funky Monkey French toast. Omg that French toast, delish! Our daughter devoured her chocolate chip pancake. I had the sweet potato veggie smash up, light on the calories but full of flavor. We washed it all down with a rummosa and a brewmosa. Great brunch!"
4,"I absolutely love Snooze. Delicious food and a great variety of food.

This is a review for our delivery experience. We got spuds deluxe with bacon and sausage (delicious) and the pancake flight. I was a little disappointed that they didn&apos;t have all the options for the flight that they normally do in the restaurant (specifically the regular blueberry and the peanut butter cup options).

The reason this was four out of five stars for this delivery experience was that I paid extra for peanut butter crema so that I could transform my chocolate chip pancake into the peanut butter cup pancake (my absolute favorite), and I&apos;m pretty sure what I got was just a cup of peanut butter on the side.

I did notice that they have a lot of cool Father&apos;s day for pancakes and French toast at home and kids-eat-free options that look intriguing."
5,"I loved this place! Where else can you get bacon/jalapeño glazed bacon? Nowhere, that&apos;s where! 

Really busy and long waits are a downer. But if you go and catch them on a slow day, heaven awaits!"
5,"Amazing!!!! I&apos;ve been to snooze only twice and the first time was in the woodlands area but this location was perfect besides the wait which was about 1.5 hr it was sure worth the wait. I tried the shrimp and grits which were on point, great flavor and I didn&apos;t even have to add any salt &amp; pepper. I also ordered the pineapple upside down pancakes which I&apos;ve had before and they were out of this world; something I cannot even describe I can eat those everyday. I never order alcoholic beverages here but I was tempted and it was a celebration so my friend and I ordered the lavender &amp; regular mimosa and the lavender one was perfect and was better than any drink I&apos;ve tasted before; I should have ordered two instead of getting the pineapple mimosa. The drinks had the perfect amount of alcohol in it."
