5,"PSA.... HALF OFF ON MONDAYS at this location. Got this giant gourmet dish for less than $10 (normally $18!)

Large, thin-crust signature pizzas for a SNAG DEAL. A bit more sturdy, not quite as thin as your normal thin crust, but still so crunchy and chewy in each perfect bite. Split half half if you want to try more options/toppings! Pictured here: 1/2 Mushroom  (baby portabella, spinach, rosemary, &amp; whipped ricotta) with added italian sausage + 1/2 Spicy Andouille (andouille sausage, jalape√±os, red onions, red peppers, green onions)! The whipped ricotta definitely stole the show! Also tried the 9&quot; personalized prosciutto &amp; Arugula which had a delightful lemon vinaigrette drizzle ($5 on Mondays). Easy carry-out service has kept me coming back :) Also lots of additional toppings you can add at extra cost. 

Ordering is always easy. Staff is always friendly. Food is always good. Prices are reasonable. And that ricotta is a blessing. They have won a loyal customer!"
5,"This spot is such a gem, they have extremely kind and helpful staff as well as fresh and delicious food. They were quick to help us out as it was our first time visiting and always made sure to check up on us. As far as covid concerns go, this restaurant took plenty of the necessary precautions, all staff had masks on and there were hand sanitizer dispensers around the store. I&apos;d definitely recommend stopping in and trying this place out, the ranch was also spot on."
5,"Really great pizza that is super shareable. They are only doing take-out right now I believe, but the pizzas are all solid. My favorite is actually the mushroom pizza that comes with a ton of different creamy mushrooms. The sausage with red pepper was my husband&apos;s favorite."
5,"Pizza is fresh and very tasty!

I love the tomato soup.

A unique hit !

Staff is very fast and efficient and organized.highly recommended!"
5,"What an excellent experience for my first time at Luna Pizzeria!  As a pizza lover, I love to try new pizza spots around town.  However, not everyone in my four person family shares my love of pizza, so it&apos;s not often that I get to enjoy this favorite food of mine.  So when my husband had to run an errand in town, I was very happy when he asked if I wanted to have lunch with him at this little pizza spot he&apos;s dined at before.  Little did I know it would be one of the best pizza dining experiences in Houston for me.

We split a medium chopped salad.  In hindsight, I think we probably could have done a mini or small between the two of us as the medium was huge.  The salad itself was delicious!  It had a variety of ingredients, including olives, chunks of mozzarella, pieces of meat (maybe ham or turkey, I&apos;m not sure).  I got a variety of veggies in each bite.  It was tossed well to where the dressing was evenly distributed throughout the salad.  This salad was on the tangy/salty side due to the olives and dressing, so if you don&apos;t like that flavor this may not be the salad for you.  But I thought it was really good.

We also split a personal size pizza.  At the recommendation of the staff, we chose half spicy andouille and half pepperoni.  The pizza was absolutely perfect.  Thin, crispy crust baked to perfection.  Plenty of toppings.  The pizza was not overly salty, like other places I&apos;ve had.  They also serve with a plate of shaved Parmesan, crushed pepper, and an herb that I didn&apos;t try...but it was a very nice touch.

The service was also outstanding.  The gentleman at the counter who took our order was so friendly and helpful.  When my husband asked about their desserts, he shared that the chocolate chip cookies, which they keep warm in a crock pot next to the register, are from Dessert Gallery but a special recipe is used just for this restaurant.  Naturally, we had to try the chocolate chip cookies.  SO GOOD.  I&apos;ve learned in my short time as a Yelper, that while it&apos;s hard to mess up chocolate chip cookies it&apos;s definitely possible (I&apos;m looking at you Crumbl).  Luna and Dessert Gallery definitely got it right.  Slightly crispy on the edges, soft and ooey in the middle with chocolate chip in every bite - this was a legit chocolate chip cookie.

Overall, this place earned every bit of this five star review and I look forward to returning!"
4,"Had a major pizza craving after getting my hair done for 7 hours! Didn&apos;t know the area much, so when I was searching for pizza places this beauty popped up - soooo glad it did!

I actually HATE pizza. I&apos;m weird, BUT I do get cravings and love trying non chain pizza joints (Pizza Hut, Dominos etc). Not sure if this is a chain, but it&apos;s sure not a regular chain like previously mentioned. 

My mouth waters as I write this. I had the Margherita and hubby had classic pepperoni. They were BOTH SOOOO DELICIOUS!! I wish I had a a picture - but we devoured it before I even thought about it! 

Def will be back to try more!"
4,"Came here on New Year&apos;s Eve due to her other upscale restaurant being completely booked. By far, we were impressed. The menu is limited and the only sides they offer are salads but when I tell you, you want be disappointed. We ordered half pepperoni pizza and HALF spicy andouille PIZZA . In addition, we added Italian sausage to the spicy andouille side. of our pizza. The pizza was delicious and I didn&apos;t feel stuffed like most pizza establishment from the huge amounts of toppings!!

I will definitely returned in the future!!!"
3,"This is more of a 3.5/5, and I do think Luna is worth checking out! It has a neighborhood pizza joint feel, and the folks behind the counter were super nice when I picked up my order. As many have mentioned, the three locations have various specials on specific days of the week, so make sure to do your research before popping in. 

My wife and I shared one large signature pizza ($18), which ended being more than enough for dinner. Luna allows you to split the pie into two separate combos free of charge, allowing us to sample both the Spicy Andouille (sausage, jalapenos, red onions, red peppers, green onions) and the Mushroom (portabello, shitake, button mushrooms, spinach, rosemary, whipped riccotta). 

Structurally, the pizzas were solid: thin crust with a nice char and chewy to the bite, a thin layer of tomato sauce so you get the flavor without a soggy slice, and a healthy amount of melty cheese. The marksmanship with the pizza cutter was shoddy though...our slices were totally uneven--some too narrow and others way too fat--so we had to re-size them with our own utensils. The Spicy Andouille half was awesome. There was a bit of burn (nothing crazy), balanced by the fruity sweetness of the peppers. The Mushroom side was a huge let-down though, especially given the mouth-watering description. The fluffy ricotta was nice, but the mushrooms were totally undercooked, essentially raw. Lots of roasty, umami flavors wasted.

As usual, I&apos;m not going to let one uneven experience dissuade me from giving Luna another go, especially when it seems to be a beloved local spot. Pizza is pizza after all, and we still enjoyed the meal even though it didn&apos;t knock our socks off."
5,How have I not been here? It seems like I&apos;ve been to every other restaurant in this shopping center. It&apos;s located at the very busy intersection of Kirby and and Richmond. Close to the end of the shopping center by Office Depot. I came here for lunch and they have a fabulous deal for a personal size pizza and salad. You can choose from one of their traditional pizzas. I think it was about $11 or $12. I almost couldn&apos;t finish my meal because the portions were so large. I loved everything about the pizza. The crust was perfect and the toppings were delish. I ordered the traditional sausage. Now I want to try all of them!  But secretly I want to come back because I LOVED the crust!
5,"According to the boys and the rest of my family (me included), best PIZZA in the Greater Houston Area hands down! Drive into town (25 + miles) every time we need a fix!"
3,"Delivery (Door dash) review: 

Order: Margherita pizza (personal, $10), parmesan chicken sandwich ($7)

The good: flavors on par with expectations (save missing ingredients - more on that below). Sandwich included potato chips. Food arrived within 30 minutes from order confirmation (I&apos;m located some 2.5 miles from the restaurant&apos;s location.

The bad: Pizza arrived almost cold and missing basil (that aroma was certainly missed). The crust wasn&apos;t floppy (the size helps) but it was on the chewier side - I attribute that to the temperature). Sandwich was a little warmer and rather pleasant to eat - a better deal than the pizza - especially considering the included chips. Speaking of the chips, they were overcooked but salted just right. 

The ugly: The quality control could be better (cold food, missing ingredients, smoky potato chips). 

Overall: Nice food that would shine if not cold. Even then, I would think $10 for the portion of pizza is on the steeper side. 

I&apos;d come me back for the sandwich and go to The Gypsy Poet for the Margherita."
5,"Luna Pizza elevates the neighborhood pizza joint to a new level of perfection. They have imaginative flavor combinations and a wide variety of fresh toppings if one wants to build a pizza from scratch.

There is also something about the small rounds of slightly charred and crispy pepperoni on the pizza at Luna Pizza that makes it absolutely crave-worthy. Our favorite is the pepperoni pie with added pineapple (don&apos;t hate it till you try it)a

Add all that on top of a great thin crust dough, with some fresh oregano leaves on top and you&apos;re in pizza heaven."
4,"One of our go-to pizza places. The price has gotten a little more expensive over the years, personal size $9 and large $17. 

It always tastes better in person, but we&apos;re used to take out now. 

I really like the arugula and fennel salad - marcona almonds, shaved Parmesan, and a vinaigrette. What a delicious combo. 

My favorite is the spicy andouille - I love how it comes with fresh jalape√±os. This pizza is spicy and I like it!

My husband will customize his own. They are very generous with the pepperoni."
4,"When I&apos;m craving pizza and really have the munchies, I always head over there , They have amazing service and always have deals available that allow me to save money. The pizza crusts that they offer are also not only delicious but enjoyable and favorable in my household when it comets everyone!"
5,"A great little place for fresh, made to order pizzas. Many different varieties and toppings. They also have salads and sandwiches. Will definitely eat here again whenever I&apos;m in town!"
5,Food was amazing! Tomas went above and beyond for us. What a great costumer service from him. We drove all the way from Conroe and we will definitely be back soon. Thank you for your service Tomas!
3,Anytime I want to pizza I always think Luna. Two personalized pizzas are awesome and for the price you can never go wrong. My girlfriend absolutely loves pizza So we&apos;re here pretty often but unfortunately the service isn&apos;t all that. I wish they were a little bit more attentive and customer service oriented. Nevertheless the pizza is very good so we&apos;re gonna
5,"This place is the type of business you&apos;re lucky to have in your city, a complete asset. I went on February 16 2021, an insane ice day that left a good portion of the city without power. They were extremely busy being one of the few places serving food but still managed to execute a great pizza. Their employees deserve a god damn medal for working so hard on such a trying day. If there are any complaints on this day they are from Karen and Kyle still waiting on an email from the manager pissed off they had to wait more than average wait time for their personalized gluten free, dairy free, soy free, vegan, asshole deluxe pizza."
4,"Found ourselves in Downtown Houston at the end of the day hankering for pizza. This place came up. Sooo glad we tried it. 

This Is thin crust pizza at its best. It tastes fresh full of flavor.  

We tried the pepperoni, the margherita, and had a half spicy andouille and half sausage. They&apos;re all so good. I couldn&apos;t find a favorite. 

Simply priced a personal or small pizza is $9 a large is $8 more. Choose a standard preset pizza if you will or customize it. Their pizzas are fully customizable with a variety of topping prices ranging at .50 to $2 per addition. Best they will do a half and half at no additional charge. 

Plenty of good food for the 4 of us. With left overs. 

They have salads, sandwiches, soup and desserts. Wine and beer as well as a soda fountain.

You order at the counter and they bring your food to you. 

The only drawback to this place is that it is a small seating area  we had to wait for a table but it wasn&apos;t that long a wait."
4,"Last time I went I ordered a chopped salad and a pepperoni pizza! 

both of the dishes were very good the attention to detail was superb!

 the staff was extremely nice and the place was extremely clean. My family enjoyed this place quite a bit and we will definitely be back. 

It&apos;s very good to find places that still offer quality everything!"
