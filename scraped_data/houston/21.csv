5,"Stanton&apos;s has been around for 50 years now, and as a native Houstonian, I know that says a lot about the place. Things don&apos;t last that long here unless they&apos;re good. And Stanton&apos;s is really, really good.

I&apos;ve eaten probably half of the menu at this point, and all of it was really good, but I think my personal favorite is the Truck-Stopper. 

I&apos;m usually not the kind of person to call this out, but the fries here are great. They&apos;re worth adding to your order.

I can&apos;t wait until the pandemic is over (like, really over, not Greg Abbott Decided He&apos;s Over It over) and they open up again. Stanton&apos;s has made themselves a Houston institution, and that reputation is well-earned."
5,I love this place. My fav burgers in town maybe. They have a lot of different toppings and types of burgers to choose from. I recommend the miss piggie or truck stop. The fries and tots are really good too. Currently only doing takeout but still super good!
5,"Oh. My. Goodness. The burgers here are fantastic. We have ordered delivery from Stanton&apos;s City Bites several times during COVID. The burgers are always tasty and they&apos;re huge. Our favorites are: the Cowboy Brunch burger, the Holy Cow, and the Grilled Shrooms burger. We&apos;ve also tried a number of their appetizers. We&apos;ve enjoyed: the waffle bites, the bacon cheese tots, the onion rings, but hands-down the best appetizer is the fried pickles. Even ordering via delivery, they still arrive crispy instead of soggy. You can&apos;t go wrong with a burger and some sides from Stanton&apos;s City Bites!!!"
5,"Wow....
I had the blue moon burger and fries... both are great!
Staff was very friendly and helpful... definitely recommend trying this place."
5,"They&apos;ve done it, folks, we can all go home. They&apos;ve perfected the classic burger. Operating from an old-school white house in the Heights, Stanton&apos;s slings burgers, sandwiches, salads, and sides that take simple ingredients and make them sing. 

I was hungry, so I couldn&apos;t resist ordering the aptly named Monster Burger, a mouth-watering behemoth consisting of a full pound of beef in the form of two stacked patties, bacon, 4 slices of American cheese, and fixings. It was everything you want in a burger. The meat was well-salted, soft with some nice crusty bits. The cheese was gummy and creamy and kept the whole thing from falling apart. The bacon had a sharp snap to it and wasn&apos;t especially greasy. The crispness of the lettuce, acidity of the pickles/onions, and punch of the mustard all played key roles. The most pleasantly surprising part was the buttery, chewy brioche bun that was expertly toasted and wasn&apos;t even a lick soggy. 

OK now for the downsides because, yes, even 5/5 establishments can have a few blemishes. Did I think my burger, tastiness notwithstanding, was worth $16? Meh, maybe not since it didn&apos;t really rely on premium ingredients, though it&apos;s probably a quantity-related mark up. The fries were so-so, well-seasoned but not as crispy as I like. Also, for what it&apos;s worth, my wife wasn&apos;t the biggest fan of her Luke Skyburger. She found deep-frying the bacon to be unnecessary, as the strips kind of lose their fatty, meaty flavor, and she also wished they had slapped on more shrooms. Overall though, one of the best burger spots in the city if you ask me!"
4,"Quarantine pickup for the win! This place has been on my list for a while so when I had a taste for a turkey burger last week, I couldn&apos;t wait to order. Called in an order for the Classic Burger which comes with mayo, mustard, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles and onions. I subbed the beef for turkey, added cheddar cheese and eliminated the mustard. 

In less than 15 minutes it was ready for pickup. I&apos;m glad I added this place to my list because the burger was delicious and fresh. No frozen pre-packaged turkey patty here...and I was grateful. 

I also got fries. I&apos;m a fry fanatic but wasn&apos;t crazy about these. They were too crispy for my liking so I didn&apos;t eat many but I&apos;m sure they&apos;ll appeal to others. They dropped my review by a star but won&apos;t prevent me from returning. Yum!"
4,"Very mouth watery burger, and tastes even better than it looks. I had it with the trouble sauce which gave it a spicy sourish touch, and I felt as if it went really well with it. What I noticed most about the burger was that the cheese was perfectly melted with the meat which made it even more enjoyable than it already is. What I love most about Stanton&apos;s is that their burgers are much cleaner, compared to other halal burger spots, although I do wish it was just a tad bit bigger. Danrates: 8.5/10
Spicy Chipotle ~ $9

5,This place is consistently good. Even with convos.. they have their meals on time.. the portions are plentiful and staff is pleasant.
4,"Solid 4 stars.

Good specialty burger selection. I had the Cowboy Brunch. It was loaded with up with an fried egg, bacon and onions, on Texas toast. It was good and I cannot complain.

Everyone else just got regular burgers and they said they were good. 

My only real complaint about the meal was the bacon cheese tots. They used a processed cheese sauce that had little to no flavor. It just made the tots soggy and was just an unappetizing mess. 

The regular fries were ok.

All in all a good place to get a burger, however far from the best burger joint ever. Would recommend and return."
5,"We stumbled across this gem on Saturday and saw on Yelp that they have good burgers. Yall aint neva lied on the reviews! The burgers are GOOD, HOT, AND DELICIOUS!  I ordered the Blue Moon because bleu cheese is life. The Hubs ordered the Original Bacon Burger because it has mustard on it..yuck! Both with tater tots and a drink which you all pay separately....bummer! Anyhoo, the burgers were made to order and GOOD, HOT, AND DELICIOUS! IDK if the tots were frozen or freshly made but they were perfect accompaniment. We will definitely be back to try the Spicy Chipotle."
3,"I&apos;m sad to say it just wasn&apos;t worth the hype to us ..

Well we finally got to go here and I was super excited to start off with hearing all the great things but it fell short the inside of the place is really cool old time feeling I got the monster burger wife got the piggy daughter got the sliders and we ordered waffle and Cajun fries ... this is a order before you sit kinda place Just FYI .

  We finally get our food after I&apos;d guess 15 minutes or so came out hot and good looking took the first bite of the burger and it honestly tasted like meat cheese and some tomato pickle feel like not much flavor in the meat real greasy but it is 2 patties ... wife burger was still kinda pink well a lot pink m wouldn&apos;t think a bacon burger had no other option then being done .. mine was well done as well . 

Fries ..those were spot on we are enjoyed those they were hot and fresh and just great tasting so if I do go back which I would if in the area I would order nothing but fries  

All in all it&apos;s ok not worst not the best all food ordered cost 42 dollars"
3,"I love this burger spot, it&apos;s really good, and definitely worth the money that I spent. I spent anywhere from five to $10 on a burger, and it turned out not to be good. This place is really average, but they have huge burgers, and that was a plus. If you&apos;re in the area you need somewhere to eat, try this place is really good"
5,"S.T.A.N.T.O.N.S. its how you spell the answer to &quot;where should we grab burgers&quot;.

I&apos;m sorry but if you think another place has better burgers then 1) don&apos;t bother talking to me if you haven&apos;t tried Stanton&apos;s yet. and 2) if you have, and still think something else is better... then send me a message with this name because I have to try it!

I&apos;ve been coming to Stanton&apos;s for years and eaten and so many other places and have never found a more satisfying burger than the cowboy brunch. I split it with my wife so we also got the waffle bites  and cajun spice fries as sides, since eating the cowboy brunch by yourself is the kind of meal you eat right before a nap."
3,"We&apos;ve been wanting to try this place for a good bit and were excited to finally get the opportunity.

I ordered the mrs.piggy &amp; waffle fries 
My daughter ordered the sliders 
And my husband ordered the monster with Cajun fries .

I&apos;ll start with the positives , the waffle fries were DELICIOUS , flavor was good, perfect combo of crispyness ect . Interior was interesting / different : 

On the other hand ... burger on the other hand was just ok , really a disappointment. It was under cooked , and really lacked flavor .
My daughter while eating said this is SO good .. besides the meat .. I said well what do you like then ? &quot; the bread , cheese .. ketchup ! Ha 

Also the tables were very wobbly .. we tried several so it wasn&apos;t just ours . And lastly NO CHANGING TABLE IN THE BATHROOM . sooooo frustrating, I had to put paper towels on the floor and change my son bc he was leaking out . - not an ideal situation : 

Glad we were able to finally come try this place out but I don&apos;t think this will be a place we return ."
4,"I love their burgers and fries! It is a unique place, very casual, family-style with good service."
5,"Delicious home style burgers and Cajun fries! Family-operated, fast service, and satisfying food."
4,"Cool little place to grab a bite. You order at the counter and seat yourself. I&apos;m quite the burger fan, so I was surprised when a friend suggested this place and I hadn&apos;t heard of it before. 

Be sure to be looking out for the building because you&apos;ll miss it if you aren&apos;t paying attention. There was parking on the street but I don&apos;t think there is much of a parking lot. 

Lot&apos;s of burger choices but you can customize them to have whatever you want! Great selection of both local beers and some wines. It&apos;s a serve yourself kinda setup but everything is conveniently located so you&apos;re not flagging someone down to get ketchup or napkins. 

I&apos;ll be back for sure!"
5,Yum yum yum! A staple in places to eat inside the loop! Burgers are very tasty here and truffle fries were insane!
3,"I was soooooooo excited to try their food. I&apos;ve heard great things. But sadly, I was disappointed in my experience with Stanton City Bites. I ordered to go because COVID. 
Cute home store with old diner pop shop vibes. 

I was sad to see the amount of food in the onion ring basket. Food was cold. The enjoyed the buns on the bacon burger but that&apos;s it. I will try again with a different burger and hopefully they will fill up their side orders."
2,"Much like any red blooded American we have all had burgers. And I will preface this post with stating I have had burgers from all over the country. Chain restaurants to men serving burgers on grill in the back of their trucks. With that said...  

This place has some interesting options. 

However is it in my top 10 of burger joint in Texas?  

Sadly no. 

But they do have this wonderful atmosphere that pulls you back into the 50-60&apos;s of Americana. 

Burger I had was a poor choice (I&apos;ll admit that) I ordered the Cowboy Brunch. 

An interesting idea just not executed well. 

The burger was served on toast (hence the brunch in the title). Toast was dry and unappealing. 

Also the burger was topped with an egg (again back to the brunch title). The egg was over cooked. Not a drop of yolk. 

The burger itself was ehh. Little overdone. Not juicy as to be expected from such a highly rated burger joint. 

Ultimately this place is a fun little throw back to yester-year but it really just missed the mark in a good quality burger."
