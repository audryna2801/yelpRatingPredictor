5,"This place should be a Houston landmark. It has been there for years and every time we visit, we end up having a great time. I think it&apos;s set in a house which has been converted to a restaurant. Has a porch in the front and a back patio. The decor in old but in a charming way. Think of a cafe in Paris. No thrills or fancy decorations, but still feels upscale. 
The service and the food are always great. Well prepared and well presented, and always tasted good. 
if you want great food, consistent service and an overall good experience, this is the place to go."
5,"Backstreet is one of my favorite brunch spots in Houston for a number of reasons. The main draw for me is the ambiance. I love sitting on the patio and enjoying the relaxed but still upscale atmosphere. The staff is incredibly nice, well-knowledgeable, and something you don&apos;t see often - genuine with recommendations!

Today I tried the butternut squash risotto which was reallllly delicious and the duck rolls. The duck rolls weren&apos;t my favorite. The cinnamon rolls for the table weren&apos;t great but they were complimentary - you can&apos;t complain! I got the crispy chicken. The presentation was different than I expected but truth be told, I tore every bite up. The risotto is buttery and creamy and just divine and the chicken was seasoned nicely with a nice crust. The pistachio pesto was yummy - I wish I would have gotten more.  My friend got the migas and I would say it&apos;s more like a breakfast egg scramble - I wouldn&apos;t recommend that. 

I&apos;ve gotten the shrimp and grits before which are delicious, as well as the brisket hash and Benedict - definitely a fan."
5,"Tucked away off Shepherd part W Gray is this delightful and charming restaurant.  We&apos;ve been several times but tonight was special as we went with friends 

Nicholas, our server, was friendly, professional and prompt. He took exceptional care and there was no problem pairing up the 3 couples fit separated bills 

I ordered the fish special which was a 6 oz Red Snapper beautifully prepared with corn soufflé and green beans.  My Honey ordered the Scallops.  She loved them!  

Had an espresso after dinner as we had some time before the Stevie Nicks flick at the River Oaks Theatre. 
 
Outdoor seating is available but we like the air conditioning so we were inside and mostly had it to ourselves.  Quiet ambiance allowed conversation without any problems.  

All in all this gem deserves their 5 stars."
4,"Had brunch here for my cousin&apos;s baby shower with a group of about 12 ladies.  Overall a great experience, especially from a service standpoint.  Our server in the upstairs area where we were seated was very attentive.  Our water cups were always filled to the brim anytime they got low.  And he was kind enough to cut the cake that we brought with us for us.

We started with 3 different appetizers - the duck spring rolls, the butternut squash flatbread, and the shrimp lettuce wraps.  I only tried the spring rolls and flatbread, but both were delicious with plenty of fillings in each.

For my entree, I ordered the brioche French toast.  This is where a star was dropped.  There were 4 of us on our side of the table that ordered the French toast, and it looked like all of ours were cooked at varying times in the oven.  Mine came out very dark brown like it was over cooked and was quite dry.  We had to ask for extra syrup to compensate the dryness.  

Given the excellent service and quality of the appetizers, I would most likely return to give this place another try."
5,"HIGHLY RECOMMEND. 

Not to mention, you can have not only an incredible meal, but also have your vehicle detailed while enjoying an incredible meal. Score.

I am making reservations to attend this evening, and it was an easy (goes without question) decision on behalf of my husband and myself. 

Sincerely,
EM"
5,Amazing food and service! (See prior review for more detail) wanted to add the shots of the food :-)
5,"I came here for a Sunday brunch with some friends and we loved it! We wished we could&apos;ve been seated outside as the weather was just beautiful, but unfortunately a long wait. Next time we visit, we&apos;ll definitely wait or make reservations to be seated outside as the outdoor patio is gorgeous. There is complimentary valet. The restaurant itself seems to be renovated from an old home that gives it a rather cozy (yet still upscale) vibe. We sampled the avocado toast, butternut squash flatbread, and steak and eggs. All were good. Oh, and they give complimentary pastries for the table! We will be back soon!"
5,"Great place! Overall I prefer the brunch menu over the regular, but to each their own. 

My favorite cocktail is the Violet Hour. Definitely get if you are a fan of pisco. 

The rosè Malbec was also very delicious as well. 

My favorite appetizer is without a doubt the duck spring rolls. It comes with four which makes a perfect shareable bite. 

My favorite entree has been the crab cake Benedict. They were an off the menu special, but I hope it becomes a permanent item. 

There is a dessert they had awhile back with oranges and chocolate brioche, but they have not brought it back due to season and covid. Hope they can bring it back in the future."
5,"This visit was great! Food was delicious, like always, and our server, Sergio was phenomenal! My only meh moment was the fact the weather wasn&apos;t in our favor and we had to eat indoors.  other than that, which was out of our control, this visit was great."
4,"First time here. Service very good and the food was good.  I did find the menu a bit short although my first visit- that was fine I&apos;d not come here often.  Great wine selection. 

Only negatives you have to valet even though they have a lot with empty spots- I hate people driving my vehicle. 

Second it was a bit pricey. Again it was good though."
5,"DINNER REVIEW! This place is as great as it lives up to be! Everything fell in place for a smooth and enjoyable dining experience. The menu is concise but extensive enough to find something for everyone. The appetizers, drinks, and main courses all sounded delectable! 

Ambience: this is a house converted restaurant that has been a staple in Houston since the 1980s. We made sure to snag a patio deck seat to enjoy the beautiful fountain and crisp weather. Service on a Wednesday at 3PM was great as there were relatively few diners around this hour during COVID, and all servers and bussers were incredibly equipped, prompt, and professional. Everyone was masked and accommodating for a comfortable experience

Parking: valet only but various neighborhood street parking nearby

Food: we each ordered a sangria $8 that was well flavored and a hearty glass. Make sure to take advantage of the complimentary bread which had such an addicting buttery spread and a wonderful cheesy aftertaste. For our entrees, I ordered the crispy chicken $24 (a whole medium sized chicken) subbing out the grits for risotto and my bf ordered the lobster risotto $30 ish. Both were fantastic and perfectly tender. The chicken is a great choice if you&apos;re really hungry and looking for something well priced, and the skin was seared perfectly crisp and seasoned with a dash of pesto. My risotto was al dente as I liked and came with mixed potatoes and vegetables cooked in a flavorful stock. My bfs risotto was tomato cream based and hearty as well! The lobster tail was a little more salted than I personally preferred but tasted fresh and meaty. 

We were both full and didn&apos;t leave much room for dessert. Overall, I enjoyed my experience and looking forward to come back for their famous brunch menu! I have no doubt that every dish here is consistently well thought out, fresh, flavorful, and delightful. You won&apos;t be disappointed!"
5,"Tucked away in a small little building, Backstreet Cafe has big things to offer! I was instantly impressed with the fun vibe, cute atmosphere, and quick service. My boyfriend I were seated right away at a table inside and on the second level. Although sitting inside feels pretty taboo right now, we didn&apos;t feel cramped or unsafe. All tables were spread apart and some windows were even open! The staff was super quick and very attentive throughout the meal. We ordered two portions of the Steak and Eggs, and we were thoroughly impressed. There was a nice bonus of some free breakfast muffins, too! Overall, the prices were very fair for the large portions.  When you try out this trendy brunch spot, make sure you book a reservation and pack a few ones for the Valet parking!"
5,"When during HRW and didn&apos;t have to wait yay.

For starters service was the best they were able to accommodate my special taste buds wanted steak and lobster well that wasn&apos;t on the lunch menu so they were able to get a lobster tail and fillet mignon for me and make me feel special.

Well and both my dish and my friends were absolutely delicious I totally plan to come back here in the future and would definitely recommend to friends and family."
5,"I&apos;ve always wanted to come here, but never attempted it - just secretly drooling at the food pix on Yelp. I never mentioned it to anyone, but Hubby read my mind &amp; surprisingly stopped by for brunch on Jan 2nd for my birthday (New Year&apos;s). We NEVER eat brunch. We were able to get seated outdoors on the dog friendly patio with our Boba the Beagle. The Shrimp and Grits were amazing. The kiddos enjoyed their dishes as well. Drinks were also delicious. I appreciated the complimentary soup. Our waiter was super friendly and gave me a birthday dessert. I don&apos;t recall what it was, maybe chocolate cake but it was gone in seconds. Best birthday meal."
2,"We were looking for a new brunch place to try and decided to come here on Sunday to try their &apos;Breakfast &amp; Such&apos; menu based on the number of reviews we came across. I ordered the Backyard Benedict and my boyfriend ordered the Skirt Steak &amp; Eggs. Both our dishes were lukewarm, the biscuit for the benedict was overwhelming and the steak was extremely overcooked. Unfortunately, we will not be looking to come back."
3,"I came here for brunch with a few coworkers and we were seated outside, which was nice since the weather was very cooperative.

I had their version of an Arnold Palmer, I forgot what it was called but it had more than just your typical iced tea and lemonade. It was too tart for my taste though.

For an appetizer, I ordered the Scallop Crudo which was pretty delicious. I&apos;ve never had raw scallops before, but the apple slice on top paired very well with it. HOWEVER, I ended up killing my coworkers Wild Mushroom Risotto. She felt it was a little undercooked, but I loved it.

Unfortunately, those were the only 2 dishes I liked. The duck spring rolls were okay. But my Shrimp and Grits lacked flavor. The shrimp were huge but I definitely feel like it could use a little more seasoning. My coworker got one of the specials which was Crab Cake Benedict. Flavor was good, but the crab cake could have been a little crispier? The texture was just mushier than I was prepared for.

We finished with coffee and dessert. The Nutella coffee was okay, but the bread pudding and flan were delicious.

Maybe I&apos;d come back for the risotto, or even to try the dinner menu. But brunch was definitely only so-so for me."
5,"I haven&apos;t been out for many other curbside pick ups during this COVID-19 shutdown but a couple weeks back I got a little tip about this place &amp; their menu offerings. Once I was able to make the pick up work for my schedule I put in my order &amp; let me tell you how AMAZING this meal was! Fresh, hot bread, lightly breaded &amp; flavorful chicken breast...topped with a house made slaw! Wow...wow...wow! LOL I&apos;m impressed!

The service was amazing, the staff were all busting their butts to get orders to &amp; from. The line moved quick for curbside &amp; I have to say I couldn&apos;t be happier. If you are into the drive up experience, you have to put this one on your list. I am anxious to try their full menu once things get back to normal! Tip the servers they are working extra hard!!!"
5,Dude this place is awesome. They have vegetarian options. Went here for houston restaurant week and can&apos;t beat 20$ for an amazing brunch. So much food and it was delicious. The Migas is flavorful. I love chocolate and the banana desert is so yummy. My husband loved the chicken sandwich! I can&apos;t wait to go back!
4,"Definitely sit on the back patio! Loved the atmosphere back there, especially with the huge tree wrapped in lights and the fountain. 

We had:
- Appetite for Life cocktail (great)
- Violet Hour cocktail (good)
- Garden Mule cocktail (great)
- Dark and Stormy cocktail (average)
- Duck Spring Rolls appetizer (great -- they were fried and came with soy sauce, similar to an egg roll)
- Pâté and Cheeses appetizer (good -- pâté, pickled okra, and chorizo were very good. The cheeses and bread were alright. This would be better for 3-4 people vs. 2, considering how much cheese it comes with)
- Braised Short Rib entree (great, but would have liked more polenta)
- Grilled Ribeye Steak entree (good)
- Caramel Kiss Cappuccino (great)
- Backstreet Cappuccino (great)"
1,"The coffee latte taste bad. Sour taste cheap. A nespresso machine literally has better quality coffee than this place. Food is Luke warm, not hot. Eggs are not fresh. Egg yolk color is yellow. Meat taste unfresh."
