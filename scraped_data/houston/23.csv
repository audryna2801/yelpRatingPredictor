5,"Still 5 stars, but I&apos;m giving an update since my subsequent visits to one of the best poke spots in H-town!

I&apos;ve tried several of their options over the past couple years and have consistently enjoyed the unique flavors, delicious sauces and fresh fish. Most recently I opted for the Truffle Tuna bowl for takeout during COVID. It&apos;s hard to find the words to describe the creaminess of the shoyu and truffle soy in a way that does them justice. Suffice it to say, I thoroughly enjoyed the meal and have found a new go-to order.

Their prices have gone up a bit over the past year, but the flavors more than make up for it. I will say that the size of the bowls is somewhat lacking compared to a few other Houston poke spots like Local and Ono. Regardless, check this place out! You won&apos;t regret it."
5,"I really thought there was a ceiling to how good Poke could be and then I had Diced Poke. I got the Pepper Tuna and Yellowtail with Bamboo Rice covered in their TRUFFLE SOY. That sauce is truly a game changer, let me tell y&apos;all. The employees were great about having me try sauces but still be Covid-friendly with the barrier they&apos;ve input between the assembly line and the customers, great touch. The quality of the fish was awesome, the homemade sauces were great, and they had awesome crunch options (hot Cheetos!!). Also I love a place where they don&apos;t charge extra for seaweed and crab salads. Can&apos;t wait to come back!"
5,"Ive been going to Diced Poke since way before COVID. I&apos;ve always absolutely loved their poke bowls. Number one: you can always taste the freshness of the fish. Number two: they don&apos;t just slap all of your mixtures together. They do it strategically and with care, like a work of art you could say. Also, you get free Miso soup and it&apos;s delicious! Right now because of COVID you can&apos;t get the soup but the poke still totally makes it worth it. I drive from the woodlands just because I&apos;m craving Diced Poke. (:"
5,"Forgot how much I missed poke! I ordered the spicy salmon bowl to go, and it was so so tasty! Generous portion size, great fish-to-rice ratio, and love the crunchy toppings mixed with the fresh, tender fish.

The sauce was flavorful but actually a bit too spicy for my tastes so be careful if that&apos;s what you decide to order!"
5,"I don&apos;t eat eggs... they&apos;re too YOLKY
I don&apos;t like Dylan... he&apos;s too FOLKY
I don&apos;t like poor dudes, they&apos;re too BROKEY
But when I want raw fish, it&apos;s DICED POKE!

Other places like this are just OKAY
Others are expensive like a week in ST TROPEZ
Others have crap sweet sauce like YOPLAIT
But the best I&apos;ve had in town is DICED POKE!

Wanna buy Barbi lunch, it&apos;s approved, SO PAY
Wanna date Barbie for free, hell NO WAY
Sometimes we go on ho-li-day but every day&apos;s a HO DAY
Especially when my Barbie gets all dolled up for DICED POKE!

WHAT

I thought I&apos;d poke my nose in here and check it out.

I&apos;m not going to mince my words - or dice them either.

I was going to criticize hipsters in general, the midtown crowd as a whole, and the obsession with Poke, but such generalizations can be a little Dicy, and can be like Poke-ing a bear, so I decided against it. Instead I&apos;ll just critique this actual food... which is surprisingly amazing.

We were surprised when we came to this mid-price shiny new trendy poke spot, right in the heart of very trendy Midtown. Surprised because while not being exactly dirt cheap or budget low-end affordable, it is absolutely delicious, and the Poke is expertly made. What&apos;s more, the drinks and sides are all good as well.

When the products are this excellent, then you can almost - and I mean almost - justify the prices. They have great service too, actually.

If it were a bit cheaper it would have been easily a five star, but considering the lovely service and cute employees and excellent freshness, and also considering the fact that so many poke places that also charge too much simultaneously give you a very mediocre or even awful product, then I honestly have no choice but to give a glowing five star rating, and say that whenever we want poke in Midtown, this is exactly where we will come.

In fact it&apos;s probably my favourite Poke place in Houston, all things considered, perhaps level with the somewhat cheaper and less fancy Papa Yu on Katy Fwy.

In retrospect they should have named it &quot;Poke Ono&quot; because it totally stole us away from The Beatles aka our regular poke places, like Yoko did John.

So all I can say is:

How do I like lemon tea? I like it ICED
How do I like Miami? I like it VICED
How do I feel when I&apos;m cross? Kinda like CHRIST
But how do I like Poke? I like it DICED!

How do I count to four? I do it like FEIST
How do I like lunch dates? I like them low PRICED
Why do I flea comb my cats? I like them de-LICED
And how do I like Poke? I like my POKE DICED!

WHAT!"
3,"Meh. This was just alright. I think the fish quality isn&apos;t as strong as Ono Poke and didn&apos;t like the topping choices as much. I will say that the advantage they have over some other poke places is that they offer the peppered tuna which I actually like more than the the tuna choices at other poke places in the area. Otherwise, I don&apos;t think anything really stands out here. I think this is just a matter of taste because many others I have talked to absolutely loved this place. In the end, I want this restaurant to succeed and have lots of customers but it just isn&apos;t my cup of tea."
5,"I am so obsessed with this place! Delicious and lots of options. I am a little sad the last few times I&apos;ve been there they haven&apos;t had bamboo rice (not sure if they&apos;re discontinuing it?) its so fun and definitely a fan fave over here. It kinda made this place unique to me. Overall really cool environment, lots of toppings, and not afraid to make it super saucyyy 
They have a points system so you can rack up points and get discounts and free things! Go, now! And let this also be your favorite poke place!"
4,Their portion and flavors were great and their price is comparable if not better than other poke places. I wish there were more topping options though! I think I still prefer pokeworks!
5,Was craving poke one day and found this gem on Yelp. I&apos;m glad I got poke from here because it was so tasty and perfect portion! Loved how it was super close by the Airbnb I was staying at.
3,"Dine in is allowed here! I was in the area and was craving poke. Saw that they have panko fried musubi, so I had to try! There&apos;s a garage right next to the plaza for parking, but I saw that there was also street parking as well. Walking in, very spacious and open! I went around 4pm, so it was empty. They had a lot of different rice options to choose from. I was surprised that their regular is 3 scoops of protein and their large is 4! 

The poke bowl was okay. The reason why is there wasn&apos;t much to choose from to add into your bowl, like vegetables wise. Presentation of the bowl wasn&apos;t appealing either. I liked that they had hot cheetos to add on top. Rice was very chunky and dry. When mixing up your bowl, there was barely any sauce at all. I like my bowl to be a little saucy where my rice is coat with sauce. As for the panko fried musubi, the rich was good! It was different from the rich in your poke bowl imo. The spam was good, but I wish it was sliced a little bit thicker. It was different for sure. They have different brands of soda I&apos;ve never seen before, but I really like the mango soda. 

As for the environment of the place, very nice. A lot of natural lighting. One thing for sure is that their silverwares that are placed out for customers shouldn&apos;t be out there when COVID being around. It also need a better wash. It&apos;s worth for a first time, but I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll be back."
4,"For those of you who don&apos;t know what poke is, it&apos;s basically sushi in a bowl but you get to customize it yourself. The protein that poke spots normally have is raw, but diced had cooked shrimp, which I personally tend to lean towards. They also had the option to make your own sushi burrito, and açaí bowls in the morning. They had a variety of veggies, a number of sauces, and several crunches to create your perfect poke bowl. The only thing that they were missing was corn, but they did have crushed hot Cheetos to spice it up. I enjoyed my bowl, it was incredibly filling, and I will for sure be stopping by soon. Also they have mochi which you can add on for dessert.

1,"This location says that it&apos;s open but it is not.
We stood in front of the door for about 10 minutes and the employee? Owner? just ignored us...
Used to be my favorite poke places buy prob will not return"
5,"Diced Poke is one of the best poke places in Houston and definitely worth a try! They use very fresh tasting ingredients, give you a sizable portion, and there&apos;s a great variety of toppings to choose from. They also have interesting style of rice, such as volcano and bamboo rice. Tbh not sure what the difference is, I think maybe volcano has more minerals and bamboo might be cooked in a bamboo cooker? I forgot lol but try it! Also they don&apos;t only serve poke, they have other options such as musubi (spam rice wrapped in seaweed, so freakin good), pokkititos (poke burritos), and mochi ice cream.

I have also had some of the best service here, the workers are sweet and helpful. I&apos;m also in love with the lighting and cleanliness of the interior because there&apos;s plenty of space and nice side windows for natural lighting. I&apos;ve only been here once and I think what deters me from coming back is really parking and location since it&apos;s in the middle of Midtown."
5,"Oh my gawd. I am in love with this poke place! I customized my own bowl with pepper tuna, yellow tail, and salmon, and added a bunch of toppings. I love how they don&apos;t charge you extra for the toppings unless you add avocado. I love it when my food is spicy so I went overboard and added toppings like hot cheetos, serrano peppers, jalapenos, habanero tobiko, and thai chilis haha. I thought their fish was fresh and the quality was amazing. I was impressed with the presentation of each bowl considering I had so many toppings. The spam musubi was also super yummy, and it makes for the perfect snack after finishing a bowl of poke. Overall, definitely a top notch place to get poke in Houston."
5,"I&apos;ve never had Poke before , but I&apos;m glad my first time was here. The atmosphere is modern , which is my fave. But the staff was very helpful. I explained it was my first visit and they took their time explaining certain foods I didn&apos;t recognize. Food was very fresh and overall unique in a good way. I will continue to eat there !"
2,"Sad to say we didn&apos;t have the greatest experience at Diced Poke the second time around. The array of toppings was as vast as I remember, but we found the fish lacking in both quality and quantity. I mixed my own 4-scoop bowl and went with salmon x 2, tuna, and pepper tuna. The salmon was bland and watery tasting, and the pepper tuna had a chemical-like aftertaste to it, kind of like a peaty scotch. The tuna was alright, but they were more judicious in scooping it compared to the other varieties of fish. They were out of both Yellowtail and Scallops when we arrived just before closing on Sunday, so I can&apos;t comment on either of those. That being said, the green bamboo rice - infused with young bamboo juice - was nice and fresh-tasting, and if you are someone for whom the accountrements are the draw of poke, then Diced Poke delivers. But I&apos;d prefer not to compromise on the taste and freshness of the fish, and DP missed that mark on this occasion."
5,Always top-notch quality ingredients. Really dig the bamboo rice and I find myself craving that flavor often.
5,"Go here if you want poké. 
1. The fish is always fresh and never has a fishy taste, if you know what I mean.
2. They aren&apos;t like other places that charge you for every little thing you add to your bowl. You can PILE stuff up on there without extra charge so you actually get full without spending a fortune. I am talking specifically about: crab mix, seaweed salad, tamago, etc (I think avo is maybe extra, but avo is always extra so its kinda a moot point there).
3. You get a complimentary miso soup to start your meal. 
4. The employees are nice and you can tell they care about how they make your bowl.
5. It is right off the rail and very convenient/If you drive they validate parking.
6. They have a rewards system and you can get $5.00 off a bowl pretty quickly! They will also send you texts for things like free drinks or 10-15% off on certain days."
5,"This is the only place I go to for poke now - the freshness of the fish, variety of free toppings, and quality of the sauces keep me a loyal costumer!

The regular bowl ($10.95) comes with 3 scoops of protein. I usually get half bamboo rice (always warm and fluffy) and half spring mix with 3 scoops of salmon, and then I pack on as many as the toppings as possible. All of the toppings are flavorful and add different textures to the poke bowl. My favorites are crab mix, seaweed salad, and cucumber salad. They&apos;re all free except for the avocado slices, so you&apos;re definitely getting a good bang for your buck.

The complimentary miso soup is also delicious, and slurping a hot soup just warms my soul every time. Parking is convenient, as there is a parking garage attached to Diced. Parking is validated, so don&apos;t forget to ask the cashier for a validation ticket!

Poke - 5/5
Service - 5/5. They even have a rewards program for frequent customers!"
5,"Super good!! It&apos;s 35 mins from where I live but it will definitely be my stop when I&apos;m downtown or in the mood for some poke bowls. They have A LOT of choices for rice, proteins, and so many topping options. They have more than just Poke bowls too. Also, the soda has higher quality options more than your normal coke products. The atmosphere is clean and modern. Parking is not very easy but not expensive."
