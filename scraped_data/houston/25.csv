5,"First off, Tai is the owner of this place and he is fantastic! His hospitality was worth the 5 stars alone. He treated our whole group like queens. THANK YOU. For being in the covid era, I felt pretty safe. There was adequate space between parties.

Not only is the staff incredible, the space, decor and environment is very cool and super different from most places. And of course, the food is also really delicious. Get a ANY burger, cocktail and a desset, just do it. Seriously can&apos;t go wrong. We also had an incredible dessert that I can&apos;t find on the menu but it was a cookie brownie thingy in a cast iron pan with a dollop of vanilla ice cream. So good! Whenever I go to Houston, I am definitely coming here first!"
5,"One of the best brunch spots we&apos;ve been to in Houston pre or post covid. The restaurant felt relatively safe with the protocols in place but as with anything you never know.

I had the Frito Pie Scramble which was surprisingly one of the best things I&apos;ve ever had. It was savory and filling, I finished every bite. I was full the rest of the day and it was totally worth it. Highly recommend 5/5."
5,"First timer coming here, loved it! Definitely coming back! The atmosphere is very welcoming &amp; service is amazing! They follow Covid precautions. Shout out to Omar &amp; Jose the recommendations of the cheesecake Belgian waffle was delicious! I also ordered the salmon Benny eggs were pouched egg-celllent!"
5,"A great brunch and dinner spot in the heights with amazing brunch food and cocktails. We usually go for dinner but decided to get brunch today and it did not disappoint. I got the smoked salmon Benny that was gorgeous, their burgers are so-so and really pricey though.

All the different cocktails I&apos;ve had from here have been excellent, I&apos;ve tried the Hot Mess which was a really tasty plantation rum drink with taj√≠n. As well as the H-Town Smash (in the picture) which is similar to a Green Tea but with bourbon instead of irish, it&apos;s a fantastic and refreshing drink and probably one of my favorite cocktails."
4,"Went for lunch and had the burger with hangover fries. The burger came on a really good homemade bun which is probably one of the best tasting buns I&apos;ve tasted. The hangover fries were excellent also, lots of flavor. 
Not too many parking spots so we have to circle around a few times until someone left."
5,"I really liked this place. The mix of pop and RnB music from early 2000s was a nice touch. It&apos;s a small place so that added to the chill atmosphere. Service was good. Our server was on top of things. The food was excellent. The bananas foster French toast, although didn&apos;t look appetizing or like the other Yelp photos (the bananas not being sliced made a difference in presentation), was very good; the caramel sauce had the right amount of sweetness and the toast was good perfectly. The duck and egg tacos were fabulous. The pickled onions were a nice touch. The drinks were good and normally prices. Overall, a solid place with an interesting menu. I&apos;ll return."
5,"This restaurant has a very cool vibe and I loved the music and decor inside! The wait staff are extremely friendly and knowledgeable about the menus! All guests are required to wear a mask when not seated at their table and the staff was always wearing masks. The tables are 6 ft apart and if you are sitting at the bar, the restaurant is careful to sit people in a way that maintains social distancing. 

We came for brunch and ordered the Breakfast Burrito and S.O.S. The breakfast burrito was absolutely delicious. The tortilla was toasted and the crisp on the outside of the tortilla provided the perfect crunch! There was a great balance of  cheese and egg in the burrito and the crispy potatoes and breakfast sausage provided the perfect combination of flavors! 

The customer service at this restaurant is above and beyond. The owners and managers are committed to ensuring every guest has a great dining experience and I am happy to see this local restaurant car so much for its customers!"
3,"Went with 3 other people and we were not impressed with food, other than the delicious shake! I read everyone&apos;s reviews and highly anticipated good eats based off the ratings but wouldn&apos;t go back there again.  We each ordered something different: Frito Pie Scramble, Sloppy Jose, a burger, and something else that I can&apos;t recall bc it wasn&apos;t memorable enough.

5,"Great meal, delicious options, good music and better service. We really enjoyed our time at this restaurant, highly recommend!"
4,"Finally got to try this place. Cute lil place located in the heights. This place has 2 TV screens if you don&apos;t want to miss football lol.  They accept reservations but when we arrived there was no wait. Place has plenty of parking.  Ordered the burrata which is like a caprese salad,  was ok. Also ordered the bacon cheddar burger which is double meat patties, bun was dry,  otherwise the burger was ok, loved the crinkle fries.  I ordered the cedar plank salmon which was tasty.  The chef&apos;s nachos was like an Asian fusion because it had teriyaki sauce or something similar drizzled on it,  not a fan of this dish.  I&apos;ll have to say this is the first sit down restaurant I can remember that doesn&apos;t serve iced tea *head scratcher.  Service was excellent, staff was very friendly."
5,"BCK was a much needed pleasant surprise. Starting at the host stand, the service was amazing. They had tables available but he also told us which ones were about to be done/cleaned if we had a preference. We did not so we got a high top that was open. Our waiter was attentive but not over bearing and on top of every recommendation. We had 2 other people check on us during dinner which was great. I was hesitant with the menu because I&apos;m not a burger person. We got the salmon, chicken katsu and Mac and cheese which were all amazing and huge portions. When we asked for boxes since we couldn&apos;t finish, they brought small boxes for each meal to be packaged separately- great attention detail!"
5,"Omar and Jose helped us out today and both did an amazing job. I had the frito pie scramble and topped it off with the cheesecake waffle, yum"
4,"Delish! Delish! Delish! I&apos;ve been to this place more than once and they continue to impress me. While there are not enough TVs for me (when it comes to sports), I LOVE the ambiance here. I&apos;ve never had a bad item on the menu nor have I had a bad bartender. Definitely make sure you order a great cocktail and their salmon!"
5,"This is my first time here with my friends and I loved the atmosphere! I got a drink, a few shots  and just ate a few pieces of wings from my friend. I got the mexican mule and it was delicious! Omar and Jose were amazing and very attentive! Made awesome delicious drinks where I can&apos;t taste the alcohol. They also gave us a box of little donuts and that was so sweet. Thank you guys! I will definitely be back with my boyfriend and try some other foods."
5,"Okay! Not surprised when I learned this was a sister restaurant to Bosscat Kitchen. Great food and great service!  

I had the chorizo burger and it did not disappoint!! Plus, I can go on and on about the service, loved the friendly hospitality!! 

Great food and a great time, will definitely be coming back for more. 

Thanks Omar!!! I will see you soon!"
5,Absolutely love this place from the customer service to the food! I&apos;ve been wanting to try this place for months now but due to Covid I really didn&apos;t get a chance to until recently and I must say I will be back! My best friend is a vegan and they even had options for her! If you are a drinker I recommend getting the Mexican mule I love the added touch of strawberries and it&apos;s made with tequila!! If you&apos;re a burger lover definitely come here! Our server was Susie and she was very attentive!! Highly recommend going here if you haven&apos;t already!!
5,"MUST TRY 

If I could give this place a 10 out 10 I would !!  We were sat right away by a super friendly host  &amp; We told him it was our first time . That we were passing through &amp;That Yelp is what brought us in . So I&apos;m hoping this will bring someone else !! He went over the menu a little bit &amp; was so kind to take the time and ask us what brought us in , that we picked a good day to come in ( taco Tuesday ) !!  Perfect !!   
Server was good food was great ! 
Now when we we&apos;re leaving .. now don&apos;t laugh .. 
The parking lot is a little small and we are just getting use to the size of our new truck , it was a little bit of a struggle backing out . Lol !!! 
THE AMAZING host came out &amp; guided us a little and got us out ! This is a good 50 minutes from our home &amp; we will definitely be back . We all about supporting small businesses and GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!!"
5,"Came in from Galveston to meet a Houston friend for happy hour and early dinner. 
Cute place with old cassette tapes on the walls along with old movie star magazine covers. 

BCK stands for &quot;bosscat kitchen&quot; which is the sister restaurant of Bosscat Kitchen &amp; Libations off Westheimer (which ive also been to a few years ago-loved it)

Today, we started with wine...white bean hummus w/ veggies, broiled brussel sprouts, a crab cake AND a side of fried asparagus--yummy. 
(Because of a major water leak yesterday off loop 610E...they had no ice for cocktails...bottled water upon request)
I also ordered a hamburger with bacon and mac &amp; cheese!!! Delicious. (had a bit of a kick to it...spice of some sort)
Ashley (our server) was fabulous! Got busy about 6pm. Highly recommend.

5,The food is amazing. We had the &quot;return of the Mac&quot;burger and the chicken sandwich. Both were AMAZING. Also the drinks were made perfectly and delicious. Jeremy was an amazing waiter; very kind and attentive.
5,"Yelp won&apos;t allow 10 stars... although they deserve it! Food is excellent! Customer service is exemplary, Pedro M is the best manager I&apos;ve ever experienced. Walked out feeling like family. Customer service is very important to us and we were blown away. The food was delicious! We all loved our food and love the fact that everything is made from scratch! It&apos;s a plus that everything here is aesthetic"
