5,"A plus for tastiness, value, and healthy meal.

Dogs and I needed healthy dinner and we ordered delivery meat and 3 sides.
-beef shawarma large amount, juicy and tender meat with a lot of flavor 
-crispy cauliflower also tangy and large amount 
-hummus has a nice thick texture and great for dipping with the two included pita bread 
-side of potatoes large and easy to eat 

I will have an extra full meal for tomorrow too!

Highly recommended!  Miss eating in, but having it delivered is as close as it gets.  Packaging is great!"
5,"This is by far my favorite Mediterranean restaurant in houston. I&apos;ve had fadis, niko nikos, and la fendee to compare to and they are still the best with the best flavors and options

Even with COVID having everything closed their food doesn&apos;t disappoint! Still hot and fresh and very generous portions


Their hummus and
Pita bread is just so amazing
And I love this saffron rice

I always get either the baked chicken and kabobs (which take longer they make them to order) and it&apos;s always hot fresh and delish

Thanks for being so great Aladdin&apos;s! Can&apos;t wait to eat in your restaurant again!"
5,I love this place. The online ordering isn&apos;t great &amp; you can&apos;t customize like when I used to eat there pre-COVID but the food is still excellent. I think the prices have gone up but maybe I don&apos;t remember the old prices. Anyway the food is worth it &amp; the portions are enough for 2-3 ppl.
5,"Excellent food at amazing prices. The owner is a wonderful and generous person and really understands customer service, relations and has a heart of gold.

Any business looking to improve their customer relations, loyalty and  increase business Needs to have a meal here!"
4,"Before the pandemic there was a time that you would find me eating here eating at least twice a month after my biweekly run around the neighborhood. Ok, fine, it was more of a stroll around the area on my way to go have coffee from one of the shops but I was still getting my steps in and Aladdin was the perfect stop to go to in between these ventures.

Fast forward to present day and they have an excellent system in place. You can pre-order prior to your arrival as the place is taking extreme cautions for our safety. If you arrive prior to ordering you will have to scan the QR code outside the restaurant to place your order. I did see someone who must have been a regular whose order they took in person but I think it just streamlines things and doesn&apos;t disrupt the flow of the kitchen if you simply follow the procedures that they have in place. I ordered the 1 protein + 3 sides x 2 combos today as I was coming back from the med center with my dad.

First order had the chicken pieces with the hummus, squash and zucchini, and the rice with vermicelli. Second order had beef with baba ganoush, fried cauliflower, and the eggplant stuffed with feta and their magical green sauce. I also got an order of falafel on the side. The chicken was absolutely perfect and so were the beef and falafel. Imagine that the food survived it&apos;s freshness all the way from montrose to cypress. The squash and zucchini was such a delightful surprise. If you know me you know that I do not like either. I don&apos;t know what they do here but it&apos;s some kind of magic because they both tasted perfectly grilled and not mushy! The baba ganoush should really deserve a paragraph of it&apos;s own. The smoky elements in the dip were either coming from the smoked paprika that they had used or from the roasting of the eggplant or maybe both but the taste today was out of this world! I mean I literally dipped everything in it until I ran out of it. 

It&apos;s a great bang for your buck! Before the pandemic I remember that some of the dishes had become sort of oily but the food today was perfection to the last bite. I cannot emphasize on how happy I am with everything we got and the ordering system is so smart! I can&apos;t wait to make it part of my walking routine again :)"
5,"I am so late to the game but man, is Aladdin ever good. The sheer number of choices offered on the line is a bit overwhelming, but after a few visits, I think I&apos;ve finally nailed down my favorite things. I really like their falafel (only gripe is that I wish an order came with MORE) and their chargrilled veggie side. Their saffron rice is delicious, too. The portions are extremely generous and will give you leftovers for days. 

The parking lot at this location is small and a bit cramped, FYI."
4,"Went to this spot during lunch on a Friday and it was not busy but several groups in there. 

Ordered the meat and 3 sides. Wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the caramelized hummus. Loved the saffron chicken, saffron rice, and the orzo. Also the eggplant pomegranate was really good! 

The house blend of all the juices was delicious. Huge serving of food and it was reasonably priced."
2,"Their food hits the spot!! I love their chicken kabobs, rice, and cauliflower. It is super filling and flavorful. The downside: they ALWAYS mess up our order. We&apos;ve been ordering to go at the office and they&apos;ve messed up every online order we&apos;ve placed. This has happened 3 times in a row already. Once was fine and understandable, but 3 times is more than enough. They&apos;ve always forgotten one of our orders and had someone drive to the office to drop it off. This is extremely frustrating because the food is so good."
5,"Came here for lunch and got a vegetarian platter. With the girlfriend . Loved the Heaping portions of a yogurt dip a beat salad and this amazing eggplant stew which to the vegetarian by choice is quite pleasant due to it&apos;s almost meaty flavor. I ordered an extra serving of pita and got in total four medium sized pita pockets to use across the meal and it made for amazing impromptu sandwiches or just for dipping. The pita the pockets are in the more traditional middle eastern style where they are fluffy light airy and are infinitely superior to the dry flat style of Pita. Well priced, must go. I would hesitate to suggest the falafel as I feel it was a touch dry for my taste."
5,There food is great and I appreciate the kindness of the owner. Their portions is generous and the price is so fair. Such a little hidden gem !
4,"I can&apos;t believe I&apos;ve never been for how long I&apos;ve lived in Houston. It was my first time and I really like that they&apos;re being covid safe and still only doing curbside or takeout. I got the 4 veggie sampler, and it was great how many options there were. I got the caramelized onion hummus, saffron rice, roasted cauliflower, pesto eggplant, and pita bread. I really liked the caramelized onion hummus and pesto eggplant, but what stole the show was the pita bread, it tasted soooo good. I&apos;ve had better saffron rice, I think I might try the vermicelli cashew rice next time instead."
5,"My favorite Mediterranean food in all of Houston!   Aladdin is my go-to spot if I&apos;m in the mood for some Mediterranean food that&apos;s also quick.  It&apos;s cafeteria style where you pick out what you want from what they&apos;ve got behind the glass.  Portions are huge, so do expect to take home at least half of your meal for leftovers.

I usually get the 1 meat 3 sides plate with gyro for my meat.  This plate runs for $13.99 which is totally reasonable considering the huge portion size.  Note: they grill the meats fresh, so they&apos;ll bring that out to your table after you pay...just gives you some time to dive into the sides first.  I like to rotate my sides each time I go here, but my favorites are the roasted cauliflower, falafel salad, fried mashed potato ball, and fried okra (yes I know that&apos;s not so Mediterranean).  These are all so savory and flavorful, I could just eat them every day.  The pita bread they give complimentary is perfectly light and puffy to go with your meal.

There&apos;s one time I went and ordered the 4 vegetables plate and they were out of the falafel salad...sad.  They told me they&apos;d make more and bring it out to me, but to my surprise, they brought me out a fresh plate of hot falafels!  This usually counts as a meat on one of the meat plates (few dollars more), so that&apos;s stellar service right there.

I love Aladdin and definitely recommend giving them a try!  Pro tip: parking can be tricky, but they have their own private lot down the street from the restaurant, north along Montrose.  Try to avoid the shared valet lot behind Uchi - the valet is only complimentary for the other surrounding businesses but not for Aladdin."
5,"I love this place. I&apos;ve been ordering from them for years, and the food has been consistently delicious, the portions generous, and the quality excellent. The meats are always juicy and grilled just right, be it poultry, beef or lamb. They have a huge variety of sides, and every single one I&apos;ve tried, which would be the majority of them, have been to die for. I highly recommend the roasted potatoes, but for a truly decadent treat, make sure you try the labneh. And I would be remiss if I didn&apos;t mention their delicious, freshly baked bread. Soft, fluffy, and with just a hint of sweetness, they&apos;re perfect for cleaning up your plate. Regardless of what you end up getting, you won&apos;t be disappointed."
5,Mmmm I love Aladdin  it&apos;s so yummy! They give you soooo much food and it never fails to amaze me. Great customer service and great quality food.
3,"Overall the food was pretty good! I did curbside pickup and it was super easy + food was ready in 20 mins!

What I liked:
-The portion sizes are hugeeeee! I ordered 2 veggie combos (4 choices of sides each). That was enough for dinner for my family of 4
-The roasted cauliflower, caramelized onion hummus, and roasted potatoes were so good and flavorful

What could have been better:
-the falafel that came with the falafel salad was so dry it was almost difficult to eat. I&apos;m not sure if tzatziki is supposed to come with the order, but I didn&apos;t get any sauces with my entree so it was really hard to eat since it was dry
-I also ordered baklava, but they forgot it and I only realized when I brought my food home since I did curbside pick up :( make sure to check your order before you leave!

Also, the food didn&apos;t taste super fresh - but the flavors were were still good, so I want to give them another chance!"
4,"Overall good experience.

Located on a corner lot near Midtown, it shares a rear parking space with the neighboring burger restaurant. It can be right but I believe there&apos;s another parking lot. 

I was pleasantly surprised by the food selection. Was expecting a few kabobs/gyro options with a couple of standard sides. However, there were lots of options for sides. A vegetarian could also get a large meal. It&apos;s a cafeteria style setup and if you want kabobs, they grill them to order. 

Opted for the entree with 3 sides. Got the chicken kabob (a little overcooked but flavorful), saffron rice (delicious), Greek salad (yummy) and spicy corn on the cob (just enough kick). All were good and lasted for a couple reheats. Can&apos;t wait to go back and try more!"
4,"We were craving Mediterranean for dinner and Aladdin&apos;s is listed on UberEats, so it seemed like a good time to revisit a spot I used to hit up regularly when I lived in Midtown. I went with the Entrée (Kafta Kabob) + 2 sides (Baba Ghannoush, Mushroom &amp; Artichoke Salad). Kafta is a skewered slab of minced lamb and beef with parsley and other herbs. Aladdin&apos;s version comes with two medium-sized kebabs that are salty, spongy, and juicy with a nice dense texture. I think they would&apos;ve been slightly more tender if they hadn&apos;t steamed for so long on the drive over, but they still hit the spot, especially when dipped into the delicious dill-and-yogurt sauce that accompanied it. The Baba Ghannoush was solid, sour and savory with a little heat. I would recommend sharing it though since it&apos;s quite a lot and the taste can get stale after a while. The pita was so fluffy and well-made that I audibly exclaimed after the first bite. The Mushroom and artichoke salad was largely forgettable - tasted fine but the mushrooms were a little on the raw side for me. Good to see Aladdin&apos;s remains one of the best casual Mediterranean spots in the city!"
4,"Cafeteria style Mediterranean restaurant, they have delicious kebabs and I think in terms of quality they are better then fadis. I like their different types of salads they have and the warm vegetables are also really good. 

I always get the hummus and eggplant salad with lamb kebabs. It&apos;s very high quality and I like the location. the only reason I give it a 4 star is cause parking can be a pain here."
3,"At the corner of Montrose and Westheimer, Aladdin is a rather unassuming Mediterranean restaurant that I had passed by for years without noticing. As a usual Fadi&apos;s patron, I didn&apos;t feel a need to try another casual Mediterranean restaurant.

Regardless, I&apos;m glad I tried Aladdin out. The first time I visited I remember not being particularly impressed. I ordered a lamb shank and found it less flavored as the one at Fadi&apos;s, so I decided not to go out of my way to Aladdin again. I gave it another go when my friends wanted to try it a couple weeks ago on a Friday evening. My friend and I decided to share a plate of Lamb Kabob, and we tried sides of babaganoush, eggplant and a salad. Your order comes with two small pieces of bread, which were pleasantly warm and great for dipping in the babaganoush.

It was a sufficient quantity of food, though we could have sprung for a little more. The lamb kabob was chewy and had a great flavor - it was definitely the highlight of the meal. I found the eggplant side and babaganoush pretty tasty, but wasn&apos;t the biggest fan of the salad. I tried a little of my friend&apos;s gyro order and enjoyed it, and the spicy hummus was delicious as well. All in all, a decent meal, though a little pricey compared to Fadi&apos;s (and the quantity of food you get there). I&apos;m still a loyal Fadi&apos;s patron, but I wouldn&apos;t turn down dinner at Aladdin."
1,"If you really enjoy paying money for your food and GET YELLED AT by the owner, this is the place for you. Food is good like any other Mediterranean restaurant, nothing out of the world. Only exception is the special treatment of getting shouted at which no other restaurants do to their customers."
