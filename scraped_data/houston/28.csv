5,"Great food, huge selection of different dishes. Helpful wait staff. Clean and Covid conscious."
5,"I went yesterday for my roommates birthday and we had a great time even though we were a little hesitant because of the ongoing pandemic. We did feel safe though, since the waitress was wearing a mask and so was the hostess and everyone else that was working there. There was only one waitress so sometimes we had to wait a little longer for things but it was still good service. The food runners, bussers and other workers were available for any requests we had and were helping the waitress with the service. We could tell that there was a lot of teamwork going on. The food was good as always, this is the second time I visit. We ordered the $60 package that included like 5 appetizers and like 5 different kinds of meats. We also had some hot sake, which was really good. Overall it was a nice experience and I&apos;d definitely come back. The prices are good for the amount of food we got in the package."
5,"Okay! So if you are a meat lover like my husband and I, this place is for you!!!!! 

We love to go during lunch time, the lunch menu is great in value. However, my husband and I have big appetite, so we usually go with combo set! 

The meats are very yummy and tender and juicy! But, it&apos;s easily overcooked if you don&apos;t pay attention to your meats! Don&apos;t worry, the waiter/ waitress will let you know how long to cook! 

Must try their rice too!!!! Good luck and have fun enjoying the food"
4,"Was this place super fancy and decor
On point? No. Was it affordable with good food, good staff, and family friendly? Yes! Brought the family and my in laws to dinner and the loved it. The options for
Families don&apos;t sound like a lot of food but believe me, it is. I really liked that they even include a dessert! We sat in a booth which I recommend if you have smaller children. Our waiter was patient and answered all
Of our questions. Would definitely come again! It&apos;s also really close to discovery green!"
3,"We came as a group of 5 for lunch on a weekday. There&apos;s plenty of parking available in this plaza. The store seemed a little run down and the bar was shut down with caution tape (lol). 

The server was friendly although not too knowledgeable about the pretty big menu and its items. We ended up ordering a ton of apps and meats. 

Okonomiyaki- 3/5 kind of meh. Tasted a bit undercooked and doesn&apos;t taste like the Japanese street food that it&apos;s trying to mimi

Takoyaki- 2/5 not great. Also a little undercooked and bland

Tofu- 4/5 I actually enjoyed the soft tofu with scallions though the rest of the table did not. Tasted fresh to me. 

Fried rice- 3/5- we ordered garlic fried rice and a couple others; they were fine as a starch element 

Meats- 3/5- quality of the meat per price charged was not great. This is true especially on the marinaded meats; some of it looked a little suspect in terms of quality. The ribeye was the best thing we had. They offered 3 sauces; the darker sauce and the orange sauce were the better of the group. You obviously get to grill your own meat and they will swap out the grill / oil the grill as needed. 

Overall it was fine to try it once since it&apos;s a place that&apos;s passed by all the time if you live in Midtown or Downtown. The quality of the meats and dishes per the price was not great. Many of the dishes tasted like they were definitely frozen and fried or microwaved. The meat quality is a little disappointing. Would try once, probably won&apos;t go back considering all the choices in the area."
3,"I was told during the pandemic they only had a limited menu but still offer a happy hour menu. So, my boyfriend and I came here just after 9pm for the happy hour special for two. The special had a good range of meats which included bistro hanger steak, yaki shabu beef, toro beef, angus beef rib and umakara pork. The meats were good but nothing special. The order also came with appetizers, rice and veggies. The apps included were miso soup, salad and edamame. The veggies were rather minimal a simple cabbage salad and assorted vegetables like button mushrooms, zucchini, tomatoes etc. Overall, the food wasn&apos;t bad but isn&apos;t something I&apos;d be raving about anytime soon ! 

But we did see an order of wings that went out to the table in front of us and I must say those did look good ! I&apos;d probably suggest going with the a la carte menu over the happy hour special !"
5,"Super late review but regardless, y&apos;all need to support this business! A really great spot if you want to get a bunch of friends together. I&apos;ve been here a few times and the service/food never disappoints. Try their sake if you get a chance. Expand your palette!"
4,"We had a little bit of technical difficulties, my grill kept turning on and off but it was ok because the food was delicious!!! They have a lunch special everyday and you can eat your favorite meats for cheap! I absolutely loved it here! The staff are so sweet and funny! Definitely worth a try!"
4,"This gyu kaku specifically is usually my go to spot because then one in willowbrook didn&apos;t have the best service &amp; this is the only other location that isn&apos;t too far. It had been a few months since I&apos;ve been to this location so my boyfriend and I decided to go to this location to have dinner. We walked in and were sited immediately which was great m. But, the server we had wasn&apos;t the best or didn&apos;t seem to know what she was doing. She brought us waters right away which was nice and then after took our order because we knew what we were wanting. We ordered the 65 dollar meal ? It came with about 3 courses and it was for two people. We knew right away this experience was going to be weird when we were brought out the meats first before our soup and salad. Then after our appetizers came out. Then before you knew it our soup and salad came out. I know the whole purpose of the courses is so that you can actually enjoy each course instead of being overwhelmed at once and having 100 things at once on the table. Our server was named Catherine other then that she was nice but not attentive at all. We tried calling the host when she passed by and just walked away. Luckily the busboy was super nice and called her when we needed her. He was a young Hispanic guy wish I would&apos;ve gotten his name. Also I wanted to say there was another server a young Caucasian girl who was actually picking up our plates which was super nice of her! The only reason this bothered me so much was 1. It&apos;s hard to enjoy all of the food when you literally have 3 courses on the table and your worried about something getting cold. 2. There was no room on the table what so ever to be comfortable. 3. We actually had our friends sitting right next to us and we noticed they received their food course by course and she was also their server. I don&apos;t know if she was swamped ? Which it wasn&apos;t busy but maybe she&apos;s new to serving ? Either way the only reason I gave this 4 stars is because of the food and also the busboy and other server who helped out our experience without even knowing."
5,"This was such a fun and delicious dinner! We had a reservation and good thing- they were packed! As a warning, the parking is terrible here. It&apos;s a small lot and street parking fills up quickly.

For drinks, I went with a couple Lychee Gin Mojitos, which were really good. Then we ordered a bunch of food. I don&apos;t remember all the meats, but I know we got the Prime Kalbi Short Rib, Harami Skirt Steak, Toro Beef, Garlic Shoyu Chicken Thigh, Garlic Shrimp, and Garlic Mushrooms. All were good, but my favorites were the beefs and shrimp. The Toro Beef was excellent--it&apos;s like bacon! I love mushrooms, but the garlic mushrooms just didn&apos;t cook well and still tasted raw at the end. We also got an order of the Beef Sukiyaki Bibimbab which was great.

Overall, a great dinner and we will definitely be coming back!"
5,Just came here tonight for a quick drink and ended up ordering a bunch of food too.  Luis was our server and was amazing.   Analise stopped by our table and recommended a few items as well.   The service tonight was amazing!!!   I&apos;ll definitely be back.
4,"First time was amazing, good deals, date with my boo. I would recommend. Everything was good wasn&apos;t so crowded when we went."
5,"Came in from Galveston with a friend. 
Hanger steak, Harami steak and salmon all of which we cooked on grill at table. Side of garlic fried rice
Erick server was the best...and cute! 
Lychee sake shot
Sweet tea vodka
Mango Mai Tai

Everything was very tasty. Highly recommend."
5,"I had forgotten how cool this place is! I had been here a few times before, but recently came back for a dinner date on Valentine&apos;s day!
Usually there is a wait even on regular days (if you don&apos;t have a reservation), but that day was about an hour wait! In the meantime, we ordered drinks at the bar. I had the white peach Cosmo which was a pretty tasty sweet drink. The bartender took a while to acknowledge us, but then again he was the only one making drinks for all the tables!

As far as the food, you can usually order a set package that comes with a selection of meats, rice, salad and sides. Depending how many people are in your group, you can probably split it to where it&apos;s not too costly. Our package came with about 5 different meats, miso soup, salad, rice, cabbage, shitake peppers, fried chicken and edamame. We also got some gyozas on the side. The fun part is cooking the meat on the grill and being able to choose from so much variety of food! We were stuffed, but made some room for dessert. We had the Tropical Sorbet, which was too sweet and syrupy. However, the Matcha tiramisu was delicious!

Despite the restaurant being packed, our server and all the other staff did an awesome job at taking care of us. Our server was pretty knowledgeable and made sure to adjust our grill a few times when she noticed that it was not working. Great customer service with a fun and unique experience!"
5,"One of my favorite places to eat! So many different varieties of food and the service is on point. We usually get the meat lovers for 2 and have plenty of food to choose from. We are also fans of Japanese beer like Sapporo, this place offers beer towers! How could you not like this place?

Also, this place gets packed fast. Make a reservation if you can!"
1,"I&apos;ve eaten at Gyu-Kaku a gazillion times before the pandemic and have loved it but this place is NOT it for takeout. It was incredibly bad and my sisters and I got three different dishes too and all were equally bad. To be fair, it&apos;s hard getting something from a Japanese BBQ place but I still wasn&apos;t expecting this. I ordered the garlic noodles with shoyu chicken bowl and it tasted stale and expired and worse was the smell. To top it off, I definitely had food poisoning that night which was not a fun experience. My sister ordered the same thing but with no chicken and just vegetables and my other sister ordered the sukiyaki fried rice bowl and theirs wasn&apos;t much better. I&apos;m not sure if it was an off day for them but I am definitely not ordering take out from them ever again!!"
2,"I was excited to come here for lunch remembering that  the food was pretty good. There was no wait our waitress greeted us shortly and took our order. The food  was  good but sadly the service was not too great. Good service really makes or breaks the meal. We had to remind the waitress multiple times for sauces, water, Togo containers. At the end we also realized that  she had  forgotten our soup and salad that went with our meal. I feel a bit cheated because of that. She also didn&apos;t really apologize for forgetting either. As this is one of the restaurant&apos;s principle &quot;admit when  wrong&quot; clearly stated near the host stand. To top that off, she didn&apos;t give us a bag for our Togo food and had to carry multiple boxes up to the front and ask for a bag. Overall I im disappointed in this as I&apos;ve had better service  here before and this ruined my experience. 

The cucumbers are bomb though!"
5,"In Houston, there are so many options for Asian barbecue; but there is only one option for  Japanese BBQ (dedicated restaurant, at least)!

Korean BBQ (KBBQ) is predominantly known in comparison--I&apos;ve been to quite a few places in and outside of Houston. In terms of quality, the meats and marinades are superb. I&apos;ve visited the restaurant more than a handful of times and I&apos;m always pleasantly surprised by how good their meat is. 

To me, Kalbi/Galbi is KING in Asian BBQ (ABBQ). It&apos;s easily my favorite cut at almost any ABBQ restaurant and Gyu-kaku creates no exception (thank the all mighty heavens). It&apos;s delicious. If you&apos;re curious and are new to the game--order it...NOW! Ahem, though there are many great options. 

Want some rice? For first timers I would highly recommend the sukiyaki bibimbap, which is a twist on fried rice. White rice, among other ingredients such as a sweet savory sauce and sauteed onions are thrown in together with a handful of well-done, mouthwatering, dressed beef and a touch of sesame seeds.

Want even bigger bang for buck? Come during lunch or happy hour. They even have a reverse happy hour for nocturnal eaters like myself. Each plate of meat (which is roughly about 10 pcs) will run you about $7. I&apos;m usually a very happy eater with 3-4 plates per person. That will run you ~$28/person, a price that is comparable to the price tag of an all you can eat KBBQ joint. The kicker being quality, I choose Gyu-kaku, hands down. Be my guest in proving me wrong!

Now some mild badness; service could always use more work and the waiters could honestly be a little more present (this comment only applies to my most recent visit). The server dropped the ball near the end after desserts were given--feels like an eternity to get my checkbook and card back. Otherwise, it was a perfect date."
4,"So glad my friend took me here! I always wanted to eat at one of these establishments. This place is one of my friend&apos;s favorite spot...the prices are very reasonable, I felt safe dining in during these COVID times. Their lunch menu is available to 6pm which was nice because the prices are very affordable. The Sake was on HH which was also nice. My favorite meat was the ribeye. So amazing and the chicken was also good. I can&apos;t to come back!"
1,"Old ripped up seats and dirty tables when seated. 
Use to come here alot when it was kept up well. 
Walked in and waited 13 minutes before being seated, only two tables seated at 11:30am too but we were told to wait ... After being seated it was another 2 mins before menu brought out, then another 3 mins before water comes out and takes our order.  Disappointed with the slowness especially on a slow day. If busy then I can understand."
