5,"First time at this spot but judging by the reviews I was in for a treat. I was a little skeptical because I&apos;ve had ramen before but never as a Take-out dish. Thanx to the times of COVID I was willing to order ramen take-out. Online ordering was easy but the wait time was quite long (almost 2 hours). This was a Monday night so I thought my order would&apos;ve been ready a lot sooner. I arrived maybe 30 min. early and sure enough this place was busy. A busy restaurant is a sign that delicious food awaits! Anyhow when my order was ready- pick up was quick and simple. 
Unpacking everything at home was straight forward &amp; instructions were provided. The broth is separated from everything else &amp; once I followed the step and combined both bowls- I slurped my way through the entire meal! I ordered the wonton chicken ramen and it was perfect! The broth was flavorful, the noodles were perfect and the wontons were soft &amp; savory. 
What a pleasant surprise! Never doubt ramen takeout from this spot!"
5,Amazing ramen bar. A bit pricey but they know what they&apos;re doing with quality food &amp; ambiance. I highly recommend the thick noodles. In pre covid times it was packed around dinner time
5,"A friend and I went to JINYA on a last minute whim and were able to get a seat at the community table without a reservation. The restaurant does appear to be following social distancing rules and wearing face masks &amp; gloves. I saw someone post a picture of the Karaage Ramen which is what brought me in so I got it, and it did not disappoint. The ramen was very flavorful, I got mine spicy and the kick was mild so if you want really spicy make that clear. I like the amount of noodles they put in the ramen, for me those are usually the first to go but there was a good amount to last through the meal. We also tried the caramelized Cauliflower small plate per waitress recommendation and it was very good. I could have eaten the full plate alone. It has a lemony garlic flavor to it. Would definitely come back!"
5,"Great staff, great food.
I&apos;m a picky eater but I got spicy chicken ramen with corn and it was great!
Will go again!
Price is a little more pricey than fast food but worth it for the environment they have."
4,"The best in Houston, however this still falls short of the best ramen in Texas to Tatsuya in Austin. The pork broth here is seasoned well and is good but lacks the full depth of other ramens. My Indian friends love this place&apos;s chicken ramen and vege ramen and highly recommend it as their best option in Texas.

For takeout, the portion sizes seem painfully small. I feel as if you&apos;re getting 1.5x-2.0x more broth in person. For the price, the pork broth has some more room to go"
5,"Jinya is the absolute real deal. Looking at the reviews, I knew it had to be delicious, but I had to judge it for myself. And let me tell you...This ramen is to die for. 

The broth is 10/10 amazing. Very thick and flavorful. The noodles (I got the thick noodles) were tasty and chewy (in the good way). The toppings on the ramen are great and each add a new element to the bowl. The fried onions are a nice treat and add a sweet element to the ramen. 

The Jinya Bun was great, I just wish I ordered more than one. The steamed bun did split in half when I picked it up, but it didn&apos;t really impact the experience at all. Still a great steamed bun. 

All in all, I am eternally grateful I moved a block away from this place because I will be a regular."
3,"I&apos;ve always wanted to try out this famous ramen bar because everyone around me always raves about it. Although I was not able to eat at the store due to covid, it had very nice, modern and dark interior. The takeout was also packaged extremely neatly and conveniently. I ordered two ramen and one rice bowl.

Tokyo Tonkatsu Ramen - 3/5
Extremely Salty, would definitely ask for less salt next time around. The portion size was pretty decent, although not as big as some of the other ramen places I&apos;ve been to. Broth was very flavorful (a tad too salty, which could explain why the ramen was extremely salty overall). I would like to say, the egg was fantastic!

Spicy Tonkatsu Ramen - 3.5/5
Extremely salty like the Tokyo Tonkatsu. I&apos;m not sure why they used different noodles for this one, but I enjoyed the chewiness and thickness of this noodle a lot better than the Tokyo Tonkatsu. Spicy level is pretty low, I could barely taste that it was &quot;spicy&quot; and I have a low spice tolerance. 

Pork Chashu Bowl - 4/5
This rice bowl was definitely the most enjoyable out of the three. It was nicely seasoned and there was a perfect rice to topping ratio. It was very delicious and I would definitely come back just for the rice bowls.

Overall I feel like this ramen bar is a bit overhyped. I would&apos;ve expected their famous ramen to be the best on the menu, but I ended up enjoying the rice bowl far more. The prices were also on the higher side for a ramen bar. Pretty much most entrees on the money were well over $10. I might consider coming back for the rice bowl, but not the ramen."
5,Probably one of my favorite ramen places I just went there for my friends birthday the service is good the ramen is good I got to give credits to the server or waiter. The Tonkotsu Black (pork)was the best I can recommend
5,"Wow what incredible service, and incredible food. When everyone walks in the staff all greet us with welcoming words in Japanese. The food was timely and amazing. I have posted the items that we had and both were spot on. The amount of food you get for the price was perfect, we had another meal in leftovers. Do yourself a favor make a visit, you won&apos;t be sorry."
4,"It&apos;s always a great experience at JINYA. My to go is the sprouting up ramen, and I added some spice this time, it was tasty! The crispy chicken was delicious and tender!!! My husband loved his spicy tonkotsu ramen, I think he literally finished in less than 10 min. The bun was not too bad, but by then I was too full to fit 

Great place for friends gathering or dates!!! 
Not as much kids friendly tho, I would say. But that&apos;s okay"
5,This was my second time here and it was even better than the first. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. The spicy chicken ramen was the perfect heat level and so goooood! The atmosphere is nice. I&apos;ll be back again soon!
3,"I was in midtown and got takeout on a whim.

Chicken ramen - 4/5 - Exactly as pictured in the menu. Broth was tasty, though oily. Noodles were a nice dense and chewy texture. Nothing spectacular but just what I expected.

Pork chashu bowl - 3/5 - Decent taste, poor value. I love this dish, so I was disappointed by the tiny pieces of chashu (nothing like the chunks in the menu) that might&apos;ve filled a shot glass. For the same price, I could get a regular size bowl with 5x the amount of pork elsewhere.

I remember liking this place more when it first opened. Since then, I&apos;ve tried most ramen shops in town and I don&apos;t know if I&apos;ll return here."
2,"I used to love ordering take-out from Jinya! Their Tonkotsu ramen with the pork chashu was truly *chef&apos;s kiss*. The containers that also come with them are also perfect for takeout ramen and virtually mess free. However, this might have happened a few months ago, but for some reason they changed their pork chashu. They&apos;re now smaller pieces and the taste is just off...Last time I ate it it tasted like it was old or gone bad. It may not be the case, as they could have switched to a cheaper chashu. Nevertheless, I wish they could switch it back and maybe I&apos;ll order more often again!"
4,"I&apos;m a  fan of Jinya for sit down (before pandemic) and for takeout/delivery during quarantine/pandemic.  When Houston has those &quot;cold&quot; days, and I want something warm, not too heavy yet hearty, and comforting, then Jinya always comes to mind. 

I can often order it and pick it up in the time stated on the Yelp app or other food-related app. My food is always correct, still warm, and satisfying.  I also, let&apos;s blame the pandemic on this one, get the pair of mochi ice cream bites.  Don&apos;t judge! It&apos;s also comforting!

I feel like I have a standing order here: Jinya Chicken Ramen with no fried onions and a seasoned egg Plus Mochi ice cream - YUMM (cue Alexis from Schitt&apos;s Creek). 

Even when I have had this delivered, they somehow package it, so the broth is warm, the noodles and meat fresh, and the ice cream not melted. It&apos;s pretty awesome. 

I think writing about it will make me order this again.  Grateful to have this during the pandemic."
3,"I have been to other of these Ramen bars in other cities and found the food and service always incredible. Unfortunately one of those was not great at the Houston location.

We went there on Saturday night with my daughter and grandson. It was about 6 PM and they told us he would be about a 20 minute wait. With Covid we were outside waiting it was a little chilly but that&apos;s OK we&apos;re from New England we can handle it. Once we receded a server and his trainee came over and they were incredibly friendly. They made it a point to interact with my grandson and he felt like one of the group. We ordered some Gyoza and some Ramen as well as the kids meal with came with soup and rice and a couple of other things. We also ordered a beer, cocktail, and soda from my grandson.

After about 10 minutes the drinks came over. Not sure why it took so long but they were busy and didn&apos;t look like they were really distancing which was a little bit of a concern but OK. 15 more minutes go by and we have no faith Ramen. My grandson&apos;s food came over pretty quickly and he was happy except for his Ramen. The server came by about 10 minutes later, we have been here for 25 minutes now, and explained that he wasn&apos;t sure where the Ramen was and would go check. 10 minutes later he came by surprise that we still have not received it he would go check. You see a pattern here. After being seated for 45 minutes we did indeed get our Ramen. It was delicious, but the crazy wait time made us decide not to go here again if ever in Houston. Maybe it was a bad night but it did look like staff was running around like they&apos;re crazy"
4,I&apos;m so glad I finally got to try this place out. Food and service was amazing will be back very soon
4,"One of the few places I&apos;ve found that has a vegan and vegetarian ramen option that is actually tasty! I&apos;ve enjoyed their spicy chicken noodle ramen as well. Love their pork steam buns, though I personally didn&apos;t care for their beyond version of the same. The prices are high, but their food definitely hits the spot every time we order from here (or dined in person pre-pandemic).  There&apos;s a menu item for every palate. Worth checking out!"
4,"-Superb lunch service (5/5). Nice and very clean restaurant. We were seated without any wait for our 1pm Friday lunch.

-Started things off with the Spicy Shrimp App 3/5). It was a bit overpriced but the shrimp were crispy and hot. The egg sandwich app was meh (2/5). 

-My bowl of Tonkotsu Black Ramen with Pork and Tofu had good flavor (4.5/5). The egg was perfectly cooked, and the broth when mixed had an almost creamy flavor to it. Needed a bit more noodles, but I left satisfied."
3,"6/20/20

We were just getting together with a group of friends for dinner, and Jinya was suggested and I had not been to this location ever and wanted to check it out. It was a Saturday night and social distancing seating. It was also very busy and we went at like 9 PM and it still had a 25 minute wait.

Wait Staff (2/5): The hostess on this night was an All Star! She was super nice to everyone that was waiting and to the people with pickup orders. She kept homeless beggars away from us, and stopped some tow truck from towing some vehicles that to go orders. She was flying everywhere and had a fun attitude about everything. She made the difference between the two vs three star.

Cannot say the same about our waiter, he was absolutely horrible, we saw him three times, initially to bring water, get our drink order and finally to take our order. He was never ever seen again! We had to stop random waiters to get help for certain things and to get our check at the end.

Drinks (5/5): We ordered a pitcher of Kirin Ichiban and it was $22, which was 1.25 pint for three people and is cheaper than buying individual beers. They are about $6-$8.

Food (4/5): The group ordered a bunch of items, and my friend next to me ordered Crispy Chicken Small Plate, he seemed to enjoy it, to me it was a tad dry, but its suppose to be fried crispy chicken.

I ordered the spicy chicken ramen with medium spice level and with the thick noodles. I asked for an extra order of noodles and was told it is already put in. Which is strange because at most locations they give it to you on the side, I got charged $2.50 for it and I am not even sure if received any extra noodles because it looked the same as everyone else&apos;s bowl. The broth tasted so good and it was perfectly spiced, I ordered some mushrooms and some corn as extras. I was able to finish about half and took the other half home in a nice container. I did not want to be full and it tasted really good the next day after heated up. I ordered a chicken bowl, there was only two slices of chicken in the entire bowl, so I do not really understand that at all.

Check (2/5): I did not come with much expectations because their service is atrocious at every location I have been too. I am not going to blame the waitress for trying to figure out everything for us at the end and she was super helpful, but our waiter royally screwed us and left. I hope our tip went to her and not him. We had a group of 4 and it was impossible for her to split it after the waiter said &quot;I will take care of it.&quot; So we decided to get two checks and figure it out and they messed that up as well."
5,"Jinya has my favorite ramen ever!  I go in each city I visit that has one and it&apos;s consistently amazing!  I get the spicy chicken ramen, hot and one bowl is more than enough food. I also tried the crispy rice tuna and it was good as well."
