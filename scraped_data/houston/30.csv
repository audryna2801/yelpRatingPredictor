5,"We go to Hearsay weekly. With this pandemic still an issue, they continue to take proper precautions at the same time offering a really good time... 

I know that&apos;s tough for restaurants but necessary and Hearsay proves it can be done - great food, good service (would be great but sometimes slow)  and great atmosphere. 

Either Hearsay - I would recommend... on the Green and this one on Travis!"
5,"Loved everything about this place from the moment we walked in until the time we left, we were well taken care of. Great customer service and wonderful staff. Enjoyed ourselves for a girls get together. We weren&apos;t rushed at all and they even allowed us to stay and finish our drinks after we had already closed our tickets.
Would recommend this place to anyone wanting great food and the best customer service I&apos;ve seen since the pandemic. Everything we ordered was great especially the calamari appetizer, a must try."
5,Thank you to my fellow yellers for their many reviews of this place which is the main reason we came here for dinner.  Walking distance from our hotel I&apos;m always quick to yelp what&apos;s close by and this place caught my eye right away from the pictures and the reviews.  Very quiet personal setting inside with music playing in the background.  Not loud at all but enough sound to where no one can really hear your conversation.  Food was fantastic.  The plating was done well.  Lots of food for your money so good luck having room for dessert.  They also deliver close by.  Definitely bookmark this spot
5,"Love this place. Atmosphere is sexy chic, cocktails by Emily were amazing! Whisky sours made right ;) 
Cassandra was super sweet! 
Food was on point! Will certainly be back!"
5,"So first time in Houston.  Here on business.  Was looking for a good place to eat.

So the wait staff rocked.   Very helpful.  Great recommendations.   Food was very good.  We had a few drinks.  They have some fun creations.

The manager stopped by and chatted with us.   Wet personable.   All in all was a great stop on our trip."
5,Great staff. Great food. Awesome selection. Try this place out. Brunch is really good. Had the Texas omelette with brisket and grits. Whoa! Check this place out.
5,"Our food was absolutely amazing and the manager took such good care of us after a small issue with getting our order sent in on time. 
Highly recommend the bacon wrapped shrimp and grits and the spinach dip.
Ambiance is also adorable upstairs"
4,"A beautiful place!

My friends and I tried this place out for their 3-course $35 HRW dinner, and had a nice time! I had the kung pao shrimp and calamari, the 12 oz pork chop, and the peach bread pudding. The kung pao shrimp and calamari was similar to that of salt toasted shrimp that you get at an Asian restaurant. Since the flavors were familiar, I enjoyed the flavors, especially the jalapeno. One star down though, as my friend who had recently visited them for HRW dinner said that this time around, the portion of the appetizer was smaller than before.

The 12 oz pork chop was large! I definitely had leftovers, and the flavors were tasty! I especially  enjoyed the apple topping and the brussel sprouts alongside it. 

The bread pudding was only ok, nothing to write home about. 

As for the service, it was great! Our waitress was attentive and wore a mask. Would like to return here for drinks!"
5,"I visited Hearsay for brunch on a Saturday afternoon. It wasn&apos;t very busy in the restaurant. We sat on the patio. The service was very good and fairly quick. We ordered a carafe of peach mimosa then my friend got the Jumbo Bacon wrapped Shrimp and Grits, and I ordered the Hearsay Chicken and Waffles. My friend stated the shrimp and grits were very delicious but there is not an option to order them without the bacon. The chicken and waffles was a very large portion but so delicious. Whatever they seasoned the chicken with was the key and it was fried to perfection. The meal came with four pieces of chicken and a huge waffle. More than enough food, even if you&apos;re starving. The bathroom was very clean as well. I would definitely go back if I&apos;m in Houston again."
4,"Staffs are friendly, they were wearing masks the whole time, there are sanitizers at the entrance, I feel safe and cleaning dinning there.  It was actually my first time visiting, looks like the menu has been adjusted, risotto is no longer on the menu.  Highly recommend ceviche as appetizer, and seafood luguini as entree, I do think they make better pasta dishes there.  As for cocktails, they recommended Southwest for life, I loved it!"
5,"The best part of our meal was the service, thank you Ashley for taking the time to treat my boyfriend and I so well! Whenever we come back to visit, she will be the main reason, and then right behind it - the delicious cocktails and food!!!!
One of the best cocktails we&apos;ve had in any bar, we&apos;re already looking forward to our next meal here!!!"
5,"We visited Hearsay Market Square during lunch after many many years of wanting to go there but not actually making it in. The space is beautifully decorated and has its own creative artsy vibe. We made plans to arrive early to ensure that we got a table, since we did not have a reservation.

We dined on:
- Spinach, Jalapeno &amp; Artichoke Dip with both crostini and chips.
- Wagyu Chicken Fried Steak with Brussels sprouts and Rosemary Parmesan Fries
- Baked Stuffed Chicken Breast with Braised Kale &amp; Bacon and Rosemary Parmesan Fries

The food was delicious. I was a bit concerned that it might be dry based on other reviews but it was perfectly prepared and delicious. The waitress was very attentive and delivered excellent service.

The parking itself is kind of sketchy, as in most areas of downtown. So walk over if you can or take an uber. 

I definitely recommend that you try them and will do my best to be back."
5,"Wish I had gotten more photos of this place because it was absolutely stunning! The establishment is much bigger than you&apos;d think, and they even have a section upstairs that makes the ambiance even more elevated-sadly, it wasn&apos;t open when my date and I arrived. Nonetheless, the service was exceptional, and the food was so so tasty! Would love to go again and try a bit of everything on the menu"
5,"Wow this place is amazing! We went on Sunday for brunch.  Had shrimp &amp; grits, so flavourful.  Mimosa was a great addition.  My BF had the Teas Omelet, all so good.  Service was amazing!"
2,"This place drew the importance of having a consistent output. We stopped by as a first-time earlier in the day and were completely satisfied with our burger and steak-salad options. Very much lived up to the name.

Then things went downhill as we returned for dinner (not much was relevant due to the city dine-in closure) and almost hit rock bottom."
3,"Today The experience at Hearsay was good! 
Service- great, to be honest there was not much people so we were treated very well! And we even bring a cake and they gave us silverware and all to cut it.
Noise - not much loud music however the tables are very very close between them so it&apos;s pretty easy to hear other people chatting 
Food and beverage- mimosas were great and they have a very spicy Bloody Mary that&apos;s good too. 
About food all was just good, and unfortunately the short ribs Benedict eggs were overcook and therefore very dry so not good, but the shrimp and grits was amazing as always!! I guess I can be back just for that ...

Overall the price was fair but weirdly  they didn&apos;t have expreso coffee or cream..."
5,"I really enjoyed the food here! Originally the wait tonight was going to be until 9pm, but they squeezed us in since a part wasn&apos;t coming in! Our waiter was friendly too, and helped us pick out our food. Food itself was great!"
4,"Visited Thursday night,
Service was really fast
Food was okay, tasted good but not amazing 
Drink were inconsistent we both order amaretto sour and my boyfriend had a second one, all three of them had different levels of sweetness but they aren&apos;t bad
Music was extremely loud when playing live we definitely couldn&apos;t have a conversation 
Overall the place is really nice for a night out i just could give it 5 stars because everything else didn&apos;t wow me"
5,"Was strolling around downtown Houston and found this recommendation through Yelp. I went on a Monday night so fairly quiet.   I got there and quickly was greeted by a lady and seated rather promptly. A super chill vibe in the restaurant.  They had digital menu from my phone and the server gave me a few recommendations as I looked. Shortly after the lady that seated me came back through to check on me and offered some options as well.  I ended up getting the Porkchop w/ Apple Compote, Bacon Brussel Sprouts, &amp; Smoked Gouda Grits. The whole plate was cooked to perfection!! The lady came back around later, and asked me about my food and made some small talk. Come to find out this was the manager, her name was Lindsey(sp).  Wow what a surprise, and how awesome it was to see a humble leader with a servants heart!! She was working just as hard as everyone else and made the experience wonderful. The actual server, didn&apos;t catch his name, was seemingly working the bar as well but he did awesome as well. One of the best overall experiences I&apos;ve ever had in a restaurant. Thank you Hearsay!!"
5,"Ashlee, our server,  went above and beyond to make our night here absolutely fantastic. My boyfriend cheated death in Iraq on deployment and we were out celebrating his &quot;alive day&quot;. The manager was so sweet to comp our dessert  Wonderful food and even better service."
