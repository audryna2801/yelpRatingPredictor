5,"Huynh has to be one of my all time favorite restaurants!!! 
I love the food so much and always am in a happy mood when I get to eat their food!

What is also great is that my family loves to eat here too! Whenever they come to Houston to visit, they always want to eat at Huynh!

I currently pick up to go orders to support this wonderful local restaurant!

You simply cannot go wrong with anything you order! Some of my favorites are the Duck Salad - a great starter to be shared, their chilled spring rolls with yummy peanut sauce, the vermicelli bowls with protein of your choice, Phoenix crispy Cornish hen, 57A with beef tenderloin &amp; 57B with chicken, 80 with tofu - gosh I could go on &amp; on so many wonderful choices!

PLUS the owners are fabulous and staff are knowledgeable and friendly!

What more can you ask for?

Soooo whether you live in Houston or surrounding areas or are visiting from out of town ADD Huynh restaurant as one of your must eat at places! I promise you will be so happy you did...and secretly thank me too!"
5,"Before the pandemic, it was a crowd pleaser! Dunno how the business is doing now or what their current practices are, but if you can do take-out or delivery -- do it! We live far from this restaurant, but we always love coming here after a ballgame or a show. 

Our fave here is: banh cuon (steamed rice sheet w/ various meats and vegs).

The food dishes are all-around good. Mai&apos;s Restaurant is good too and so is Kim Son; however, I think Huynh&apos;s is a good balance between those other two for taste, quality, variety, and price. 

Service here was also pleasant."
5,"I would most definitely Recommend this place! 
Service: phenomenal service!!! I mean for 1 what great team work, there&apos;s always someone ready to take our order, pick up and switch out our plates, refill our water and take the things out of our way. The server was so informative, confident and gave us some great recommendations, so much I enjoyed a dish I thought I would be skeptical about! Bryan our server was on point the whole journey! Yes I said journey because that&apos;s what it felt like!!! He left us wanting more and we can&apos;t wait to try some of the other mouth watering dishes at our next visit. The whole team was just remarkable!! 

Product: we ordered the Vietnamese eggrolls: we ended up getting 4 orders!!! I loved dipping them into the lemon pepper sauce 
The Phoenix chicken : I was kind of skeptical about it but ended up loving it! The sauce was great the kimchi gave it the perfect compliment!! So good and so pretty 
The shrimp coconut curry : was our absolute favorite!!! Perfect amount of spice, the rice just melted with the sauce and we were so excited to notice the thin noodles on the bottom of the bowl! Would definitely recommend 

Beverage: jasmine tea was beautiful, aromatic and delicious 

Thank you so much for the great recommendations, service and hospitality!! Looking forward to trying the 57 on the menu next time, suggested by Bryan!!!"
5,"The closet Vietnamese restaurant to the Convention Center, MinuteMaid park &amp; Toyota Center downtown Houston. That is well received by critics. Top 21 Vietnamese restaurants in Houston. Top 100 in Houston and so on, I got to check it out..

It&apos;s on a little sketchy part where I had to walk through a police station and a few homeless tents... But it was only 0.3 mile from the Marriott Marquis Houston hotel. 

I waited outside for 15 minutes because they didn&apos;t open till 11 AM. Worth the wait I say!

The American gent was sweeping the front of the restaurant said I could come in to sit and wait first. That was nice of him.

All the Vietnamese servers were kind and very welcoming. My server recommended me the Bún Bò Huê&apos; spicy lemongrass beef &amp; pork leg noodle soup. It was very good. Just enough spicy abs then fragrant of the lemongrass was spot on. Tender beef, coagulated pork blood cake, pork leg all were very good.

Bánh Cuôn Vietnamese dish is made from a thin, wide sheet of steamed fermented, rice batter filled with a mixture of cooked seasoned ground pork, minced wood ear mushroom, and minced shallots. Served with Vietnamese pork sausage, sliced cucumber, basil and steamed bean sprouts, with the dipping sauce which is mixed fish sauce. It was very good as well, I wish the dipping sauce was less salty.

Love their cute decoration, with lots of Buddha &amp; Ông Dia, dimp lighting, quite nice for a typical Viet place.

I really enjoyed my visit and looking to revisit in the future."
5,"I had the pleasure of having food from here for lunch. Tried the duck salad and the short ribs. Both were insanely delicious. If there ever was an award for most refreshing dish of the year, this duck salad would win. I&apos;m not even sure what the 2 sauces or dressings are. I think one is ginger based. But I could literally drink both. Soooo good. Such a simple dish but packs a big punch.  The short ribs were delicious. Sweet, sour, savory...everything. 

Final grade: A
you know a place is good when you already know you will return the very next day."
5,"This is a top vietnamese place and let me tell you why! Vegans and vegetarians rejoice - they&apos;ve got some goodies for you!

This place is BYOB and is a weekend staple for us..... We frequent once a week and the food is always CONSISTENT! For foodies, you know how disapointing it is to have really good crispy tofu one day and then something completely different the next time. 

Soft spring rolls or bonh cuon w fried onions 5/5 they are so soft, tasty and always fresh. Fresh is key with these and they never disappoint 

Cabbage salad no meat 5/5 really really good and tasty w lime dressing. Vegans, make sure you specify vegan for all dishes as this comes w fish sauce

Shaking tofu 10/5 - seriously my favorite shaking tofu ever! It is thin, tasty and almost caramelized. We always order it extra crispy!!

Birds nest 5/5 - so tasty and delicious, order it with some spice if you are daring - you won&apos;t regret it! It is a bed of fried noodles with a gravy with veggies and protein poured on top

Veg fried rice 5/5 - simple, al dente and always yummy! 

As said earlier, make sure you order it vegan to ensure no eggs, fish sauce or oyster sauce.

Enjoy!;"
4,"I had the pleasure of having dinner here about a week ago on a Saturday night. While this restaurant is in a very busy and crowded area with many other restaurants and bars it has its own dedicated parking lot which is nice. From the outside it doesn&apos;t look like much but the interior is quite attractive with an upscale feel to it. I knew that Huynh had a good reputation and expected a fine meal. 

After looking at the menu, I chose two appetizers for my meal that were listed as specialties. The banh uot thit nuong were 2 spring rolls with grilled pork in a special rice paper with meat sauce. Man, were they good? Hell yea! I could have eaten another order of those easily. Oh so soft and tasty. Yum yum. My second choice was the goi vit which consisted of pulled duck with cabbage and herbs in a ginger dipping sauce. It was crisp, tart and light with a taste that I enjoyed. I found it oddly satisfying even though it was something that I wouldn&apos;t typically eat. My drink was iced tea with sugar water as a sweetener that I loved. Table service during the meal was very good. I would happily return to try other menu items as I believe this is a very good restaurant to dine in."
4,This is a really good Vietnamese spot in Eado. The restaurant is set up nicely and the wait staff is very attentive. The food is equally up to par with your typical go to&apos;s like spring rolls and pho but I did not see the common street food favorite like the beef or grilled pork Vietnamese sandwich :( Nevertheless I will give it four out of five due to the delicious food and making a good effort in creating a semi up scale restaurant with decent prices.
5,"Tried this place for dinner on a Monday evening and glad I did. Had the Phoenix Chicken which is actually half of a Cornish Game Hen that came with rice, fried egg, and a salad. Great service, easy parking, and friendly staff. New to the area and will definitely keep this place in my rotation."
5,"This place was shockingly good. I&apos;ve only been here once and had the shaking beef and the banh cuon with everything. The shaking beef was the standout. It&apos;s cooked so perfectly tender and really goes well with the vegetables and bed of salad it comes with. 

Service was great as well and the inside is nicely decorated and clean."
4,"Covid situation, so I picked it up and ate at the hotel.
The soup was hot and delicious, and there was plenty of food. However, there is a shortage of herbs. The price was also cheap. I have a lot of thoughts about using it again."
5,"Bo luc lac - but make it meatless. 

I crave tofu luc lac, like all the time. This meatless version of &quot;shaken beef&quot; has all the flavor, all the spice, all the saltiness and heartiness you need after a long day, after a workout, after night of drinking... it hits all the spots when you&apos;re craving it. Even if you don&apos;t know what your body is craving, just order this dish. 

Huynh has been great about the to-go orders. Just call it in, and it&apos;s ready in 10 minutes - 15 min max."
5,"I took my sister here after a terrible visit to a &quot;Vietnamese&quot; restaurant in Austin and Huynh really redeemed our taste buds.

From the moment we walked in, the service was outstanding. All the servers made sure we were taken care of and I appreciated that - very personable. I also absolutely LOVE the interior design. It has great feng shui and feels homey and authentic :) 

Banh Uot Tom Chay - typical dish and I enjoyed it.
Banh Cuon Tom with fried onions - this really hit the spot, I was craving this!
Mi Quang - very tasty. Slight spice to it. Could&apos;ve probably been a slightly larger portion however it was delicious.

Great, authentic Vietnamese food. 10/10!"

We looked for gems on our last trip to Houston but came up short. Once things settle down we&apos;ll give it another go! 

The Good: The restaurant itself was located near several bars, convenience stores and other restaurants. Looked clean upon entering and we were seated quickly. 

The Bad: We ordered the bun combo which is my usual for a Vietnamese venue. The expectation was some fresh chopped lettuce, a bed of noodles, finely chopped carrot, peanuts, shrimp, pork and egg roll. (I nix the cilantro) At first glance, it looked like everything was right. Unfortunately, the pork tasted oily and a bit off. Not a great quality and not much flavor. The same treatment carried over to the egg roll. It was small and overly saturated with oil. Also, the silantro that I had asked to have left off was included in my plate. A very healthy heaping of it . As a side note, our waitress never came back. (They weren&apos;t busy) but we saw her hanging out and chatting with other servers. We had to find someone to give up chopsticks and then had to find someone else to close us out.

The Aftermath: We were surprised because the reviews were pretty solid here. Most likely because it&apos;s a high foot traffic area. Some of our friends came in later that day to try and left disappointed as well. Aesthetically speaking, the food looks fine but the taste and service just wasn&apos;t there.

5,"Amazing food, and excellent, excellent, excellent service. We were greeted by 2 different people within the first 5 minutes of sitting down to ensure our drinks have been started. Waitstaff here are all friendly and attentive. As a former restaurant manager I always train my waitstaff to pay attention to drink refills, as this is one important aspect of service that they can actually control. My tea and water were always refilled at the halfway point, never needing for me to actually ask for one. As for the food, we had Shrimp &amp; Pork Spring rolls, their weekend special Bit Tet (Steak, Eggs and Viet sausage on a hot skillet) Pho Dac Biet (Special) and Pho Tai. Also, they serve a carafe of simple syrup along with the iced tea which makes it so much easier. Definitely worth the trip!"
3,"I want to start off by saying the customer service was great.  Staff was friendly and efficient!  However, we were disappointed in the food.  We came here based on recommendations from some people we know and yelp rating.

Mi Quang was nothing special and lacked flavor.  The broth is given already in the bowl (some places will give you the broth separately) and there wasn&apos;t much of it.
Pho Dac Biet was okay.  The broth was very average taste.  Like many other reviews have already mentioned, the pho was pricey for its size (at least for the regular size).  There was not a lot of meat compared to many other places.  Also, bo vien (meatballs) is extra charge if you want it (mentioned in the menu).

It&apos;s possible that there are other dishes offered here that will be more delightful than the ones we had.  We may give this place another try (and try their other dishes) but we wouldn&apos;t go out of our way to come here for the Pho or Mi Quang."
5,"We love coming to Huynh! Some of my favorite dishes: 
Chicken or pork spring rolls
Soft rolls
57 (not sure the name but this is the menu number) beef or chicken with green peppers, onions and jalapeño slices with house rice (this is amazing!!)
I could eat the house rice alone all day!!
Vermicelli 
Rice plates 
Coconut curry shrimp!
Lemonade 
Flan!
Vietnamese coffee!!!

Yes, I love a lot of their food! Do yourself a favor and stop by for some delicious food!"
5,"Haven&apos;t had a single thing I don&apos;t love! Since COVID, I get everything to-go and the food travels well (thanks to great packaging). Staff are very friendly, back in the pre-COVID days, the owner would always ask us how we were doing and offered delicious suggestions when I couldn&apos;t decide. The menu is extensive! 

Try the avocado coffee after your meal, you won&apos;t regret it!"
5,"Dining at Huynh Restaurant on a cold &amp; rainy weeknight was a great way to improve our attitude towards the day.
We were lucky to have Brian as our waitperson. He&apos;s been with the restaurant for 12 years and can recommend appetizers and entrees that will want you to come back over and over.
If you can, order to share style so everyone can have a little bit of everything.
Definitely order the cups of pho&apos; or chicken broth soups. They are only a dollar and a nice add-on to the meal.
The beef tenderloin on the family style dishes was superb. The meat was so tender and flavorful.
The chicken and thin egg noodles was very tasty. Next time I think I&apos;ll try the wide noodles or the crispy noodle version.
The veggie fried rice was a safe entree to order. It definitely went fast.

The clincher was the restaurant is byob. They only charge $2.50 for each person to drink wine. And that&apos;s not per bottle.

I&apos;ll definitely be back soon!"
2,They were rude. I walked in to pick up my takeout and the wait staff just stared at me like I was wearing a big bird outfit. Nobody greeted me there was no signage telling us where pick up orders are to be picked up from. It wasn&apos;t until I walked around the corner to start helping myself did anyone feel obliged to serve me as a customer. Food was ok. Not coming back.
