5,"A few of my friends were in town and wanted to catch up over dinner, so we decided to come to Luigi&apos;s. They are operating during the pandemic and have their outdoor seating open (indoor seating closed).

The staff was friendly and food came out quick. They have a big menu that includes everything from pizza to pasta to salad. I ordered a slice of margherita and mexicana pizza which I thoroughly enjoyed! They were bigger than my face and with ample toppings. I am a huge fan of thin and crispy crust and this hit the spot. My friends also ordered fries, mozzarella sticks, and alfredo pasta which were good, but not what this place is known for. I can see Luigi&apos;s being really busy during lunch and dinner hours when not in a pandemic. I would definitely come here again to try their other slices!"
5,Moved into the neighborhood a few months ago and this place is practically within walking distance. Get a large cheese weekly and it&apos;s always delicious! Staff is nice and food is good what more could you ask for ‚Äç
5,The Chicken Parmesan sandwich was outstanding! Delivery was timely. Will order again for sure. May try their pizza next. Ordered via DoorDash.
5,"Luigi&apos;s is our go to spot for a slice of pizza in Houston! We have been here a few times now and have yet to have a bad experience.

This time we tried the caprese, which I really enjoyed. It came with fresh tomatoes, buffalo-style mozzarella, &amp; basil. The last time I remember my favorite slice being the margarita! You can&apos;t go wrong with either choice. If you are in a cheesy mood, I would go with the caprese since it has the mozzarella.

I finally tried their gelato, and it lived up to my expectations! It was super creamy which I really liked. The flavor we ordered wasn&apos;t labeled but had both chocolate &amp; caramel in it.

I can&apos;t wait to come back again for more pizza and gelato sometime soon!"
1,"Please we let the whole pizza in garbage 
Total waste if time , frozen is better digerno 
Not worth writing about it"
4,"Tonight I ordered a Supreme Pizza, after giving them my credit card number 7 times, they stated they were able to get it entered into their system. I sent my house guest to pick up the pizza (it was ordered under his name). Upon arrival they stated the pizza was not paid for so my house guest called me and I checked my bank statement, it showed it had charged it for $18.93. I sent a screen shot of it to my house guest so he could present it to the staff. The staff stated that it did not match the cost of the pizza and would have to pay again for the pizza. My house guest called me at home and put me on the phone with John (Luigi&apos;s staff/manager). John stated the amount charged to me did not match the cost of the pizza and I would have to pay again. I asked him to refund the $ 18.93 that had posted to my bank account. John stated he could not do that. I asked to talk to the owner or someone else, he stated if I wanted I could come in tomorrow and talk to someone working I could. I asked who I should talk to and he was silent on the phone. 

Currently, Luigi&apos;s charged me  $18.93 for a pizza that they refused to give me, without paying a second time for it at a price he quoted somewhere around $23.xx and when I asked for the refund of the $18.93, John refused. 

There was no one to escalate to and no one with the ability/know how to assist with resolving. My advice is to skip this place. My time invested in this pizza already exceeds 2 hours. This is one neighborhood restaurant that is not interested in taking care of their customers.

This is a follow up to my first review above.  I went into see the owner today. After speaking with her and sharing my experience and frustration the night previous, she was very friendly and provided a full refund and offered to provide me with a pizza. I accepted both (and provided a tip to the crew making the pizza). The pizza was great, the service recovery was spectacular and I am most pleased with the result. The only thing I would encourage them to do is to provide the necessary training and escalation process for the team to follow when the owner is not there to help resolve the issue.  I will order here again in the future. : )"
5,"Luigi&apos;s was great! Stopped by for a couple slices &amp; some pasta. My girlfriend &amp; I both got a slice of the Caprese pizza. Very large NY Style slices. Nice flop with a nice crunch in the crust as well. I also got a small bowl of chicken alfredo which was very good too! Can&apos;t say enough about the guy who took our order &amp; served us, he went above &amp; beyond!! The seating is pretty limited inside so we had to go outside, he immediately followed us out &amp; set up a fresh tank of propane &amp; heater next to our table. I love good service!"
4,"Not bad.

I love the huge slices. 
Three slices took up an entire half pizza pie. 

The pizza itself is a bit on the thinner side.
Which makes the pizza too soft.

But the flavors are there. Sauce. Good. Cheese good. Size good.

Not bad."
1,"We tried Luigi&apos;s against our better judgement on an evening a group of us happened to all be craving pizza. The place did seem reasonably busy  ( but not slammed) which we took as a positive sign. We ordered a large pepperoni to dine in. We were given a buzzer device that would let us know when the pie was ready.

So we waited. And waited. And waited. We weren&apos;t sure if the patio area outside the place was part of it or the adjoining establishments, but after some time spent there we wandered back over to the tables that afforded us a view of the counter. Finally after *45 minutes*, our pizza came out. And......It was lukewarm and lousy. Mediocre ingredients to say the least. This was not good pizza.

We were so disappointed with the experience, we drove somewhere else and finally had excellent pizza that evening."
4,"Luigi is the place to go if you&apos;re in need of a quick fix for a solid pizza. Large slices, thin crust, and a variety of toppings. It&apos;s also conveniently next to Axelrad so you can grab drinks after!

Only thing is parking can be a little inconvenient when things get busy, but there&apos;s street parking and you can even park a street away and just walk over."
2,"This place although unclaimed is at best 2 stars. How this place holds onto 4 stars is bafflingly.

1. 45min wait.
2. Dog feces.
3. Cardboard pizza.

There was nothing redeeming about any of the experience.

It took way too long for mediocre pizza that in all honesty, you can get frozen.

I&apos;m sad."
4,"This restaurant is still operating during the COVID-19 pandemic with take out, delivery, and patio seating. 

I was in Houston for a business trip and decided to visit some friends and eat here for dinner. The staff is friendly and offers fast service. The food is reasonably priced so it won&apos;t hurt your wallet, which is a plus! I ordered the mozzarella sticks, chicken Alfredo, and Margherita pizza. The mozzarella sticks were pretty standard. Nothing to rave about. The chicken Alfredo comes with breadsticks and a side salad or fries, I chose the side salad. The chicken Alfredo dish was bland and the bread sticks remind me of the ones from Olive Garden, which aren&apos;t my favorite, but I know many people do like those types of breadsticks. The pizza was amazing! You can order pizza by the slice or a whole pie. I wanted to try other things from the menu so I opted for a slice, but I wish I ordered more! The slices are massive, have a crispy crust, and a generous amount of toppings, basically everything you&apos;d want in a pizza!

If I ever go back to Houston, I&apos;ll pay this place a visit again, but I&apos;ll stick to ordering the pizza!"
4,"2020 Update:: the pizza is incredibly delicious! My pizza was perfectly cooked yesterday- not burnt at all. But, the pizza wasn&apos;t hot and steamy. I couldn&apos;t understand why my pizza and wings didn&apos;t come out hot out the oven. The temperature of my food is extremely important. The gelato is delicious too!

The flavor of the pizza is fantastic! Remember to ask for extra cheese because they don&apos;t put eThis time I went the pizza crust was a little burnt, which I didn&apos;t like either. I ate abt 4 slices of pizza but was still hungry."
4,"Solid pizza, good folks in the kitchen, good crowd, really nice servers.  They run out of ingredients on Sunday, so get your order in early."
5,"This pizza was piping hot, bomb af, and totally shareable. The seating area is quite small but I loved the beer garden right outside! Don&apos;t forget to try the gelato-- it is surprisingly delicious! I am super thankful for the friendly staff here at Luigis and will definitely be coming back sometime soon!"
5,"Can you ask for anything more then hammocks, pizza, beer and live music?  Absolutely not! Especially on a Thursday night after work.
 Huddled right next to Axelrad, this pizza joint is simply one that you cannot come across just anywhere. This little gem definitely has its own personality. And I think you all can vouch that you love little mom and pop places with personalities. 
 You can grab a couple of slices, go next door to Axelrad and enjoy a beer watching live music.  Axelrad also has movie nights so keep an eye out! Great date idea.  The 2 negatives I found were the fact that the pizza was so thin and, of course, parking. Other than that take a chance and go on out!"
5,We always order Luigi&apos;s when we go to Axle&apos;s bar and it is a great mix the pizza is always so good. It&apos;s the perfect touch with our drinks!
5,"Luigi&apos;s Pizzeria exceeded my expectations , if I could give them 10 stars I would.

Hands down top 2 pizza places in Texas I&apos;ve been too , the other one being Dinos in Fort Worth.

I&apos;ll definitely be back for more no doubt."
3,"I must have forgot to do this review. My sister said it was her favorite pizza in Houston. I mean it was alright. We drove all the way from deep northwest to try it and it was subpar at best. Maybe we caught them on an off day. We got a large pepperoni. I mean it was decent but it wasn&apos;t just the best thing ever. I will probably go back and give them a second shot. The dining area is tiny! 

This may be one that you should get delivered or get it to go as the dining area is tiny. 

We will give them another shot and maybe I&apos;ll update the review if they impress. We were expecting the best Pizza ever. My sister swears by it. It&apos;s her favorite pizza. Again maybe we caught them on an off day. I look forward to trying them again and see if we get different results."
5,"Their cheese pizza is the closest thing to a NY slice of pizza that I&apos;ve had in Houston, (which is the best kind of slice!) and for that reason, this is one of my favorite pizza places in Houston. Their pepperoni pizza and margherita pizzas are also delicious! Added bonus is that they&apos;re right near Axelrad, where you can enjoy a huge outdoor area, listen to live music, and grab a refreshing beer! They also offer gelato options. If you&apos;re ordering a pie, you may have to wait a little longer, especially on a weekend night as it does tend to get busy-- but totally worth it!"
