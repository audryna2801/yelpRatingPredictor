Recently they opened a second location in San Antonio. This is Texas BBQ done right. You cannot order wrong here, everything is of superb quality and cooked to perfection. Of course we have our favorites, but we have tried everything on the menu. They have picnic tables inside and a large patio outside. They also offer a full bar. 

Our Typical Order:
Brisket (must order! most excellent!)
Jalapeño Cheese Sausage 
Pork Ribs
Smoked Turkey on a jalapeño cheddar bun (my fave )
South Texas Beans
Mac &amp; Cheese 


Pro-tip: $1 beers on THURSDAYS. Make sure and take advantage of this cool weather and enjoy some awesome BBQ and beer on their patio! 

Closed Mondays and Tuesdays."
5,"This place is SO amazing. I came here around 2:30PM on a Friday and there was just a couple of people ahead of me. The line went really fast because people knew exactly what they wanted and the food was already made. You just had to order it and they had to cut off a piece for you. 

Parking was easy. The tiny lot was completely full but there were plenty of street parking all around. They do not leave any door or windows open and due to COVID, I was worried about the how closely the benches were placed and the level of airflow so I ordered to-go instead of eating there. 

I got their 1lb of the glazed Pork Ribs, 2 slices of their fatty Prime Brisket, potato salad, coleslaw, and mac &amp; cheese. The sides were just okay. Out of all the sides, the mac &amp; cheese was the best but that&apos;s not saying much. The real winners were the meats and the sauces that came with them. 

Make sure to get EXTRA sauce - double what they usually give you.  I love both of their sauces so I can&apos;t tell you which one you should get, but I&apos;d get double of both. The Pork Ribs were INCREDIBLE - sweet, melts off the bone, and does not need sauce with it. The Prime Brisket is good but even better with their sauces."
5,My first time to have Southern style bbq because I&apos;ve never been able to find a place that serves halal meat.  This was so good. They do a good job of keeping the beef separate from the pork. Love the sauce and the coleslaw too.  Potato salad and rice were just ok in our opinion. Totally worth it. I also love that they have an outdoor patio dining option.
5,"Scenario, ordered online here from Pearland, plans to pick it up and head to sisters to eat it.  As I am near downtown on 45 traffic jam...its houston its expected, no biggie.  Then while pushing through traffic phone rings, its mom.  Apparently she had locked her keys in the trunk while at the store in Pearland.  Here I had to make a decision Pinkerton&apos;s or be the noble son and turn around at the next exit and go pick her up.  
I&apos;d have to say after trying this brisket I made the right decision, I mean she was at the store for hours anyways...a few extra minutes shouldn&apos;t been an issue, but i did skip heading to the sisters. 

This brisket is amazing...loved every bit of it.  It&apos;s the juiciness and taste of the brisket for me."
4,"Good.
Bbq. 
Sauce.

Good meat.
Limited offer later in the day.

Will come back to get more!!!"
5,"Amazing, absolutely the best.

I am a HUGE bbq fan, and I have high standards LOL

The brisket is so soft, you barely need to use your fork to cut it! Great Smokey flavor. The ribs are fall off the bone and seasoned perfectly. Hot link was awesome. Mac was awesome. 


Just come here, it&apos;s great"
4,"My boyfriend and I brought our friends who were visiting from Toronto here to try Texas BBQ for the first time and they absolutely loved it ! We ordered the Ribs, Brisket, Slaw, Mac &amp; Cheese, Beans and the Jalapeño Cheese Rice ! 

Brisket - super flavourful and a must order
Ribs - seasoned well and tasty
Slaw - one of my favourite sides, refreshing and light
Mac &amp; Cheese - generous amount of cheese 
Beans - good but nothing special 
Jalapeño Cheese Rice - wasn&apos;t bad but wasn&apos;t great, wouldn&apos;t order again 

P.S Make sure to get lots of extra sauce on the side, their sauces are to die for and goes with everything !"
5,"This BBQ joint is really local. Honestly, the best ribs we&apos;ve ever had! You can order the meats by the pound. They have a lot of interesting sides - we tried the code coselaw and duck jambalaya."
4,"It&apos;s rare for me to find a BBQ restaurant that really wows me, but Pinkerton&apos;s Barbecue is on the list of my top BBQ restaurants in Houston! 
The glazed pork ribs here are to die for! The meat practically falls off the bone, and the sweet glaze is the perfect touch. Moist brisket is always a must for barbecue, the moist brisket here is so tender and flavorful. So the meat = 10/10 for me 
But I also judge a BBQ place by their sides, and the sides here are just OK. I tried their Mac and cheese and potato salad. They were good but nothing too out of the ordinary. 

I came on a Sunday morning right before they opened at 11, and there was already a small line forming at the door. Nothing too crazy though! Aside from the line, there was not a problem finding seating and social distancing while dining in."
5,"As of right now this is my favorite BBQ place in Houston. This place is a bit pricey. I tried their brisket, boudin, turkey, mac &amp; cheese, potato salad, and jalapeno cheese rice. Everything was tasty!

The good
The brisket was tender and moist! Everywhere else I have tried BBQ in Houston their brisket has been dry. The mac &amp; cheese wasn&apos;t excessively rich and their were pieces of bacon or brisket in it. I couldn&apos;t tell which. The turkey was smoked well. Their BBQ sauce was sweet and smokey. The potato salad was really good, they did something different to it but I can&apos;t remember what now haha (I should really write these as soon as I eat the food but here I am 2 weeks later).

The bad
My biggest issue here is the pricing. I spent about $50 and for me it was about 1 meals worth of food (to be fair I do eat like a savage). The turkey was on the salty side. The boudin was good, but nothing exceptional. I could have bought one from the grocery store and grilled it for the same quality. The jalapeno cheese rice was a bit bland and for me the calories wouldn&apos;t be worth it.

To me the Salt Lick in Austin is the GOAT of BBQ. The next time I crave BBQ in Houston I will definitely be ordering from here. If I was richer I would be ordering here more often but due to their pricing I wouldn&apos;t eat here as much as I&apos;d like to."
5,"Still thinking about this bbq trip from 3 months ago.
It&apos;s that good. Cute place, atmosphere and nice staff. Will be back!"
5,"Pinkertons was suggested to me as a MUST go to BBQ in Houston. So I had to make sure to fall through when I was in the city. I can say that this place is worth the hype and I really enjoyed my visit. 

I end up getting the beef ribs, Mac and cheese, and potato salad. This was my first time ever getting beef ribs, so I was in for a treat. The rib was enormous. But it was really good. I loved the bark on the outside, it was packed with so much flavor, and was super juicy. The mac and cheese was good but it was just ok. The potato salad was good too, but still nothing out of this world. I kind of was hoping the sides would be good enough to match the meat, but still it was solid. I liked the sauces too. I always feel like the sauce is a big part of any BBQ place so I&apos;m glad that they were really good. 

Another thing I really liked about Pinkertons was how friendly and helpful the staff was and how good the customer service was. From the greeting until I left I felt like there was an outstanding amount of great customer service. Workers were making sure I had exactly what I needed and were very helpful.

I can say a lot more but at the same time there isn&apos;t much more to say. This place is very good. And i&apos;d recommend anyone here. Especially if you are coming from out of town like I was. The Texas BBQ hype is real and Pinkertons is a good example."
3,"Although this plate of BBQ looks delicious, looks can be quite deceiving. The place is nice, there&apos;s a full bar which is not what you normally see at a bbq place so that&apos;s a nice touch. They sell their meats by the lb so it can get a lil pricey. The brisket was not as moist or flavorful as you&apos;d expect from typical bbq joints within their price range. The bbq sauce was good though. I had glazed ribs, the glaze was sweet and tasty but the ribs weren&apos;t really &quot;fall apart&quot;. The potato salad was standard mustard potato salad with bits of celery in it. The service was fine, the patio is spacious. It was an ok experience. Don&apos;t think I&apos;ll return."
4,"I had to have BBQ before flying back 
Stoped at Pinkerton after getting good feedback 
They know what they are doing 
Everything was very good 
The highlight was the Brisket- melt in your mouth 
Really suggest to check this place! 
Next time I will try the lean brisket"
5,The sides were a little bland but still tasty. The meats were incredible. Overall pretty expensive but worth it occasionally!
5,"Out. Of. Control. Definitely the best beef rib I&apos;ve had! Adding to my death row meal. Steaming, juicy, tender, fall off the bone! The bbq sauce is out of this world, sweet but still full bodied. Go early! An hour after I ate they were out of beef ribs! Come and eat it! I sat at the bar after and tried the bartenders recommendation, ranch water which I kept calling desert water. New name idea?! Tequila, topo chico, candied jalapeños and lime juice. So good! Love that it was served in the topo chico bottle. Bartender so knowledgeable and really friendly. Has tons of rare liquor! Don&apos;t wait, go and eat!"
5,"Best BBQ in the Heights without question.  We have never had a bad meal at Pinkertons and we have eaten here probably 30 times since they have opened.

The brisket is perfectly smoked and fat rendered so nicely. My favorite thing they have besides the brisket and burnt ends would have to be the jalepeno cheese sausage. Literally this is the best sausage I have ever had and I will stop in mid afternoon when there are no lines just to grab a few links for a late lunch or just an afternoon snack.  It literally is that good.

Also fond of their turkey, pulled pork and ribs.  I personally try and stay away from carbs and their pulled pork is dry as their turkey.  When I want some sugar their candied ribs are through the roof as well, my wife loves them.

Sides are on point. The duck jambalaya, cheesy rice and Mac and cheese are our favorites. The kids love the Mac and cheese.

Save room for dessert, the cobbler is also amazing and you can grab a blue bell ice cream cup out of the freezer at the beginning of the line.  They also have a bread pudding that ranks up their too but when I come to Pinkertons and want something sweet, the cobbler always ends up on my tray.

Give them a try, you won&apos;t be disappointed"
5,"Hands down some of the Best BBQ I&apos;ve had so far and it&apos;s Halal so that&apos;s a huge plus. I&apos;ve been to a lot of places in Houston for BBQ such as Brisket House, Pit Room, Truth, Rudy&apos;s, etc. and while many of those places are good; Pinkerton&apos;s is on another level. 
I highly recommend their Coleslaw &amp; Potato salad for your sides if you don&apos;t eat pork as their other sides do have pork. 
I do wish they had some baked Mac &amp; Cheese without pork &amp; maybe some sweet potatoes as other options with regards to their sides but you won&apos;t be disappointed with any of the food here. 

If it wasn&apos;t so far from where I live I&apos;d definitely be eating there at least once a week. 

Wether you live in Houston or you&apos;re just visiting definitely make this your first BBQ stop; you won&apos;t regret it. They have a lot of BBQ spots in Houston but very few of them even come close to Pinkerton&apos;s."
3,"I went to this place because I&apos;d seen all the beautiful photos of people&apos;s bbq trays with the brisket, bread and the most important side dish -- Macaroni &amp; Cheese. I want to be clear, I came here primarily to see what that Mac n cheese was talking about. 

Sadly, when he scooped my Mac and cheese, I noticed pink pieces of meat in it and when I asked about it, he told me that there was pork in the dish. . I don&apos;t eat pork so I had to settle for potato salad since the beans also had pork in the recipe. I also ordered lean brisket, and bread pudding for dessert. 

All in all, I got one small side, dessert, and about four slices of brisket (it had fat on it and I&apos;m used to having no fat when I ask for lean) and my total was $25. Kinda pricey but I guess that&apos;s about normal for BBQ but I&apos;m used to paying less at Rudy&apos;s, my favorite bbq place. The meat was cool and the potato salad was average. I wish I had the option to get more bbq sauce in my to go order. I didn&apos;t take photos of my food (my bad y&apos;all!) but I did capture the bread putting. It had blueberry and cream cheese on it and was pretty good, very sweet tho. 

Please note that my review of the food is in direct comparison to what I normally order at Rudy&apos;s. I 100% prefer the taste of Rudy&apos;s over this place but I would come back to Pinkerton&apos;s if someone else was paying."
4,"After reading all the reviews about this being the best in Houston I had high expectations.....

The expectations did not match what I received....

I still gave this 4 stars as in California where I&apos;m from this is still leaps and bounds better than anything around back home...

But after having killens BBQ a few days before which I&apos;m my opinion is the best in Houston and way better than Pinkertons...

This place is also a bit pricey... what I recieved in my picture was $53.00.  I felt what I got was wort about 25 bucks max... sausage was okay.... expected much better... Brisket was great and ribs where just okay...."
