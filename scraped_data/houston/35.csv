This is a magnificient Mexican restaurant. I learned about this place&apos;s chef, Hugo Ortega and his James Beard Awards. This isn&apos;t just any kind of Mexican food, it&apos;s more of a seafood focusing on wild Mexican flavors. 
We went for brunch, and started off with the raw oysters, which were gulf oysters. I wish I had gotten the wood roasted oysters instead. Once I walked in, and saw how they were roasting them on a sort of converted wood fired pizza oven, I wish I had gotten them served that way! Next time... 
I got a chili relleno, which was fantastic. I really enjoy the dish, it&apos;s more of a showcase of the poblano pepper than seafood, and I wish I had gotten more seafood! My brunch partner got ahi tuna, and had obviously out ordered me. 
But I nailed it for dessert- we got El Coco- an orb made of chocolate, filled with more chocolately goodness. It came with a hammer to smash open the chocolate. I&apos;d never had to smash my dessert before. 
The drinks were great too- I got a tequila drink made with Tabasco soda, which was sort of like a paloma blanca. It wasn&apos;t Tabasco like the sauce, more like the state of Mexico. 
The restaurant was fantastic- I scored a table out on their patio which felt safe and everything. They did a great job with keeping us hydrated and the service was fantastic. I absolutely enjoyed checking out Chef Hugo&apos;s food. You can get his cookbook from the public library."
5,"Beautiful outdoor patio that is ideal for brunch. Definitely a see &amp; be seen type of place. Inside is clean &amp; modern, but at this time of year, the patio is perfect. 

Service is focused on the presentation factor. They make a point of presenting the food in a good way. 

I went a couple of weeks ago for brunch. I had the fish tacos &amp; a couple of margarita. My friend had the ceviche &amp; a side. The drinks are a little more creative than the typical margaritas in town. The fish tacos were nicely done. We skipped dessert but the presentation of the churros &amp; hot chocolate is impressive."
5,We came here for brunch and did the houston restaurant week. Wow! Watermelon soup was delish! Very flavorful and cool as we sat outside on patio in hot weather. We had our second course - I had the vegetarian option from HRW and it was so tasty! The third course was the French toast with cinnamon ice cream with cherries. It was so delicious I couldn&apos;t finish it all. We also got the guava mimosas carafe! Don&apos;t forget to hydrate with water. It&apos;s great and covid safe! Make reservations to sit outside and enjoy your meal!!  They also have a veg menu!
5,"Amazing vibe
One of the best restaurants in houston
Selection of adult beverages and quality of food is fantastic"
1,"Where do I begin...I am still shocked as to how the night ended. Let alone the follow up. let me tell you though...ITS TOTALLY WORTH A READ.

THE GOOD:  To start the ambiance of the restaurant was great. The server was excellent.  That was about the only good thing. Drinks were just mediocre. 

The BAD: Stone crab we ordered was sour. It was comped. Fresh lobster..unimpressive. Ordered a salad. Excellent. Ordered 2 entree&apos;s in a rush bc they told us that they were closing. We ordered the ribeye steak and the scallop entree&apos;s with a side of brussels. We confirmed medium rare would be a warm RED center. Entrees come out. Steak MED WELL on the WELL side. Told the server we were disappointed, but had understood it would be impossible to fix because they were &quot;closed&quot;.  We had plenty to drink so at that point we were getting close to full bc we did want to get desserts. So we asked the server to wrap everything to go.  Mind you. We didn&apos;t even get to the over cooked ribeye or brussels. Not one bite.  Ordered our desserts which were amazing and decided to close out. They explained the stoNe crab and steak were comped, which was a nice gesture. Left the restaurant.  Next morning I am sitting through the fridge and to my surprise, neither entree&apos;s or side dish were in the to go bag. 

THE WORST: I decided to call the restaurant to speak to a manager about my missing to go food. His name is James. He mentioned that he was the manager last night who addressed my concern yesterday about the crab and steak. I told him that I&apos;m missing the entree&apos;s that &quot;I ordered&quot;. He told me &quot;you didn&apos;t tell the server you were done?&quot; In my mind I&apos;m thinking....&quot;well why do you think I&apos;m calling?&quot; But no I said. &quot;No we were done bc we wanted to get desserts&quot; he said. &quot;well you didn&apos;t pay for the steak bc I comped it&quot; lol interesting response. I said &quot;look as much as I appreciated that it didnt mean I didn&apos;t want to take it home. Let alone the other stuff in which I had paid for. One comped entree doesn&apos;t make up for throwing the rest of my food away&quot; he said &quot;well let me talk to the server to see what he says.&quot; Confusing. I asked &quot;what does the servers opinion have to do with my reality of not getting my to go food?&quot; He said &quot;because he&apos;s a professional and he wouldn&apos;t just throw it away&quot;....can you see where I&apos;m going here?? Back n forth this manager refused to believe me &quot;the guest&quot; that we had wanted our food packed up and insisted that the server would the deciding factor. Unbelievable. He could have mad ethe solution super easy. Give us a refund. Heck we would be take the same 2 entree&apos;s as a carryout! I&apos;m sure the cost is low on their part rather a refund. But nope. I asked to speak to the GM and he coldishly just gave me a generic email which led to nowhere. 

CONCLUSION: I hope your night goes better than mine. It&apos;s a huge difference when a privately owned restaurant group handles guests and complaints. So take caution. Apparently servers have the final say or dictating whether to save a guest or not. I am blown away by the managers lack-of professional decision ability that I will gladly without hesitation avoid all Hugo&apos;s restaurants. I can get over subpar food. But being treated like I&apos;m not important is something I won&apos;t stand for. Making me worth less than their &quot;cost of 2 entree&apos;s&quot; is demoralizing.

If Caracol is reading this, please feel free to reach out. We are waiting."
4,"I&apos;m giving 4 stars for ambiance, location, service &amp; drinks. Other than that I was not overly impressed with the food I ordered. Maybe I ordered the wrong items? I don&apos;t know because it appears as though most people were very satisfied with their meals here. I&apos;ll try it 1 more time due to the reasons I gave it 4 stars &amp; hopefully be able to update this review with good foods noted"
4,"Interior decor is very nice and fancy, great ambiance. We truly enjoyed every single dish we ordered: 
The wood-grilled butterflied fish is so perfectly cooked: buttery, tender and flavorful. Great portion too. 
The oysters were great to share! 
And the Mariscos al Ajillo is very uniquely seasoned with everything in there: scallops, frog legs, lobster, abalone, clams, mussels, octopus, shrimp etc. 

The only reason I&apos;m not giving them a 5 star is the service. It started out really good, but then it went down gradually as our server found out we weren&apos;t going to order drinks and desserts, and the attitude was very obvious. We understand the reasons, but we still would like to be treated as valued customers regardless and we still tip well."
5,"My boyfriend and I went on a date here and we absolutely loved it!! We started out with the Ostiones Asados (wood-grilled oysters). We only ordered 6 of them just to try but they were so good that we could&apos;ve easily ordered 24 and made those the bulk of our meal. Then for our entrees we got the Robalo con Mole Amarillo and the Mariscos al Ajillo. The mole on the fish was rich and flavorful, and I wanted to dip everything in it! I&apos;m also glad we got to try so many different types of seafood (mussels, clams, abalone, scallop, lobster, octopus, frog leg, shrimp) all in the Mariscos al Ajillo. This was one of our more expensive date nights but it was so worth it. We want to come back and try other dishes!"
5,"This was a very nice dinner spot! I went during restaurant week and was pleasantly surprised. I&apos;ve always heard good things about this restaurant but I finally got to try it. I&apos;m not a huge fan of oysters, I prefer cooked oysters, but these oysters were amazing! I only wish they served more.
I ordered the catch of the day, I can&apos;t remember what fish it was, it wasn&apos;t familiar to me, but it was tasty! The portion size was on the smaller side, but it did come with a bowl of rice.

I would definitely love to check it out again!"
5,"We want here for our anniversary during houston restaurant weeks and it was spectacular! Their happy hour is a great deal, we got the dozen raw oysters which were smooth and fresh. Highly recommend! 

The service was on point, just enough care and space. I highly recommend the meats here, we had both the ribs and the pork shank were both cooked extremely well and  fall off the bone. 

For dessert, they were accommodating with my diet restrictions (no gluten or dairy) and had a great sorbet. My husband got the churro and he said they were the best he has had in his life!"
3,"You. Know. I jus wasn&apos;t impressed. 
Looked amazing.

Ambiance. Very nice.

Playing beautiful.

Service amazing.

Food. Jus didn&apos;t hit like it should have. 

I enjoyed it. But I couldn&apos;t rave about it.

Things felt so..... Eh... Nothing popped! Nothing screamed!  No fire works . 

I didn&apos;t feel the depth . I should have felt new flavors developing as I chewed. I should have felt the development as the meals went on."
5,"I love trying new restaurants , and this one was at the top of my list. We made reservations and when we got there we were seated right away.

The restaurant is beautiful and the service was fantastic. We decided to order numerous appetizers instead of a single meal in order to try as much food as possible. 

All the food was well prepared, fresh, and delicious . 

The only thing that wasn&apos;t good was the water down sangria, but other than that this was a great place!"

Updating my review because of the new menu item (Braised Short Rib) that is only available on the restaurant week menu!

It&apos;s served with a plantain stuff with fresh cheese from Oaxaca, on a bed of mole and side of Brussels sprouts.
I ordered it a la carte (as the staff was so generous to let me) and so I got 2 plantains but I noticed that those who went with the HRW only got one plantain. 

The taste rating for this dish is 5 out of 5! To give you an idea of just how tender the rib is, I ate the entire meal with just my fork and never once used a knife. The savory mole and the sweet and creamy plantain work together so well for a balanced experience of flavors.

Luckily, HRW has been extended till the end of the month. If you&apos;re wondering what is the dish to try and happen to be a omnivore, then this review is here to recommend the Braised Short Rib dish."
5,"Our HRW Experience at Caracol was absolutely fantastic! My husband was a bit resistant to my desire to dine at Caracol so I ended up making a reservation and just telling him we were going to dinner!  Even he said as we were leaving that it was probably one of his favorite dining experiences to-date!

Our Waiter was incredibly accommodating and so friendly. I ordered the &quot;Between The Waves&quot; menu but expressed some regret to him that the Wood-Fired Oysters were not included. Voila! With a wave of his fingers and some negotiating he was able to comp us 3 to try! (With the caveat that my husband HAD to try a bite as we had mentioned that he had a strong aversion to shellfish )

We found all the flavor combinations to be unique and they kept our palates on our toes. The entrees were cooked well and were juicy and well-seasoned. And the desserts were equally as unique. We will certainly have to visit again ."
5,"Amazing experience. Dinner was excellent we started with the CEVICHE DE CHILE CANARIO and CAMPECHANA ESTILO D.F. both were delicious the CANARIO was my favorite I wanted to lick the bowl! For dinner I had the MARISCOS AL AJILLO
sautéed scallop, shrimp, lobster, abalone, clams, mussels, octopus, frog legs, garlic, quelites, chile de árbol, avocado-tomatillo salsa, and let me just say it was amazing this dish alone would be a reason to return to try more. Highly recommend for the adventurous eater who isn&apos;t afraid to go for someone different. The drinks and wine selection were equally on point."
5,"Higher end coastal Mexican cuisine. If you love Mexican food and seafood, definitely check this place out! Service is fantastic and the food/drinks were wonderful. Will definitely come back!"
4,"We recently came here for anniversary dinner and thought the food was delicious! The vegetarian menu has so many options, which is hard to find at more classy restaurants. A friend who recently came here complained about the seafood smell but when we came for dinner there was no such smell. It smelled more smoky. 
The ambience was very classy and romantic and we dressed up for a candelit dinner. 

For appetizers, we had both the guac/salsa/tortilla chips as well as the vegetarian quesadilla. We requested a spicy sauce with the nacho chips. It was very spicy habenero sauce! Not for the weak! For entrees, it was hard to pick just two. Everything looked good. We ordered deconstructed enchilada and tamal azteca. The deconstructed enchilada had a slight bitter taste and I liked the tamal azteca more. I thought the tamal azteca was delicious, although needed a little bit of sauce. We had enough for leftovers the next day. 

Drinks were tasty as well, just the right amount of balance of flavor with alcohol. We ordered the Blackberry mojito and oaxacan whiskey sour.

However, service could have been better. As we let them know when we made our reservation that we were celebrating an anniversary dinner, we knew that we were going to get a complimentary dessert. However, our waiter made it seem that we could pick anything off the dessert menu and it would be complimentary. We were excited to try the El Coco and requested it. We were then given both the El Coco and a complimentary flan dessert that said &quot;Happy Anniversary on the plate.&quot; And we saw that the El Coco had been added to the bill at the end of our meal. In the end our waiter ended up removing it from the bill after initially denying that he had said it was complimentary. He also seemed a little distracted throughout the meal. That being said, if you&apos;re wanting a dessert with your meal, highly recommend the El Coco. It&apos;s a chocolate shell with a cream filling that you smash with a hammer.  

This restaurant is part of a group of classy Houston restaurants owned by the same owner (Hugo&apos;s, Caracol, Xochi, and Backstreet Cafe). I appreciate that all locations have vegetarian menus. We&apos;ve been to all but Xochi and have to say that Caracol has been the best so far with more unique and flavorful vegetarian options. 

TIP: They validate garage parking at the front counter. The garage is large."
5,"Last week, this was one of the restaurants that our friends recommended and we gave it a try. It was special because I hadn&apos;t seen my sorority little sister and her husband in a very long time. Excited to catch up with them and excited to have great food. The ambiance is surely upscale!

This place definitely didn&apos;t disappoint. We had white wine to go with the meal. I had read about the wood-roasted oysters (ostiones asados) so we got that and campechana estilo D.F. which had shrimp, crab, octopus, Mexico City-style to start the meal off. 
For the entree, I had the callo de hacha which is pan-seared scallops. Cooked perfectly! It didn&apos;t look like a huge portion but as I ate, it surely was very filling. As they say, looks can be deceiving! My friend had the sopa de tamalayota/pumpkin soup and it looked very creamy. She also got the lechuguita orejona which was a beautifully plated salad. My husband and her husband both had the grilled red snapper (I can&apos;t remember the Spanish name of the dish). They both thoroughly enjoyed every bite!

Highly recommend!"
5,Hugo knows how to do it! Fancy Mexican seafood and has a great brunch on Sundays that is a must try!!! So many great traditional Mexican dishes. Take any visitors from up north to show them food they can truly only get here
5,Great dining experience amidst covid! I ordered from the &quot;TAMAL AZTECA CON HONGOS Y HUITLACOCHE&quot; (vegetarian menu) it was amazing!
