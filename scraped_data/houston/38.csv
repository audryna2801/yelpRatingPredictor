5,"Fast casual service that is my favorite
 lunch take out place for a simple sandwich, pho, or rice dish to go in Midtown. Lots of good options on menu including Vietnamese coffee. The food is delicious and well presented. They call the ticket number for your order. Some items are out of stock during that day so it is good to have a back up option to order.

I wish that they enforced social distancing and capacity limits during the crowded lunch rush hour of 11AM and 2PM.  There is a lot of space to social distance inside at least."
5,"Came here for lunch during COVID-19 and ordered the 1), 2) 3), 5) and Vietnamese coffee for two people. The staff was taking great precautions and the service was fast. All the banh mi sandwiches came out hot and delicious and the coffee was one of the better ones I&apos;ve had around Houston. We were absolutely stuffed and had tons of leftovers."
5,"I ordered like a 100 sandwiches and they just never disappoint. The best Vietnamese sandwiches...fight me.  No I&apos;m kidding don&apos;t fight me, I&apos;m wimpy. But seriously, even during COVID-19 shutdowns, they&apos;re here to feed us. I&apos;m looking forward to coming back for a big fat bowl of Pho."

Amazing Vietnamese Sandwiches! Growing up in Little Saigon in Orange Country, CA, having Vietnamese cultured parents and grandparents, I can totally vouch for good Vietnamese food! This place definitely meets traditional Vietnamese standards. The wait is long, the place does not look nice nor clean, and it looks like it was built in the 1970s. Do we care? Of course not as long as it tastes good.  Come here..."
1,"Disappointed. I was craving banh mi and was debating between this place or Thien An...guess I made the wrong choice.
My dac biet was lacking...lacking meat, lacking mayo, lacking veggies (cilantro was wilting and not fresh). I know times are tough BC of COVID but it shouldn&apos;t be this bad. I&apos;ve had plenty of takeout from other places that still kept their quality.

Also no spring rolls :("
5,"Yoooooo, this place is so clutch. great food, great portion size even better prices, give this place a chance they deserve your money."
4,"I&apos;ve been coming here for a while for super cheap Vietnamese food and mainly get their banh mi. Over the years, the price has gone up a bit which is understandable. However, I recently got their combo and bbq banh mi and was a bit disappointed. Combo is my favorite flavor but it lacked flavor. It looked delicious since the sandwich was colorful and packed ingredients but the pickled vegetables didn&apos;t seem pickled enough and the meat tasted very bland. I was honestly very surprised because I have loved their sandwiches before. Maybe an off day I&apos;m not sure I&apos;ll have to try again. The BBQ tasted pretty good. But yeah... a bit disappointed this time but still good food for good value. I will try the combo sandwich again next time. As always, the egg rolls are amazing!"
4,"Tl;dr: Not the best banh mi I&apos;ve ever had, but good for the price. 

I was craving a banh mi post-exam so I made the drive into midtown to check out Les Givral&apos;s. I arrived a few minutes before opening and already there was a line of 4, eager for lunch!

The restaurant is currently set up for take out only. Some seats available for waiting, spaced a healthy distance apart. The shop is pretty big so there&apos;s plenty of room to avoid being in close proximity to others while you wait for your food. 

+++ #1 Chargrilled BBQ Pork with Pate (3.5 stars): A pretty decent banh mi but an exceptional value lunch. For $3.25 the sandwich comes with a healthy amount of meaty BBQ pork that&apos;s a little sweet. I wish the sandwich had more pate and mayonnaise, though. Also, I wish my sandwich had been assembled a little more carefully for better distribution of the herbs and pickles throughout the sandwich. The baguette had a nice crusty exterior with soft interior. Again, not the best banh mi I&apos;ve ever had, but you can&apos;t argue with that price point!

+++ Cha Gio (Imperial Rolls) (3 stars): The flavor of these reminded me exactly of the ones I had in Vietnam-- yum! But my mediocre rating reflects the amount of salt these suckers had. I probably consumed 3x my daily salt intake with these rolls... the saltiness soon became overbearing on the flavor. Maybe I just had a bad batch... I&apos;d be willing to try them again.

Service was friendly and it took me about 10ish minutes to receive my order after placing. I think though, that&apos;s just because I ordered a hot food. I observed others receiving their sandwiches much more quickly!"
5,Incredible food and you can&apos;t beat the price!! Would eat here every day lol but wow $2.50 for a sandwich that&apos;s awesome. Go here!
4,Now I don&apos;t know what made me even look up bahn mi to step into this little paradise. Whatever the reason I&apos;m glad I did. This was the best $3 sandwich I&apos;ve ever had! Loved the simplicity of the ingredients but still very flavorful and a variety of options to choose from; meat or no meat. The vegetables were all fresh with a good crunch and the bread was delish. Since it was my first time the employees were quick to help me out and give me some recommendations. I will for sure be back and it may or may not be tomorrow lol.
5,"Mannn name a resteraunt that will give you Banh Mi for $3. Les Givrals is truly a hidden gem not talked about. Such affordable food in such an amazing part of Houston, Midtown. I always thought that the nicer the location, the higher the prices tend to usually be. This spot broke that trend and surpasses my expectations. The bread is crispy, the meat is flavorful and the size is more than enough. I wish I got a pic but I ate it all before I even remembered."
4,"PURCHASED: bánh mì xíu mi--meatball on french bread ($3.50) + bò kho w/ egg noodles stew--tender beef stew  ($6.50) + cà phê sa đá--traditional Vietnamese ice coffee ($3.50)
TOTAL: $15.00 w/tax and tip

PROS:
+ authentic Vietnamese food: There are many Vietnamese restaurants located in Midtown Houston. These are: (A) Les Givral&apos;s, (B) Pho Saigon--don&apos;t go, taste has gone down hill, (C) Thien An Sandwiches--I would totally go here. This spot is a good spot. (However, please see below). 

CONS:
- line out the door: Les Givral&apos;s is most famous for their fair fare and delicious traditional Vietnamese dishes. In particular, it is known for its Banh Mi. However, it is also known for its long lines. While dining in today (late-December 2019) the line was out the door from the time we were in line until the time I had to unbutton my pants after being thoroughly stuffed after the meal. 

IMPRESSION:
Last time I was here was 2 years ago. The taste is great, the fare is fair, and the line is long; there has been no changes since that time. Excellent choice. If you&apos;re looking for another place since you&apos;ve been to this spot in Midtown too much, try Thien An just a few blocks away (please see my review for more information)."
5,"To make a sandwich this cheap takes some BALLS
Like getting in barrel and going over the FALLS
But whether you like 2-Pac or Biggie SMALLS
You&apos;ll f**king love the Banh Mi at LES GIVRAL&apos;S

Come here at the end of Midtown Bar CRAWLS
Drive here from the suburbs of Houston&apos;s Urban SPRAWLS
Just walk the rest of the way if your car STALLS
You have to get a Banh Mi at LES GIVRAL&apos;S

The bathroom&apos;s kinda gross if nature CALLS
But if you wanna f*** in there, it has thick WALLS
(speaking from experience)
LG&apos;s 100 times better than the food in MALLS
So come and get a Banh Mi at LES GIVRAL&apos;S

WHAT

One of the best Banh Mi sandwiches you will ever eat in your life. Houston is a city packed with Vietnamese gems... some call it the heart of North America&apos;s Viet population and cuisine. Les Giv is the Aorta of that heart. I know what you&apos;re thinking, being an Oxford man, aorta have come up with a better metaphor. But I&apos;m not very meta really. If you&apos;re meta, my question to you: what are you meta for?

What to get: Sandwich, Viet Iced Coffee
What not to get: Rabies from getting bitten by a Muskrat

I love lays (not the potato chip), but I love Les just as much (as in, Givral&apos;s).

Service here is anywhere from average to really poor, and they no longer have free tap water and will charge you for their cheap purified bottled water - but their sandwiches remain dirt cheap and large and stuffed with meat and veggies and overloaded with butter (which we usually don&apos;t get because it&apos;s so unhealthy), and the bread is almost always great and the meats are amazing - especially the chicken for the gym and the pork for taste. Either way you can&apos;t go wrong with these perfect Banh Mi sandwiches.

I&apos;m trying to come up with words to describe how good they are. &quot;Giv&quot; me just a little more time? And my vocabulary will surely grow? As Boy George famously said... Giv me time? If you have a sandwich from here, would you &quot;Giv&quot; a little bit, Giv a little bit of your sandwich to me?

Plus their Vietnamese iced coffee is far and away the best anywhere near downtown or Midtown - although it doesn&apos;t compare to the stuff over at Lee&apos;s - but it&apos;s still really good. There&apos;s not much of it in there though, so enjoy it while you can.

Spring rolls are good if they&apos;re fresh, like early in the day, then Barbie really likes them. I&apos;ve never gotten into their soups because I don&apos;t love Vietnamese soup, but if you do then you&apos;ll probably love these ones too.

It&apos;s not clean in here, and the bathrooms are pretty gross, but there&apos;s a lot of attractive Midtown people coming in and you&apos;ll have a great meal and a great time - and it will cost you next to nothing. Even though officially you can&apos;t do it, they&apos;ve never been weird about me bringing water in here - or me eating outside food combined with my inside food, because this is usually my stop right after the gym and after lifting I have to eat chicken.

All in all it&apos;s the best Banh Mi sandwich in Greater Houston, although there is very stiff competition from several others, we&apos;ve been coming here for years, and we will keep coming here hopefully for many years.

While Tapioca Place, Nguyen Ngo and Webster&apos;s Spring Roll Express all make some of the best BM sandwiches in the country, all in the Houston area, which is infamous for perfect Vietnamese cuisine from the enormous Viet population here - nothing quite compares to the sandwich made by LG.

And I don&apos;t mean LG phones, which are, well, crap."
5,"BUY THE WHOLE MENU

Cannot believe this place, food is unbelievably well priced as well as tasty!

Banh mi bread is nice and crispy, loaded with whatever meat you decide. 
Vermicelli is delicious as well as well portioned, the grilled pork is my favorite.
They have a variety of eggrolls and springs rolls for you to choose from.

During their lunch and morning hours they get super packed! This place is very popular and I see why! Two people can get a supersized lunch here for under $15."
5,"Stopped in for some spring rolls &amp; egg rolls. 
The egg rolls are delicious. 
I bought a lot so he could have some for lunch tomorrow. 
20 egg rolls, 2(2) bbq pork spring rolls. 
Talk about good. 

Wish they were not so far from home.

Return=heck yeah!!!!! 

I did look at their hours; the are now closed on the weekend."
5,"Wow this spot is insane !!! The food is soo good and the price!! Got the #2 pork Banh mi with egg.
That was amazing so tasty !
The pho soup was great too.

Their ice coffee is strong

Price was like $3.50 for one entire sandwich!!!
What?!
We got our food within 7 minutes too!


The tables at first were smelly like wet rags but eventually got better"
5,"The banh mis and the VIET COFFEE, ugh so good!!!  Very good price too, they should make more locations!"
4,"In a small several-block strip of Midtown lies Les Givral&apos;s and other Vietnamese/Chinese restaurants. There isn&apos;t much to do around here but eat and drink, but if that&apos;s all you need, this is the restaurant for you.

My roommates and I came in after Imelda had passed, too tired to cook and too weary to drive far from our home. We got banh mi, pho tai (brisket), spring rolls and com tam thit nuong (rice with grilled pork). The banh mi was done before the three of us had even finished paying for our meals. Everything else came out within five minutes.

The portion of rice to meat is massive -- there was plenty for me to take home and reheat the next day. What I didn&apos;t like, though, was that the rice was overcooked and mushy, making for a mound of blandness. I found myself having to pair each bite of rice with meat, rather than using rice to chase down intense grill and marinade flavors. I&apos;d opt for the banh mi or pho instead, which my roommates found delicious.

The spring rolls are made and packaged for sale early, so by the time I got mine, the rice paper wrapper had hardened and the lettuce was losing its crunch. You&apos;ll need a lot of sauce to get through this one. But they are true to what a goi cuon should be, packed with cooked shrimp or pork for a filling and healthy appetizer.

Just a note: it&apos;s confusing that you fetch your spring roll appetizers on one side of the restaurant and find water and utensils on the other, but the food is delivered to you. Make sure you know where to go for what before you scoop up a table.

I&apos;d give Les Givral&apos;s a 3.5-star rating, rounded down because the dishes aren&apos;t stellar. But it is affordable, fast, and friendly, and that you can&apos;t pass up when you&apos;re in need of quick comfort food."
1,"Worst Com Thit I&apos;ve ever had. It was so dry, the texture was like beef jerky. The dumplings tasted like the frozen ones from any grocery store. Lesson learned. I&apos;ll stick to Pho Saigon."
5,"If you want Vietnamese food quickly, cheap, and absolutely delicious this is definitely the spot for you. Might be one of the best charred pork plates i&apos;ve ever had. I&apos;d be here everyday if it was for downtown traffic."
