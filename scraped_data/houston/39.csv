5,"All I can say is, I was SO full from dinner here last night and even felt the aftermath this morning. But as I write this, I am still dreaming about the Nancy cakes. Goodness gracious. It was PERFECT. Even my husband who is not huge on carbs (yeah, he&apos;s weird), devoured the 2 cakes. Call me basic, but it was my favorite thing we ordered.

We went in for my husband&apos;s birthday and everything was perfect. Absolutely loved the atmosphere, the candles, and the fact they took social distancing very seriously. 

Other than the fabulous Nancy cakes, we also ordered:
-Buckwheat casarecce: braised duck ragu pasta. GREAT flavors. Quite heavy so the portion was perfect.
-The famous cheeseburger + fries: I loved that the bun was thin and different from other burgers. It was good but would&apos;ve enjoyed it more if we weren&apos;t already too full from the appetizers (Nancy cakes..). The toum that came with the fries was totally on my level. GARLIC bomb. Amazing.
-Chicken back: Crispy, sweet, and limey. It was a good appetizer.
-Sirloin tip: This was for the hubs. Again, i think i would&apos;ve enjoyed the flavor more if this was the first thing i tasted. We had to take this as a leftover bc..i mean.. we ordered a LOT for 2 people.
-Goat cheese ice cream with mulled wine and rice puffs: I honestly got this for the rice puffs (Im big on carbs...can you tell?). It was really good! Perfect portion after a BIG meal. It wasn&apos;t too sweet. 

Drinks wise, we got an old fashioned and dream kitchen. Both were good but the dream kitchen was phenomenal.

Overall, we cannot WAIT to go back!"
5,"Had dinner here for the first time last night and I must say the food dining experience was everything the ambiance low lighting and the social distance seating was on point. My order consisted of dirty grey goose martinis, pancake appetizer along with the dumplings both were so delicious and my main entree was the Lamb Tartare followed by their infamous chocolate mousse dessert which was like no other mousse I have ever eaten it was to die . I can&apos;t wait to come back to try their cheeseburger that was on the menu."
5,"My husband and I came to Nancy&apos;s Hustle on a whim on a Sunday afternoon and we love this place! The ambiance is romantic, they had lit candles, and the decor is amazing. It is better for a romantic date rather than a large dinner with friends. There are a few outdoor tables, but not a nice outdoor patio area.

*Nancy Cakes - 5/5
*Lamb Tartare - 5/5 I usually think lamb can taste gamey but the toasted almonds and the aioli really made this dish. I&apos;m surprised because I&apos;m not a fan of nuts.
*Scallops - 5/5 The crunch! And the flavor! Yummmmmm.

Overall, this restaurant is a 5/5. Ambiance, specialty drinks, flavors (omg, the flavors!!!), and combinations in the entrees. The hostess was awesome and so was our waiter, Zack. 

We will definitely be back!"
3,"I wanted to like this place as I was recommended by a friend- but it&apos;s a solid 3 from me. 

I will say that the highlight of my meal was the duck dumplings and the beef n&apos;duja. The dumplings are so crispy and hold a lot of juice inside! 

Maybe it&apos;s what we chose to order but a lot of the other dishes had a flavor profile that was too similar. I would definitely not get the mackerel because it was under-seasoned. The wood grilled chicken is decent but I expected more from it. Ricotta gnocchi was just okay. I&apos;m aware that maybe I would have a different opinion if I tried some of the other popular dishes but this review is based off my first experience only."
4,"Second time around in here after over a year. Always hard to get a decent weekend reservation time unless you book well in advance, but we lucked out this time!
Love that they rotate their menu- keeps things fresh and exciting. Everything except the Nancy cakes seemed different to me. 
There was nothing I didn&apos;t like, but surprisingly the chicken was my favourite dish of the night. Perfectly juicy and the best combination of flavours with the fennel aioli and onions in the dish."
5,"Can I just say this food left me full and sad I couldn&apos;t eat more. We have the Crispy Duck Dumplings, Nancy Cakes and one of the pastas with braised duck. The duck dumplings were DELICIOUS. Tangy and sweet and the duck melted in your mouth. The Nancy cakes were very light and cooked perfectly with the butter was a combination unmatched. Cannot wait to go back and enjoy it all again!"
5,"I finally got to try Nancy&apos;s for the first time this past weekend for my birthday. They were really great when it came to social distancing and everyone wearing masks. 
Their menu is so unique and I was told that it does change frequently which makes it even better. I ordered the nancy cake&apos;s which were AMAZING!! I still dream about those things. I also ordered the sourdough bread, pasta, red snapper, and also the dumplings. 
I had 2 drinks there which I do not remember the name but overall everything was freaking delicious. We had to make reservations about 2-3 weeks in advance in order to get the time we did on a Friday holiday evening. 
Overall, I cannot wait to be back and I really recommend trying this place if you get the chance!!"
5,"Definitely worth the wait! My husband and I were greeted at the door and taken to our table. Our waiter Robert greeted us quickly! We got two cocktails- the Matador! They were strong and delicious! 
We started off with the lamb dumplings and the Nancy cakes. Both were so full of flavor and unique! Next we had the lamb tartare. Also delicious, however, there were quite a few nuts inside of the lamb tartare and it was served with seeded naan - which made it a little overly crunchy! 
Finally, we had the pasta paired with the sourdough bread. Excellent flavor! Overall my husband and I left very happy! For the quality and uniqueness of food along with the excellent service, we will definitely be back again!"
5,"Absolutely love the atmosphere and the food. 
We got the lamb dumpling, Nancy cakes, chocolate mousse, gnocchi. Everything came out hot and delicious and we would strongly recommend the Nancy cakes. Great option for date night."
5,"Always a pleasure being here!! Their food and drinks are amazing. I tried their new rendition of the lamb dumplings, which kind of tasted like a potsticker. I prefer their lamb dumplings imo. The beef dumplings seemed heavier. The Nancy cakes were wonderful as always! We ordered the chicken as our main and it was perfectly cooked! Delicious and flavorful. It tasted of grilled &amp; smoky chicken, sweet caramelized onions, lemon, and herbs *chefs kisses*. Glad to see them operating again."
5,"I&apos;ve been dying Nancy&apos;s Hustle for a long time! Finally came here for my birthday with family and we were able to try several plates. **4.5 stars despite some undercooked chicken. 

COVID: Reservation only, very cautious. Tables are spaced, servers minimize contact, and distance themselves. Hand sanitizer available at each table.

Nancy cakes: Pillowly soft and perfectly griddled. The smoked trout roe was amazing.

Crispy duck dumplings: Very tasty, the dumpling skirt adds a nice crunch. Loved the house fermented cabbage 

Chicken back snacks: Not much meat since it&apos;s the back but the &quot;chicken oysters&quot; are always a treat. Good flavor. 

Wood grilled chicken: I loved the flavors. Seasoned beautifully with lemon and sumac, aioli was great. My only qualm was that the tenderloin of the breast was definitely undercooked. 

Chickpea dal: I love dal and the labneh and crispy garlic were perfect. But the coconut paratha, OMG. Mind blowingly good. Buttery, flaky, soft, and the coconut flavor came through just enough. 

Grilled merguez sausage and squid: lovely spiced, tender sausage and the lemon aioli and squid were great

Desserts

Pear cake: It came with a hibiscus ginger sorbet that had the perfect flavor but on the icy side. The pear cake was a lovely fluffy texture and the pear came through very well. The creme anglais added a lovely creamy element that was not overly sweet. 

Chocolate mousse: I&apos;m not usually a chocolate dessert person but this was my favorite dessert! I loved the texture of the soft mochi and crunchy, candied peanuts. The best part was how *salty* the mousse was. Salted, rich chocolate is the best!

Hawaiian vacation sundae: This was ok, coconut sorbet had a great flavor but veryyy icy texture. Could have done without root beer granita. The candied cashews were the best part. 

Also had a cocktail, the sloe gin fizz. Pretty good"
5,"Had a great time here with some friends recently after planning to come for awhile. Tried a lot of different things on the menu, shared family style, took waitress&apos;s recs, and we ate every bite of each plate. Portions were a bit small in some cases and it was kind of hard to figure how much we should order. They also ran out of the chicken which we were planning on ordering, so that was a bummer. We enjoyed ourselves a lot and would consider going back (maybe if I wasn&apos;t too hungry lol.) A gem for sure"
5,"Yes I&apos;m the person that never shuts up about this burger because it&apos;s truly THAT GOOD. English muffin + burger, didn&apos;t know I needed that in my life but it truly maintains the shape of the burger so well. The beef is so freakin juicy and the waiter recommended that I get it smash burger style (like Shake Shack) and it was so incredibly flavorful. Gotta get some extra sauce on the side! I don&apos;t particularly love the Nancy cakes, but their dumplings are always fantastic. The previous time I came, I had their Lamb dumplings and this time they had crispy Duck dumplings - both awesome. Also their chickpea Dahl with a COCONUT paratha ? Who woulda thought! Also a dish that defied my expectations. They do a great job of keeping tables around 6 ft apart during Covid so extra kudos for that."
5,We just really like this place!  The Nancy Cakes are to die for!  Small and sexy ....just like we like it!
5,"Went to Nancy&apos;s Hustle for my 4th anniversary. It was maybe the best all around meal I&apos;ve had in Houston. Great service, divine food, and a cute somewhat kitschy dining room. I had heard the food was good and that&apos;s why we came and it was nice to still be surprised by how good it is. I won&apos;t rehash how good the cakes are, etc etc, but I will make a point to recommend the duck dumplings. I am not even usually a fan of duck and it was one of the best things I&apos;ve ever eaten. This place is special and deserves your attention."
5,"My husband and I have been waiting for Nancy&apos;s to re-open for dine in service and they did not disappoint.  It would not be a stretch to say it&apos;s the best meal out we have had since Quarantine began.  

Started out with some delicious cocktails, Sloe Gin Fizz for the hubby and the Blinker for myself.  Cocktails were very well balanced and the foam on the Sloe Gin Fizz was velvety and substantial.  We ordered the Fried Chicken Back Snack to start the meal and it might be the tastiest chicken we have had in a long time.  I told my hubby that I might come back and order 2 plates of the Chicken Back Snack for a meal next time we are back at Nancy&apos;s.  

For the main course,  my hubby decided on the Grilled Duck Breast and I went with the Grilled Sirloin Tip.  Both entrees were very well prepared and delicious.   The duck fat sticky rice and blistered peppers were extremely tasty even though they were only accompaniment to the main course."
5,"TLDR: Casual upscale dining with delicious offerings that are worth the wait! Hustle on over and give them a go. 

Overall Rating: 8.6/10
Lamb tartare: 8.6/10 lovely textures! Clean, bright, and delicious. 
Egg w/ Sunchoke: 8.5/10 wonderfully seasoned and balanced. 
Duck Sausage: 8.7/10 loved how well this was executed! The sausage had a great snap and a was everything you want in a good sausage. The accompanying veg was the perfect pairing and had a lovely flavor profile to compliment the richness. 
Roasted Chicken: 8.4/10 I usually never order chicken, but I&apos;ll admit this was one of the better chicken dishes I&apos;ve had in recent memory. 
Service: 8.7/10 personable, knowledgeable, and seamless. 

My experience at Nancy&apos;s Hustle was memorable. SOLID dishes all around. That&apos;s hard to do. There truly wasn&apos;t anything I didn&apos;t enjoy. From the greeting to the farewell, the server was on top of things. Both in her descriptions of the dishes and the timing of service. The food was definitely a highlight. Execution and flavor profiles were on point. I was truly impressed."
5,"We went to Nancy&apos;s Hustle for dinner on the recommendation of a friend, and it was the greatest time.  The most memorable meal that I&apos;ve had in Houston for a while and I dine out frequently.   The menu is brilliant, the service is so friendly and the food is excellent!  What more can you ask for?

Fabulous option for couples or dinner with friends.  So glad that Nancy&apos;s Hustle is back and open again after the shutdown!"
5,"There&apos;s a reason this place is hard to get a reservation for days ahead of time. Easy 5 star. Great service (truly top notch), great food, great ambiance, great drinks, and actually pretty reasonably priced for how flavorful and interesting the food is.

We went for a birthday celebration. We got the off menu salad, the roasted beets, the brussel sprouts and the snapper. I&apos;m not usually a fan of cooked fish and surprisingly I loved the snapper. The brussel sprouts and beets were great too. And the salad was unusually saltly and yogurty and delicious.

The waitress was a pleasure. Easy going, knew the intricacies of the menu (what was gf, drink recommendations to pair with food, what foods to pair with each other, etc), and was a good mix of attentive while giving us plenty of privacy.

I&apos;ll be back."
5,"Arguably a contender for Houston&apos;s best restaurant. This place has a chef with the kind of magic, that has people eating caviar with miniature hotcake, and cultured butter. 

As Nancy&apos;s menu changes, guests get the opportunity to try out new dishes regularly, and the restaurant&apos;s knack for inventive creations leads to never-ending possibilities.  Unfortunately, it leads to losing favorites, like the crab pasta, which was one of my favorite dishes in Houston history."
