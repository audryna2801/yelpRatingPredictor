5,"Wow, crunchy chicken sandwich add bacon-- where have you been all my life?  This is really delicious.. Comes on a pretzel bun which is warm and has just the right balance of hardness to it. Flavor is really good and overall pretty healthy and not too heavy. 

My review here is for delivery service. Its pretty consistent and fast. Ordering online via apps pretty straight forward. Sandwich comes with two sides. I also tried their carrot cupcake and that was pretty good too. On the healthier side, but still a good flavor (perhaps like a muffin)."
5,"One of the yummiest and healthiest meals I&apos;ve had in Houston. I ordered online for pick up and everything was ready in about 20 min. 

The salad I got had so many flavors and was filling. My husband said that it&apos;s the best egg salad sandwich he&apos;s ever had. We also tried both vegan soups and they did not disappoint. The space is large and has both patio and indoor seating. I also thought it was cool that they sell speciality foods and drink to take home with you."
5,"It was my first visit and the lady taking my order was helpful in sharing some of her favorites. I decided on the avocado BLT; and chose the kale salad and house made chips(great seasoning)for sides. The sides were pretty good but the sandwich was really amazing. Get extra napkins because it is overflowing with ingredients and great flavor! 

This spot is adorable, small and intimate inside, but has outdoor seating in the front and back. Social distancing was fairly easy on a Saturday afternoon, the environment is quiet and inviting for a nice meal. Parking is close, free, and easy. The restaurant and bathrooms are clean and you can tell they put thought into the decor, which isn&apos;t necessary but always a nice touch!"
4,"Local foods is the bomb!!!! is an accurate description of Local foods!. Their fruit is absolutely delicious and I enjoy it every-time I go there! Everything is fresh, and they have really nice deals on their items. 

You&apos;ll think that the food will be really expensive, but they are not, they are really fresh, and I don&apos;t have a hard time finding anything that I need. Everything is organic, and everything is made to eat immediately."
3,"Go for some of the food and great service 

Be forewarned that the homemade chips have no Old Bay Seasoning as advertised...very disappointed 

The homemade Pickles do and are really good"
5,"Wow this place was delicious!  I don&apos;t remember it being so good but they knocked it out of the park with the posole, crunchy chicken sandwich, and garden sammie. Had a Hispanic coworker try the posole and she said the flavors were spot on. Everyone liked their crunchy chicken sandwich. The garden Sammie was the surprise of the day. It was so flavorful and the bread was perfect. I&apos;m so happy with this vegan item."
5,Highly highly recommend the garden sammie - absolutely perfection!! Husband got the chicken sandwich and loved it! Their prices are great foe the quality and quantity of food. Highly recommend!!
4,"Picked up lunch from here on a warm Wednesday afternoon. The online ordering process was very seamless and straightforward. They&apos;re doing some construction right now but there&apos;s a dedicated pickup zone. They provide utensils upon request which I also found convenient. I got the Garden Sammie with chips and potato salad and my friend got the Avocado BLT. As someone who isn&apos;t vegetarian or vegan, I wasn&apos;t expecting too much from the Garden Sammie. However, it was absolutely delicious. The portion is very generous and I recommend getting it on the pretzel bun instead of the ciabatta. I think meat-eaters would equally enjoy it. The only downside for me, as a college student, is the price. Two sandwiches without drinks came out to $30 after taxes and tip. It&apos;s great if you have the budget, but it&apos;s more of an occasional splurge otherwise."
5,"After a long long time of lockdown , am back to this on of my fav food stop in town. 
Masks mandatory, they had a pop up store of fresh vegetables in a basket for $30.

With local stores just about opening up, there was hardly any crowd when we reached- maybe because we were there at 10.30, almost exactly when the store opens. 

We friends met up at Herman Park, walked 6 feet apart with masks on and went to Local Foods totally hungry- with no patience to eat at home we just made a table of the trunk of the car and ate right there - still maintaining the 6 feet distance - It was just funny but fun !
We got the vegan meatball sub which was like a quinoa falafel bruger, the garden sammie  and the truffled egg salad - which we made into a sandwich. The sides to go with them were chips, kale salad, pumpkin seed salad, red potato salad, and a couple of strawberries for dessert . Phew! Got the whole list I hope. So glad that the food was exactly the way I remembered it to be- fresh, tasty, not too hot or dry- just right.

Am coming back !"
4,"Solid spot that serves &quot;healthy&quot; food options with fresh ingredients. In the era of COVID, the indoor dining area has been transformed into a pop-up market with lots of fresh locally sourced produce and other cool items like alternative meat products. I&apos;ve always appreciated the atmosphere and overall values of this establishment and they&apos;ve managed to continue to stay true to that through these unprecedented times.

Dining open outdoors on the patio. Hand sanitizer available. Plentiful parking in shared lot with neighboring establishments."
5,"I tried the seasonal sandwich consisting of Roasted Chicken, Brie, Provolone, Arugula, Cranberries and toasted on wheat bread. It was such a great sandwich and I especially loved the chicken. The Red Skin Potato salad was yummy too! I ordered and paid online and it was ready when I walked in. Easy peasy!"
5,"Such a cute spot! Love the energy, food and finds. Supports small businesses which is such a huge plus! This spot is also very unique with food options, you won&apos;t find one like it! Amazing job y&apos;all! Also very welcoming. (:"
5,"Pretty good! We got the Crispy Chicken Sandwich, Quinoa Burger, Harvest Salad, and Salmon Salad. My favorite was the salmon salad - the maple glaze was terrific and the salad was very filling. The vinaigrette was also very good. Will be coming back here sometime! I also love the mini grocery store in the shop."
5,"Takeout was so easy and fast! Friendly service. Got the truffled egg salad sandwich with potato salad, orange, and cranberry lemonade. Liked everything; very filling yet not heavy. Good place to go to for good food without the guilt.

I&apos;ve tried the crispy chicken sandwich and house chips recently.  I liked the sandwich, but it wasn&apos;t what I imagined, if you know what I mean. The house chips were crispy, and I was given more than I would have needed. Overall, I still prefer the truffled egg sandwich combo I got before, but I&apos;d love to continue to explore the menu."
4,"Fun sandwich and salad place. My favorite thing to get here is the garden sammie with ciabatta bread. There&apos;s brussels sprouts and cauliflower, and you can pay extra to add some chicken. You can also have the garden sammie as a salad which I&apos;ve tried before.

The crunchy chicken sandwich is a crowd favorite here, but I felt that it was somewhat overrated. Definitely prefer the garden sammie for sure.

The sides here are not as fresh as the ones at Mendocino Farms so I think I&apos;d prefer there to here, but Local Foods is definitely a solid option!"
5,"Did a takeout during COVID-19 and Local Foods still tastes amazing as always. Got seafood crab sandwich with kale salad and red potato salad. A little bit pricey but worth the tag!! (Strawberries mine)

The inside of the store turned into a grocery store, and it&apos;s SO fun to spend time there looking at a wide selection of items available, but beware as it&apos;s also very expensive. They&apos;re trying to pay rent and stay afloat, I guess."
4,"Best salad ever! I ordinarily do not order a salad but I was just feeling the salad love on my visit. I was not disappointed. It was beautiful and tasted fresh and good.

Avocado, cucumber, tomatoes,shredded chicken,boiled egg and so much crumbliest bacon ever. The mustard dressing was very good and although I would usually use an oil and vinegar, the mustard was a nice change.

The lettuce was fixed in a chopped California style which I really loved. I mean nobody likes getting a big stalky hard piece of lettuce in their salad which so many restaurants give you, which I never understand. This probably was the most perfect BIG salad I have ever ordered. I could not finish the lettuce parts, but I did fish out all of the goodies and were they delightful. This place is vegan friendly but for others you can also find something on the menu for your tastes as well. Even if you are not a salad fan you may love their salads. They have more than 1 to choose from."
5,One of my favorite spots for lunch. Healthy sandwiches with an outdoor area where you can bring your pets as well.
5,"I love Local Foods! I ordered the Garden Sammie with pasta salad and the Tuscan kale, and it was delicious. The whole meal was extremely satisfying, but it didn&apos;t feel heavy in my stomach afterwards. The ciabatta bread was so well baked and was super fluffy on the inside. Very well seasoned and tasty!! The overall ambience of the restaurant is super welcoming and rustic."
5,Love this place. I hope only for the best for this restaurant.
