4,"After a great afternoon at the museum with my sis, we opted to eat a late brunch at Empire Cafe. I haven&apos;t been here in awhile, but I remembered how much I enjoyed their food and coffee drinks. We wanted to sit outdoors on their patio, but there were too many people eating outside. So, we ordered our food and coffee as takeout and ate in our car. 

Since we missed their cutoff time for brunch on a weekday, we ordered their all day breakfast build your own omelette option. You can pick up to four items to go into your omelette. I chose cheddar cheese, crimini mushrooms, red onions, and bacon. My sis chose cheddar cheese, crimini mushrooms, spinach, and sausage. We both enjoyed our omelettes, although mine was a bit dry. Next time, I&apos;ll swap out the red onions for spinach for added moisture. We both loved the fried potatoes as our side dish. They were crispy, flavorful, and well seasoned. We also loved their almond joy latte drink. The almond and chocolate syrups went so well with the espresso. It was a beautiful day outside, and I was thankful we were able to enjoy such delicious food together. 

When the pandemic is over, I plan to dine in and try their other brunch and lunch dishes. The pasta dishes and Shakshouka looked pretty tempting."
5,"My wife, and I do these things called &quot;hotel days&quot; which as it sounds is usually done in a hotel somewhere far away from home.  While on vacation we always take one day out of it, and just veg in the hotel, order room service for every meal, stare out at the view, drink wine, I may have a cigar, take a long bath, listen to music, watch tv, etcetera..  Since Covid we&apos;ve been having to do this at home, which brings me to Empire Cafe.  We ordered eggs benedict, pancakes with fruit, a side of sausage, and a side of bacon, and even delivered it was just like room service from a fine hotel.  Think Ritz-Carlton, or Four Seasons.  In fact, she said the only better pancakes she&apos;s had were from the Ritz-Carlton in Vienna, Austria, and if you know anything about Austrian confections then you know why they can take a simple thing like pancakes and make them into a life-changing experience.  These were second only to that, and holy smokes.  Even the bacon was good, and they don&apos;t just give you two anemic looking strips, they give you a pile of real bacon.  
Thank you Empire Cafe for adding so perfectly to this delightful day, and we&apos;ll see you in the future."
4,"This is a cute spot for brunch in Houston. Especially during COVID, I really appreciated the large outdoor seating area.

I ordered the chicken &amp; waffles, and it was slightly above average. The waffle itself was delicious! I loved the flavor and felt like it was cooked perfectly. I also liked the well-sized fruit cup and egg that came with it. My only complaint was the chicken - the breading felt soggy to me, and it didn&apos;t have a lot of flavor.

The service was great and the meal was well-priced for the amount of food. I would recommend coming to Empire Cafe for brunch!"
4,"Very nice local owned brunch spot in the montrose area. No issues finding parking. There&apos;s also a lot available across the street in case the main lot gets over crowded. 

The chicken and waffle I ordered was very unique! They infused cheese In their waffles and their chicken was perfectly fried and breaded"
3,"Empire is overrated.
Its cramped! Parking and inside.
Taste like they used old chicken to make my Sandwich. The pickle on top was the best part its sweet and spicy!
The salad was fresh. Fresh veggies are always good.
This company need more structure my to go order was up front( kinda backwards). Most places have a pick up spot and a order spot."
3,"Came here for breakfast on a weekend pretty early ~9am and it wasn&apos;t too busy. I was not prepared for the order at the counter style since I hadn&apos;t scoped out the menu yet and the line was moving super quick. 

Decided on an almond joy coffee which was really good and super sweet. The cold brew was also decent but nothing special. 

Ordered the savory chicken &amp; waffles from the special menu and it was pretty good. Loved the Shakshouka dish - it was a lot of food! 

We sat in the back room and it wasn&apos;t a good atmosphere back there, would prefer to sit in the main area or outside next time."
5,First time here ! I was so impressed w the breakfast I had. The flavors were amazing ... not your usual waffles - they were savory and delicious! And the chicken was so perfectly fried!!
5,"This is for the Barry White cake, five stars, an amazing concoction of deliciousness! We love it so much we ordered an entire Barry White cake to take to a birthday celebration. It&apos;s AMAZING. Not to say their other cakes aren&apos;t good, every single cake slice I&apos;ve had is eye-rolling, mouth-watering, have-to-eat-every-last-bite, wonderful. There is a strawberry cake, that has pink cake with white icing that is *almost* as wonderful as Barry White, it is absolutely the best cake slice I&apos;ve had other than Barry White. Are you dying for cake yet? You won&apos;t be disappointed. 

Also, I had the penne vodka pasta last time and it was great! I usually don&apos;t care what I eat because we order a slice of cake to take it to our table and polish off before our meals even get to us, lol. Living life to the extreme. But the pasta was terrific. I didn&apos;t know it had ham in it though and had to pick around it (pigs are friends, not food) and will ask for it to be made veg next time. We love this place, with its cute ambiance, decor, and laid back vibe, will continue to be confirmed regulars!"
5,"Very cute and homey place. The ordering process was a bit weird but you get to choose your own seats and seat yourself. 
Different options of items you can order"
5,"Always a favorite place for brunch! A favorite is the Italian toast, which is a lighter but no less sumptuously delicious version of French toast. The thick Italian bread is dusted with powdered sugar and topped with always the freshest berries. Syrup is served on the side but really isn&apos;t necessary! 

For this trip I opted for one of the daily specials, a salad and cup of soup of the day. The soup was...fine, if a little bland and a tad tepid. But the salad - wow! It was huge! And absolutely delightful. The lettuce was super fresh and the chicken grilled perfectly. The slivered almonds were a nice touch and it even came with a piece of toasted buttery bread. 

The drinks are always amazing here, so many creative fun choices. The mimosa is a great standby but the Bloody Mary is also delicious if you like spicy. And if you like your coffee boozy they have no less than six choices to give you that extra buzz to start your day!"
5,"Came to celebrate a birthday brunch and it was amazing! I got the italian toast which was their version of a french toast with berries. I loved how crispy the outside of the toast was and how soft the inside was. It tasted just sweet enough with the syrup. I also ordered the Milky Way which is a coffee with caramel, hazelnut, and chocolate syrup I believe. A little too sweet but makes sense with all of the syrups! It was delicious regardless."
5,"I love this place! I found it when I first moved to Houston and it was just as good the second time. They have a great variety of breakfast options, including vegetarian, and the coffee is so good. Staff is nice and service is relatively fast, even on a busy day."
2,"That moment when a good place goes downhill is measurable. Like most things, it&apos;s not due to any obvious outward appearance, but rather a change in attitude. Empire&apos;s attitude has changed. The weird look you get asking for a napkin so you don&apos;t have to use your sleeve to wipe up a spill. Undercooked food... Forgotten items... The &quot;you&apos;re here for us&quot; grimace awaiting you coming up to order. 
Sorry, you&apos;re right Empire, we&apos;ll take our money elsewhere."
4,"This is one of my favorites in Montrose area. I like they have outdoor sitting.
I got tea when I was there, and you could try different kind of tea but I think they changed that policy."
5,"Hello Yelp. It&apos;s been awhile. Something about a pandemic affecting the world and shutting down half the restaurants that really puts a kink in Yelping. Luckily places like Empire Cafe are still alive and kicking though. I decided to order their Avocado Toast and Breakfast Tacos from Uber Eats and I think it changed my life. Because despite my accidentally falling asleep after placing the order and not checking the door til about an hour after the Uber driver drops it off... it was still the most dang delicious Avocado Toast I&apos;ve ever had. So much flavor!! And the Breakfast Tacos... they were more like two delicious giant breakfast burritos.... just wow. 

I naturally wanted more and decided to satisfy my craving by getting it again the next day... but in person this time. Unfortunately I never satisfied that craving. I started a new one instead by getting lured into their Monday special. It was a plate of chicken in a creamy Marsala mushroom sauce, a side of mixed veggies, and pasta in a tomato sauce. The chicken was a bit dry but the Marsala sauce was amaaazing. Note to self: ask for extra sauce on the side next Monday. And the pasta was also the best I&apos;ve ever had in my life.... I had to fight every urge not to devour it all before even getting to the chicken. When I I say picture a spaghetti or pasta from an Italian restaurant, this is exactly how it should taste in your head. Not too tart, perfect amounts tomatoey and savory. Too bad most Italian places don&apos;t make it this good either. I&apos;d go back to Empire just for that pasta again. After I finally get the other two items from my initial craving again that is. 

Btw the place is pretty cool. Indoor and outdoor covered seating with lots of space for social distancing. Free Wifi for guests so great place for solo diners or small groups wanting to get work done. You can kick back and read a book after your meal, catch up with a friend, or lunch meeting it up with the coworkers. There is indeed a small private parking lot on the side too with curb side parking as well. If you&apos;ve been cooped up by the pandemic like I have... please check this place out. It&apos;s a great gateway back into the outside world."
3,"Honestly, I was disappointed by this place. I came here with very high expectations and it was kind of a let down. The brunch options weren&apos;t great and it was very busy. Although the food came out quickly it was really just missing something. I wasn&apos;t at all impressed by the omelette I got . It just felt very plain. The prices were also a little up there so I was expecting much more than what I received. So honestly, I think this may be the last time I come here, but I always believe in second chances. Therefore, I might come again to see if this was a just an off experience."
4,"Good place for a pleasant weekend brunch! Nice relaxing ambience with shaded patio seating which is a big plus! Good selection of breakfast/ brunch &amp; drink options at a decent price tag! 
&apos;++&apos;s: Not-fried chicken waffles &amp; Eggs Benedict with Salmon - a must-try! Good portion size and combination!
&apos;==&apos;: Northwestern Breakfast - a hit and a miss! Love the scrambled eggs with Salmon but the rest of the plate wasn&apos;t up to the mark..
&apos;- -&apos;s: Cappucino - surprising but even though the perfect morning coffee smelt and looked good, it was a big letdown because of being &apos;cold&apos;!! Not sure why but all of our 3 coffees were not hot or rather even a bit cold outside which was a surprise but I believe a one-off..!

Overall, a very good place to hang-out with friends or family to start off the weekend!"
5,"I am convinced that this is one of the best cafes still open in the area! Both patio areas are beautiful, especially the lights they strung up and all the plants. I appreciate that the seating is safe and socially distant- I have camped out at a table working for hours and never felt unsafe. Also, the servers are extremely kind. Their coffee is good and comes with little biscuits, which is a nice touch. The pizza and soup were also great, and the pricing on the menu is fair. It&apos;s also fun that I can spend the afternoon working and then finish the night with a cocktail from their bar. If you want a place with a good ambiance, this is a must-see!

They also have a convenient parking lot behind the building."
2,"College hangout spot where you have to pay for music, crowded, coffee is mediocre. Ordered pistachio latte and lavender latte both tasted plain. For a tiny bag of chips it&apos;s $3.50 (hmmmm I thought I left LA?) overrated. Or rated by young kids that don&apos;t have a grip on what a real coffee shop is. No food only pasterys that they over charge for. It&apos;s a cool look that&apos;s why I gave 3 stars. But come on $3.50 for a 1oz snack bag of chips?!.... after reading reviews I realized they have food here funny thing is the lady at the counter told me they didn&apos;t? Hmmm... why?"
4,"We chose the Empire Cafe this past Saturday night to celebrate #YelpsBigNightIn during the stay-at-home regulations amongst the  COVID-19 outbreak. We ordered delivery through Uber Eats, and it arrived promptly!

First things first they got our order right, which is always a step in the right direction. I ordered the Pasta Rustica with chicken added, and my fiancé ordered the Bravo salmon. Of the two, I definitely out-ordered him! To be fair, the salmon was well blackened and seasoned, but my meal was just much more delicious! The pasta sauce was creamy and well flavored, though it does normally come with sautéed red onions that I requested to have removed. 

Will definitely order from them again! Thanks for being open and offering delivery after 7pm on a Saturday!!"
