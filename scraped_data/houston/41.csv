5,"So good! I haven&apos;t had much ice cream in Houston but this was the best yet - so much so, I&apos;m afraid to try anything else for fear of being disappointed.  I&apos;ve been twice and since neither visit were mid-summer, I was in and out both times. Both visits were also during COVID so not sure if that had anything to do with the low traffic. 

It sits on a corner with just a couple street parking spots near the door. There are also a couple spaces in the rear. It&apos;s a small place but who needs size when you have so many wonderful flavors in there bursting to get out. Both times I got my cream in a cup but purchased a cone to consume later. 

For the first visit I got the butter pecan streusel which is a brown butter &amp; brown sugar base with house-made pecan streusel. Amazing is an understatement. Each bite had every flavor listed - such a good ratio. On the second visit, I tried the pb cookies &amp; cream which has a peanut butter base + Oreo pieces. Very rich but yummy. If you LOVE peanut butter like I do, this will be a hit. 

They also take touch less payments which makes indulging in decadence feel safer. Hey, it makes me feel better about eating yummy ice cream. I&apos;ll definitely be back to try more."
5,"SO. GOOD. 
Perfectly creamy and the house made brown butter waffle cones are a wonderful compliment. They have 14 flavors, but I will say I haven&apos;t tried all them all because I absolutely love the Sunday Funday flavor which is a sweet cream base with house-made brownie chunks and a fudge ripple. SO GOOD. I&apos;m a sucker for brownie chunks though. I&apos;ve also tried city that never sleeps, strawberry almond cheese cake, and PB cookies n cream, but I will always make sure I also get my Sunday Funday scoop by getting the split cone option, which basically is two &quot;half&quot; scoops of ice cream, but you can pick two flavors for $5.50!! Single scoop is $5, and double scoop is $7. For only 50 cents more than single scoop, you get two flavors?! What a deal!
Perfect for the crazy Houston heat, but I&apos;ve also craved it in 40 degree weather. Basically, it&apos;s always good, and I have to refrain from coming every week. LOL I&apos;ll be back soon. Please don&apos;t ever run out of Sunday Funday or my heart will be broken. 

Also, thanks for taking COVID precautions. No cash. No samples right now ( unfortunately,  but for the best). Hand sanitizer available. Masks on until you step away from the counter."
5,"This was my first one trying their ice cream and it certainly won&apos;t be my last. This ice cream was phenomenal. I got the front loops ice cream and my wife got the dulce de horchata ice cream. Both had their own unique home made taste that you just don&apos;t find any more. The staff inside were pretty nice and they were following COVID guidelines with shields, cashless transactions, and everyone wearing masks. I really enjoyed the ice cream and the vibe of the restaurant."
3,"My friends really hyped this place up so I decided to finally go! I got the city never sleeps and butter pecan split ($5?) with the waffle cone($1.25). I loved the textures of the ice cream but I wasn&apos;t in love with flavors I got (maybe I should return and try other flavors). I definitely enjoyed city never sleeps more than butter pecan which had too many brown sugar chunks for my taste but even city never sleeps needed more complexity with the coffee flavor for me personally. The waffle cone was decent and had a very nice crunch, but it&apos;s not something I&apos;d get again. The split portion is actually quite a bit even though they say it&apos;s only one scoop (it&apos;s like 2). 

They do have some unique flavors that I&apos;d be curious to try again if I have the occasion to return."
4,"This is a good example of a trendy and slightly more upscale ice cream location catering to the yuppies and Montrose area. It is a good date spot or for casual dessert. We couldn&apos;t find parking and had to park next door at Canes&apos; (sorry!)

The pricing is obviously going to be reflective of the area and for these type of ice cream spots; around $3 per scoop. I got the Horchata and Earl Grey/Lavender/Lemon scoops in a cone, which comes out to around $8. 

My issue with the flavors available was that most of them are pretty heavy and close to some kind of cookies n cream type of flavor and very rich. I was hoping for some more interesting flavors like matcha, taro, or anything fruity. Everything looked super heavy and after eating it, we were ready to take a nap. 

The quality of the ice cream itself is good, you can tell from the texture and how creamy it is that it probably contains pretty high milk fat. 

The cashier was not very friendly, did not offer us samples when we took a while to look at the flavors, and seemed generally pissed to be working.  It was kinda a bummer because she was opposite of the atmosphere that the store owners were trying to create. Yikes. 

Anyways, the quality of the ice cream is good, however if there was some more variety in flavors, that would be great. We saw a couple on a date and it seemed like a great place to do exactly that."
5,"Seriously the creamiest ice cream I&apos;ve ever had! So delicious. This place also seems to take covid precautions seriously, as evidenced by their signage and providing hand sanitizer.
I highly recommend the butter pecan streusel. They have such unique flavors, I wish sampling was allowed, but I respect the fact that they&apos;re not bc of covid. Looking forward to going back when I&apos;m in the area!"
5,"Not gonna lie, I&apos;m probably about to sound super bias with my review because this place has 2 PEANUT BUTTER ice creams. Peanut butter is one of my favorite flavors overall, so I just was super happy with that, but there was still plenty of different flavors to choose from that looked equally as delicious! 

Parking is definitely tight, but it wasn&apos;t busy when I went, so that wasn&apos;t a problem. The ice cream is on the pricier side, but if you&apos;re a foodie like me, you know that no price is too much for some bomb dessert!

Please come try this place out, you won&apos;t be disappointed with the many different flavors!"
5,"Found this place while searching for late night ice cream. It was sooooooo good. They close at midnight on fridays and saturdays so if you want some ice cream at 11pm like we did, give this place a try!! My girlfriend and I both got a waffle cone with a scoop of the &quot;Rain or shine&quot; flavor. It was delicious. Not too sweet, and the lavender flavor was great. Also the cone was so good!! The whole place smelled like a bakery as soon as you step in. Staff was friendly too. Overall nice experience and we loved the ice cream flavor that we chose. I recommend trying it if youre ever in the montrose area!"
5,"Came here after eating Korean bbq. My fiancé was craving ice cream and we came across this place. You aren&apos;t allowed to try flavors due to Covid, but I highly recommend the Happy Wife flavor. Sweet cream is the best. My fiancé got the cereal milk flavor and she loved it. Will come back to try all of the flavors."
5,"This is by far the best ice cream I have ever had . I&apos;m visiting Houston for the first time with my boyfriend. I had the&quot;Happy Wife&quot; &amp; &quot; Cereal Milk &quot; In a waffle cone the ice cream itself was super creamy and smooth , the waffle cone was perfectly crisp . 10/10 !"
5,"Coming here was a spur of the moment type deal. My friends and I had just finished a walk around Hermann park and that, on top of that Texas heat... we wanted ice cream. 

I looked for some ice cream shops around and this place stood out to me. Though I love me some Marble Slab Creamery and Aqua US, I wanted something different, that was also aesthetically pleasing. This place definitely fit the bill for both.

The ice cream was creamy and the unique flavors really is what makes this place so incredible. I ordered the happy wife life flavor in a brown sugar waffle cone. It was really yummy! 

Definitely will come back to try their other unique flavors!"
4,"I would give it a 4.5

The flavors are very creative. Creamy. Not too sweet.

Nice balance in flavors. Nothing overpowers one another.


I have gotten the &quot;the city that never sleeps&quot;, &quot;rain or shine&quot;
Honestly &quot;rain or shine&quot; was probably my favorite so far. Earl grey, lavender, lemon. What a fricken combo! Sounds strange. But amazing together.

Good balance. Very tasty. I enjoyed myself very much.

Would I come back? Yes! There are so many different options that I need to try. And they all look so amazing! 

Highly recommend."
5,This place has such a cool concept of adding cereal to there ice creams as well as having unique flavors. They are pretty COVID friendly since they don&apos;t accept cash and they package the ice cream so well for to go orders too. As far as flavors I enjoyed it which was surprising since I&apos;m not an ice cream fanatic to begin with but this visit made me want to come back and try new flavors.
4,"milk + sugar is a trendy ice creamery in downtown Houston with fun flavors. Indulge in varieties such as &quot;happy wife&quot; (cream base with almond pound cake), Thai tea, or &quot;city that never sleeps&quot; (coffee and pretzel ice cream with chocolate flakes). The brown butter waffle cones are also delicious. Overall a fun stop if you have a sweet craving that only ice cream can satisfy!"
4,"What&apos;s not to love about this place?? Milk + Sugar is such a cute and delicious ice cream place and if I&apos;m ever in the area, I always have to stop by and grab a cone. 

I love that they can do a split scoop for those like me who have a hard time making a decision. They have plenty of unique flavors and prior to covid- you can try samples of it, but when I went back during covid times, there was no samples available (for good reason). There&apos;s not one flavor I would recommend because they&apos;re all delicious! The descriptions are really helpful when making a choice, even if you don&apos;t get to sample it. 

You could still sit in an eat your ice cream, but they do require social distancing. I do appreciate the availability of hand sanitizers and their cleaning procedures. 

Parking can be a bit tough, but sometimes you can get lucky and find a spot around the area."
4,"Really cool, trendy spot. Great place to go after a quick bite at Raising Canes or Churrasco&apos;s. The esthetic and ambiance was cool and hip. We loved the yellow door and the art. The ice cream was good (we got the Recess) but not great. I think the prices were fair but I wish there were more options."
5,Really good service. My wife and I were first timers and the employees explained the prices and the flavors ver well.
4,"Solid spot for ice cream in the area! milk + sugar was a great escape from the heat and humidity when I visited Houston. They have some great flavor combos, and though I couldn&apos;t sample any flavors due to COVID precautions, I was happy I chose the strawberry almond cheesecake and the rain or shine. They were both so creamy and just the right amount of sweet. The almond flavor complemented the cheesecake flavor very well - I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve had that combo elsewhere before, and I&apos;m always on the prowl for new ice cream spots with unique flavors. In the rain or shine, lemon was nice litte twang added to the more classic lavendar &amp; earl grey mix. They do have rotating seasonal flavors, so I&apos;ll definitely make this spot a stop for next time I&apos;m in town!"
5,"Unique flavors, not that many options but the four flavors I tried were all pretty great.
I don&apos;t believe you can get a simple scoop of vanilla or chocolate ice cream here so if you&apos;re more of a basic Becky this isn&apos;t going to be for you.
Cereal milk and earl grey lavender are my two favorites. 
Parking available in the back."
4,"AMAZING ICE CREAM. Another Yelp recommendation, small hole in the wall, and I was not disappointed at all, it&apos;s hard to beat homemade ice cream and waffle cones. I ordered the City That Never Sleeps, and it was delicious. A very good coffee flavor with chocolate flakes and pretzels, did not taste much of the pretzel but I did not miss it in the ice cream at all. I think my only complaint would be that the waffle cone is so fragile, the ice cream was making it soft and you couldn&apos;t hold onto it too hard, but that is a small technicality I&apos;m okay with and overlooking. All of the flavors seem interesting and very different, I look forward to trying them!"
