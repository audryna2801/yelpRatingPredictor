5,"Classic, comforting Italian food at a non-fussy spot in Montrose. 

Have only gotten takeout due to the pandemic, but the inside is very spacious. Easy takeout parking marked on the side street off of Westheimer. 

We enjoy their Wednesday dinner special (eggplant Parmesan) but they have something different each night. 

Portions are large enough for sharing."
5,"**COVID Review**

I have not been back to Paulie in years. Not because the food was bad or anything, I just live to damn far. My best friend let me try her leftover Cacio e Pepe from Paulie and since then, my mind cannot stop thinking about it. I was ranting to my best friend on how I was craving it, she told it was perfect timing because they only serve it on Fridays.

I drove into town and head to Paulie. Since it was during the pandemic, there was no line. I order the Cacio e Pepe w/ a Caesar salad and the Canestri alla Funghi. 

My goodness, the large canestri alla funghi dish could feed an army! It literally took me days for my family and I to finish it! The Cacio e Pepe was just how I remembered it, creamy + peppery. Do not forget to try their bread, you won&apos;t regret it!"
5,"What a gem of a place! This cute, quaint Italian cafe is just adorable. 

You walk in &amp; the menu is huge on the wall to order from. Walk to the counter to very attentive staff with positive vibes, huge plus. 

Such a variety on the menu there&apos;s something for everyone. Pastas, chicken, steak &amp; seafood! 

There are tables that seat 2 and 4 most. There&apos;s a patio side double door that I&apos;m sure they open when weather permits which would be lovely. 

Food:

Roasted Salmon - Honestly, this dish is on a scale with McCormick&apos;s. Salmon cooled perfectly, flaky, great seasoning with lemon. Served with Parmesan potatos, wowww, I was expecting a bland taste of nothing looking at the red potato cut on the plate with a boring white sauce. Wrong!  These potatos tasted of the best seasoned mashed potatoes, with hints of cheese, onions, cream &amp; salt...amazing! Also served with  a side broccoli. Can&apos;t go wrong with this dish if your a seafood person. So filling! 

Mushroom Pasta - it was something fungus LOL.  Order it!!!  Talk about creamy perfection! First off, in order to have a pasta dish RIGHT, the PASTA has to be cooked properly &amp; OMG this place set their timer to a tea, perfect al dente pasta, filled with creamy gooey, cheesy, did I say creamy? Mushroom sauce. If you don&apos;t like mushrooms you will still like this dish. It doesn&apos;t taste only like mushrooms even though its filled with them, LOL...how is that possible? Idk just try it, you&apos;ll see. 

Also had a side salad &amp; cup of mushroom soup, served piping hot like every other dish, it was creamy &amp; filling. 

The skirt steak was cooked as requested &amp; tender, not over seasoned so you could appreciate the meat. 

Dessert - 2 pretty shortbread cookies, not bad Lorna doone is hard to compete with, LOL

Love this place! I wish I lived closer I would order lunch from here everyday for at least 2 weeks until I was sick &amp; tired of pasta! Lol they are awesome. You won&apos;t be disappointed! Enjoy!"
3,"I want to like Paulies but their pastas are consistently under sauced and under salted.

Advice to management: Take a trip to Flavor Town and up your sauce levels, don&apos;t be so skimpy with the sauce i&apos;m paying you $19 for pasta for gods sake."
3,"Service was amazing!!! The employees were so attentive and welcoming.
There is a small lot for parking in the back fo the resultant. It gets full fast, so be prepared to street park. I hear they tow quickly in that area, so make sure to check you surroundings. 

Vinni Pizza: (2/5) it tasted like a mediocre freezer pizza with some sliced sausage on top. I was with a party of 7. My pizza came out 10-15 minutes earlier then all my other friend&apos;s orders. They all ordered pasta, so it was very suspicious. 

I tasted my friend&apos;s pasta and it was super good. Only giving a 3 stars because I feel bamboozled for my pizza.

If you come here, make sure you stay clear of the pizza and order a pasta."
4,"Pasta homemade. You can for sure taste the difference in this food. Yummy. House salad and House dressing was delicious. Both mine and my husband&apos;s main plates were great. Fresh,hot, and large portions. Small cozy place, but very busy. We will return. Next time I want to try their dessert."
4,"If Paulie wants a cracker, then this might be a place to come and look for one. Or perhaps not.

This is a super cute little Italian Cafe that is not cheap but also not expensive and makes really good Northeast style Italian-American dishes that are very pleasing. I&apos;m surprised more people haven&apos;t heard about it or raved about it yet."
3,"Man, I wanted to love this place!! The Yelp reviews were glowing and the presentation of the food and the portion sizes for this hangry pregnant lady were perfect! 

My family and I ordered 4 different entrees, the Italian Family Salad and shortbread cookies for dessert-- all for pick up. I had the regular sized Canestri alla Funghi with chicken. The weight of my entree was at least 2lbs; it was piping hot and looked amazing! The chicken was perfect-- tender and well-seasoned. There was plenty of mushroom sauce to perfectly coat the massive amount of pasta, but unfortunately, it was severely under-salted; I tried, but couldn&apos;t push through it-- but hey, left overs for days! The shortbread cookies were very good and so was the salad; I didn&apos;t care too much for the bread. 

Overall, this place is a good spot! And I likely wouldn&apos;t have minded the lack of salt if we were dining in, or even dining at home because that&apos;s what salt shakers are for. Unfortunately, we were out of town and in a hotel room, so we didn&apos;t have any salt on hand, but I would absolutely visit this restaurant again and order other items. Everything tasted like it was made in-house; they seem like the real deal!"
3,Meh it was average - not bad but nothing outstanding. I got the signature mushroom pasta (I forgot the name). It was good but nothing special. Huge portions. The atmosphere is pretty cool though inside.
4,"Food: 4/5
Service: 4/5
Cleanliness: 4/5
Decor &amp; Style: 4/5

The Mushroom Pasta and the Affogato were my go-to and it was really good. There is not very many places that serve Affogato&apos;s so already this place automatically deserves at least 4/5 stars. Think about it, how many places serve Affogato&apos;s that have less than a 3 star? Exactly! The managers/owners know what they&apos;re doing and they have great taste. Will be back!"
5,Great little spot near the heights! There was actually a surprising amount of options here. I ordered a pesto pasta with chicken while my fianc√© got the spaghetti w/ meatballs. Both were fire might I add. They also have sandwiches and pizza if that is your thing. The Def give this place a shot if you&apos;re a fan of pasta or italian food in general. Parking is the only thing that is tricky at night time so be prepared for that.
5,Brought my own tony chacheres because why not but we stopped here yesterday after my bridal appointment and we all got the fettuccine Alfredo! We loved it! It was SO creamy and the pricing isn&apos;t bad at all!!
4,"I&apos;ve heard a great number of friends and colleagues tell me that Paulie&apos;s is their favorite Italian joint in Houston, so I figured a pandemic was as good a time as any to give it a shot. And I must say, not sure I can dispute the claim so far. Hand-made pasta is just in a different universe compared to the store-bought kind I have with unfortunate regularity. It&apos;s spongier, more pliant, and has more little grooves and crannies for the sauce to adhere. Basically better in every way. 

We began with the Canestri alla Funghi, which comprised thick curved noodles in a creamy and toothsome mushroom-based sauce. The flavor was excellent, grassy and earthy with a nice zap of citrus, but there wasn&apos;t enough sauce and I think a pinch or two of salt would have helped. The Rigatoni Bolognese was delicious, with a silky gravy that balanced nutty and sweet flavors with ease. The Nonna Pizza was also well-received. Despite the excess of arugula - a leafy green I don&apos;t care too much for - the crispy thin crust, hearty sliced pancetta, and fresh pesto more than made up for it, not to mention the roasted tomatoes, which were somehow the best part of the whole affair. We polished the meal off with a Key Lime Tart, which was a tad too sweet for our palates, but was well-made nonetheless.

Paulie&apos;s made for some excellent take-out, so I&apos;m sure it&apos;s even better fresh out of the kitchen. I plan to test this theory in person soon."
5,"This is some of the best pizza I&apos;ve ever had. The crust actually had flavor and it wasn&apos;t soggy at all. The pasta was good but I preferred the pizza. I will definitely be going back as I&apos;d love to try the other pizzas and the mushroom pasta.
The service was great. The prices were comparable to that area but I have to say it was worth it."
2,"Say it with me- O-VER-PRICED. These three items and an iced tea rang in about $60. The flavors were okay, but nothing special. I would have rather went to Olive Garden. Also, the chicken picatta and pasta were cold. It seemed to be a consistent issue because the table next to me sent their pasta back for being cold too. Just a very sub-par experience overall."
3,"Family was craving Italian, and we were hungry. Found Paulie&apos;s via Yelp and some reviews noted the large portions. I can confirm that the small is definitely large enough for one person, and the regular size is big enough for at least 2 people. It&apos;s HUGE!!! I&apos;d give this place 5 stars for the portions, and the shortbread cookies were good too. I have to dock it a couple stars for the flavor though. I tasted 3 different pasta entrees and every dish was under salted, even the Italian salad dressing was lacking salt. Maybe a salt shortage due to the covids or something."
5,"This place is deeeelicious! There is very limited parking at the back of the restaurant otherwise you would have to park legally on the side of the neighborhood and walk over. My friend and I came here for dinner. You order at the counter then find seating inside or outside (limited). My friend and I ordered Canestri alla Funghi (regular size $18) and Rigatoni Bolognese (regular size $18) (opt for Bucatini pasta instead). 

Canestri alla Funghi: 5/5 - This pasta was different in a good way! It was unique with the Crimini and Shiitake mushrooms. The sauce has a hint of lemon to it which is on the lighter side for sauce, and I appreciate that they didn&apos;t drown the pasta with sauce but just enough. Be sure to throughly mixed it. 

Bolognese w/ Bucatini pasta: 5/5 - I think this is my favorite between the two! I really like this one because the flavor was on point. I love how they add basil in this dish. This one has got to be one of the best pasta dishes, I tried. 

Let me tell you about the grilled bread they give you along with the pasta. It is amazing. I can just eat all of it on its own. It is a thin bread that is buttered and perfectly toasted/grilled. 

Overall, since it was our first time here, we made the mistake of ordering the regular size rather than the small size. Food takes a little bit, but it was well worth it. The prices are reasonable. I definitely recommend giving this place a try! It is hit in my books."
5,"I absolutely love this place! I got the caesar salad and the canestri &amp; broccoli. Their caesar salad has a really nice dressing (you can tell they don&apos;t skip out on the anchovies) that&apos;s worth the price for a simple salad. My pasta was fantastic - again, for something so basic, it&apos;s done to perfection. The broccoli was well-cooked, and there was just the right amount of garlic and parmesan to round out the meal. I get Paulie&apos;s every two months or so now for a treat."
5,"Wow, this pasta was amazing! I came here on the recommendation of a friend who comes at least once a week, and I wasn&apos;t disappointed. 

I tried the Rigatoni Bolognese and the Fusilli pasta with pesto. The Rigatoni Bolognese was my favorite! I can&apos;t describe the flavor, but it had a meaty undertone and it was amazing. The texture was also great, it was perfectly chewy. One of the best pasta dishes I&apos;ve ever had. 

The Fusilli pasta with pesto was also good, but I wasn&apos;t amazed by it. Its predominant flavor was salt with some pesto added. In comparison with the Rigatoni Bolognese, it was mediocre. 

One thing to note - the portion sizes are huge! The larger size is plenty of food for two people to share (there&apos;ll probably be leftovers)."
5,"Not sure how I&apos;ve never written a review for this place! 
Paulie&apos;s is great for your Italian quick fix. I&apos;ve come for lunch and dinner and all the options are great. The portions are plenty (but the seats are not!) It can be challenging to find a spot to sit during peak hours but people are always rotating out. Parking is behind the restaurant or there&apos;s always street parking."
