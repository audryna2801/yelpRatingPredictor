5,"I grew up in or just outside Philly. I had three places to eat within walking distance: a diner, a pizzeria, and a deli, all family owned, all worth the shoe leather. The deli was where I usually could be found, at one of two tables outside or one of the six inside, so I know what I like, and Kenny &amp; Ziggy&apos;s consistently exceeds my overly high standards.

Put it this way: I live up north of Conroe, Texas. But even when I lived out near Austin, this was my destination EVERY time I hit Houston and finished what I was in town to do.

The pastrami, corned beef, brisket, and every expertly sliced deli meat are outstanding. In fact, the pastrami is the BEST ever. The chopped liver is amazing, and every bite of smoked fish will bring a smile to your face. The potato salad tastes like my grandmother&apos;s - I kid you not! And please, for your own sake, get a bowl of chicken soup with a MONSTER matzo ball &amp; mush-mosh, AND the open-faced Reuben.

Now let&apos;s talk desserts: take your pick, not one will leave you disappointed. This time, I had the &quot;OMG! Cheesecake&quot;, and trust me, it lives up to its name, 100%.

Service, always exemplary, is that and more in this time of social distancing, masks, and sanitising the world like an operating theater. The banter between servers and kitchen employees and ever between one diner and another diner will leave you in stitches. Our server, Bogdan, was the best, hands down. 

In closing,  if you EVER leave Kenny &amp; Ziggy&apos;s unhappy or hungry, you DIDN&apos;T EAT"
5,"This is an absolute staple in Houston! It is the perfect mixture of established restaurant with a mom and pop hole in the wall decor. When you walk in you are gifted with house made pickles that were so good I ate 3! The burger (pictured) was absolutely amazing! The perfect blend of sweet and salty and easily enough for two meals; and believe me I can throw down so that is saying a lot lol. Also, with a heaping load of French fries that were nothing to write home about but asking for a side of their mustard kicked it up another level for sure.  The Corned Beef (also pictured) although I did not eat it was such a beauty stacked with meat and I did try the potato salad and that was great too, just like grandma makes. 
I look forward to coming many more times and trying so many items from this menu with so many unique options!"
5,"This is a wonderful restaurant that is run by the best of the best!  The food is fantastic and they have been so careful to protect everyone during this epidemic!  Thank you so much for caring about and for us all!  Will see you again, soon!"
5,"Ok I loveee coming here! Everything is delicious and gigantic! A must visit place in Houston, and a perfect place to take visiting guests!!! Won&apos;t disappoint! For adventurous eaters I recommend the tongue sandwich!!! They have a straight up tongue one and a sandwich that has three meetings including tongue(didn&apos;t try it but seems great)

Bonus!!! They have expanded the gluten free menu since I&apos;ve last been here, which was so amazing to see! I stopped coming here  2+ years ago manly because i felt restricted and sad they didn&apos;t have many options. This time around I was so happy they had a printed out menu and they had gluten free bread! I&apos;m really grateful for this.  If you want the bread toasted they don&apos;t have a contaminated free zone to do so, so wouldn&apos;t recommend that. Which sucks, and I hope they consider taking a bit more  protocols in the future. Especially since they&apos;ve expanded. It also would be great to see some gluten - free desserts on the menu. 




Really a great place! 10/10 will always recommend. The staff is always phenomenal!  Can&apos;t say enough great things about this place"
4,"I just reread my last review.  I wish I had read it before ordering.  I now remember how crazy big the sandwiches are, and that I definitely do not need my own. I may still have time to fix this grievous error.
This restaurant is definitely practicing social distancing, complete with taking temps at the door.  We ar as far back in the restaurant as possible, which is fine, it&apos;s much quieter back here.
They start every table out with a plate of pickles, as like an on the house appetizer.  The bright green pickles are more of a lightly pickles  cucumber.  I like these more than the regular pickles, and the boys prefer the regular pickles, as such, I score in the cuckles ( yes, I just made up my own word)
Our server is Tony, and I almost feel as if he has all the tables here in this back room.  He does have help, but I still feel like he is going solo.  He&apos;s doing a great job and doing too good a job of upselling.  We did not need a side of fries, especially at $6 
So, our sandwiches were delicious, and even bigger than I remember.  I definitely should have split mine.  They are jaw breaking, see the back of other&apos;s throats as they attempt a bite, stacked full of meat.  I find it hard to believe that this is the normal NY size sandwich, if it were, well, I think people would be dropping left and right from cardio problems up there.  Half the sandwich and half the price would be more my style.  I mean, yeah they are good, and yes, all 3 of us have a half sandwich for later, but $22 a piece? What does f we don&apos;t head straight home?  We&apos;d be literally tossing $35. Worth of food out.
I did not bother ordering the chicken soup that Tony was touting as Jewish penicillin.  My last review noted my dissatisfaction of it, so I did not even bother .
Overall, pleased with service and food we ordered, so I am upgrading to a 4  star review."
5,"Everything we have ordered has been delicious ... French toast, Ruben Sandwich, Lox and Bagels and that insanely good cheeseburger with pastrami on top... it&apos;s definitely pricey but oh so worth it."
5,"So good! So unique but so good! 
Service was amazing. We had such a great time that I didn&apos;t take very many pictures!"
5,"We got the corned beef and cabbage and beef stroganoff, as well as chocolate cream pie. Really delicious and huge portions. Amazing nostalgic atmosphere with NYC/Jewish/Broadway themed decor. Friendly efficient knowledgeable staff. Amazing dessert case. The most authentic diner in Texas! Can&apos;t wait to go back."
5,"Kenny &amp; Ziggy&apos;s has been a staple in Houston since the day they opened their doors. No deli, especially that claiming to be a &quot;New York&quot; style, compares to this place. From their lox, to their fried onion strings to their INSANE chicken noodle soup. That soup truly cures everything. If you haven&apos;t given this place a try, get up and go now. The entire city should be supporting this local gem. If I still lived in Bellaire, I&apos;d still be eating there weekly!"
5,Must go place every time we visit Houston! Loved everything we&apos;ve tried! Our go to is the patty melt and cheesecake.
5,"I appreciate this business reaching out to me about an order that was placed.
Living in CA but coming from New England I know their corned beef is the best!"
5,"Really good for outside of New York! I ordered the rueben, and one small side of Cole Slaw. My friend ordered the club and a side of vegetables. He never even touched the veggies. The sandwich is SO big it wasn&apos;t even needed. 

I can honestly say, I ate less than half at lunch. Another less than half for dinner; and was finally able to finish it for lunch the next day! It was really really good. Highly recommend and I&apos;ll be back."
5,"As authentic a NY Jewish deli as I&apos;ve ver been to outside of NY.  It is so good that I went back for dinner after eating lunch there. 

It&apos;s a rectangular dining room in a storefront location in an upscale strip center. Plenty of booths and tables at the front and side, and a &quot;to go&quot; deli counter on the left. Sinatra-era music plays. The walls are covered with caricatures of the stars. Looking for the old fashioned NY deli vibe. 

Service is friendly and fast.  They start you off with a bowl of pickles - half sours and garlic dills.  For lunch I had my deli favorite - tongue. (Don&apos;t judge) Delicious, thin-sliced, lean beef tongue, slow cooked in spices just like corned beef. The taste is halfway between pastrami and corned beef.  Makes a scrumptious sandwich on moist and doughy on-the-inside/crunchy crust on-the-outside Jewish rye, slathered with deli mustard. Plus a Dr. Brown&apos;s Cream soda to complete the experience. 

For dinner I went back and had a bowl of chicken soup with a matzoh ball and kasha varnishkas. 

The soup is homemade, hearty and flavorful with chunks of carrots and celery and shreds of chicken. The matzoh ball is softball-sized, light and fluffy.  As good as grandma used to make! 

Kasha and varnishkas is perfectly executed. Small grain buckwheat, onions, mushrooms simmered till everything is al dente, then tossed with bowtie pasta. Another one that&apos;s on par with grandma. 

You can&apos;t have this kind of a meal without a black and white cookie... And this one is a giant.  2&quot; thick with 1/4&quot; of icing....  Too much to finish in one sitting, so some left for midnite snack. 

When you&apos;re in the mood to get you&apos;re Jewish food on... Or try something else from their huge menu - THIS is your place.  Recommended."
4,"I love me a good man-wich, so when I had the craving for an egg salad sandwich, I wanted to try it here. My husband and I went for a quick  lunch before I had to pick up the kids. The tables are covid spaced, which was nice. The d√©cor is fun, lots of caricatures, movie posters, and famous photos of scenes in films with some sort of Kenny and Ziggy alteration to a line in it. It has a lot of eye stimulating visuals, the desserts, the meats, the toppings....my egg salad was good, I would not get it on the onion roll next time, probably regular sandwich bread. My husband got a monstrosity of a hamburger concoction, big portions...so either share or take it home. They have every kind of sandwich combo you can think of, including breads, toppings, tapenades, spreads, you name it...they also have mains if you are not in the mood for a sandwich. Service was good, place is clean, everyone was wearing masks and gloves"
5,"Word on the street is that this is THE go-to spot for pastrami and such sandwiches by the locals. So that&apos;s how you know it&apos;s good. 

My dad and I shared the Fidler on the Roof of your Mouth, but with an onion roll and that was plenty. It&apos;s staCked!! - definitely can&apos;t bite the whole thing. I ended up splitting it in haLf and eating it like an open face sandwich. 

Tried a little bit of the matzah ball soup as well and it was delicious.  

Would definitely eaT here again."
4,New York style deli in the heart of uptown Houston. The serving sizes are huge which I guess justifies the price. I&apos;m still on the fence about whether or not bagel and nova lox should cost $20 plus. Either way I still come and enjoy.
4,"Went for the first time a few weeks back, and was surprised. The portions are REALLY BIG. I got the Boulevard Big Boy and it was flavorful and HUGE!!! Next time I plan to get the cabbage wrapped pastrami and most importantly the mashed potatoes because THE GRAVY was the best I&apos;ve tasted thus far!

HIGHLY RECOMMEND"
5,This place is the REAL DEAL!!!!! Best deli outside of New York and Jersey hands down!!!!!! Makes me kvell!!!!!
5,"What can I say, all of my favorite deli foods in overly large portions, a great staff show posters And caricature drawing all over the walls and Sinatra playing throughout, if you were looking for a New York deli experience in Houston, this is as close as you&apos;re going to get"
5,My husband took me here knowing I was looking for a good Jewish deli. I was happy to see foods I was use to and that it was done the way I was raised. We can&apos;t wait to go again and try something else off their large menu.
