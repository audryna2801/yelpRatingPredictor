5,"Don&apos;t let the outside appearance fool you-- the food is incredible and the staff are so nice! Ordered takeout, and my mouth was watering from the delicious smell during the car ride home. Got the vegetarian chimichanga and it was SO GOOD. Totally hit the spot! The portions are large, so will definitely have leftovers for lunch tomorrow. This place did not disappoint, and I will be"
5,This place is so good! It&apos;s a must try. I tried the kabob plate and it was beyond delicious. The outside of the building doesn&apos;t look too appeasing but don&apos;t that that deter you from walking in. It was delicious.
5,"There isn&apos;t anything here that I can say is bad. I&apos;ve tried the chicken shawarma sandwich, the loaded burger (the best burger in Houston), and the chicken quesadilla which are usually good as hell. Although, the last time I order the chicken quesadilla it was made with a different tortilla, more doughy than normal. I wasn&apos;t a big fan although my coworker enjoyed it. I&apos;m blaming it on the corona because they were out of a lot of their normal food."
5,"You&apos;ve passed this placed 1,000 times on Almeda and never knew it. I can admit that I have. Located in a tiny space, it looks like the biggest hole in the wall. DO NOT LET THAT FOOL YOU! A friend recommended this joint and when I read the raving reviews on Yelp, I just couldn&apos;t believe I had never been here. 

The parking lot is small and can become super packed during prime eating times. Serving up Mediterranean, Mexican, Burgers I couldn&apos;t imagine this place could be so great with so many different types of menus. I ordered a hamburger with cheese and fries. Okay, so this was like one of the best hamburgers I have EVER had! No, really. Thank goodness it&apos;s pretty close because this will be a new place to frequent. Y&apos;all seriously get your behinds in here!"
2,"Broke down but creative.
Deceiving but quick.
Pricey and overrated.
Hard to spot and unbelievably hidden."
4,"I readily admit that I only tried the kebab platter. It had beef, Kofta I believe, and chicken. The sides was a nice fresh salad with a lovely vinegrette, hummus, rice and pita. I subbed the rice with refried beans and cheese (keto and all) The meats were delicious and tender. Well the beef was a bit gritty and tough but flavorful.  I loved the chicken. So good.  I also loved the salad. The weird thing was it went so well with the hummus. I know weird combo but it worked! The pita was a bit dry and the refried beans was just ok. 

Final grade: B
I&apos;d return, but not necessarily a bookmarked spot"
3,"First time to this restaurant, for time in state and heard good things. Got two soft corn tortillas one with beef and one with chicken. The tacos weren&apos;t too bad wasn&apos;t really that flavorful or served with a lime wedge for added tang. I kinda wish they had some kind of sauce that I could of added to it because the meat didn&apos;t have much flavor. I wouldn&apos;t say it was bad but it wasn&apos;t amazing. I also got a side of fries which were pretty good but the seasoning was a little too salty which gets overwhelming. I definitely would cut back on the excess seasoning so it&apos;s just the right amount."
5,"The Chicken Shawarma was to die for loved it and ordering again, I have been waiting to come to work just to order it again."
5,"I&apos;m so glad my friend introduced me to M&amp;M Grill last year! I feel like fusion restaurants are usually a clear hit or miss, and this one is definitely a hit.

M&amp;M Grill brings together 2 of my favorite cuisines - Mediterranean &amp; Mexican. They have some amazing combos! The few times I&apos;ve been here I have tended to order items more on the Mediterranean side.

My favorite order is the shawrma plate. The meat is very well-seasoned, and it is a great amount of food for the price. My friend &amp; I also split a burger on one visit, and I enjoyed the flavor of that one as well. I will for sure be back again!"
5,Great hamburger and quick service I got the bbq bacon burger with cheddar cheese.  It was one of the best burgers I&apos;ve had in Houston.  One bite everyone knows the rules 8.76!
4,"It had been a minute for me since I had M&amp;M, so I figured I might as well have their signature loaded double cheeseburger. As you can see the size is monstrous, not to mention the taste is superb. They serve both halal Mexican and Mediterranean food hence the name. If you&apos;re not feeling a burger, I&apos;ve heard their chimichanga is popular.

5,"The burgers are legit!! Awesome flavor!  This isn&apos;t really a great dine-in place, but the food is great so order something to go."
5,"I&apos;ve been here at least 20 times. The burgers are good but it&apos;s pretty big and I wish they had a smaller option. Kids burger please because I wanna take a nap after eating it!!! I love the chili cheese fries and have had them at least 10 times. They&apos;re perfect for my cheat days,lol. I recent had the tacos for the first time and they officially have a fan in me. I&apos;ll be back (in my Terminator voice). 

They&apos;re always busy for lunch Mon-Fri so time your visit wisely."
1,"I wish I could give em negative 5 . Worst customer service, nasty restaurant and greasy food. Waste of time and money. Never again."
3,"I love supporting small local places, but this was a little bit of a letdown based on the other reviews. The portion on the chicken shawarma platter was really disappointing and the rice was too salty. The hummus and garlic sauce, however, was phenomenal. I think if I go again I&apos;d try something else entirely, like their burgers."
5,"The double loaded cheeseburger is amazing - the creamy garlic sauce, the thick stacks of beef, the the crunch of the pickles and fried onions... YUM.

Also portion sizes are hugeee. I split a burger and I was still so full afterwards. It hit just the right spot for my hungry and fast food craving soul. The fries were also pretty good, but I saw another table get curly fries instead of the steak fries that we got. Will definitely try those next time!

Staff were really friendly and polite too! Will definitely come back and try the diverse menu"
5,"Don&apos;t let the storefront fool you, it doesn&apos;t look like much on the outside but man, they cook some really yummy food!

We haven&apos;t tried everything bc we&apos;re creatures of habit but we love the chicken swarma plate, fajita place, and mushroom burger.. SO GOOD"
5,"Really quaint comfort food space. You can get American, Mexican, and Mediterranean food all under one roof and it&apos;s all pretty solid.

Great customer service too."
4,"This unassuming restaurant is a fantastic hole in the wall in the Med Center area. M&amp;M stands for Mexican and Mediterranean, which represents the type of foods they offer. You can get a chimichanga with queso and shawarma plate in the same place, it&apos;s awesome! 
Their dishes are a cheat meal heaven, perfect when you want something greasy yet oh so good. The portions are also ridiculously huge. Don&apos;t come here if you&apos;re on a diet or want something healthy! 

The Loaded Double Swiss Mushroom Burger is amazing. It&apos;s stacked with yummy toppings, a hearty portion of meat, and is very saucy. You&apos;re bound to need a nap after though. 
I also like their Beef Shawarma plate!  

Parking is a little difficult because the lot is super small, so I usually try and come during slower hours or do pick up."
5,"My husband and I stopped here for dinner one evening. We had to park across the street, which wasn&apos;t pleasant, but fine. I ordered a gyro which was a little different than what I am used to. The pita bread was thinner an larger than I&apos;ve had in the past, but this did not disrupt the flavor. It tasted great and all the ingredients were fresh. The fries were nothing special, but they were good. There is very limited seating, just FYI."
