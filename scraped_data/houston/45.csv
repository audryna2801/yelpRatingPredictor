5,"I ordered their Prime 14 oz NY Strip medium rare for takeout and it was fantastic. It was seasoned very well and very delicious. My steak also had somewhat of a red wine flavor from the juices, which was great and unique. It was broiled very nicely and was very juicy in texture. The inner redness of my steak was great and the quality of their meat is top notch. The service was great, fast, friendly and very hospitable. This is one of the best steakhouses in TX. They also have a Wagyu version of the NY Strip for just five or six dollars more that I plan on ordering on my next visit here."
5,"My wife and I stopped in on a whim just after they reopened during COVID. Loved it! Going back as often as possible!

Te server was great! we usually leave at least 20% tip, she got 50%! I always say, if you cant afford the tip, you can;t afford the meal! (Maybe because I was a server in college.)

The burger was awesome and drinks were perfect!

We loved the atmosphere, even though we had a table right by the kitchen entrance, it was a great experience!"
5,"I wanted to take my niece to a really nice place since she was in town for a few days. Vic &amp; Anthony&apos;s was perfect. The ambiance and food was perfect. Justin our server was efficient and sweet. He gave us 5 star service and explained everything. Despite this pandemic, they made sure the proper precautions were taken and we felt safe sitting down to eat our meal. We will definitely be back to eat here in the future."
5,"I went for my Birthday Dinner and everything was great from start to finish. First Class service all the way. This was my 1st time trying the lamb chops, LOVE! LOVE! LOVE! They were juicy, tender and had great flavor. 

For Dessert, I had the cheesecake, it was delicious!!! The ambiance, customer service everything was perfect!"
1,"Don&apos;t do it, reconsider! You can do so much better than this place!!!!

This is my least favorite steakhouse in Houston, possibly in existence. I would seriously rather go to Outback. Each time that I&apos;ve been here was never on my own volition and each time was a less than stellar experience. I had successfully avoided coming here for the last 2 years (and convinced many business partners, colleagues, friends and family to go elsewhere when visiting because their food just isn&apos;t great to me). Unfortunately last night I was not aware that this is where my partner made reservations. I tried to be optimistic. They failed as per usual. 3 strikes, OUT for me -- first and last visit from my partner, and now I will aggressively decline any invitation to ever eat here again.

We had a reservation at 11pm. They required that my partner put his credit card on file and stated if he did not show or was late, they would charge $50. We arrived, on time and guess what?! We were told they were 30 minutes behind on reservations. They made no attempt to text or call as they did to confirm we were coming to advise of the situation. We attempted to find space at the bar and boy was it an attempt because THEY WERE NOT FOLLOWING ANY COVID-19 SAFETY GUIDELINES. Every table was seated and they were not spaced 6 feet apart. Every single seat at the bar was occupied and one of the bartenders in particular continuously removed his mask. 

After 20 minutes of being ignored at the bar, we were finally able to order a drink. The bartender made the wrong drink. Had to remake it. In addition there was a female bartender who had an extremely nasty attitude and was slamming things everywhere, complaining to her fellow employees about them apparently understaffing for the day. After 45 minutes we still had not been seated, so someone retrieved a manager. While he did at least inquire about it, he offered no apologies and was actually quite rude. He blamed the situation on people &quot;lingering&quot; and them not being prepared. How not? You go off reservations and you were booked for the night?  I asked what they were doing to compensate guests because we were having a poor experience and failed to understand how they threatened to charge guests if they were late for their reservation, but they were AN HOUR LATE seating us and felt that justified no rectification? He said &quot;we will handle that later&quot;. Okay, when is later? I got no answer. We attempted to close our tab at the bar, but we were again ignored. Our table was finally ready so we left and at that point, the rude female behind the bar tried to run behind us with the ticket. The employee that seated us was at least very nice and HE took the ticket from her, crumbled it up and told us not to worry about it. This was literally THE ONLY nice thing about the evening. 

We ended up sitting with a very rude, very dry server. I had initially expressed that we were frustrated because we waited over an hour past our reservation time to be seated and (not that it was necessarily his fault as the server) he offered no apology. He said they had over 700 guests and that I should put it behind me. EXCUSE ME? You want me to feel sorry that you knew you would have this many guests because you operate by reservations and failed to plan?!!!! Yeah I was ready to go before we even ordered, especially since it was after midnight and I was barely hungry. My partner wanted his steak, so we did order lightly and as per usual, the food was just meh with the steak being the least desirable thing. They did not cook it to the temperature requested and it was not a great quality steak. It appeared they tried to mask this by drenching it with butter. SMH. It was especially being that we&apos;d just had steaks at Steak 48 and Eddie V&apos;s in the two days prior ... Vic&apos;s never compares. The Thai spot near our home makes a better steak too!!

Anyway, we decided against any additional drinks or dessert because why? We were brought two 1/4 glasses of champagne that we didn&apos;t ask for and didn&apos;t want, presumably because of the New Year. We both agreed that this place will never be in the rotation with our favorite steakhouses and I&apos;d also like to note the manager never did come back to address the issue. We therefore took it into our own hands. Although it is very unlike us to not tip 25%, the service and experience were so abhorrent that we decided not to tip at all. After all, the server&apos;s response to me was to just put it behind me. Hope he can put that behind him!

NEVER EVER AGAIN."
5,"This is an upscale restaurant with the most tender steaks that I can recall ever tasting, to the point with it could be cut with a fork in the absence of a knife. The crab cakes were filled with crab meat fillets were barely noted. The drinks were small but still had a kick to it.

If you don&apos;t dress well, you may feel out of place as some customers dress to the max. You not treated any differently by the staff if your not as the staff are super friendly.

This may not be a place for people who feels uncomfortable spending money on their food, but my opinion it was worth it."
5,"Very friendly staff, Steve was our server and made the experience seamless. I love the atmosphere and the vibe! The menu was easy to understand and I ordered the crab cake and quail for appetizer it was GREAT! All the food we ordered left well beyond satisfied, I&apos;ll be back and def would refer!"

Quality: 4
Service: 4
Taste: 4

Stopped by for dinner for the first time and quite frankly, not what I expected.

I had a reservation for 1 and had to wait for my table upon arrival. The hostess finally said the table was ready but when she walked me to the area they were still preparing and we had to wait.

For service, my waiter was kind which I appreciated but he was working a section full of birthday parties (apparently most people in the restaurant this night were celebrating birthdays) and so not as attentive as he could be.

The first choice was a lobster bisque. It came out after quite some time and had little to no lobster. The flavors just weren&apos;t there and it took time to get a hold of my waiter to get some pepper for it.

For my main I went with the prime ribeye and added the herbed crab topping ... this was the greatest let down. The steak unfortunately was not seasoned thoroughly as more than half of it was completely flavorless and the other half flavored. The topping was also bland. Herbed crab and somehow they missed the mark... 

The side I opted for here was the au gratin potatoes. I went with this because I was curious to if they could best Pappas Bros and they did. This au gratin potatoes was the best dish of the entire night.

With the size of my steak and side it&apos;s no surprise that I couldn&apos;t handle a large dessert. I went with a kiwi and strawberry sorbet and coconut gelato trio and my favorite was the gelato.

The wine selections isn&apos;t as extensive for glasses here but I did enjoy every glass I had.

Overall, I&apos;ve had better steak and bisque and so not much to call home about here. Would definitely return but I would need my steak cooked much more efficiently."
5,"Fantastic food, fantastic staff, fantastic ambiance. Live music was a special touch! Order the pear martini, you won&apos;t regret it!"
3,"I&apos;m somewhere between a 3 and 3.5 because I know this restaurant can do better but unfortunately the service we received makes it hard for me to go any higher.  

Parking: you can valet or there is street metered parking but this is downtown so its a lot of one way streets so be mindful of that.

I came here with a group of 7 for a birthday dinner during Houston Restaurant Week. If you come with a large party, make sure everyone is on time, otherwise they will not seat you. 

I guess i&apos;ll start with the service. It was subpar for a fine dining restaurant. The waiter was VERY slow. We barely saw her throughout the meal, we had to stop other waiters to get ours. Yet we saw her checking on other tables quite frequently. The thing that bothers me the most when going out with large parties is that, some establishments include an 18-20% gratuity. In this case 20% - which i have absolutely no problem paying IF we get great service. It has now become a thing of, the waiter knows they will get it so they give the bare minimum service which is terrible. 

The food:
Drink: London in Texas - i loved it! It was very refreshing. Almost like an ice tea with a hint of fresh fruit and alcohol of course.
App: lobster bisque - lacking flavor, needed season but a decent amount of lobster in it
Meal: filet with mashed potatoes and green beans. Steak was pretty good, slightly overcooked (i ordered medium blackened) but the mashes potatoes had a nice consistent texture and the greens were basic. Everything needed seasoning to be honest.
Dessert: croissant bread pudding-  this was not what i thought it would be. I actually very much disliked it. The texture, the flavor, i only ate the ice cream

Overall, i think this just was not the best experience. I have been to this location before and got much better service and food."
3,"First time Vic &amp; Anthony&apos;s experience.
The bartender Mr. G was less than welcoming. You could feel it in his spirit.  When asking for anything, it&apos;s wasn&apos;t giving full attention to.  So I&apos;ll have to request it several times.  
The lady who sat next to me, (who&apos;s a brown lady as well), notice the service I received.  Ms. W shared that, she received the same treatment initially, as sat down, prior to ordering something. 
When I sat at the bar, their were ONLY 2 guest souls in the room, one elder white guy at the bar; and one young brown girl, who I sat near.  sitting NOT BUSY at ALL.  (So it&apos;s safe to say, they cherry pick, the service you get)

I honestly didn&apos;t have a taste for anything nor was I hungry, I visit to use my reward, from my select club card.  I ordered the salmon, cause I figured you can&apos;t mess that up.  My Salmon was cooked to perfection, but the presentation was busy to the extreme, and overwhelming with fresh parsley; and whatever else was garnished on there.  It took away from the salmon so much, that it taste very earthly; the corn and other veggies was a bit fresh and gave it some-what a nice balanced. Beware of shells from the crab meat.  Yikes. 

When a gentleman came to collect the dish ware after boxing my own meal (which I didn&apos;t mind, since I didn&apos;t plan to take the garden from the salmon with me.  The other lady made a observation and a statement to me.)

It started when I asked Mr. G. For confirmation on my select reward card, and explained in great detail reasoning of my request.  He calls for a manager to confirm, after my explanation (obviously Mr. G wasn&apos;t knowledgeable on checking balances on reward cards).  He related the message to management in a sarcastic way, (...&quot;needed to check her reward, cause possibly someone else may have used it, however that could have been&quot;).  I only sat at the bar, because I was dining alone.  Not to drink.  Mr. G told me drinks are NOT covered from rewards.  Cool. (Wasn&apos;t planning on drinking anyway.  I&apos;m more of a tea lady).  I asked for a menu, he hands me a &quot;DRINK MENU&quot;.  I then ask for a dinner menu.   He made me a glass of water, i asked for lemons.  Honestly I didn&apos;t get a lemon until I requested hot water to make my tea.   I asked for lemons again, and got it after I boxed my food. 
I didn&apos;t get complimentary bread until I ordered my meal.  I ordered maybe 25 minutes after I was sitting and chatting.

Over all I didn&apos;t care for the service.  Management had very pleasant spirit, he confirm my request, &amp; checked both of my reward cards. 
I didn&apos;t care for my food, but I didn&apos;t complain. Energy was completely off for me, that I received from the Mr. G the bartender (I was NOT the only guest who felt this way). 
The best part of my visit is that I met someone new, who was very genuine and our energy click like a magnet.  If I was to ever return to Vic, I wouldn&apos;t plan to sit at the Bar. 
Ironically my ex, suggested Vic &amp; Ant&apos;s for my birthday dinner, (we dined at Brennan&apos;s instead)"
5,"Went in for dinner earlier this week to celebrate my birthday. I was beyond impressed with Vic &amp; Anthony&apos;s. Every minute of our dining experience was exceptional. The service was phenomenal, the food was exquisite. The wine list is extensive. I ordered a filet mignon topped with foie gras. It was by far the best steak I have ever had. Cooked to perfection, tender, full of flavor. Every bite melted in my mouth. Our server even brought us a dessert on the house which was a very nice surprise.
I would give 100 stars (   ) if Yelp would let me."
5,Mike was very knowledgeable of the menu selections and also very welcoming and respectful when removing our finished plates. My best friend and I enjoyed ourselves. We weren&apos;t interrupted annoyingly. The food was awesome and our cocktails were strong. The plating was superb.
5,"Oh god - This place is good 
Tomahawk wagyu steak has to be ordered Medium and if you lucky you get the Filet mignon as a part of the steak and it cuts like a marble when you bite after placing your share in the super hot butter plate that also tends to cook your medium done meat -

Oh boy - don&apos;t eat the bread !!!!!!! Stop it !!!!!!!"
5,"This was my first time dining here overall great experience. We came for Valentine&apos;s day and unfortunately it was set to snow that evening but ended up snowing way later than they predicted so we were able dine in and enjoy our date. Eddie was our server! He was wonderful very helpful with suggestions! We ended up getting the jumbo lump crab cake as an appetizer it was the big enough to share and quite delicious! We ended up ordering a prime ribeye cooked medium complemented with the jumbo lump crab Oscar scampi style shrimp, Heartbrand NY strip steak cooked medium complemented with roasted bone marrow bacon, a side of Au gratin  potatoes, and fried lobster Mac n cheese. The steaks and their complements were cooked perfectly we were not disappointed! The potato were good. The lobster Mac wasn&apos;t my favorite the lobster tails were fried with a nice crunchy crust but the macoroni wasn&apos;t what I expected not as creamy and even had veggies in it. We had Remy XO and lemon drop martinis as our cocktails  Would definitely recommend dining here my boyfriend said this is his new favorite steakhouse! We will be back."
5,"Vic &amp; Anthony&apos;s is one of our favorite steak restaurants.  They do have a variety of different steaks and steak toppings. If you are not in the mood for steak, they have other options for you as well.  The appetizers and sides are typically served family style and are made for sharing. Some of our favorite appetizers are the crabcakes, cream spinach, and sliced bacon.  One of the top side dishes you can order is the lobster mac &amp; cheese.

Their wine list is quite extensive. They have very few bottles that are less than $100. They have some bottles that are as expensive as $15,000.  They have an extensive list of wines from all over the world including countries such as Argentina, France, Italy, South Africa, Australia, and many others.  

If you need to host a private event, they have multiple private meeting rooms available upstairs. Some of them are very large and can hold a large multitude of people. Others are smaller and will hold as few as 10 or so. Typically, there is a room minimum to host an event.

The service is always very good. We have always received excellent service from every wait-person we have had here. Reservations are highly recommended. This is a Landry&apos;s restaurant so be sure you utilize your Landry&apos;s Select Club membership to earn valuable points.  Valet parking is available for a fee.

Bottom line - Very good steaks. A multitude of appetizers and side dishes are available as well and typically served family style. And exclusive and extensive wine list. We have been pleased with every visit here. Bon appétit."
5,"Outstanding. I&apos;ve been here a couple times but this was the first time since I&apos;ve started writing yelp reviews. For a Friday night, we were lucky to get a relatively last minute reservation for 3 at 6:30. The food was nothing short of incredible.

Two of the folks in our party ordered the lobster bisque, and while it&apos;s off menu, it&apos;s been a staple to V&amp;A&apos;s for over 75 years, simply to die for.

The sides are without question some of the best in the city, this time we tried the au gratin potatoes (which I could funnel in to my mouth continuously given the chance), the Brussel sprouts (crispy and delicious), and the creamed spinach (not recommended) 

As for entrees, I had the 6 oz Wagyu ribeye (cooked Rare+) and it simply melted in my mouth (it&apos;s a Wagyu after all!). My father ordered the 8 oz filet which was probably a 9/10, and the real shocker was the Red Snapper my wife ordered which was flaky, delicious, and with an outstanding sauce.

Jumbo lump crab cake is a must with any steak, I wish I had a stock of them available to me at all times."
4,"Great place to eat the service really nice.
We ask a cocktail and our waitress recommend to us an amazing one that match with our food. The salmon with shrimp that I asked for was delicious and the steak of my husband good election too. Definitely a recommend restaurant and of course I&apos;ll comeback."
4,Good place and good food. Very nice private room much better than than some of the snooty overpriced private clubs downtown (CC).
1,When I arrived at a high price steak house and order a glass of Sauvignon I expect it to be in a nice glass not a convention mini glass.  That was an instant turn off for me. The decor is wonderful as I have come to expect from a top steakhouse.  However first impressions are important to me and my first impression lacked the wow I was seeking especially when I plan to spend over $200 for dinner for two.  Step up your game.  Also bar server was dismissive and impersonal. She made us very uncomfortable like my partner and I did not belong there.
