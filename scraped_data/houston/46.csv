5,"Best cocktails in Houston, PERIODT! In order for this place to stay open they had to knock down all their drinks from $12 to eight dollars and serve &quot;snacks&quot; for four dollars With each drink. Essentially the drinks are still $12 you were just getting free snacks and helping them stay open during this Covid pandemic and operational. So they do not have to fire there are hard-working staff. That&apos;s a cause that I can get behind because nowhere in Houston can you get drinks this well-made and delicious. If you want a old-fashioned as it should be this is your first stop in Houston.

I personally love a good French 75, and boy do they do a good job! Some of the snacks are dried peas, sesame sticks, &amp; sweet and spicy nuts. Come help this establishment stay thriving through the pandemic and support small business!"
5,"Anvil is the best bar in the entire US and no one can convince me otherwise!! They make hundreds (dare I say thousands) of fantastic cocktails all for $8-$12 max -- you can&apos;t touch a decent cocktail in other big cities for less than $14! Anvil has a self-park lot + valet, and they recently converted their front 2 spaces into a covered, heated patio. They also started to sell several to-go bottles of pre-mixed cocktails, which make a unique gift or party offering. Side note: the pretzel is to-die-for if you need a snack; I could drink the beer-based dipping cheese on its own.
Apart from Anvil&apos;s incredible house creations (if you like Fernet, I highly recommend you order the off-menu Golden Gate Swizzle), all of their bartenders can also make any classic cocktail you could imagine. Anvil is NOT pretentious, and their bartenders reject the snobbish &quot;mixologist&quot; title... but don&apos;t let that fool you - their bartenders are extremely well-trained! Trainees have to shadow / bar-back for 6+ months before being considered full-time - including several &apos;tests,&apos; such as the Blind 50 taste test. Anvil&apos;s final bartender &quot;initiation&quot; event (my favorite) is the 100 Night, where the bar sells all 100 classics on their menu for $1, and the trainee has to make ALL OF THEM as fast (and perfect) as possible. Every season, each staff bartender creates their own new &apos;feauture&apos; cocktail for the seasonal menu... and those drinks can be forever ordered even after they&apos;ve rotated off the menu. Another highlight is the ever-rotating &quot;Break Even Bottle&quot; of different high-quality spirits, which are sold by the ounce at retail cost. There is always something new to try at Anvil, no matter how often you visit.
All of these qualities make Anvil the perfect place for... well, anything: a first date, a wedding anniversary, a girlfriends&apos; get-together, or even a post-workout snack (speaking from experience). My fiancée and I even had our engagement photos taken here! If you&apos;ve made it this far in my novel-length review, I&apos;ll tell you my last and final Anvil accolade: All of their 100 List cocktails are 50% off during 4-5pm Happy Hour** on weekdays! HH is the perfect time to try new cocktails that you&apos;re not sure you&apos;ll like and normally wouldn&apos;t order at the full price out of fear.
**Happy Hour may be suspended during covid service; I haven&apos;t had the heart to ask because I just want to give them all my money so they&apos;ll stay in business."
5,"Open with distancing during Covid!

Anvil is technically operating as a restaurant during the pandemic. Meaning, you have to order food with each round of drinks. They have a &quot;snack&quot; menu averaging ~$4 per item - like bar nuts, chips, olives with orange zest. To compensate for this, they&apos;ve decreased the price of their cocktails to $8 each. Yes. Eight. Dollars. I was SHOOK. How can they only be charging $8?!!! We felt like we were stealing. And honestly, I would&apos;ve been happy to pay $12 (dare I say $14) AND $4 for chips to help this awesome biz out. 

I got the Princeton and a Kir Royale. The Princeton was soOoOo good. It was like a perfect gin martini with port at the bottom. I enjoyed the first half as a martini, and stirred in the port to enjoy the second half of the drink. I finished my night with a simple Kir Royale - a delicious classic.

We felt safe, loved the ambiance, enjoyed our bar snacks (sheeps milk cheese, country ham, castelvetranos with orange zest, chips), and supported an amazing biz with highly skilled bartenders. Can&apos;t wait to come back!"
4,Consistently good drinks and great atmosphere. Perfect for couples and small groups. We always take our out  of town friends here. Great selection of cocktails!
3,"They are open for covid but expect a long wait. They actually follow strict guidelines and I appreciate it. However, FULL DISCLAIMER: they do require you to buy something from the snack/food menu with your drink. I wish I was told this from the very beginning. I really didn&apos;t wanna spend $4 on a bowl of sesame sticks, and mind you each person that wanted a drink had to get an item. There are plenty of other safe bars that you can go to, but if you&apos;re in the area and are concerned with COVID, this is your safe space. It wasn&apos;t worth it for me and I don&apos;t see myself coming back until the pandemic is over (hopefully soon!)."
4,"We were kind of looking for a drink and eating place for the night, and stumbled across this place because everything else we were looking for was closed. So they had some covid rules in place which was good. Ordered some drink and had to order some chips because they required &quot;food&quot; to be ordered so it&apos;s considered to be okay. I wasn&apos;t too okay with that but rules are rules I guess. The drink menu on the qr code was straight forward and very easy to read it&apos;s divided up into categories so that you get an idea as to what kind of drink you are getting."
5,"Pre covid review: Nice quiet bar (Sunday visit) with a great bartender who knew what he was talking about with cocktails and whisky, and not in a pretentious way. The garnishes on their drinks are beautiful too."
5,"The premier craft cocktail bar in Houston! If you want a special cocktail experience where the bartenders craft your drink with such care and precision like it&apos;s an art form, this place is for you. Yes, the price tag matches the care put into each drink, but it is well worth it. I certainly recommend stepping outside of your typical drink comfort zone and trying something interesting on the menu - this is the place to trust and do that!"
2,"We went twice this weekend and will not likely go back. The drink prices do not match the menu price (see Cream of Kentucky and Weller Antique). They are also requiring a food purchase with EVERY drink. I could get behind that with covid, however last night the ONLY food items they had were peas and sesame sticks, which no one in our party wanted or liked. You also get charged for ice. That should be disclosed up front. Overall, too many bad business practices for me to support this establishment."
5,"Anvil takes crafted cocktails to another level; I&apos;ve been to many bars in Houston and none of them has measured up to its level. I am always on the look out for prohibition-style places and I am not sure if Anvil is supposed to reflect that entirely but all of their drinks definitely exhibit character and quality.
Ambience is relaxed and lights are extremely dim.
I believe they are currently closed; I am writing a review for my visit back in February. Looking forward to when I get to return."
5,"It&apos;s Lauren&apos;s first time in Houston from New York; a black car charters her here. I meet her in one of Anvil&apos;s dark booth&apos;s and massage her thigh, nodding vigorously at her stories of her nightmare laundromat in Queens, visiting her rich family in India, what with her servant Bhagu always pouring tea into tiny metal cups with everyone in the house half-naked because of summer. In Anvil, you&apos;d never know you were in a flat swamp. It feels metropolitan. Swanky. Much like the large estate on the tobacco plantations her family owns. 

Lauren&apos;s fresh from the airport, her backpack beside her. Beats headphones around her neck. The rest of Anvil&apos;s patrons are much better dressed but not nearly as attractive. Lauren&apos;s frustrated about a lot of things. Anvil&apos;s too-long menu and that New York poets are being exoticised for their ethnicity. I try to make the case that she should move to Houston, in with me. That Houston has cool bars, too. That sometimes there are poetry readings in the shops around Anvil. My offer is clear wrap see-through. She knows I&apos;m up to no good here when she&apos;s not around. That I&apos;m womanizing while she&apos;s on her Queens bound train. The staff at Anvil know me well, and Lauren can speculate. 

If she elects to come move here, I stand a chance as an artist in Houston. I&apos;ll have a brown poetess on my arm. One foot in the pool. But if hip places like Anvil can&apos;t convince her, then I&apos;ll really be on my island yelling obscenities at the sky. 

I order a drink that resembles a Manhattan called The Preakness. Like Lauren, it&apos;s sweet. But unlike Lauren, it&apos;s strong. 

She won&apos;t ever tell me her true feelings. About Anvil or otherwise. She&apos;ll smile and nod and be too agreeable for her own good. It&apos;s easy to dismiss her as some sweet and obedient thing, but there are demons lurking for sure. And, her wanting me to love her is a general desperation to be loved rather than her enjoying who I am as a person. 

&quot;The bartenders here are experts in chemistry. They have to go through a whole apprenticeship just to work here,&quot; I say. 

I should ask the Anvil bartenders if Lauren and I mix, I think. Maybe they&apos;ll say no, or maybe they&apos;ll say we&apos;re an awesome cocktail but one that goes straight to the head. One that can really mess someone up. I&apos;ll spare them the awkward conversation. Besides, there are so many ingredients in their drinks, they work too hard to be interrupted with such a question. I deem Anvil bartenders the same way I regard Lauren putting up with me. I don&apos;t quite know how or why they do it."
5,Love this place. The bartenders are super knowledgeable and friendly. The menu is extensive and the bartenders are very friendly and knowledgeable.
5,"One of the bars I recommend any cocktail lover to go. They have one of the largest lists of cocktails I&apos;ve ever seen. To add to that they add their own twist to their various drinks too so don&apos;t expect a lousy old fashioned as the bartenders seem to know what they&apos;re doing. If you like boozy drinks and whiskey, I recommend trying the whiskey flip. The liquor menu is very large and you&apos;ll have a ball just looking at their collection. As of now you&apos;ll have to order food along with your drinks as the bar has to comply with new restrictions to stay open. 

The location itself is great for a long night out with friends as it is next to other popular bars and locations like pistoleros, poison girl, and present company. Parking is easy to find depending on the day and time as there is a park nearby where you can find a spot. 

The general atmosphere is very laidback and styled as a early 20th century bar. Very dimly lit so it gives you a sense of privacy for those out on a date or who just want to have their sense of space with friends. Pre-coivid, the bar could get very packed at times but now the bar is very spacy so if you feel safe to go out then take advantage of it while you still can!"
5,"Just started coming here and it&apos;s already my favorite bar! The staff, Kory, Qwesha, and Alexander are super friendly and knowledgeable. I have enjoyed every cocktail that I&apos;ve had here, but my favorites are the Absinthe Suissesse, Plinys Tonic, and The Mexican firing squad. Definitely has a chill vibe and kickass music."
4,"Pro: Delicious drinks, I had the jalapeño gin drink and it was fantastic. 

Cons: It gets VERY packed and there is very limited seating, so if you have a group get there early to get a table.

Will return!"
5,"This is a lively happening bar! 

As the night starts out, it is quiet and you can get a table. But guard it because by 8 everyone is packed in and seats are valuable! What a crowd! 

Drinks aren&apos;t served you have to order from the bar and the bartender flags you down when they are ready. Food is your choice of Cheese Plate or Cheese Plate... :( but there are sides you can add to it. The scotch egg was pretty good!

The drinks were really hard drink and not so much beer and wine. That said, we needed the change and were in the mood for a good cocktail. 

Great place for stiff drinks and a healthy bill. But the atmosphere justifies it. It&apos;s not a place with bright lights for all the old folks -so know how to use your phone light to illuminate your menu otherwise you might not get a drink!

There is both indoor and outdoor seating available. We sat inside and it was close to standing room only when we left at 10:00. 

I will be back!"
5,"There is are parking lot specifically for Anvil across the street.

When you first walk in, the bartenders at the bar will hand you menus. The menu is interesting because they have customized drinks created specially from the bartenders at the bar. We got here at sundown and the lighting was very dim at the bar area. I had to used my phone screen light to read the descriptions on the menu.

I ordered the &quot;muddy waters&quot; as my first drink and was amazed by how smooth the drink was. The taste of alcohol was barley present and the sweetness of the drink was not overpowering. 

The bartenders were very friendly as well. Feel free to ask them any questions in regards to your drink. If you give them a preference of how you like your liquor, they&apos;ll draw something up for you."
5,"To this day, still one of my favorite if not favorite cocktail bars. I am glad they are still going strong. I love it how you can tell the bartender what kind of drinks you like and they will make you one that suits your tastes. As I have gotten older, I do need to pull out my phone flashlight to read the menu.

Definitely recommend an Anvil original, Pliny&apos;s tonic: spicy, cucumber, mint, delicious.

I always default to an Old Fashioned

My friend really likes the Laurel Agitator: gin, lemon, honeysuckle, egg white, pretty refreshing."
5,"Anvil is one of my favorite bars in the city! I&apos;ve been coming here for years, and for classic cocktails its one of the best in town and the world that I&apos;ve been to.

They can make you most any classic cocktail that strikes your fancy. In fact their menu contains over 100 classic cocktails, so they have just about something for anything. With that said, its a purist cocktail bar, so don&apos;t expect a Coke, Rum &amp; Coke, Vodka, or anything else you grab on the quick at your run of the mill bar--- The started carrying a little bit of vodka, but you need to be respectful if your asking for it. 

I saw a party guy come in asking for 4 vodka cokes, but walked away with 4 gin and tonics.

The place does get crowded, and drinks can take 5-10 min, or 10-20 if you want a Ramos Gin Fizz (shaken for a bit with 2&quot; of egg white fizz that sticks out of the glass). For something like and refreshing, check out the mojitos. Or for a mojito with a twist, try the Queen&apos;s Park Swizzle. If you like Scotch, give the Bobby H Burns or Blood &amp; Sand. If you want a strong agave based drink try the Brave. This place also makes an authentic Penicillin with two shots of different scotch, one of which is Laphroaig.

If you want to avoid the crowds come early, or stay late past when the post dinner crowd starts thinning out. For me I&apos;ve always enjoyed good conversation over cocktails.

Aside from the killer drinks, they also have a good street pretzel, pastrami sandwich, and meat and cheese platter if you are hungry..

One last thing. They have shots from their &quot;Break-even bottle&quot; which is a great chance to try an oz of some really exotic top shelf spirits at an affordable price."
5,"The Bees knees was the bizness.
The ambience is just perfect and gets you in the mood.
Tried off the books and was tasty. I want to try other options next time
Server was friendly too"
