5,"I love this place. I&apos;ve only eaten the chicken and beef tacos but I can vouch for them both. My friend ordered the pork and liked that. Their meat is well seasoned and cooked to perfection. I&apos;ve been back at least four times since I first discovered this truck and I look forward to going again soon.

They&apos;re open during quarantine if I&apos;m not mistaken but the hours may have changed slightly. 

Just go and thank me later."
5,"My housemates and I decided to stop by for tacos, and it was all of our first times. We thought everything we got was super delicious, and the lady taking orders was sweet as well. I ordered tacos on corn with barbacoa, trompo (marinated pork), and chicken. The trompo was my favorite because of just how well seasoned the pork was, but the flavors of all of the tacos were phenomenal and really allowed you to savor the food. Moreover, although the tacos are small, the portion of meat that they give you is pretty big. I will definitely be coming back here often moving forward! 

For your information, they always ask if you want cilantro and onions on your taco and provide free salsa (green and red). My housemates and I didn&apos;t know that the truck only takes cash, but there is an ATM in the convenience store nearby. However, there is a withdrawal fee, so that&apos;s something to keep in mind! The lot the truck is in is pretty small, so parking may be harder during a busier time of the day."
2,"Foods underwhelming.
Okay at best. Nothing special.

2 stars for the food- really Spicy red salsa, great green salsa.

Now to the negatives. There&apos;s something shady about the place and when other reviews talk about overcharging you- it&apos;s true. They round up each order we had.

My order came out to $18 and the girl taking the order told me she no longer has change. Mind you- it&apos;s cash only. Not even apologetic but expecting us to give it to her. It just doesn&apos;t feel right and seems like something they do at this truck. Didn&apos;t sit well with me but we had no choice.

Customer service is not there. We wanted more salsa as we got 8 tacos- nope. &quot; in the bag&quot;. Yes we know lol we just use a lot of salsa. Ya that was a no.

I expected more with the reviews but seems like it&apos;s been going down hill for sometime plus the shadiness of it all.

We won&apos;t be back and definitely don&apos;t recommend it here."
3,"We were so excited to try out this taco truck because of all the positive things we&apos;ve heard from our friends. We have two trucks we frequent often and wanted to add this one to our rotation. 

The first thing I noticed was the new prices, most items have gone up about 50 cents up to $2 for the tortas. I did my research and was excited to see some reviews stating they have complimentary avocado, however, that was not the case when we went. I also saw their tacos were small so I ordered 6 just for myself which was a good idea because I ate them all. The new menu doesn&apos;t have pastor listed as a meat but I asked the worker and they did have it. The pastor was really good especially with the pineapple. Barbacoa and fajita were solid but not the best we&apos;ve had. I would skip the chicken. The two sauces were good but watch out for the red sauce, a few drops goes a loooong way. 

Overall, the tacos were good but not the best I&apos;ve had. They also were a little pricey for their size. I would come again for the pastor but prob won&apos;t be stopping by too often."
1,"I&apos;ve been coming here quite a few times and never noticed if they&apos;ve overcharged me or not, but never missed any items til now.
Make sure you double check your bag, I had a taco missing and make sure you calculate correctly before paying.
I paid 3 dollars extra and missing tacos. Pissed

I&apos;ve read comments that they&apos;ve been overcharging and items missing as well.  Wish I read ahead of time."
5,"I went to this white and red food truck that permanently resides on W Alabama St &amp; Shepherd called Tacos Tierra Caliente (no IG). Their tacos are authentic &amp; tasty! You can pick from green or red sauces too but green is my favorite. I tried flour tortillas this time around just to switch it up but they do offer corn. They have very fast service so you won&apos;t have to wait long for your food. Also, THEY ARE CASH ONLY! One of my favorite hidden gems of Houston!"
5,What are the best locations I have ever went to  If your average San Diego check them out there awesome do not miss out the food is amazing
5,"I&apos;ve been coming here for years and their street  tacos never disappoint! Some of the best tacos in Houston. The al pastor and beef are my favorites. Their prices are very affordable too, keep in mind they&apos;re small so you&apos;ll need to order a few if you&apos;re hungry. Highly recommend!"
4,"Delicious Mexican tacos!! Our favorites were the beef and the barbacoa street tacos! Made fresh and the corn tortillas had a good flavor. The quesadillas were just ok, probably pass on those or try a meat other than chicken. Would come back here again if I was in the area and craving tacos!"
5,"Loved their tacos !!!! Pretty expensive but very good ! (Don&apos;t get the Gordita though lol ) 
Quesadillas are phenomenal and greeen salsa rocks"
5,"I went in search of authentic, simple tacos in Houston and Tacos Tierra did not disappoint! The barbacoa and chicken tacos were juicy and the perfect size. Cilantro, onions, meat and lime on a fresh warm corn tortilla. I&apos;ll be back!!"
4,"This spot has been bookmarked for my Houston visits for years now. After nearly ten visits to Houston, we finally made the 2 mike trek to Tacos Tierra Caliente to kick the day off strong with some breakfast tacos. Let&apos;s just say, we&apos;ll be back. 

This no frills taco truck is located in a small strip mall parking lot. Had it not been for the Yelp reviews, I probably would have never found myself pulling into the parking lot for this simple, unsuspecting truck. The menu is equally simple with a handful of breakfast and lunch dinner tacos available. Breakfast tacos are only $1 (I&apos;d recommend three/adult) and come in potato, chorizo and egg/bacon. I especially enjoyed the egg and chorizo combo with cheese. On the truck counter you&apos;ll find DIY salsa- both pack an awesome punch. 

My only wish would be that the breakfast tacos would have the fresh onion and cucumbers (or jalape√±o/carrot combo) that come with most other street tacos. However, next time, I can just plan for my own pairings at home. I love a splash of veggie and extra spice in their to break up the meat/cheese heaviness."
4,"Great tacos. THE HOT SAUCE IS AMAZING but be warned, it&apos;s not that hot on the mouth but will mess up your stomach if you overdo it like me. 
Take the tacos next door nextdoor to Alabama Ice House. They are even open on Christmas morning. Definitely one of the best taco trucks in the loop"
5,"Yes, these tacos are super cheap and super delicious. Be aware that they&apos;re tiny so I would need at least 3 tacos to fill me up. My favorites have been the carnitas and fajita tacos. Put on a generous amount of the green salsa which has a nice kick to it (not as spicy as the red one). 

The couple times I&apos;ve went later at night, they&apos;ve run out of most meats so I would definitely try to go earlier in the day."
4,"Really really good tacos. Get the barbacoa, and thank me later.

I ended up getting one of each - barbacoa, beef, chicken and pork. All were very very good, but I ended up liking the barbacoa the most. So tender, fatty and juicy, the texture is almost like oxtail. The tacos were on the smaller side, I got 5 and was at a content level of fullness, but I&apos;d get 6-8 on a really hungry day. Service was super quick and we&apos;re generous with the sauces. Watch out for the red one, it&apos;s super hot (but in a good way)"
1,They are lazy and careless. They added pork to my tacos when i ordered potato egg and cheese. I&apos;m vegetarian and now am unable to eat my meal. This isn&apos;t okay. Please try next time.
4,"Casual food truck located in a parking lot.
Al pastor taco was the best flavor especially with a healthy dose of lime and green sauce. It&apos;s only served with cilantro and onions. 
Tried fajita which was good and pork skin was interesting. 
The tacos were tiny yet extremely cheap. 
Fairly on par with the delicious tacos from California."
5,The best tacos in town. One of the few places that has a veggie taco &amp; it&apos;s great! Chicken tacos are great. Sauces are tasty &amp; spicy. Only thing missing is the elotes.
5,"Best best best taco truck in Houston !!!! Excellent service and never disappointing, with delicious tacos with many options beef chicken which ever you prefer, there is tables across from them.
It&apos;s fast. It&apos;s cheap. There&apos;s an ice house across the street (no drinks available at this taco truck). The big quesadilla is huge. The tacos are tasty. Classic pit stop for me when I&apos;m hungry."
3,"Good. I will not add more on this matter as others have explained how good, but I can&apos;t five 5 stars b/c as a few reviewers have mentioned, they will overcharge if you do not speak spanish. I know this, because my friends normally order for me in Spanish. The one day I went by myself, I ended up paying more than usual (~$5 more than usual). It doesn&apos;t matter if reviewers say &apos;pay attention&apos; because the last time I was there, prices weren&apos;t listed. You would have to ask how much each will be to then determine if they charged correctly or not, but who really wants to do that. It&apos;s disappointing, but there you go."
