5,"Loved this place. 

Standard burger joint fare, done really well. Lots of space, including a good bit of outdoor patio seating so plenty of room for social distancing. Friendly and fast service and good prices. Definitely a good spot overall if you&apos;re looking for a burger and fries.

Also super dog friendly. They offered treats for the dogs and brought out cups of peanut butter, whipped cream and dog treats for them. The dogs loved them. Really nice.

So this spot checks all the boxes for a solid lunch. Good food, friendly people, lots of space, good prices and a chill vibe. Would definitely return."
5,"Best burger place in town. 

Get the classic, but remove the seasoning salt. Doesn&apos;t need! Add Gouda cheese. Medium rare is lovely. 

Also- get the hand cut fries . Off the charts! 

My one wish would be that they not add sugar to their spicy ketchup. I&apos;ve been buying primal kitchen spicy ketchup with no added sugar. 

They have a unique beer selection. Def try the light and creamy Buckle Bunny  best cream ale I&apos;ve tried. Won awards. I can see why.  I also love Wabash blueberry  ale. It&apos;s not sweet. Well balanced. 

The staff are super friendly. The patio has a nice vibe. Great to watch games on the patio. And it&apos;s super dog friendly. They even have a pup shake and they bring water for your dog. 

I like to try their special burgers too. They once had one with hash browns and eggs with a blueberry sauce. Ir was good the next day! 

And if you like fish, you will love the Mahi Mahi sandwich. 

Everting is simple yet top quality. Great to go dining. 

Tip- look for gift card specials. Also download the toast app."
5,The Burger Joint in Montrose is a safe bet for great burgers and fries. The outdoor seating area is comfortable and the service is good. They serve local beers on draft and everything is just right.
3,"Burger Joint 

Cookies and Cream Milkshake

Price: $5.41

Taste: The Oreo taste was evident and felt throughout the entire milkshake. This cookie and cream milkshake could be up there with Chick-Fil-A. Try it if you don&apos;t believe me. 

Consistency: Soft-served is used so the consistency was smooth. A little looser than I like, but it wasn&apos;t milky. They provide a thick straw so the cookie pieces passes through with no problem.

Appearance: Nicely put together. The whipped cream filled the top of the cup and the cookie crumbles served as a nice touch.

Quality of Service: When I entered the cashier was on the phone taking another order. Another gentleman said he would be right with me when he got off the phone. With two cash registers I am not sure why he couldn&apos;t take my order, but I wasn&apos;t up in arms about the brief wait. All outdoor seating, even the indoor seating is outdoors. I like the vibe of this location and they provide heating lamps if you&apos;re cold.

Overall Rating: 3 Shakes"
1,"Got food poisoning from yall :(

I ordered some food a month ago (was an avid costumer for a long time), and immediately after eating my meal I felt nausea and vomited/had diahrea. Took me weeks to fully heal and regain appetite. Due to covid I could not leave home for doctor.

Currently dealing with a possible pinworm infection that I got after the order I ate.

I contacted owner via email and had no response, so I hope they reach out to me as a response to what I say.

This review will be updated if any of my medical results worsen/improve once I am able to go again to my doctor after this freezing storm.

Has anyone else felt sick after eating here during the month of january or before?"
5,"You wanna know how to run a restaurant? Every freakin detail here is perfect. Like any joint, you line up to order, and get excellent courteous service. Take a number and your order appears, almost magically in front of you! 

MnC was wonderfully rich, creamy cheese. Onion rings could not have been better. Burger Perfect! Music on sound system Excellent 90&apos;s. Plate cleared instantly! Lots of NFL on TVs.... 

Trying to find fault is impossible! Even the weather was great for dining al fresco!"
5,"A win for all-- two-leggeds and four! Perfect spot to bring your dog after a day of play at the Buffalo Bayou dog park. They&apos;ll love the puppy shake of peanut butter, whipped cream, and cookies. And the sweet wait staff will bring a bowl of water too. 

The food was fresh, hot, served quickly, and delicious. One order of fries can be shared. The burgers are big. And we love the outdoor seating. 

Great, casual, Fido-friendly place to refuel. Plus a surprisingly good selection of cold beer on tap."
3,"I really liked the environment of this place.. the lights on the trees, numerous TVs so no matter where you&apos;re sitting you can watch something (seems like a great spot to watch sports tbh), and the staff was also friendly. 

I really liked the queso fries and my salted caramel milkshake. They had a couple options for boozey milkshakes, which I would like to come back and try some time! The Mexi Burger was... interesting.. I think the ham is what threw me off.. lol.. didn&apos;t feel it was worth the $10, sadly. 

Parking lot is also very small, I&apos;m worried about how it might look on a busy day...

Would probably try again, but with a different burger next time."
4,"The Burger joint is a pretty good place to come if you are wanting to be safe and precautious during covid times.  There is a nice outdoor area where you sit and enjoy your delish burger. 

 The fries were OK but the Burger was pretty awesome. I wanted to get the traditional cheeseburger just so I could get a good sense of what their traditional Burger is like. The meat was very tender and juicy. I requested that it was cooked a solid medium and I was not disappointed! Overall cool Burger place to sit and enjoy a solid burger."
4,Very good burgers.  But burgers and great shakes.  Lowered one star as the impossible option is really overly expensive beyond other places that have it also.
4,"What a great place! Drove from
Kingwood to try it out. Totally worth it. 
The burger was delicious and the atmosphere was very nice!"
4,"Came here for dinner and saw that this place had several good reviews, so we decided to take a shot and try it out. Parking is a bit difficult to find in such a small parking lot, especially for how busy this place is, but we got lucky and found a spot (despite it being a bit tight, we made it!)

We ordered at the register - I ordered the short stacked burger, medium with bacon and parm fries and garlic herb sauce on the side. We got our number and chose a table, as we awaited our meals. The food came out relatively quick and my burger was pretty big. Makes sense considering it was stacked with so much goodness - pulled pork, mac and cheese, an egg, and slaw. It was good, but it was too big of a burger for myself to handle on my own. The bacon parm fries were good, but I didn&apos;t really like the fries being soft/soggy. I prefer them a bit more crispy, but I can&apos;t complain, as the flavoring paired with the garlic herb sauce was exceptionally delicious. 

The staff is attentive and friendly and this place is dog friendly, as well. They have 3 options of dog treats/snacks for your furry friend should you bring him/her here! Overall, the atmosphere of the place is vibing and it was pretty packed when we came in. The line was out the door for sure. If you want some decent burgers, I&apos;d recommend this place definitely!"
5,The burgers are very good and they are not over priced. They do a good job of social distancing. The onion rings are the best.
5,"I recently visited The Burger Joint with my girlfriend. I ordered the Mexi Burger topped with a fried egg with a side of garlic aioli, and she ordered a simple burger with sweet potato fries. 

The Mexi Burger topped with a fried egg and some aioli is probably one of my favorite burgers that I&apos;ve ever had. No joke. It has beef and ham with avocado and other toppings. Absolutely delicious. I was disappointed afterwards only because I had run out of burger to eat. The sweet potato fries are pretty great too. 

The workers are all very nice and even guided us to an outdoor seating area where we could enjoy a nice socially distanced meal. This place also has various flat screens showing football games and other sports outdoors by shaded picnic tables. 5/5. Go try it!"
5,"Super clean, great staff and excellent burgers. 
We ordered the basic burger with cheddar and sweet potato fries and have returned twice for the same. 

Particularly like the large outdoor seating area with spread out tables, TVs, and heaters for those cooler days.  It is very clean and they are one of the best places we&apos;ve been to during the pandemic in terms of a safe environment."
5,"This spot had nothing but raves about it and it initially struck me as a place to give a try. NOT ONE PERSON WAS WRONG! This place has everything going for it: location, well cooked burgers that remain juicy and flavorful, well balanced flavors, options of fries to suit all taste buds, plenty of food to fill even the hungriest, and great prices for the quality that you receive. I luckily didn&apos;t go on a busy night (15 min wait). Curb side was easy and very professional. This will be one of my go to places. The fire burger was my recommended choice. The spice was not subtle nor was it so bold that one couldn&apos;t finish the burger. It hit!!! If you get a double, you&apos;ll love yourself twice as much haha."
5,Good burger spot for sure ! Never got my turkey dinner but it&apos;s okay maybe next year! Family against it ! So it is what it is! I enjoyed my lamb burger and milk shake with fries ! Remind me of the good old high schools days for some reason! He workers were lit so good spot for sure !
5,"DAP!! (Down a$$ place) great service, curbside pick up. Very attentive, good food. TVs all over, great beers on tap even though I don&apos;t drink drink. Veggie burger, vegan cheese, add jalapeños and some avocado and you gucci fam! Wish they had vegan Mac tho :/ one day."
4,The place is good Burger and Hot dog are good too. Crew are so fast and polite it&apos;s a little expensive but come to try different fast food ( homemade style is good)
5,"Came during all the ice, and props to the kitchen, 200+ orders and I see everybody hustling around. Was about a 2 hour wait but I always love the food here. Worth the wait on the cold day. But yeah props the the kitchen and all the staff for putting up with all the needless complaining."
