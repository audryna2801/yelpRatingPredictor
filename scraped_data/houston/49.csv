5,"Wow- absolutely loved lunch here!

Covid safety protocol in place with masks, gloves, and spacing. 

Both the food and service were fantastic!  I got the chicken fried chicken, altered to have gravy on the side, sub fries instead of mashed potatoes and green beans instead of black eyed peas... So yeah, changed it a bit. The chicken was so juicy, tasty, just perfectly cooked and the gravy was very good. I got it on the side because I like to dip but I&apos;m sure it would&apos;ve been fine on the chicken. The green beans were so good- seasoned with onions and garlic. And fries- wow, crispy outside and full or flavor. The whole dish was a LOT of food and I have left overs for dinner. 

My friend got the crab cake and said it was full of crabmeat and she really liked it. 

We shared red velvet cake which was a large slice and very moist - wow!

Service was very attentive and added to the great lunch. 

So many items on the menu looked good that I can&apos;t wait to come back and try more things!!"
5,"I highly recommend going here, we had a table of seven and everyone was pleased. Not only was the food good but the service as well. Valet parking is available as well as parking garage located on the east side of the restaurant. The waitress was professional and very knowledgeable of the menu with good recommendations. I ordered the fried pork chop and it came out really really delicious. This place can get pretty crowded but everyone is social distancing and it accommodates everyone like your the only table in the restaurant."
5,"Graces was delicious. Visited for the first time on a Sunday. It gets packed out on the Lords day so expect about a 30 minute wait. They are covid aware in here so you&apos;ll be properly spaced from most other tables.

Check the pictures out attached, we tried quite a few things and everything was flavorful and portioned generously. 

Don&apos;t cheat yourself, treat yourself.. and come here for a GREAT meal.

Also, black owned. :) So, show some love."
5,"The Food and the drinks here were amazing. Our waiter, (my brother from another mother) SAM... he&apos;s the man. He offered and made suggestions for dishes to try. This oysters with pickles was amazing. Breakfast potatoes and Sam had the guys in the back whip it up with peppers and onions. 

We sat up front by the chef and line cook window. These guys back there man, were cooking up a storm. The drinks were very good. They make a great old fashioned here. The service was great. This is a must if you are visiting Houston. Really had fun time here. 

Live, love and laugh

2,"HOLY SALTY FOOD BATMAN !!!

We went on a Sunday around 1pm. Bad idea!!
It was packed, packed, packed. We had a 2 hour hour wait (and yes it actually took 2 hours).

Not a family friendly or date night restaurant, it is loud and has a party atmosphere, the crowd is young, so go with your friends, leave the family and kids at home.
There are no reservations so go early and be prepared to wait.
Oh ! and after waiting 2 hours we sat down and had a lovely card on our table that stated we were limited to about 1 hour and 30 minutes of eating time (which I guess makes sense because of the big crowd waiting to eat).

Our waiter was friendly but because the crowds at each table were so big it took him forever to get back to us each time. But wether you like your waiter or not, they add 18% gratuity to your bill, no matter what the size of your table is.

Now on to the food.
Each meal comes with either soup or salad. We chose the caesar salad and I must say, that was the BEST caesar we have ever had. 
But
The rest of our food, NO THANK YOU! Everything was beyond salty. No exaggerating. I like salt but wow, the brussel sprouts burned my tongue (like the way pineapple does) because it was so salty. The mashed potatoes, mac and cheese, the bater on the chicken ... ALL SALTY. We only took bites of our food and took the rest home and threw it in the trash.

I would honestly only go back for the caesar salad and wouldn&apos;t recommend this place to any of my friends."
5,"My first time here was for brunch a couple years ago but I finally returned for dinner. I came for a birthday right before closing and started off with a sidecar to drink. My second sidecar was better than the first, though. For my meal I had the stuffed chicken with broccolini and mashed potatoes and would y&apos;all believe that I was almost scraping the plate when I finished!!! This was so good. It was stuffed with crab and topped with a creamy Cajun sauce. The broccolini was perfectly tender and the potatoes were a good texture. My boyfriend ordered the stuffed poblano and the taste I had was good as well! The sauce almost tasted like etouffee. Although I was with a larger party, the service was still decent. I wish I would&apos;ve saved room for dessert."
3,Visited this place for brunch on a Saturday. There was a wait however it moved along pretty fast. The service was great however our food was cold. I&apos;m Willing to give this place a second try.
5,"I cannot stress how excellent the service is here. Recently had a chance to visit my favorite server Angel and had a lovely time. Your drinks never go empty, you never want for anything and they really do think of everything. There&apos;s even complimentary bread with a sweet butter pairs perfectly. 

I&apos;ve had a few previous reviews that detail dishes and parking and such so no need to rehash all that. Just wanted to drop a line to say that I&apos;ve never had such consistently excellent service anywhere else. Never change, Grace&apos;s."
5,"Since its opening, I have visited Grace&apos;s quite a few times.  I don&apos;t know why I never reviewed it, but I have never been disappointed.  This last visit might have been the best.  

Made reservations through Open Table for my coworker&apos;s birthday lunch.  We had a table of 5 and everyone enjoyed the visit.

Lunch is a great deal because you get the well portioned entrée, plus the option of a soup or salad included.  I have always loved their gumbo, but went with the chicken tortilla soup.  This was just as good as the gumbo!  It did not taste like the chicken tortilla soup I have had in the past, but I will now hold those to a higher standard.  By the way my Cajun friend who went, loved the seafood gumbo.  My entrée was the fish tacos.  Usually not what I order, but they sounded great.  Wow, I will definitely order these again (see pic).  Really great flavors.  

The ambiance is great, always clean.  It feels like you are in your grandma&apos;s parlor.  There is no plastic on the chairs, just a nice vibe of comfort and classy.  

Finally the service. We had this little spitfire that was sassy and funny.  She definitely made the experience great.  Strong menu knowledge, personable, and made sure we were taken care of.  

Will I be back?  Without a doubt, one of my Houston favorites I seem to forget about for some reason and then remember how great it is."
5,"I came here with some friends that regularly visit this place and highly recommended it. I wasn&apos;t aware of how popular this place was. On a Friday night there was 40 minute wait time. My friends insisted it was worth it and we went to the bar for drinks while we waited. The wait was 100% worth it. From the service, to the food, to the drinks, everything  was amazing! We started off with the seafood campechana and we devoured it immediately. I had the creole stuffed chicken and it was amazing. It was a lot of food so I did not finish it. I can confirm that it tasted just as good for lunch the next day. Really looking forward to trying more dishes here!"
5,My friend and I went yesterday for the first time. We walked in and went to the bar that&apos;s where we met Sherrel. She deserves 10 gold stars!! Sherrel went out of her way to make sure we had the BEST time. Thank you Sherrel for being YOU!!
4,"Delicious comfort food, awesome atmosphere. Due to covid they even set up outside seating for those who are not comfortable sitting outside. The staff was very nice and had some great recommendations since it was my first time dinning there. I tried the shrimp
Stuffed Poblano amazing flavor, I totally recommend this dish. I will def go back there to try other dishes...great place to hang out with friends."
5,"As a lamb chop girl, I must say they exceed my expectations every time! The service is unmatched and the interior is beautiful. If you&apos;re looking to get a good buzz I recommend a &quot;sidecar&quot;, it&apos;s a Hennessy based cocktail, very delicious! Parking is great , when you are not going during Sunday brunch."
5,I love Graces!! Whenever I fly to Houston it&apos;s one of my first go to spots. There nothing like a good comforting meal! Everything I&apos;ve tried so far has been phenomenal! The staff are always pleasant and my meal comes out quickly. I will forever visit when I travel down south!
4,"Still a solid spot for Southern food in a slightly more upscale format. Everything we ordered was solid, portions are good. Valet is not required, you can park for free in the parking garage between Grace&apos;s and Mia&apos;s"
5,"I really like ribs so I ordered the sticky ribs and they were really really good they definitely surpassed my expectations and I will definitely be back. Last time I was there I was eating by myself but next time I&apos;m definitely bringing my family because this is a place that they must try.
Good job!"
4,"I got takeout from Grace&apos;s during HRW 2020! No complaints about the ordering process or service; let&apos;s get to the good stuff - the food!

- Sticky ribs: yummy! These had a nice glaze on them and flavor throughout the meat. They&apos;d go great with some plain rice and veggies too if you have any. I&apos;d definitely recommend this dish!
- Gumbo: really salty, and they didn&apos;t give us the white rice and saltines that this dish was supposed to come with. It was mostly soupy with mainly lots of chopped onions and only a couple pieces of shrimp and crab. I wasn&apos;t a fan of this dish, and it was hard to eat on its own. 
- Beef tips and rice: Grace&apos;s redeemed themselves with this dish! It was the definition of comfort food, and tasted like a nice pot roast. The cornbread cake was a nice touch to this dish. 

Of all the HRW places I tried, I thought Grace&apos;s had one of the best lunch values. The food was a little heavy (maybe because I didn&apos;t pick any of the salad options on the menu lol), and I&apos;d swap out the gumbo if I came again, but overall I enjoyed my meal from here."
5,"My cousin wouldn&apos;t stop talking about how much she lovedddd this stuffed chicken the last time she visited Houston. So to appease her and my belly, we went and now I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. The gumbo was amazing, so rich and hearty and the stuffed chicken was everything my cousin raved about and more. she left houston thinking about the chicken and here I am dreaming about the gumbo."
5,"What can I say? I had an amazing time here and our waiter was exceptional. 

We came on a Saturday at 11am for brunch and everything was perfect. 

We opted to valet our car but they had a garage next to the restaurant which we didn&apos;t see until we were leaving. 

The tables are spaced out to adhere to the social distancing rules. We were seated in the back in a private room which would be perfect for dinner parties. For almost all of our meal, we were the only ones in there. 

We got the mimosa pomegranate and let me tell you, I do not know what was in it but we were buzzed lol so much buzzed, that when we got home we were knocked out lol.

We got the calamari, chicken pot pie, tuna tartare. The calamari was by far the best I&apos;ve ever tasted in my life. It came with noodles and shrimp. 

I absolutely will return to this restaurant. 100 stars if I could l."
3,"3.5 stars - the food is very rich, which makes it tasty, with Papa&apos;s $$ pricing. 

We like the chicken pot pie, shrimp burger - comes with sweet pickles, and tortilla soup - has a kick. 

We don&apos;t like the fried chicken- the batter is well seasoned, but the meat itself is quite bland. 

Overall, a solid choice for some indulgent food."
