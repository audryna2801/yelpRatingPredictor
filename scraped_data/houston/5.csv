5,Went on a humbug. The food was excellent!  The portion sizes were hearty enough to share. The fresh squeezed juice was delicious.  The wait for food was short. The presentation was beautiful too. I definitely would go back again and again and I definitely would recommend this hip funky cool little resturant.  All servers practiced social distancing and they wore a mask.
5,"Yes, yes, yes.  I love me Barnaby&apos;s.   Come early since they get busy.  Small outdoor patio space.  Free coffee while you wait.  Friendly staff.  I personally love the small dining space - retains the hole-in-the-wall feel even when their restaurant brand has gained full local notoriety."
5,"Worth the wait! Social distancing on the patio - we chose to wait for that option. Staff was polite, wore masks, and did an excellent job with the challenges they are facing. Best waffles! Make sure to ask for the fruit on top :)"
5,"Baby Barnabys is a Montrose staple. The portions are huge and the food is always delicious. I come here at least 1 a month for breakfast. 

I&apos;m writing this review because Scott is hands down the best server around. Scott expertly runs the joint and I always know I am in the best hands when he is my server. His warm, friendly demeanor is unmatched. Everyone who walks through the door is greeted by name. When things get busy, Scott is never flustered. Calm, personable and &quot;with-it&quot; Scott manages Baby Barnabys with the expertise of a ship captain. 

Twice now I&apos;ve been the very first customer when they open and to say that having Scott be my first interaction of the day makes my whole mood/outlook on the day positive and hopeful is a vast understatement. Starbucks used to teach this in their trainings &quot;baristas may be the first people customers talk to in the morning....&quot;. And while they have tapped into something important and true, Scott nails this. He truly kicks people&apos;s days off on the right foot. It&apos;s like having a good friend serve you who understands that, while friends, he is also still the server. That&apos;s a hard line to toe. But he always maintains the perfect balance. 

I just can&apos;t say enough about this first rate service. It&apos;s people like Scott that will always keep me coming back!"
5,"Excellent meal worth the wait 
Breakfast was awesome 
My friend got heuvos rancheros with corn tortillas 
It tasted great
I got the breakfast plate with eggs scrambled and sausage and grits and whole wheat toast
It tasted great would highly recommend"
5,"Looking for a hearty and healthy brunch? This spot is JUST THAT! 

Green Eggs has two eggs scrambled with spinach, artichoke hearts, and Jack cheese.  When I first got the plate I thought the eggs looked soggy but they pair perfectly with the chicken apple sausage and crispy potatoes. I subbed my wheat toast for an English muffin and I loved it!

Wait time was ~20 minutes on New Years Day. You sign in on a clipboard and wait outside for your name to be called. 

Coffee and drinks were bleh. Come here for the food, not the drinks!"
5,"The food is delicious and the service is even better. The hospitality here was very welcoming. You can hear the staff call the customers by their names which is a nice touch.  Very local vibe. Also they&apos;re playing 80s music inside which is the best. Great menu selection, will definitely be returning during our Houston stay."
4,Grits were bland and pancakes are a little thick but everything else was amazing. A little compact as far as seating but it&apos;s an ok spot.
4,"I Love this small quaint breakfast cafe. It was a cold wait this time due to the weather but the warmth and yumminess of the food was worth the wait. I ordered the French toast with bacon and potatoes, sooo good! Every time I come here the service is fantastic and the food is hot and fresh! The bacon has thee best smoked flavor ever!!!! If you come by here, don&apos;t leave without ordering a side of bacon, you&apos;ll thank me later."
3,"Went here in January to see  about their keto options. 
Servers were catty and didn&apos;t know what was in their soup. When I asked for lettuce wrap they gave me this. And charged extra lol."
5,"I don&apos;t know what it is but gays sue know how to cook!
Not only here i know other restaurants to .
So what&apos;s different here well the place is in a old
Montrose house so it kind of gives you at home vide and for me I mostly eat Thai food given I am Thai so this is the only American gay establishment I know if I&apos;m sure there are many others.
I really love the crispy potatoes green eggs and the steak it&apos;s pretty good as well.

PS the staff is super friendly."
5,The breakfast here is phenomenal. My friends went back the very next day. In comparison to the wait at most breakfast places in the same area you can&apos;t beat it. I was afraid it was because the food was somehow inferior but that&apos;s definitely not the case. The staff make you feel at home and I didn&apos;t try one thing I didn&apos;t like. Because I definitely ate off my husbands plate as well.
4,"Service was great. Food was good except my pancake was burnt. Took my dog with me and I love how pet friendly this place is! I&apos;d go back, but I wouldn&apos;t get the pancake again."
5,"Really great food! I enjoyed it. There was a wait, but it wasn&apos;t too bad. Those biscuits are the truth!"
5,Food was great! There was a bit of a line but the food was worth the wait. The chicken apple sausage is definitely the star of the dish.
5,"Cons: Fantastic breakfast spot, I had the waffles, they are fluffy and delicious! They were so large I had half for breakfast the next day. The biscuit and the potatoes were also great. Coffee was very good. 

Cons: it is very popular so there is a long wait, but it is totally worth it. Service was lacking because they were so busy, so we had keep calling the waiter back for missing parts of our orders, but at least they helped with a smile."
5,"Solid breakfast place! I came here on a Sunday morning for breakfast. Theres a place for you to put your name in a pad since there will likely be a line. We waited about 20-30 minutes for a table inside for 2. 
I ordered the red velvet pancakes and my bf ordered the green eggs. Personally, I wasnt a big fan of the green eggs but it&apos;s one of their signatures so I would say it&apos;s worth a try. The red velvet pancakes came with a cream cheese frosting and was yummy. 
The service here was fast, whether it was getting the food out, getting our orders, or the check. The waiters here were friendly and accommodating. 
Definitely recommend trying this place!"
4,"Stopped in on a weekday for a solo breakfast. So glad I went early because this location is small and shortly after my arrival, around 9:30am, several people came through the door. All were directed to sign in on the clipboard until seats became available. It&apos;s so small, I wouldn&apos;t recommend it for parties larger than 4 plus there also isn&apos;t a ton of parking. The upside to all of this quaintness is the home-like feeling it yields. The staff knew their customers which added a certain charm to a well-known chain.

Onto the food: the breakfast is delish. I thought I was just getting a simple order of pancakes with chicken sausage and eggs but it was no ordinary flapjack. It was fluffy and huge! Definitely couldn&apos;t eat it all but it was yummy. Also loved that they fresh squeezed juice to order...nice touch. Barnaby&apos;s seems to be scattered about the city but this was one of my favorite experiences."
4,Went for breakfast on Fri around 10:30 am.  It was wait. But once we got seated it was fast service and food was great. Breakfast taco was one of the best I have had. Definitely coming back
3,"My red velvet pancake was burnt, barely edible and super dry!  I&apos;m disappointed because the food is normally ok."
