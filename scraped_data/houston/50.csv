5,"Best restaurant in River Oaks.  Hidden gem, or was to this out of towner.   I&apos;ve been to Houston a 1000x.  Wish I would&apos;ve found this place sooner.  Great food, great service.  If possible, ask for Chris to be your waiter.  This guy was good!   He was friendly and provided great recommendations.   

In my opinion, a good restaurant starts with the host/hostess.  I wish I could remember his name, but the host was fantastic.   In walking me to my table, he was super friendly and conversive.  He came by and checked on me while I was eating too.  Think about your bad experiences at a supposedly good restaurant.  How was the host or hostess?  That&apos;s the first clue, on my opinion, if you&apos;re going to have a good night.  Definitely started with the host here and my night was fantastic.  


I&apos;ll be back."
5,"We dined at the bar at State of Grace last night. It was the best dining experience in a very long time. State of Grace did an excellent job preserving the special atmosphere we&apos;ve loved on our previous visits while respecting the Covid safety guidelines.  The service was top notch and the food was fantastic.

We enjoyed the hush puppies as a starter. The butter lettuce salad with oregano dressing was incredible!! We selected the butternut squash pasta for a seasonal main dish. Everything was hot, fresh and perfectly portioned. 

We can&apos;t say enough good things about our experience. Thank you to the staff for making our &apos;stay-cation&apos; in Houston exactly what we&apos;d hoped for."
5,"We had such a great experience. With all the COVID going on, it was nice to be able to get out and received great service and food! 
Great job team!"
5,"My favorite date spot in town! There are certainly better places to go for the food in town (this is Houston, after all), but the ambiance and service at State of Grace just cannot be beat. 

We went for a celebratory dinner and loved the crab beignets. If you&apos;re in the mood for oysters, do not miss their oyster happy hour! It&apos;s one of the best deals in town.

Far and away our favorite part of dinner was our waiter! He was very attentive and friendly, and his wine recommendations were on point. He even brought us a complimentary round of sparkling wine when we told him we were celebrating! 

If you&apos;re looking for a spot to treat or impress a special someone (think Valentine&apos;s Day, Anniversary), State of Grace has you covered!"
5,"I promise you I am not exaggerating when I saw that everything my former coworkers and I had was so DELICIOUS! I mean even the water was so good and refreshing. It&apos;s a no no to drink without a straw but after the first sip I started gulping it. I may have been dehydrated but it was good. My Dad and I always rate the water at the establishments we visit, lol.
My former coworkers and I had a meal together since I had resigned to start travel nursing. Our experience was lovely and it was largely due to our wonderful waiter 2/10/21. I forgot his name but he was the tall, African American with curly hair. We all loved how professional, friendly, and pleasant that he was. He also made spot on suggestions. Really, all of the brigade were very pleasant and friendly! Every one!
First, let me just say that the atmosphere and ambiance is very nice and lovely. To me it is a dress up but feel at home type of vibe. One of our coworkers wives is gluten free and they they accommodated her so well.
The food was so good. Let me take you through. For starters we got French fries with Bernaise sauce and crab hushpuppies with butter and powdered sugar. Can I just say that the Bernaise sauce on the fries was so good I wanted to drink it! The fries were thin and crispy but still managed to be soft on the inside. So yum! The crab hushpuppies were superb with the savory and a hint of sweet from the powdered sugar. Really delicious and they stay warm for a long time.
So we also ordered citrus salad(omg so tasty), half chicken with potatoes, sauce, and veggies(3 ordered the chicken and they ate every bit! Crispy, juicy, and flavorful), steak fries (juicy with a nice cook on the crust of the steak), scallops (great sear, great flavor and very tender. Great size to the scallops), and a oyster tray and shrimp and octopus cocktail(made well for our gluten diet, was very delicious!).
A few ended up getting the ice cream sundae and shared it with their partners. It looked huge and tempting!
So as we were wrapping up to head home our waiter gave us a complimentary ginger snap cream pie. I don&apos;t know if it was homemade but it tasted fresh and O M G so good! Yumzies!!! I would return just for those!
I hope to go again very soon!"
5,"First and foremost, the customer service here is unparalleled. You will have a hard time finding better elsewhere. 

I have been wanting to try this restaurant for awhile now and I finally went! When you arrive, you&apos;re greeted with a warm welcome. After you&apos;re seated, you are greeted by your waiter/waitress very promptly. The service is quick and efficient! I have to give credit to Goose as he was fantastic. He knew the menu like the back of his hand, he was so kind and he was just a pleasure to be around. The inside is pretty dim, so definitely not the best place for photos, but the ambiance is great and it fits the style of the restaurant well.

I had the 1/2 chicken with pur√©e potatoes and large capers. The flavor was great, the chicken was cooked perfectly and the portion was just right. I liked the fact that they used the larger grape-like capers. I feel as if that complimented the dish well. To drink, I had the Buffalo Speedster, which is their version of an old fashioned, with a slightly more citrus-like taste. 

Overall, my friends and I had a great experience and I will definitely be back in the future"
3,"I was here for a Sunday brunch at around 1pm. We arrived before the reservation and we got a table immediately upon arrival, so service is great. No doubt that people here were friendly, and definitely made we feel welcome. But tbh the food took forever to arrive. The taste was decent, but it really took 30-40 mins to make a burger?"
4,"I previously had a chance to try State of Grace for work-related dinner and remembered it was a great experience, so I gladly helped my friend select this restaurant for a friends get-together post-Christmas Brunch. The reservation process was made extremely easy with the help of Andrew!

The restaurant surely has well-adhered COVID protocols in place. Our waiter was very attentive and paid attention to details. I was sad that he said the bartender would not be able to make the Sangria, but the replacement drink he suggested was quite well. My friend loved her Gilded Brambles, and I must say I liked hers more too!

I felt like we had a pretty good sample of brunch items earlier today. For starters, we had the Cinnamon Roll, Hushpuppies, and Biscuit &amp; Ham. 3 words: GET THE HUSHPUPPIES! They were DA BOMB, we had to order another serving to satisfy our tummies!! Some of my friends liked the Cinnamon Roll, but I thought it was so-so, the dough was on the chewy side for my taste. Biscuit &amp; Ham was not too bad.

For entrees, we ordered a variety of dishes, including the Pork Belly Benedict, Chicken Fried Chicken, Duck Tostada, and Southern Shakshuka. I was also able to try the Gumbo as well. 

The Gumbo, as true to our waiter&apos;s description, was medium in thickness. All in all, it wasn&apos;t my most favorite interpretation of gumbo, but I definitely appreciated and liked the soup! It does have a kick with the pepper, but not too spicy. Though I have to say, as an Asian, I am really picky about rice--and definitely the rice was UNDERCOOKED in the gumbo. I even had to try again at the end, just to ensure it wasn&apos;t to my imagination, and yes the rice was quite grainy in texture... 

One of my friends loved the Benedict and said the Pork Belly was done to perfection! My Shakshuka was good, but after the appetizers and the gumbo, it was a little bit on the heavier side. The other 2 entrees were not too well-received by my friends, with the Chicken Fried Chicken too thick on the batter, and the Duck was not memorable.


Tl;dr: Overall, great atmosphere and service, good drinks and AWESOME hushpuppies. Entrees were a hit or miss, though undercooked rice is quite unacceptable for this standard. However, I would love to be back and try their dinner menu again!"
5,"I came to State of Grace as soon as I landed in Houston and I was not disappointed.  This place is not only beautiful but the staff makes you feel very welcome and also hands out little treats when leaving.  It was the sweetest touch to the beginning of a great trip. 

Food here is delicious! The hush puppies are like crack -- not that I know what crack tastes like but you just can&apos;t stop eating these puppies!

Pear toast was delightful but I would do without the hazelnuts. 

Oysters are amazing and the happy hour will make anyone happy. 

The drink I ordered was La Parilla -- it comes with a mezcal float. I mean come on!! It was the best!  You can tell they worked hard on their cocktail program!  

I&apos;d definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Houston and hopefully I&apos;ll make my way back soon!"
5,"Colby was amazing!!! I was there with a friend of mine today that had never been there and Colby really took care of us. He was insightful of not only the menu but he was really a breath of fresh air! He maintained great conversation with us the whole time that was the best part. If you&apos;re looking for a great time, go to state of grace and ask for mr. Colby"
4,"Went on Sunday for lunch, without a reservation. As a result, we were seated at the bar. Bartenders took good care of us. I had the persimmon salad &amp; pimento cheese with crackers. The salad was beautifully presented. I would have preferred more greens, less dressing &amp; there was something white that I didn&apos;t really like. It looked like fennel, but wasn&apos;t. For the pimento cheese, it was ok. I was excited to try it &amp; thought it was a great idea, but the flavors was meh. I&apos;m not a fan of smoked, and it was described as such on the menu. I asked &amp; was told it wasn&apos;t a strong smoked flavor &amp; I agree. But it lacked the sweetness from pimentos perhaps. 

My friend had the shakshhka &amp; was very happy with her dish. 

The decor is old school tiled/upscale fountain shop, very classic elegant, with unique artwork on the walls."
5,"Probably my favorite restaurant in Houston. 

They took all the necessary precautions to keep the guests as well as staff safe. Everything we have ordered has been spectacular minus the chocolate cake. For dessert my favorite is their sticky toffee pudding."
3,"Yikes expensy and not that spectacular. The vibe is nice though, feels like it&apos;s made for fancy southern belles and their wealthy families. We sat in the oyster room but i can&apos;t comment on the oysters since I went for brunch."
4,"Revisited this location last week and found the food good, and the waitperson was really good.  We were there at lunch so it was not a celebratory occasion but the stop was certainly worthwhile.  Had the oysters on the lunch special.  The shrimp remoulade was absolutely delicious.  The menu is rather limited at lunch but I would recommend it if just for the remoulade. (Which by the way is a true Louisiana remoulade sauce)."
5,"Always a fantastic &quot;go to&quot; restaurant. Across from Lamar High School on Westheimer. Valet parking. I always love people watching because a good amount of the patrons are River Oaks residents.  If it&apos;s dinner I would make a reservation just to stay safe. Bar or table seating. More adult friendly for dinner. There is no dress code, but definitely don&apos;t slum it here! 

Menus change often and are seasonal so I would check their website first to see what is cooking in the kitchen. Full bar, lunch, dinner, brunch, pasta, fish, burgers, seafood and raw bar, salads, crab cakes, tuna, scallops, a bit of everything if you catch my drift. And I haven&apos;t had anything here that did not disappoint. The wait staff is fantastic as well!

As early 2020 they still have a pre-fix Sunday menu for a set price. You do get some choices with mains and sides. I think it&apos;s a great deal!"
5,This was my first time here and the food was PHENOMENAL!!  Not only was the food great but the service was superb!  The host and all the waiters were very kind and accommodating.  I can&apos;t wait to come here again.  This restaurant will become a regular dining spot for me and can&apos;t wait to take family and friends here.
5,"Amazing food, amazing atmosphere. It&apos;s on the pricier side but I assure you it is 1000% worth it!! This place did NOT disappoint!!"
5,"Had a  wonderful experience. I didn&apos;t have a reservation so ended in the oyster bAr but it was cool watching them prepare the oysters and on ice dishes. 
Souther snow drink: a must if you like cocktail delectably creamy with a smooth coffee finish. Rated a 5 stars. 

Smoking Quarter: stronger cocktail. Definitely plenty of etOh. 4 stars. You can smell the citrus with a Lingering finish smoky taste. 

Deviled crab cake: 3-4stars. It wasn&apos;t a crab 
cake but crabs with veggies served on a half shell. There&apos;s some spiciness - not the kind that burns your tongue but the kind that leavEs a lasting heat on your tongue. Husband really enjoyed it. 

Entree we had the scallop dish aNd the smoky  Beef ribs. 

Scallop dish: 4 stars. scallop was moist and delicious. Definitely prepared and cooked well. Tasted sweet and fresh. I like the risotto that came with it. Complimented it well. Didn&apos;t care much for the sausage. Would have been better to replace sausage with another scallop. 

Smoky beef rib: 4 stars. beef was a huge. It could probably feed 3 people. The pickled veggies were good and I ate the roti and herbs. But it didn&apos;t seem to go together that&apos;s well. Meat was very tender but couldn&apos;t get into the flavor for some reason. 

Fortunately the manager was making his round and he noticed that we barely touched it so he offered to let us try a different dish. We took him up in the offer and got the good chicken dish and it did not disappoint 5 stars for the flavorful tender and moist chicken. Came with mash potatoes and gravy and caper berries which hit the spot on texture and saltiness  that complimented the dish really well. Much more cohesive dish in my opinion. 

Brussel sprout:  4 stars. delicious. Really liked the compliment of the citrusy flavors. But sitting in too much oil.  

Overall we had a good time and a  great experience. Definitely worth a stop if you are in the area."
4,"The restaurant is beautiful and I had excellent customer service. Went for brunch in a Saturday and it wasn&apos;t very crowded. I got the warm cinnamon roll, then the Shrimp &amp; grits. It was a bit too spicy for me &amp; the shrimp was over cooked. Management asked how things were and I said they were fine &amp; he inquired more. Since I had already eaten most of my food, pushing the spicy peppers to the side, I didn&apos;t request any consolation. 
I had two drinks both with were very good, the fool&apos;s gold #2 and the fuego d&apos;averna. 
When my check came the shrimp &amp; grits had been taken off."
4,"Happy hour oysters only please!! These oysters are on point! The freshness, the brine, the salt, and they give you fresh horsh radish!!!! If you know another place that does that, comment!!! 

Anyway, service here is always amazing. They have a great bar area that&apos;s secluded from the dining area, food here is okay too, but I come mainly for the oysters!"
