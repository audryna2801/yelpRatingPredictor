4,"Ninfa&apos;s is obviously a legendary Houston institution, founded in 1973 by &quot;Mama&quot; Ninfa Laurenzo, a towering figure in the history of Tex-Mex who (by some accounts) is responsible for introducing American diners to fajitas. While the restaurant relinquished its &quot;family-run&quot; title over 15 years ago, it still makes some damn good Tex-Mex and authentic Mexican fare.

During a recent take-out dinner, I ordered the Pulpo Cazuelita Tacos, which came in the form of sliced roasted octopus, a small grilled potato, and coleslaw. The tacos are DIY, so I loaded up the house-made corn tortillas (it came with 2) with the seafood, a little slaw, some chili aioli and a squirt of lemon juice. They were magical. The octopus had a heavy wood-fired char and were well-salted, chewy and smoky, elevated by a dash of citrus. The sauce was creamy and added some acidity, and the corn tortillas were wonderful and thiccc with at least three c&apos;s. The potato was fairly bland and somewhat undercooked though. In terms of the salsas that arrived with our entrees, the green avocado-based salsa was tangy and fresh, but the red one was watery and subpar. 

I think I&apos;d still take El Tiempo (which, funny enough, was started by one of Mama Ninfa&apos;s sons and is still run by the Laurenzo family!) over Ninfa&apos;s, but you can&apos;t go wrong with either. To its credit, Ninfa&apos;s strikes me as sliiiightly cheaper and has more of an authentic, home-style vibe."
4,"Had to come check out this authentic tex mex spot since it was highly recommended by some
Houstonians we met. The place is very big so plenty of space to socially distance. Face masks are required and the staff wears gloves and sanitizes each table. There&apos;s also hand sanitizer around the restaurant. The food was pretty good, I really enjoyed their chips and tomatillo salsa. The best thing I had was the jumbo diablo shrimp!  Food was very flavorful and a great portion size."
4,"This place is such a houston classic and did not disappoint!! I absolutely love an enchilada moment and these were quite good! Because they were take out, the cheese on the enchiladas were a bit hardened, but nonetheless still tasty! You have a choice of regular Mexican rice or poblano rice so DEFINITELY get the poblano rice. It&apos;s next level delicious! The mushroom quesadillas as an appetizer were also delicious especially with the avocado cream salsa. The salsas they gave complimentary were all delicious. The queso was nothing special but still queso so still tasty at least! My husband got the pork carnitas. Just be aware they literally give you an entire chunk of it. Not shredded or anything. We were kind of shocked haha. But overall will definitely come back and at some point in restaurant will probably be better experience."
5,"https://youtu.be/NYgPlm_bAc4

We went all out and I&apos;m not mad about it! Mexican coke, guac, combo fajitas, sopapillas.....WOW. The homemade tortillas were to die for alone. Amazing service, too."
3,"Not what it used to be. The meal was ok, but not spectacular. The tortillas were too thick and had a strange after taste.  I thought the green sauce and red sauce were too bland. 
The service also only adequate. 
The history of the building and  the memory of Mama Ninfa are why we keep coming back."
5,"The vibe is super cute. It&apos;s got character. I did not love the salsa but to be fair I&apos;m not a creamy salsa person and I don&apos;t love a strong onion  flavor. 

I had the octopus  tacos! They were so flavorful and tender, up there with the best octopus I have had. 
And definitely were amazing the next day. I loved the redirect black beans too. Best ones I have had. 

I think their tortilla could be better but just a minor critique. I will be back to try more stuff because the menu looks great. 

The portions are great for the price. Good quality and value. 

And lastly, their drinks were made fresh. I asked for a skinny marg with cucumber and mint. It was lovely. I asked for Tajin but they rimmed by glass with a
Chile peanut  seasoning.  No lime. Good thing I don&apos;t have a peanut allergy"
4,"Right. I&apos;ve probably had tastier Fajitas here in SoCal or  Arizona but this place is apparently the originator. Or so Food Network tells me! Started with some ceviche (pretty good), then on to some chicken fajitas... really tasty but maybe some more &quot;extras&quot; would be nice: sour cream, guacamole, spicy pico, etc. Still overall, great spot, good serving staff and big but homey space."
4,"This was our first Mexican restaurant in Houston! I read this was the OG place for fajitas!!! We ordered fajitas and they didn&apos;t come out sizzling? A little disappointed there. Other than that, the food came out really fast, service was great, and the food was really good. Honestly the beef taco was so simple and so delicious, it might have stolen the show."
4,"I have had some chips and drinks here and the drinks were good it has always been so packed that didn&apos;t get a chance to eat. Since covid-19 hit wanted to go back and see if we could finally eat here. This time we didn&apos;t get drinks, we got the cheese appetizer dish , enchiladas and beef stew. The appetizer with pickled onions and carrots was so delish. They smoked the jalapeno for the salsa and it made such a great topping for this dish. The enchilada was also good it came with the typical rice and beans. The last dish was beef stew. The meat was tender and the veggies good. The meat did lack flavor and the sauce for the stew could have used a bit more salt or something. Over all the experience was good. The service was fast, the staff was helpful and pleasant."
5,So I have been eyeing this place for a while now and I finally had the chance to go! This place was wonderful!!! The vibes were amazing and the employees were super friendly! I got the pork tamales and my fianc√© got the steak fajitas I believe!! The steak was cooked to absolute perfect but I do think I could&apos;ve used a TAD more salt but not much! The tamales were perfect and no complaints there. We also got the queso which was fabulous and finished it off with dessert! Now the dessert was not all that good to me! We got the soapapillas and honestly have gotten better at other places. This id argue was the worst I&apos;ve had. I asked for honey which I was told they didn&apos;t have and I think it probably would&apos;ve helped. But all in all I won&apos;t let that dessert be the factor to bring this great place down!!
4,"One of my favorite restaurant simply joys are when they can cook the beef for my salad or fajita perfectly. Ninfa&apos;s did it! This salad was so marvelous. Every bit of it was fresh and delicious. I could&apos;ve eaten 20 Diablo shrimps. The green sauce is spicier than most I&apos;ve had and I loved it! Margs were delicious too. All in all everything a total slam dunk! Our waiter was very nice and attentive, and the outdoor patio (in back) was even warmer than inside! So cozy. I prefer the indoor atmosphere of their Galleria location, but this has that original charm you&apos;ll only find at the first locations."
2,"After hearing so much about Ninfa&apos;s and it&apos;s prominent role in the Houston Tex-Mex scene, I knew I had to try it out!  Unfortunately, both my boyfriend and I left very underwhelmed and with stomachaches.

First, I will commend the restaurant on their fantastic COVID-19 set up inside. This was our first time dining inside since the pandemic began and we felt great about the distance between tables, the masked and gloved staff, and the additional barriers put in between tables. I haven&apos;t seen any other restaurant do this. I appreciated their contactless menu, but their online menu is very difficult to navigate and we both had trouble with it.

The food, however, left a lot to be desired. We ordered nachos for an app and those weren&apos;t bad, but both the Diablo Shrimp Tacos and the Delicioso Combo we ordered as entrees were lackluster, which at $20 a pop was pretty disappointing. Both the taco and the flautas had just meat, no toppings (veggies, cheese, onions) whatsoever which was unexpected and definitely not was I was looking for in a nice meal. Margaritas were ok, but nothing to write home about. 

When we got home and both felt nauseous, we agreed that we wouldn&apos;t be going back."
4,"Visited for breakfast right when they opened on a Saturday morning (10ish) and was pleasantly pleased with how they weren&apos;t busy, lol. We were able to be seated quickly, with no wait. However, you can make reservations ahead of time (the restaurant also encourages it) in case you&apos;re worried about seating/waiting. They did allow some seating indoors, but our group opted to sit outside on the covered patio where tables are nicely spaced out.

We were greeted quickly by our server who was wearing a mask. He asked us if we wanted to see a printed menu, but also encouraged us to view their digital menu, which you pull open on your phone by scanning a QR code. If you want to save yourself some time, you can also preview the menus from their website in advance.

Our drink and app orders were taken pretty quickly, with chips and salsa immediately brought out. We decided to add some queso while we waited. I love Queso, plain or with all the fixings, but wasn&apos;t as impressed with this version. Unfortunately, it was too thick for me and congealed quicker than expected. It either needed to be thinned just a tad or heated more thoroughly.

I will say that it did take a while before we finally got our entree orders in, but once we did, they came out fairly quickly. Each of us decided to stick with the breakfast tacos, all ordering completely different items. I went with the brisket taco and chorizo thinking they were going to be on the smaller side. The plate comes with beans, pico, and salsa, and if you end up eating a ton of chips, then you&apos;ll be full after one taco. They were both delicious, but I&apos;d pick my brisket taco over the chorizo one any day. Our waiter was great and ensured our drinks were always full. Good food, relaxing atmosphere...it was just what we needed."
5,"Addictively good!! This place is such a vibe and will take your taco Tuesday to a whole new level.  Hands down my favorite Mexican restaurant in Houston and my first stop every time I come home to visit. I even ask family and friends to bring me food whenever they travel to visit me in DC. I have tried the majority of the menu but my favorites are the combination fajitas, caldo xochitl soup, and queso flameado. (Get it with fajita beef instead of chorizo and you will be thanking me later.) Besides crazy good food the staff is amazing. Always cheerful and attentive. The patio area is my favorite place to sit even before Covid. I have neeeever had a bad experience here and I&apos;ve been coming here since I was a kid."
4,"Very interesting. I chose the Granjas Enchiladas dish and it was pretty satisfying up until the point where I ate the cheese on top of the enchiladas. I&apos;m a big fan of cheese but this one in particular tastes very distinct to me. It did not scream out to me as Mexican cheese or crema.. it was more of a hot liquified strange version of cheese that to me was not too satisfying. I&apos;m sure there&apos;s plenty of other fabulous dishes to try so I&apos;ll be sure to check other ones out and probably do another review. Also, I&apos;m glad that they have the traditional bottled &quot;Mexican coco colas&quot; in the restaurant. I have attached the picture of what I got from the menu and how it looks."
4,"Pandemic visit -- we got lunch for curbside pickup.

The beef fajitas were delicious. Came with a moderate portion of chips and a non-spicy salsa and a green sauce as well. 

My wife enjoyed her enchiladas al carbon with chicken (she said it was very mildly spicy, by default -- she didn&apos;t request any particular spice level). 

The fajitas seemed pretty overpriced though.  It was in the upper 20s, close to $30 for their smallest portion of fajitas (at least what was available in the online ordering menu).

PS their rice is really delicious. Different from your typical Mexican rice that&apos;s tomato-y, Ninfa&apos;s rice is more creamy flavored rather than tomato-y. It was delectable."
5,"Delicious fajitas, my favorite in Houston. Margaritas are great, not super sweet. Fun atmosphere. Will be back for sure!"
5,"We came here in 2014!!!  This is the place that started the fajita craze that we have today. It&apos;s a huge restaurant with the best Mexican food I&apos;ve had in a long time. 

We ordered the steak fajitas and oh my what a surprise this was. The fajitas had so much flavor and you could tell they no what there doing. We had a great waitress who made sure we were taken care of. We got right in no wait for us, but by the time we were leaving the line was out the door.  I will say it was the best fajitas I&apos;ve had in a long time!!   Great salsa and cold beer what can be better!"
1,"I can only assume that the Lorenzo family sold the Ninfa&apos;s on Navigation. The service was terrible, but not as bad as the cold cheese enchiladas I had. My guest ordered juevos rancheros with out cheese and they brought him a cold cheese omelette which he couldn&apos;t  and didn&apos;t take a bite of.  When he told the waiter this wasn&apos;t at all what he ordered, the waiter said he was sorry, and walked away.  Was sorry, Really ??
when he brought the check I told him he needed to comp his meal since he couldn&apos;t and didn&apos;t eat it.  He never looked up, pretended he didn&apos;t hear me and swiped our two credit cards."
4,"The Original Ninfa&apos;s on Navigation is a must for any Houstonian. A true original, nestled in second ward htx. We stopped by last weekend for dinner, after Covid re-openings. It was our first real dinner out since all the madness, so I was a little iffy, but we had a good experience. 

We chose to be seated outside- the tables were separated by more than 6 feet, and all of the staff were wearing masks. 

We ordered the chile con queso and the guac for starters. I also got a skinny marg, and hubs got the house frozen. The appetizers were fantastic. 

For our entrees, I got the red snapper fish tacos (build your own), hubs got the red enchiladas de fajita, and kid got the beef fajita burger.  Kid said the burger was &quot;fire,&quot; so I&apos;m assuming that was a 10/10. 

My fish tacos were just okay. And hubs said his enchiladas were decent, but definitely not the best he&apos;s had.

Service was good, but lacking in some areas. We waited for our drinks to be refilled a couple of times- but I guess I was more forgiving, since restaurants are starting from scratch and implementing new safety/cleanliness measures. 

I only took a pic of my marg- so here&apos;s that. All in all, good experience. Next time will prob try their fajitas or a Tex-Mex plate."
