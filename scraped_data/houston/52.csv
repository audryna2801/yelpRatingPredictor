5,"A friend of mine brought me to this little tucked away treasure.

Little Matt&apos;s is a great family restaurant. Good prices and even better food! While ordering and waiting for food, I was able to hold friendly conversation with all of the front end staff.  The service was just as sweet as food.

There is indoor and outdoor seating, and the aesthetics are pleasing no matter which you choose. They have iPads with games to keep the kids busy while waiting for the food, and all sorts of arcade games for those nostalgic enough to jump on them. There was also complementary wine margarita and beer for the grownups. 

I had a Blue Ring Burger - cooked medium and topped with a thick onion ring, blue cheese crumbles, bacon, pickles, red onion and a tangy BBQ sauce on a toasted egg bun; served with fries. Would definitely go back again. Also proceeds from the restaurant go to multiple charities and hospitals.  

Not only will you leave here full, you leave feeling good!"
5,"Dining out in a pandemic, with 5 kids is usually chaotic, &quot;what the f-word was I thinking&quot; at best. Little Matt&apos;s flipped that on its head. The warmth with which we were welcomed, ample space and patio for littles to explore and DELICIOUS food, I am already planning our next visit.

The grilled chicken was so succulent and well seasoned. The hamburgers fresh and cooked to perfection, fries seemed hand cut and mouthwatering.

My littles spilled hamburger and water on floor. Waitstaff was quick and gracious in cleaning it up.

The owner, I assume, offered a complimentary &quot;Mommy drink&quot; and was so emphatic to our plight.

This place is a gem and will be our go-to when in town.

If you&apos;re reading this far, what are you waiting for? Hurry up and support this amazing local business!"
5,"Food was great! Burgers are really good! You get complimentary beer, wine or margarita. Guy at the counter was super nice! 

Dog friendly patio- no heaters but turned out to be really nice weather. Staff brought out a burger patty for my pup and a big bowl of ice water! Overall, amazing service!"
4,"The burgers and burrito salad remind me of home cooking...the good versions 

Great place for kids...plenty of play area. Lots of candy and ice cream 

Of note there is only bench sitting so can be hard to sit for any long times

We had some really good service and the manager checked to ensure we were satisfied"
1,"The reviews are clearly based on brain washed West U Karens and SIMPs. Food is mediocre at best. Make you buy an entire entree to have a margarita while your kid drinks an Icee. Restaurants make big margin off booze and this is the rule? Then be a total a hole about it? Yeah. Never coming back. What a joke.

In response to the note below. I was trying to purchase a margarita and had no idea it was &quot;complimentary&quot;. Even told your employee you should charge more and they never explained that you don&apos;t have a liquor license, the margs are complimentary, and that you donate to charities. So my bad? Or yours? Regardless, I will give my money directly to charities instead of going through you."
2,Mostly upset because I just paid $13 far a kids meal.  three chicken tenders and a handful of french fries. Apparently the cup of water was three bucks.I guess bring your own water.
3,Kid friendly even during the pandemic--great customer service and perfect for the weekday when cooking is too much or just want to hit the neighborhood aka to get out the house. Large portions so order with caution
3,"There are so many great things about this place - super kid &amp; dog friendly, plenty of parking out front, an arcade, &amp; 2 free (alcoholic) drinks for parents.

Now the reason I&apos;m giving 3 stars is because the food has always been average when we&apos;ve been here &amp; we&apos;re big foodies!  On this particular visit we got the kids&apos; Mac n cheese, kids&apos; hot dog, a burrito bowl, &amp; the Thai wrap. The best thing was probably the hot dog.

We&apos;ll continue to come here when we need a quick meal with the kids, but it&apos;s not at the top of our list food wise."
5,"I rarely review, but after my third visit to Little Matt&apos;s yesterday, I decided a recommendation is merited. 

I&apos;ve ordered from all over the menu and every last thing has been delicious and tasted freshly prepared. The Miss Texas Chicken Sandwich and the unique B.L.A.T. both come on a perfect sourdough bun and either is great if you&apos;re in the mood for a sandwich. For sides, the classic fries are terrific and the beer battered onion rings are so worth it. Yesterday, I had Tortilla Soup and can honestly say it&apos;s now my favorite Tortilla Soup in all of Houston. No filler rice, just delicious broth and chicken with plenty of fresh avocado, vegetables and cheeses. Each visit has earned five stars from me, so I should also mention how hospitable Little Matt&apos;s employees are. 

I know Little Matt&apos;s was started with a commitment to give back to Houston&apos;s children&apos;s medical community and although I believe the restaurant has changed ownership, that passion seems to remain. I&apos;ll be back often to support that mission and enjoy their terrific food."
5,"Hidden Gem. Okay - Parking, well not sure but it looks like it could be an issue. I visited on a Wednesday night about 6:30. The place is nice and local. It is designed for families with kids or larger groups with kids. Definitely kid and dog friendly! Customer service is excellent! It is very obvious that they have their locals that visit on a regular. It is located near West University Elementary school and based on the crowd most patrons are from the local area. 

Now for the food - I had the buffalo burger with onion rings and my guest had the regular burger. There were no left overs! I thought my buffalo burger was a bit small in comparisons to the regular burger but it was excellent. With my meal I had a beer which I learned later that the alcohol which is a couple of selections of different beers and a red or white wine are free! Which was a nice touch and nice surprise! Two sandwiches and a tip, $32. 

I do recommend and will visit again since it is right around the corner from me and the food as well as the service was excellent. 

As for eye candy - this is a kid friendly and dog friendly place located near a elementary, in West U, need I say more. Stay at home moms with 3.5 kids, and a bottle of wine in front of them! LOL!"
5,"Good food, perfect for the family, will definitely come again. Great bun on California club, tender chicken and perfectly cooked crispy bacon, ordered a side salad and veggies were very fresh and crisp."
4,"I was on this side of town running some errands and found this place doing a quick yelp search. It was a little difficult to find if you&apos;re not from the area but not too bad. Parking wasn&apos;t an issue. 

I am not sure what I expected but I love that this place caught me off guard when I walked in. They are super kid friendly but not in a bad way. They have an ice cream freezer and they have an icee machine. I was sold as soon as I saw both. 

The food was good. I really enjoyed the sourdough bun that my burger came on. I got the Santa Barbara burger with mushrooms/bacon/ all the fixings. The burger was super good with standard fries. I think they make their french fries in house. They tasted very fresh and good! 

There isn&apos;t a lot of seating so I sat at the table with some other people who were friendly but did not bother me. They have a huge condiment section if you are into all the different mustards/ketchups etc. The place has a lot of character and the staff was very friendly. If you want a good burger def check them out."
4,"Lovely casual place for families with kids. Nice patio in the back that overseas a little creek. We had burgers, salads, and chicken strips. Everything was really good experience for the chicken strips (it tastes great but too crunchy) my little one couldn&apos;t eat it. 
Service was great. Plenty of parking spots. All arcades and games are closed now because of  COVID-19. Social distancing is enforced."
5,"I never knew Little Matt&apos;s existed in this location!  Super close and apparently very popular with the locals!  We saw lots of families just walk or bike here for food!  We called in an order and came by to pickup - they told us it would be ready in 10 mins and they weren&apos;t kidding.  Super super friendly staff/owner!  The restaurant was so cute and you can tell the owner (or at least I thought he was the owner) enjoyed what he was doing!  They packed my food well - asked if we wanted ketchup and mustard.. and then asked if I wanted a few blended margaritas with my food =)  We enjoyed the classic cheeseburger - bf said he enjoyed the egg bun!  I ordered the Ahi Tuna Burger and the garlic fries - O.M.G!! If you love garlic - the garlic fries here is to die for!  So garlicky and delicious!  The 8oz Ahi patty was packed separately so my burger wasn&apos;t soggy when I got to it - and the 8oz of tuna was huge and worth the price!  Cooked well and seasoned well!  It went really well with the horseradish mayo that came with the burger!  It reminded me of this Ahi Tuna Club I used to love - next time I think I would try to build one with the Ahi here =)  We both enjoyed our food tremendously.  We both commented on how cute the restaurant was (even though the bf only saw it from the outside), and I was smittened by how friendly everyone was.  We will definitely be back - for takeout - and hopefully when all this is done with, for some dine-in hospitality.  They had ipads to distract the kids and adult beverages for the adults - even a cooler out front with ice cream bars!  Loved everything about this place!"
5,"Rice village... oh how I wish you weren&apos;t so far! I love this area. I took my mom for a museum day and found this awesome restaurant thanks to (of course) YELP! 
This place has so much character. You walk in and find the &quot;wish wall&quot;, &quot;faith wall&quot; or whatever you want to personally call it. Such a creative touch. There is a big menu in the front where you order at the counter and then take a seat after. 

They have a cool little arcade area which is super fun for kids.. and even adults like myself! They also have seating areas outside in the front when you first walk up and also in the back.. seems dog friendly! 
I ordered the BLTA on sourdough with fries... AMAZING. Thick cut bacon on point, perfect amount of veggies and that bread is the icing on the cake
 Delicious. By the way... they have sriracha mayonnaise and whataburger condiments!!!! Also some other great hot sauces which made me love this place even more. **Gold clap** Little Matt&apos;s!"
5,"Little Matt&apos;s definitely deserves five stars!  I&apos;ve had them on my list for some time and finally got the chance to check them out.  I came on a holiday and expected crazy crowds, but we were seated and eating in no time. Customer service is outstanding here. If you need a kid friendly place to eat, this is absolutely the spot to come to. When you walk in there a wall of iPads. It&apos;s not for ordering, it&apos;s for the kids. They have a little arcade. They have an icee machine, soft serve, plus a freezer of ice cream bars. There&apos;s also a great patio out back when the weather cooperates.

They have a pretty extensive menu that should satisfy anyone. You have salads, chicken sandwiches, burgers, and even Mexican food. I went with the Santa Barbara Sour Dough burger. This burger was so good!  The bread alone was praiseworthy. It was nice and soft and just toasted right. The burger patty and mushrooms were seasoned to perfection and the huge slice of Swiss paired well with it. It comes with bacon, and they sure did not skimp on that. It was topped with thick cut, delicious bacon. Everything worked well together. I opted to skip on the veggies as the burger had a lot going on already. The fries were just right as well. Freshly cooked and crispy like I like it. What I loved about this place as well was the wall of condiments. They are proud to supply their customers with Whataburger products!  The creamy pepper sauce was perfect with my burger. 

Little Matt&apos;s is also known for donating a lot to Texas Children&apos;s Hospital which really impressed me. Not only kid friendly, but they support them as well. I will definitely be back!"
4,The food is consistent good and when it&apos;s cooler outside adults can sit on the patio and watch the kiddos run around while having a glass of wine. This is a little hidden gem spot that is kid friendly.
5,"This place is the best hidden gem! Not only is it designed beautifully, the food is great and it&apos;s one of the best places I have ever taken my 4 kids!!! Having a candy bar and icees is a really nice touch. We really appreciated the GM taking care of us while we were there and his kindness was very much noticed as he went above and beyond for not only us, but his employees too. Great experience, can&apos;t wait to go back."
4,"Went with the in laws and I must say, it was as good as the reviews make it out to be!

I had just a regular cheese burger cause I didn&apos;t wanna get too cute with it and not like it. I loved it, the burger was juicy, but not too juicy as to make the bread soggy, and it was well seasoned. 

The place is very kid friendly and it looks like a fun time for the whole family. I cannot wait to be back!"
5,The food is always amazing but Tim and the rest of the staff made this place an experience. Tim went out of his way to make sure are dog Zoe had an amazing birthday! We will be back for sure!
