5,"I am so glad i could convince my mom to try something new since she is the ultimate hamburger queen  
This place has all social distancing measures along with patio seating since the Covid rates are soaring in houston! 
East Downtown location so plenty of restaurants,  parking, sidewalks, and diverse mix of ppl with great skyline  views.
Huge selection of burgers  
Quality meat and options especially since i don&apos;t eat red meat! Full Bar and games to distract so what&apos;s not to love about this local gem!"
5,"Awesome place! First time here and will definitely go back.  To say it&apos;s a burger joint is an understatement as their beef comes from 44 Farms, world renowned cattle ranch.  

I had the River Oaks C. C. and I loved, loved, loved it.  Juicy, cooked perfectly in a brioche bun.  My wife had the Hit Bastard.   She really dugs spicy foods and this one measured up.  

She tried the Moontang Mimosa which is a concoction of Vodka, moonshine and champagne with OJ for color.  Very strong!  And very good.  I had a Brooklyn Lager and a Guinness. 

We sat outside and they have plenty of seating.  Great music in the background that allowed easy conversations.  

Our server was Henry and he was knowledgeable, friendly and prompt.  Great service overall.  

Prices are reasonable so go and enjoy.  PS plenty of indoor seating too. Mask up and stay safe"
5,"I am not a burger person but I loved the burgers at Rodeo Goat! Soft bun, juicy meat, and huge on flavor! 

The recommended to only have one order of cheese fries with surprise for the table of six. We could have eaten two or even three. The fries were so good. They have a nice size outdoor area, a cool inside area, and there was a cute cat just walking around. 

The chocolate mint shake was too chocolate tasting for me. I don&apos;t like chocolate very much and was hope for more mint and less chocolate (like a shamrock shake.)

There are so many other great things to do around the area."
5,"Tl;dr I still think about these burgers. Skip the fries though. 

Wow, Rodeo Goat is like, THE place in Houston to get burgers. Rodeo Goat is like Ben &amp; Jerry&apos;s ice cream because they have so many burger toppings expertly paired together for flavor explosions!

My friend and I ordered the Terlingua and Bad Hombre (battle of the burgers). Notably, the Terlingua is topped with chili and corn chips making for an excellent chili burger you never knew you needed. 

The Bad Hombre though, was my favorite-- topped with maple bacon, two cheeses, mango pico, cream cheese spread, and hot sauce. It&apos;s honestly impressive that Rodeo Goat is able to pile on that many things onto one patty... to say the least, this was a messy burger to eat haha. But Bad Hombre was the perfect combination of textures AND flavors to go with this beefy patty-- spicy, creamy, sweet, savory, what more could you ask for? 

The only disappointment of the afternoon was the fries. Our combo order of sweet and regular fries was disappointingly soggy and limp. These were a pass. 

Our hostess was kind and attentive, and at the time of visit, tables were appropriately socially distanced. 

Looking forward to my next Rodeo Goat burger..!!!"
3,"After hearing so many good things about Rodeo Goat on the Houston Foodie Friend&apos;s Facebook page, I knew I had to stop by and try it!

I didn&apos;t realize before coming that it&apos;s more bar than a restaurant, featuring a huge drink menu and a large outdoor space for hanging out. The rodeo-inspired decor and vibe was casual and cool. 

The food was just ok. After reading such rave reviews, I was expecting a fantastic burger and mine was fine, but nothing I would make the trip over to EaDo for again. They have a fun menu, but it&apos;s lacking descriptions for a lot of their specialty dishes, so expect to have lots of questions for your server (what are goat balls, the surprise option for cheese fries, etc). I ordered the River Oaks CC (I&apos;m a cheeseburger purist), my boyfriend got the Pile It On Burger, and we ordered cheese fries to share. Cheese fries weren&apos;t that good in my opinion, but you do receive a lot of them. Both of our burgers were alright, although mine was quite undercooked to be considered &quot;medium&quot; and was absolutely drowning in mustard. I wouldn&apos;t recommend the milkshakes either, which were pretty sad, especially for the $7 price tag. 

Things to know: 
- There&apos;s no designated parking, so you&apos;ll probably have to pay to use the lot across the street.
- It&apos;s more bar/beer garden than restaurant
- This would be a great place to bring friends for drinks and hang out (when that&apos;s a safer to do)

Overall, was pretty underwhelmed. I can imagine this would be a great place to hang with friends, drink, and eat some food during non-COVID times, but it wouldn&apos;t be my choice stop if I&apos;m just wanting a burger."
4,Went here with a group of friends after visiting some of the breweries nearby and this hit the spot! Everyone loved their burgers. The only complaints we had is they forgot parts of our order so we never got our fries and that the service was really slow. Honestly the burgers are good size so we filled up quickly but we waited really long times to get drinks and food. We also got our food at different times so some people were finishing up as others finally had something arrive.
4,"I was leaving a birthday party at Chapman&amp; west Restaurant lounge Which is next door to the rodeo goat.  I wanted some bread and a good meal to help after a party. I walked past it and entered a cool open space and seemed it like a poppin area before COVID.

 There&apos;s a huge window you can walk up to for ordering  to go or you can walk inside and sit at a bar stool at long picnic tables separated  by dividers 6&apos; apart. 

 My server was nice and suggested his favourite  Burger I got the ranch goat and loved all the ingredients. It was really good. I Ordered a beer as well but don&apos;t remember what it was and I forgot to take a picture! 

I had a Caesar salad which was really tasty I think there were onion rings that were meant to be croutons and the fries weren&apos;t bad as well. All I can say is that I didn&apos;t know I was getting charged extra for the bun but all in all the meal itself was good"
5,"Our waitress Ashley was so sweet and attentive. And our burgers, OMG our burgers were 10/10!! The fries were also amazing. Everything about this place was perfect!!"
4,"BODACIOUS BURGER $12 [American cheese, bacon, crispy onions, grilled jalapenos, pickles, smoked jalapeno mayo, BBQ sauce]- 
SO GOOD (or so hungry). I&apos;ve been disappointed with several burger places in Houston and Austin, but this one was worth it. Crispy onions and bacon added great texture. It was so tasty with w/ the jalape√±os (spicy but good), pickles, mayo, bbq sauce. Also, the PATTY itself was delicious! I&apos;m tired of all the burger places that have a lot of fancy toppings with a bland patty. It was also pretty thick, not sure if $12 thick, but it was definitely filling, yet I wasn&apos;t too stuffed.

Other burgers that looked great: 281, sugar, Marvin, whiskey. Too many choices! My friend got the Nanny Goat this time, but he really likes the Luv Ya Blue.

HOMEMADE GOAT CHIPS $2.50- chose sweet over sour bc my friend likes the sweet better, and they were delish! I guess they&apos;re coated with sugar, but they&apos;re not that sweet. Also, they&apos;re so light and not oily surprisingly for potato chips, so they can be dangerous. For $2.50, you get a huge portion w/ some dipping sauce (ranch?). I think we only ate like half, so probably shareable among 3-4 hungry people.

Daily specials:
Mon- $3 Moontang
Tues- take out Tues, free fries w/ burger
Wed- half price cheese fries
HH M-F 4-7p

Plenty of seating inside and out. Great patio. I can see parking as an issue though because I think they only have paid parking. Add that on top of the burger prices, ouch!

I don&apos;t live close, but even if I did, not sure if it&apos;d be a regular spot. My friend on the other hand literally eats here every week or every other week, and he says you can&apos;t go wrong w/ any burger bc they&apos;re all great. I think he&apos;s had almost all of them and also the different patty options (ground chicken, ground turkey, impossible, vegan). Burgers are delicious, but I wish they were a few bucks cheaper. DEFINITELY WORTH TRYING AT LEAST ONCE!"
4,"Came to Rodeo Goat for lunch while visiting Houston with 3 others. We were craving burgers this particular day and we&apos;re glad we checked them out.

This place has lots of space and outdoor seating. Nice lunch crowd on the weekend and I could see it getting very packed pre-Covid. Plenty of beer options on tap.

We all ordered burgers and each of us enjoyed them. I went for one of their &quot;contest burgers&quot;. It was Big Tex vs a Green Chile type burger and that&apos;s the one I ordered. This was an excellent burger packed with flavor and dressed out beautifully. I practically inhaled it, so good! 

Small quip that the service was a little on the slow side."
4,"It was my second time trying but same experience as the first, did not disappoint. The burgers were great and really enjoyed the queso. Only negative thing was the slow service but once I had my order taken, it was a much better experience. I recommend the Chaca Oaxaca"
2,"People really like this place, so I&apos;ll definitely come back for another go, but I found myself fairly underwhelmed by our take-out burgers last night. The (281) 330-8004, which comes with garlic-roasted cremini mushrooms, gruyere, soy caramel glaze, and pickled onions, sounds like an absolute umami bomb but ended up tasting just OK. Not especially memorable, and the pickled onions were the dominant flavor outside of the meat. My wife&apos;s Terlingua, topped with Havarti cheese, chili, and corn chips, was the better of the two options with a frito pie-like flavor profile. My issue with both burgers was: 1) they were too light on the toppings/sauce, which led to muted versions of otherwise inventive concepts, and 2) the meat itself was pretty dry and dense, requiring a lot more jaw action than a juicier burger would. The Texas caviar, a summery mix of black eyed peas and other small veggies doused in oil and vinegar, was pretty refreshing with the salty chips. My wife&apos;s thick-cut fries were decent as well. 

That all being said, the staff was friendly and attentive as I waited for the order, and we got a kick out of the zany, irreverent menu. I had a burger at the Rodeo Goat in Dallas years ago and remember really liking it, so I&apos;ll give this one another chance. Will need a better showing though to unseat Hopdoddy, Burger Joint, and Stanton&apos;s as my go-to spots."
3,"Service was slow, and burgers were just ok not great, would rather go to burger joint or hopdoddy but if I was in eado already with friends I wouldn&apos;t oppose it, just not my preference."
5,"This was our second time here and I almost forgot how delicious this burger was.. my husband and I order the cheese fries surprise it was huge and amazing!! He ordered the Bodacious.. I didn&apos;t get a pic of his unfortunately, I ordered the Nanny Goat!! The beef is simply amazing.. juicy and really can tell the quality!  If you are a Goat cheese person you will fall in love! I also had some local beers that were a great pair for the good! Good Covid guidelines and great service as well! Can&apos;t wait to go back for a 3rd"
5,"We have visited Rodeo Goat several times now. Their burgers and salads are delicious, inexpensive, and filling as their portion sizes are pretty large. The food always tastes like your very creative grandma made it with love. 

So far we have tried:
- Royale with Cheese
- Neil Young
- Cowboy Cobb
- Sees-Her Salad (with Chicken)
- Salted Caramel &amp; Pretzel
- Cookies &amp; Cream Shake
- Cookies &amp; Cream Shake

We wil be back and definitely encourage you to visit. The parking across the street has a meter/pay station but it makes it easy to safely exit your car if you have kids who swing doors open."
4,"The steaming pile was delicious! Even with the egg that we requested without the egg ,twas delicious though! The Firebird was amazing love the dill in there yummm!! The whiskey burger was crazy delicious! This place is worth the drive!"
3,"Cool hang out spot if you want a burger past 10 o clock that&apos;s homemade. They have a variety of burgers if you&apos;re the spontaneous type. Fries are awesome, but my favorite was the chips and quest. Outdoor seating is pretty cool"
5,"After honest consumption I have to admit their plant based burgers are a five start; Mark I believe his name, helped me with my order - great customer service. A very spacious building. Id come back for a dine in at some point. I am still full; satisfied

Thank you"
5,"Wonderful out door seating and great atmosphere! Ashley was the best server! Friendly and perky, she made the food taste that much better"
5,"Made a last-minute decision to come here and so glad we did! We got the Marvin Zindler Burger, Whiskey Burger, and Cheese Fries Surprise (not as life-changing as we expected, but the serving size made up for that, and we were indeed pleasantly surprised by the chili beef underneath!). We both liked the Marvin Zindler Burger more, though the Whiskey Burger was very unique with the blackberry, mustard, and bacon flavors mixed in! One of my friends referred to it as &quot;the sugar burger,&quot; which I had a good laugh at. Outside seating only, which was exactly what we were looking for. They have two hook and ring-on-a-string game sets (&quot;ring a bull&quot;), which we played while we waited for our food and the check. Overall a great experience!"
