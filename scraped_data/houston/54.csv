5,"This place is just as good as I remembered! I hadn&apos;t visited since I moved from H-town in 2016-- glad I returned to this staple, with my whole family in tow. We ordered a variety of menu items; I had the chicken and steak combo taco salad &amp; pork and chicken guisado tacos. Everything was delicious. The taco salad shell was light and flaky and the steak and chicken were tender. The pork guisado taco was perfect (I should have ordered two) and so was the chicken guisado taco. Everything I ordered was full of flavor and satisfied my taco cravings. Customer service was excellent. I highly recommend checking out this spot if you&apos;re looking for great tacos anytime of day! Final notes: pick up only &amp; social distancing enforced; must wear a mask."
5,"Absolutely love tacos a go go. They always have immaculate service, and make sure they follow COVID guidelines."
5,"Came here for a quick lunch eat. Sometimes you have those days where you have a breakfast appetite for lunch. 

I ordered the breakfast taco plate that comes with the side of potatoes and beans. Each taco comes with scrambled egg and you are choice of 2 additional toppings. I picked bacon and cheese, the other sausage and cheese -- next time I&apos;ll opted for guacamole/avocado over the cheese

With the hibiscus lemonade --- so good!

I knew liked the tacos so much I ordered a shrimp and fish taco to go for later in the day. 

The grilled fish taco is perfection. The next day I came back to order 2 more."
4,"I was in the mood for some tacos after a Houston sabbatical and Tacos A Go Go has always been one of those talked about places that you need to try. I was impressed by the flavors, the freshness of the ingredients, and their convenient curbside pick up. It is on the corner and the sign is a little tucked away so it may be difficult to spot at first though. For a small asian girl, two tacos is more than enough because these babies are packed. 

Overall, the tacos were good. The grilled fish was the biggest taco I got! I really liked how tender the fish was and the flavorful sauce. On the other hand, the barbacoa was a little disappointing because of how tough the meat was; I was expecting something more tender even though it&apos;s not pulled pork. 

Their online order system is super easy and they had my taco order ready very quickly. This is not my favorite taco place, but if you want something filling and ready to go quickly, this is the place to be."
5,"This spot is kind of tucked away on that portion of Main that&apos;s on the rail route so the roads are tight and parking is limited but the tacos are worth it!

I had seen it on Yelp multiple times and finally decided to go through and take a peek inside and it was definitely worth it. The guacamole is really good. The different style of tacos are great as well.

I&apos;ve had everything here from shrimp, fish, carnitas, steak. You name it and I&apos;ve had it. I&apos;ve never had a single thing bad from here!"
5,"Can&apos;t believe I haven&apos;t written a review for this place yet. I love coming here for breakfast or actually anytime...why do I lie? As a vegetarian, I love the tater tot taco without bacon and the verde taco. I also really enjoy their fresh red salsa, it is so delicious! If I come around breakfast time, I usually get their Katz cinnamon coffee. My boyfriend swears by getting the breakfast burrito because you can put whatever you want in it, and they give you a large portion."
5,"The food was delicious and flavorful .Oh the belly was out of this world  and the 
Beef was my favorite I am saving my pastor and my other Beef for my breakfast. I want to thank you so much for my food and getting here so quickly."
4,"Honestly I feel like this place is such a good tacos &quot;to go to&quot; place.

It&apos;s not the best.
But it&apos;s pretty good.
It&apos;s not always busy.
No crazy lines.
Decor is lovely.
Food comes out quick.
I feel satisfied after.

Kind of a win."
4,"Super solid breakfast tacos!  We&apos;re in town from Nashville which is a breakfast taco desert. There are so many options in Houston our heads were spinning. Decided to go with Tacos A Gogo. They were very friendly on the phone and prompt!

Had the tacos on flour tortilla which were delish. Ordered egg/potato/chorizo/cheese/avocado. That one was very tasty. Good ratios of each filling. My daughter had the barbacoa taco which she loved. Super flavorful, moist and juicy. My other daughter had the Tater Taco which she loved. 

The only reason I knocked off a star is because I asked for hot sauce specifically (wanted cholula or tapatio). She said it was in the bag but when I got home all that was in there was salsa. Other than that, I&apos;d definitely go back!"
4,"Not fancy by any stretch - a little a seedy (in a good way) even. Some seats are worn, some look newer but hey, esthetics aren&apos;t the reason you come here. The menu isn&apos;t overloaded with pages of options but they also don&apos;t just stop at tacos. I&apos;ll have to check out the rest at some point because the 3 times I visited, I got chicken tacos. They were muy delicioso! So much so, the 3 times I visited were in the same week! I should be embarrassed but I&apos;m not...actually disappointed I didn&apos;t make it in a 4th time. The salsas were fresh and so were the chips. So good!

I found street parking each time I came but I could see this being an issue during busy hours. Luckily, there&apos;s a parking garage across the street should you want to dine in. I&apos;ll see ya there!!"
2,"Stopped by in the AM for a quick breakfast before school. 

WHERES THE MEAT?  I had two breakfast tacos - sausage/onion and bacon/potato. Both tasted like they were sprayed with a gentle mist of meat flavoring, but try as I might I couldn&apos;t any sizable bite of the bacon or sausage that I ordered. Extremely upsetting.

The rest of the tacos were outstandingly... average. Tastes like something I could make at home, probably even better. The verde sauce that came with the taco was watery and really didn&apos;t add much, only redeeming quality was that there were onions and cilantro in the sauce. And I&apos;ll never say no to more cilantro and onions, but the sauce itself? Eh. 

Staff was nice. Food didn&apos;t take that long to come out. 

Stop cutting corners on the meat, add some salt into your verde and you might have a decent breakfast taco on your hands."
4,"Great food, will be ordering from here again. Basically the new Torchy&apos;s with more Tex-Mex flavors"
5,"I was hipped to this spot by one of my passengers when I drove for Lyft.  I&apos;m so thankful that I didn&apos;t mind the additional stop because when I tell you theae tacos are on point and ALL THE TIME!!! They are consistently good! 
My 12 year old does not like breakfast tacos but after reluctantly trying the bacon, geilled potato, and pico de gallo taco, she&apos;s been asking for it ever since.  That alone definitely makes it one of my go to spots!!!!!!!! I&apos;m here now picking up a few for my mom; these will be her first and I know it&apos;s going to be a homerun.   I also love all the options of salsa provided!!!!  The tacos don&apos;t need it for taste, but Im just a salsa girl at heart!!!  Whatever you order, you WILL NOT be disappointed."
5,Got some good JAMAICA to go and my friend got a potatoe taco and a fish taco! Vegan friendly!!!
5,"When dining in Texas (and specifically the Houston area), a few things come to mind..  BBQ, Southern food, and the place I am reviewing, Tex-Mex. And no place does it better than &quot;Tacos A Go Go&quot;. After a painstaking process of trying to find the perfect place for lunch, this place seemed as the smart choice based on its high ratings and close proximity to our hotel.

Located directly on Main St. in the heart of the Midtown neighborhood of Houston, Tacos A Go Go has been serving hungry Texans since 2006. Getting here can be a bit tricky though as there is very limited parking. Conveniently, the METRORail drops you off directly in front. And of course, you always have the option of using a rideshare service such as Uber or Lyft. Fortunately, my lady and I were able to find a parking spot only a block away which was around 3:30pm on a hot summer afternoon.

For first timers, this place is really a hit or miss. In fact, just by walking on Main St., you would not even know of this place even existing. But once inside, you are greeted by a fairly generous interior. It has a rather dark tone to it with blue and burnt red walls but that only adds to the ambiance of this place. You will also see pictures representing Mexican wrestlers, a red devil, and a painting of a woman that says Tabasco on it. It&apos;s a very innovative yet funky look from an artists&apos; perspective.

After debating what I should order, I settled on getting two tacos, one was their &quot;Pollo Guisado&quot; (which included shredded chicken simmered in a garlic, tomato, Serrano pepper sauce) and the other was their &quot;Picadillo&quot; (which included lean ground beef simmered with potatoes, carrots, fresh thyme and a special blend of spices). My lady opted for two of their &quot;Carne Guisada&quot; tacos (which offered tender US beef braised in a rich tomato-adobo sauce). We started off which chips and guacamole as well as taking full advantage of their salsa bar. And to drink, I tried one of their Texas-brewed Amber ale beers.

Both our plates came out fairly quickly, less than 7 minutes actually. Considering I live out in California, trying true Tex-Mex food was a very big deal to me. One first bite of both of my tacos and I was absolutely sold. The melted cheese, ground beef, and eclectic spices really made the overall flavor of these Tex-Mex tacos absolutely unique and different. My lady also raved about here Carne Guisada tacos as the beef with tomato-adobo sauce absolutely tantalized her taste buds. Not to mention, our homemade chips and guacamole were excellent; creamy and a little bit of kick for spice.

Overall, &quot;Tacos A Go Go&quot; is a place that I will go-go again if I&apos;m ever in Houston. Great quick, attentive service, reasonable prices, a distinctive interior, and amazingly tasty food. Not to mention, they have decent hours and are open late (until 2am) on Friday &amp; Saturday nights. And if you don&apos;t happen to be in the Midtown area, they have four other locations; The Heights, Oak Forest, Downtown Tunnels, and Cinco Ranch (in Katy). My rating for Tacos A Go Go, a perfect five stars!"
5,"Nice hipster tacos joint. Nothing authentic but I guess that&apos;s the point anyway.

The breakfast tacos here are classic. Huge and stuffed. And made customizable with toppings. 

Came back to try some of the dinner options. The brisket taco and shrimp taco. Pretty nice, especially the shrimp taco.

The beer selection isn&apos;t extensive but they have some good brews. That Saint Arnold Headliner hits perfect with the tacos here.

Definitely 5 stars for what it is!"
1,"Placed an order, called after the order was placed to ask for red and green salsa. When I asked I was told &quot;Um yea that&apos;s normally what we give you when you order tacos&quot; her tone was kinda like &apos;duh&apos; 

Anywho. I get the tacos. No napkins no red salsa, no green salsa. The tacos were good even tho I paid for extra avocado on my breakfast tacos that I didn&apos;t receive either. 

I haven&apos;t even started eating and I&apos;m already over it"
5,"Food was excellent. The nachos are the bomb!!!!!

Customer service was also excellent."
5,I ordered through DoorDash at the Main Street location. I&apos;ve ordered here several times and had them cater an event at my job. They are consistently delicious and the food is always hot when delivered and never had an issue as far as quality goes. But after several months I had to post a review. Today I ordered and they sent me a free dessert. I did not ask for it and they sent it with a special message. It totally made my day!!!! I&apos;m a forever customer!!
5,"7/3/19

I have never been to this location, and after I found out it was the original location I was very excited. I happen to be in this area before going to a Dynamo game, wanted to get dinner in before the game. 

It was not busy at all on Wednesday around 6:15 PM, one of the ladies who looked like a manager, was chatting with me about stories on which Dynamo players have visited. She was great, entertaining and was excited to be there, and was asking me a lot of questions to get to know her customer base better.

Parking (2/5): I walked from a friends place over to the restaurant, but it is located on main, there is no parking available, there might be street parking a few blocks away.

Food/Drinks (5/5): Pastor, Grilled Chicken on Flour, with a Hopadillo IPA, my god, my mouth is watering now writing the combo of those three items. Tacos were easily devour-able, two is definitely plenty unless you are super hungry."
