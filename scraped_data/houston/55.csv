5,"Cannot say enough good things about this place! Ordering through yelp is extremely easy and includes options to select your protein, spicy ness level, and any special dietary requests. 

I got the tom kha soup, veggie massaman curry, and pad kee mao. Everything was super flavorful and just the right amount of spicy (I opted for medium spicy level). Unlike a lot of take out options, all the dishes were hot and the veggies were not overly cooked. The prices are very reasonable, almost everything is under $10, and the serving sizes are very generous. Another plus is that the market is located right off of 45 and there is plenty of parking out front. 

Highly recommend!"
5,"Excellent take out &amp; dine it, great friendly staff &amp; knowledgeable about Asian ingredients that I can&apos;t find at the regular grocery stores, Kudos!"
5,"The foood is baaaangin. In other words the dishes we placed onto our taste buds rang with traditional/authentic, immersive flavors. Not only was the staff knowledgeable and kind on the phone but very helpful when making our decisions through ordering. 

The papaya salad was spicy yet crisp with each bite. Not to mention the Nam! Being raised in a Thai/Laos household, this brought me back to the comfort of my  Moms recipe and truly made my mouth water. 

10/10 will be stoked to enjoy more of the cuisine either take out or dine in. Thank you for an awesome meal!"
5,"My favorite Thai/Laos restaurant next to Banh Som Tum in the north side.
The larb is delicious and is super authentic. I get the spiciest and it is indeed spicy!
The wings are an absolute must try - so flavorful and crispy. They taste delicious even the next day, just throw them in the air fryer. 
Laos sausage is delicious too.!"
5,"Oh wow so were do I begin this is one those places I have procrastinated badly on writing a review for I&apos;ve literally had probably the whole Menu and Many off menu dishes here and repeat it

 uncountable times.

First off the service is so good the staff are extremely friendly and attentive and i like that they share their tips this way everyone is there to help with what ever you may need rather than being tied to one waiter/waitress 
Who&apos;s busy with multiple tables.

The food is usually amazing now one thing is for sure everything is made from scratch this is home cooking there are several different cooks so depending on who makes it it will taste different.
Also keep in mind when you are ordering certain things they can depend on the actual product like today my papaya salad was extremely spicy but really didn&apos;t taste that good however I get it at least twice a week so I won&apos;t let it not being the best once in a while bum me out.
They have 5 spice levels here warning level 4 is considered Thai Hot and sometimes is even a bit too much even for me I love Thai chili! 
Remember I said it&apos;s made from scratch so every cook also has different spice levels really wish we could put emojis here lol.

Also One important thing to mention as most places in the Heights have a lot of problem with the parking here has never been a problem for me at least and as many times as I have as I have been here I&apos;m going to go with parking is great.

Ps this is not one those bougie Thai restaurants that have been popping up all around town this is authentic
Thai food which quite honestly is what I want from any culture not some Americanized overpriced water down food in a fancy environment it is good for some vacations like a date or something but if you just want good food is where you go.

My favorite Thai Restaurant:)

Here&apos;s a few photos but if you look I have posted many many more!"
3,"I really wanted to love this place but it was just okay to me. I would love to give them another chance and maybe try something else since the things I ordered was just mediocre.

Chicken pad thai: Great portion, just really really dry..

Pad Kee Mao: A lot of vegetables, but noodles were also dry. 

Chicken satay: Comes with four pieces, it was really good.

Pork Spare ribs: Really good and great amount

Thai tea: I asked for togo cup, great amount and great taste 

Really wish the noodles weren&apos;t so dry &amp; more flavorful."
5,"Amazing Thai food! We ordered the fried tofu, beans and red curry. Great vegetarian options. They are also good enough to accommodate special orders. Must try for authentic Thai food."
5,Thank you so much for the Thai Tea sub coconut milk! Super friendly and excellent staff service. I&apos;d recommend my family and friends to visit and enjoy their cuisines. This place is a dynamic duo of a restaurant and market. Thank you Mr. Alan and the cashier in front for the useful tips on how to make Thai Tea at home! They have products you can&apos;t find easily elsewhere here. I will be back for sure.
5,"This place doesn&apos;t miss. I have had an exceptional experience every time I have come here! The food is affordable and absolutely delicious. We have had lovely service every time, as well. There is ample seating and parking."
5,"Pad Thai and yellow curry really good. Wouldn&apos;t order the chicken wings again. 3 wings for $8 seems high and they were very dried out.

service was impeccable. Lovely young guy at the counter couldn&apos;t have been nicer or more accommodating.

Will definitely return."
5,Fantastic Thai food.  I order from here often and they&apos;re super consistent.  All noodle and rice dishes I&apos;ve tried are outstanding and authentic.
5,"Probably the best Thai food I&apos;ve had in Houston (and trust me, I&apos;ve been to loads of Thai restaurants)!! 
I ordered the chicken pad kee mao and the ginger chicken steamed dumplings. 
The pad kee mao had so much flavor, a kick of spice, and wasn&apos;t oily or clumpy at all! Usually to-go noodles can tend to get a little clumpy and stuck together, but I didn&apos;t have an issue with this at all. 
The ginger dumplings were delicious. Steamed perfectly, with a juicy minced chicken filling - and the dipping sauce was full of flavor too! 
I can&apos;t believe I waited so long to try this place - but I won&apos;t be able to stop ordering from here now!"
3,"Takeout via Uber eats.

My friend and I got pad see mao. I got &quot;a little
Spicy&quot; and it was definitely spicy, but it was good. She got spicy and it was really hot. I got a Thai tea and it was good. We got the garlic fried rice to share and I wouldn&apos;t recommend - not much flavor to it. We also got the chicken steam dumplings and they did taste homemade but really lacked taste, and the sauce was not good. The spring rolls were crispy and the sweet chili sauce was good. I probably will try other Asian restaurants before I go back but it was definitely a solid &quot;B&quot; rating from me."
4,Satisfied my pad Thai craving last night by checking out this spot. Staff was really friendly from placing my order to picking up. Plenty of classic Thai options to choose from and the portion sizes are also pretty large.
5,"I really like this place. The service is always good, and I really love the food. I&apos;ve tried their Panang curry, Massaman curry, Tom Yum soup, Pad Kra Pao, Pad Nam Prik Pao, Spring Rolls, and their Thai Tea (with coconut cream, omg, so good). 

The first time I brought my fiance here with me, we ended coming back again the next day! He loves their Massaman curry and I believe he said it was the best one he&apos;s had here in Houston. My personal favorite dish here is the Pad Kra Pao, which was actually suggested to me by one of the servers. I was looking to try something different from my usual choices of curry or pad kee mao, and he really hit the nail on the head for a dish that I would enjoy based on my usual favorites. 

This place is a gem and you shouldn&apos;t pass it up if you&apos;re nearby and in the mood for Thai food."
5,"So yummy! I was recommended this place by a friend and I&apos;ve returned 3 times, and can&apos;t wait to come more times. A must order here is the Kee Mao Rice which is crispy fried rice with Chinese sausages that you eat wrapped in lettuce. This dish will be unlike anything you&apos;ve eer tasted! 

The pananag curry and yellow curry are solid options as well! The pad thai is savory and sweet, and gushing with flavor. Any thing you get here is delicious and worth it. The mango sticky rice is great for dessert--huge portion with coconuty rice and fresh mangos! The service is always very efficient."
5,"Well this being a favorite of mine lately at least once if not three of more time per week I definitely will say 5 stars the service is the most friendly in town.

As for the food it is so delicious most of the time so even when they&apos;re having an off day I just overlook it.

Will be back in a couple days definitely recommend."
1,"After reading these almost perfect reviews I was so excited to try here.
I ordered the Pla Rad Prik and that was one of my worst food decisions. Background: I enjoy fish especially Thai prepared fish. The outside of the fish looked nice but when I cut it open it was full of water. It was wet and watery and tasted terrible. It also had a very strong smell so I knew that the fish was OLD.
I even called the restaurant to ask what kind of fish they used ..thinking that maybe it&apos;s a fish I never had...but they said tilapia. I threw the entire meal in the trash. This was supposed to be my dinner . Twas disappointing and gross."
4,"This is a place which is a thai restaurant as well as a small grocery market. We ordered Pad Thai, Pad See Ew and Massaman Curry. The are vegan friendly and can make almost any things from vegan sauce. All the meats can be substituted by tofu or veggies and fish/oyster sauce by vegan sauce. They can also adjust the spice level. Since it starts from mild, we ordered mild but for sure you can try their level 2 spice. Mild wasn&apos;t spicy at all. They have a sauce bar on side from where you can surely take any hot sauce or chili oil to add to the food. Nonetheless, the food really tasted well. My favorite was the massaman curry with tofu and potatoes! 

We went for early dinner and hence the place was quite available, but my friends also checked out this place on valentine&apos;s and it was super busy. So yea, give it a try and also try mango rice! I like mango, I like rice, sometimes not together."
5,"Good food and prices!  The main dishes comes with steamed white rice.  I like eating spicy food and the medium level here is great.

Spring rolls - shrimp (2) $5 - Stuffed with fresh veggies and served with 2 sauces - peanut and sweet &amp; sour.
Pad Kra Pao Chicken $9 - Very authentic with ground meat and cut up green beans.  My favorite dish of the night.
Panang Curry Chicken $9 - Great curry flavor served with tons of veggies and meat.
Thai custard $7 - Ok, not the kind of soft spongy custard I like.  This was more dense and came with a lot of sweet sticky rice (a bit heavy for a dessert).
Steamed rice $2

Plenty of parking in the lot.  There&apos;s a grocery store inside, too.
