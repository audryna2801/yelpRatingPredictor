5,"When I came across this pre-pandemic photo of Ray&apos;s BBQ on my phone, I knew I had to show this place some foodie appreciation. The menu is classic for American/Southern Texas BBQ with all the usual meats (brisket, sausage, pulled pork, etc.) and sides (potato salad, Mac n cheese, etc), but there were also some unexpected options like po boys. I got the brisket plate and shrimp po boy and enjoyed both! 

- brisket: tender meat, not overwhelmingly salty like some places (probably because it doesn&apos;t have a seasoning crust on the outside) but a little lacking in flavor. The tangy BBQ sauce gives this the oomph it needs. 
- Potato salad: I liked this, and if you like mustard in your potato salad you will too
- Mac n cheese: decently creamy and cheesy
- Shrimp po boy: an unexpected tasty find! The fried shrimp came out super fresh and hot. I think the sandwich would have been even better if the bread had been warmed and toasted a bit, but it was still good as is. The fries are steak cut (not my preferred) and were also fresh.

If you have your heart set on a specific cut of meat, it&apos;s best to call ahead as they can run out. It&apos;s located in a smallish plaza easily seen from the street, but there&apos;s usually parking in the front."
5,"From outside in the parking lot as you step out of your car, the wonderful aroma of BBQ hits you. It&apos;s tantalizing. This business is very much organized and is practicing COVID-19 restrictions. The woman taking orders was very polite and friendly. 
I had the 3 meat plate that came with 2 sides. I had Mac n cheese and spicy rice (dirty rice style) as my sides. For the meats I had chicken, ribs and rib tips. All to go as there&apos;s no indoor seating due to the pandemic. 
The spicy rice had just enough of a kick to it and the Mac n cheese was delish. The order came with the obligatory white bread, dill pickle slices and white onion. 
My wife had the 2 meat dinner with the same sides that I had and her meats were the ribs and the brisket. The brisket was very tender and juicy. The ribs were a bit hard but well seasoned and the chicken was spot on.  They threw in a couple of to-go bbq sauces. 
There was a line at the door and they had an employee regulating the number of people inside at any time.  This place rocks! Try it and you won&apos;t be sorry."
5,"I found this place through a Houston Black-owned business list and wow, I wish I had known about it sooner. After visiting, I can see why their rating is so high. 

First, I would like to compliment the management and workers for how quickly and safely they were handling everything all while being so nice. Everyone was wearing masks, they were super efficient in getting their lines down and the food out in a timely manner, and they had markings on the floor so customers could stay 6 ft apart. 

The food was so good, and very much worth the price I paid. It was either $15 or $16 for the 2 meat plate which came with a lot more meat than some other bbq places will give. The ribs were probably my favorite as they were literally fall-off-the-bone ribs and the brisket was really good too. The mac and cheese had a bit of what I think is a cajun seasoning, which gave it a little kick and the potato salad was perfect. 

I live about 40 minutes away without traffic, but honestly, I&apos;d go out of my way IN HOUSTON TRAFFIC just to eat here again. My experience with the food and staff left that much of a good impression!"
5,"I came to Ray&apos;s months ago but forgot to write a review. Since I couldn&apos;t remember the food a few weeks later I figured it must have been average. I was very much so mistaken! Went back recently for a to-go order of the 2 meats plate- ribs, Turkey, Mac and cheese, Cole slaw- and it was SO GOOD!! They do not skimp in the meat, I always appreciate a place that gives you your money&apos;s worth. My date got the same meal but with brisket and sausage. He (and I) loved his meats as well! 

The only downside was that the Turkey is sliced so it kind of feels like a regular piece of sliced Thanksgiving Turkey. That was underwhelming, BUT the ribs were so good and meaty that it totally made up for it and wouldn&apos;t even make me consider less than 5 stars."
4,"Been going here for years. Love Mr. Ray. Followed them to two locations. 

Ribs don&apos;t need sauce. Sausage is spicy (to me) but so good that I suffer for it no matter what. Potato salad rivals my Momma&apos;s. Fried corn is awesome! Fried fish is next level. 

Love the Sweet Tea and Lemonade and the sizing is ridiculous. 

Select what you need and enjoy!!!!"
5,"Definitely my new BBQ spot for now...
I ordered through DoorDash

My order was packaged well and instructions followed. 

-      Rib Plate w green beans &amp; Loaded baked potato. The ribs were juicy and well seasoned. 
-      Chopped Brisket (ordered for a side and added some to the potato yumm) The brisket was good just a little bland. BBQ sauce added the perfect taste. 
-      Large sweet tea. This was sweeeeeet like saweetie and so so good! 
-      Side of hush puppies. Perfectly crisp! 
-      Fried corn. This was the only thing I didn&apos;t really care for over all. It was ok but soggy. I ended up taking a bite and focusing my attention on the above goodness ^"
5,"OMG!  AMAZING BBQ!!!  We got the 4 meat platter.  They were out of the rib tips so we got ribs, brisket, sausage and chicken.  For sides we got potato salad,  cucumber salad, macaroni salad an Mac and cheese.  The stars of the meat show was the brisket and ribs.  They were cooked perfectly!  Tender, moist and the perfect amount of smoke!  The chicken was a bit dry (was white meat) and the sausage was ok.  The stars of the sides show was the potato salad and the cucumber salad.  Wow!  The potato salad was creamy and had the right amount of zing.  I would certainly come back here in a heart beat!"
4,"Why 4 stars? Because this was another solid Houston BBQ experience.

   ---   ---   ---

I&apos;ve had Ray&apos;s bookmarked for years but have just never had the chance to visit. This year, I was determined to finally make the trip and was able to accomplish that mission. 

We arrived around 11:15a on a Tuesday and there were already several people ahead of us in line. When we eventually ordered, we were told that it would be about 25 minutes, which was accurate. I&apos;d definitely recommend calling ahead or ordering online if you&apos;re in a hurry. 

I knew fairly easily that I wanted to try the rib tips and the brisket, based on the reviews, so that&apos;s what I ordered for my two meat platter. I thought the brisket was just okay (3-stars) and the rib tips were 4-stars. I enjoyed the flavor and texture of the rib tips, but probably would have just preferred regular ribs since there wasn&apos;t much meat on the tips.

I did like the mac-n-cheese and the boudin sausage. A lot of the sides looked appealing, but I ordered boudin because it&apos;s not something you&apos;d normally find on a BBQ menu, especially where I live in Tampa. 

For dessert, we ordered the butter cream cake the banana pudding. Both were tasty, but the butter cream icing was so intensely sweet that it was a bit overwhelming. And the banana pudding was oddly watery.

Overall, I&apos;d rate this one more like 3-stars compared to most of the BBQ institutions I&apos;ve had around Houston, but I&apos;m rounding up a star for the struggles that local restaurants have been through during COVID-19."
3,"It had been a long time since I&apos;d last tried Ray&apos;s. My memory was more positive than the more recent experience . A group of us came craving bbq. Sadly they do not offer their meats by the pound. So the only way to try multiple meats is to order a platter.

We got brisket, spare ribs, sausage, and fried fish. The fried fish was the best part. The brisket was only ok, Along with the other meats. Ribs were slightly undercooked. Food was just average overall."
5,"3meat dinner with two sides. Beef Riblets, ribs. &amp; smoked sausage with a side of fried corn (OMG) &amp;&amp; cole slaw. So yea if the bbq doesn&apos;t come from rays... I don&apos;t want it! Lol I can&apos;t say anything else cz this bbq ws amazing, their sides are phenomenal. Smoked to perfection and delicious. Worth every dime and the portions are more than satisfying. I love this place. The best bbq I&apos;ve had in a while. Even their bbq SAUCE is bomb. Their peace cobbler which wasn&apos;t pictured was sooooo delicious. Great customer service, the server was so nice &amp; really searched to get me the cobbler with the most crust. *tears of joy*"
3,"My cousin from North Carolina made the long drive to Houston. Whenever he&apos;s in town, he&apos;s always down for some Texas BBQ or Tex-Mex. There are so many solid BBQ joints that have sprouted up around town so this was my first time visiting Ray&apos;s BBQ Shack. Located pretty close to UH, the area is a little sketch. We ordered takeout and then sat in our cars with the windows down as we were chowing down. COVID life. 

I went with the two meat plate with riblets, brisket, green beans, and mac and cheese. Bread, pickles, and onions are complimentary. The BBQ gold standard for me is Killen&apos;s BBQ. Ray&apos;s isn&apos;t quite there but I did appreciate what they&apos;re doing here. The meats are the stars of the show at any BBQ spot but I was pleased that Ray&apos;s sides delivered. Both the green beans and the mac and cheese were flavorful. 

The riblets were a bit of a miss. Some of them were really, really fatty. Overly fatty. Fat is good at BBQ joints but some pieces were just too much. Whereas other riblets were perfect. Some inconsistency here. The brisket was moist and the BBQ sauce was delicious. I could&apos;ve used more bark on the brisket to take it up a notch. Ray&apos;s meats have a noticeable mesquite flavor to them. Smoky and well seasoned. 

The interior of the restaurant is clean and modern. With a little more consistency, Ray&apos;s would be a four-star."
5,"&quot;Authenticity is a collection of choices that we have to make every day. It&apos;s about the choice to show up and be real. The choice to be honest. The choice to let our true selves be seen.&quot;

I love real, authentic people and restaurants, and Ray&apos;s is real authentic. And it&apos;s unpretentious!  

Pretentious people droll on and on about what they think and profess to know, but it&apos;s usually just crap. Most are simpleminded morons and trying to make themselves seem like something they are not -,and will never be.  

Ray&apos;s is none of this.

Instead, Ray&apos;s lets their great food do the talking - like the real players who stand back and read the room and kick ass with their actions.

It&apos;s just straight up good eaten.

And I loved the catfish when I was there."
2,"The food was mediocre and not seasoned enough, to me. First off, being a southern belle, you should be able to smell (good)  bbq, in passing."
3,"We were in the neighborhood and wanted some bbq. I looked up places on Yelp and saw Ray&apos;s BBQ Shack. I said to myself, any bbq place with the name Ray in it must be good. I mean I&apos;m not biased just because my middle name is Ray ;-). I ordered the 2 meat plate with ribs and dark meat chicken. You get two sides and I went with the spicy or dirty rice, with Mac and cheese. The meat had a lot of deep smoke flavor, so if you are not a fan of the smoke, you may not like this place. The meat was good but the chicken was just a little on the dry side. The rice was yummy and the Mac was okay (I&apos;m not a huge Mac and cheese fan to begin with so that that for what it&apos;s worth). Now the cake was the highlight of the meal. I have to warn you, get your insulin ready cause it packs a sugary punch but it is soooo gooood! I will be back to try some other items and I&apos;m hoping I can revise the 3 star rating to a 4 at least. I mean it has the name Ray so...."
3,"Disclaimer:  I have not tried the BBQ here, which I&apos;m assuming is what they&apos;re known for.  I was on the hunt for some fried catfish close by and this place checked the box.

I called in to place a takeout order during stay-at-home order in Houston. The lady who answered said that she couldn&apos;t take orders over the phone and that I would need to order online.  Alright...not sure how difficult it was to punch in a phone order?  I tried placing an online order, but the system wouldn&apos;t allow me to, so then I called back stating the issue and asking if I could just place my order over the phone.  The same lady said that she would only allow it this one time.  Okay...I was hoping to support a local business during this COVID-19 crisis but if I&apos;m inconveniencing her by making a phone order, then maybe they don&apos;t need my business.  All that aside, I decided to give it a try this one time.

When I came to pick up my order, everybody inside was super friendly and thanked me for coming.  I was completely surprised because this was a totally different feel from what I got over the phone.

The fish was decent and plentiful...$12.95 for a 3-piece meal with fries and hush puppies.  The fried catfish wasn&apos;t as crispy as other places I&apos;ve had it, but maybe that&apos;s because it was in a to-go box for the 15 minutes from the restaurant to my house.

I have to say the BEST part was the fried corn on the cob.  I got this as an extra side because I had read so many good reviews about it...and boy did it live up to the hype.  I never knew such a thing existed but this was heaven in my mouth.  Buttermilk breading was the perfect cherry-on-top to something as simple as corn on the cob.

I&apos;ll be back to try the barbecue sometime, as I&apos;m sure this is what brings the crowds in."
4,"4stars for their beef rib ( only available on Friday and Saturday). It was one large rib. I&apos;ve never seen such a huge beef rib. Meat was very tender. Comes with 2 a sides which I opted for cucumber salad (3stars - cucumber and tomato in a thick tart sauce kinda like Italian dressing ) and potato salad (4 stars-- one of the better potato salad I have had with smaller chunks of potato and flavorful). 
Also got the strawberry lemonade albeit it was too sweet for me and I couldn&apos;t taste any lemonade."
4,"Residing in a cute little strip mall, Ray&apos;s is one of the life sources of this reenergized community. This place was packed with people from various backgrounds all in fellowship for one thing...a taste of what Ray is smoking!
What I :
Atmosphere- clean and energetic with what appeared to be a full bar.
Service- Excellent! Everyone was friendly and welcoming 
Chicken- smoked to perfection and scrumptious 
Shrimp- perfectly seasoned and fresh
Fish- it was crispy and ACTUALLY catfish and fresh. Tasted a little like shrimp though
Brisket- tender with a nice smoke

What could improve:
Smoked Mac and cheese- the smoke was perfectly balanced the Mac was cheesy, but there was a lack in flavor
BBQ sauce- bit too vinegary 
Beans- can&apos;t put my finger on it, but they had a weird taste.

Would I return to Ray&apos;s? Definitely for happy hour. I&apos;ll be happy to try the brisket sammie."
4,"BBQ places can be pretty hit or miss so while I was hoping for a good experience, I didn&apos;t get my hopes up too high. I was pleasantly surprised from the moment I arrived. It&apos;s located in a small strip of stores/eateries so there&apos;s parking which is always a plus. 

The place is clean and was well covered by quite a few employees. There are a fair amount of seats but I can see how it might quickly become crowded at peak seating times. There&apos;s also a small bar that can seat about 6. Ordering is pretty simple for either dining in or to-go. 

Onto the food! I got the 2 meat plate option that came with 2 sides and toast. I had the turkey and chicken - both were good and had a nice smoke flavor. For sides, I got fries (which are steak - my fav) and green beans. Fries were good but was a little disappointed that the green beans came from a can. It was definitely enough for more than one meal and despite the canned side, I&apos;ll be back."
5,Delicious food! Brisket melts in your mouth and the baby backs are falling off the bone! Excellent service as well professional and prompt!
4,"Its in a newly renovated business park with a decent amount of parking. However I ain&apos;t parked longer than 30 seconds and I had mofos trying g to run game. Some chick pulled up on me with a sob story about not having money for diapers while having a a secondary conversation on an iPhone 11. Got past that to have a dude asking me &quot;brotha do you have a dime...I&apos;m homeless&quot;.

Geez...but worth the bullshite to eat this meat.  Nice smoke ring in the tender brisket.

Nice bark on the  ribs which have the perfect seasoning g of salt and pepper. More tender than the brisket and should be on Texas monthly&apos;s bEst list.

Upgraded the standard slice of white bread with golden buttered toast and dirty rice should be a staple side all bbq establishments in Houston...

Didn&apos;t care for the baked beans, it&apos;s canned and they pour a ridiculous amount of their house sauce in the mix, just inedible.

Overall a great place to indulge in southern smoked meat."
