5,"Eddie V&apos;s brings new meaning to an outstanding dining experience. My mom and I celebrated Galentine&apos;s at Eddie V&apos;s. They had a Valentine&apos;s Day Chef Special, bit we ordered ofd their menu. For dinner we ordered:


Jumbo Lump Crab Cake sautéed Maryland style with spicy chive remoulade (Filled with crab ×it breadcrumbs on top)

Georges Bank Scallops sautéed with citrus fruit, roasted almonds and brown butter (my mother absolutely loved this dish. She let me taste a scallop and it was delightful).

Au Gratin Cheddar Potatoes (This is flavorful and very rich with creamy cheese) 

Crispy Brussels Sprouts, Korean Glaze, Peanuts ( My mom loved these, however they were just okay to me. I usually like them a tad bit sweeter. The server did correctly describe them to me and let me know they weren&apos;t very sweet. I still wanted to try. They had good flavor.)

Portion sizes are large. We could only eat half of our food because we were saving space for dessert. 

After our meal we went for dessert. This place is well known for their Bananas Foster Butter Cake. So we ordered one to share. Best dessert I have ever put in my mouth. The Bananas Foster Butter Cake is flambéed tableside and served with butter pecan ice cream. It is a must try if you haven&apos;t tried. 

At the end of dinner, they brought me and my mom roses, which we both thought was really cute. 
Service overall was really good. Our server was friendly. The restaurant manager also came by our table to chat with us briefly to make sure we were having a nice dining experience. 

I look forward to going back again for future events and get togethers with friends and family. 

Parking: valet, metered parking, and nearby parking garage. 

COVID Precautions: patrons wear a mask unless seated at your table. Restaurant staff all required to wear masks."
5,"So I have heard many rave about this restaurant but their compliments still did not truly state how wonderful this place is.. This experience was spectacular! There was not any openings for reservations which speaks volumes but the bar seating was compliant with the social distancing requirements. 

I started off with a French 75... it was superb.

I ordered a Caesar salad .. It was great a filling the only the was the dressing was a bit on the tart side but still was good.

I tried the crab cake appetizer and omg! It was soooooooo good. It was filled with lump crab meat and a spicy sauce.. again so so good! 

That&apos;s it. I literally was full after a salad and crab cake folks!

I tried the diamond drink... it was tasty. Not strong but tasty. I probably wouldn&apos;t order it again. My friend had the 24k martini.. she swore it was the best drink ever 

Service was fast considering we went on a busy night. I will DEFINITELY be returning soon to hopefully order an entree."
5,"The purpose of this letter to commend your staff, specifically Todd  Parker  (server) and Atul Kapoor (general manager) at the Eddie Vs located at  1111 West Ave.  Both Todd and Atul went above and beyond to ensure my dining experience and birthday was memorable on February 19,2021.  They absolutely exceeded my expectations and should be acknowledged for their professionalism and service.  
 
As you may recall, the week of February 14, was a tough week for Texas, a tough week for Houston.  I was scheduled to have a party on the evening of February 19th. Unfortunately as the week progressed it was evident that the party not going to happen.  Ultimately, the party was cancelled.
 
In an effort to salvage my birthday, my daughter and friend  suggested that we have an intimate dinner at Eddie Vs (one of my favorite restaurants).  After a bit of coaxing, I agreed.  My friend  made the reservation for 4.  We invited Gregory B  who&apos;s behavior  was completely inappropriate. 
 
First and fore most,  I want to compliment Todd, for his unwavering service and professionalism.  Todd was attentive yet respectful.  I have been a patron of Eddie Vs for as long as you have been in Houston, both personally and professionally.  I have frequented the restaurant too many times to count.  In fact I would be defined as a &quot;regular.&quot; Todd is hands down one of the best servers I have enjoyed the pleasure of working with.
 
Gregory B&apos;s  perspective of  dinner  off base and not reflective of the evening. Both Todd and Atul went above and beyond to ensure that our dining experience was positive.  It&apos;s unfortunate that this person was unhappy, however his unhappiness was not caused by any staff at Eddie Vs.
 
Eddie Vs is one of my favorite restaurants and will continue to be in my frequent rotation.  In fact I returned to Eddie Vs on Sunday, February 21st and had dinner with my daughter .   Additionally my daughter had dinner at Eddie Vs on Saturday, March 6th.   Clearly some people do not understand the &quot;art&quot; of eating at a fine dining restaurant.  We will continue to patronize Eddie Vs obviously without the troublemaker that went to dinner with us. 
 
Great dinner and great staff.  Lesson learned that not all friends deserve to eat out with you.  Some should stick to drive through."
3,"Eddie V&apos;s was one of my all time favorite restaurants for fine dining in Houston however my last dining experience changed that. We was seated promptly at our arrival. The restaurant was following COVID 19 restrictions. The restaurant was beautiful and ambiance was great as always. Our waiter wasn&apos;t it. We started by ordering drinks and appetizer. We waited nearly 20 mins before our drinks were bought to our table. The calamari was good, excellent texture and fried to perfection with the perfect amount of crispy. For my entree I ordered the ribeye steak with the lobster mashed potatoes. Our food was bought out and I received my ribeye. When I asked our server about my side, he stated they was out of the lobster mashed potatoes. Why wouldn&apos;t he come informed me about that prior to my ribeye coming out.

I then asked about their lobster Mac and cheese, which I ordered previously. Our server said they don&apos;t serve lobster Mac and cheese. He informed me they have truffle Mac and cheese. My ribeye was good however it could had been a tad bit more tender. 

I didn&apos;t care for the truffle Mac and cheese. My friends on the other side enjoyed their meal so I was happy with that. The crab fried rice picture was what my friend ordered, that was really delicious!"
5,"We had an absolutely fabulous time. I wish I could remember the name of our server because she was phenomenal! when I remember, I&apos;ll edit this review! She had the most pleasant most beautiful personality ever. She literally always kept a smile on her face even when I saw her go to other tables. She was just a delight; Super attentive super personable super sweet... 

The food, of course, was delectable! Just savory yummy goodness.

This is my second time at this location and the last time has been over a decade ago!

 We ordered the crab cake, virgin mojito, salmon for me and the redfish for her. Plus crab fried rice and crab lobster mac and cheese. 

Everything was scrumptious.

Then came down to my birthday trio cookie, butter cake and pecan ice cream surprise! That was soooooo good. They put on a show too! Haha.

I had just a really really fabulous time. Though my birthday was the end of December, my friend wanted to treat me to a birthday meal. 

I&apos;m so happy that we came here! I felt really great and special thanks to Eddie V&apos;s!"
5,"I came here with a few coworkers after work to have a drink and relax after a long day. The atmosphere here is so relaxing. 
Our waitress immediately greeted us and was very attentive the entire time we were here. She recommended to us The Diamond which was amazing. 
I forgot what&apos;s in it, but it&apos;s not too strong but it&apos;ll give you a light buzz and it has a nice citrusy flavor. 
We ordered the seafood tower to share which came with crab meat, lobster, jumbo shrimp, and oysters with 4 different sauces. They also bring you complimentary bread &amp; butter to your table to accompany your meal. 
I would definitely come back here again."
5,"Our group came in for dinner before a cocktail party and Eddie V&apos;s was the perfect place to start our night! 

Our group was relatively large and Eddie V&apos;s made it easy to make a reservation! We decided to go with the Houston Restaurant Week Menu and it did not disappoint! 

I started with the Crispy Salt and Pepper Shrimp that we&apos;re perfectly crispy and topped with a delicious sauce! For the second course, I got the 8 oz fillet and mashed potatoes. The steak was perfectly cooked with a great crisp on the outside! Finally we finished with the banana foster cake which was absolutely delicious. The cake was very rich but so so good and would be perfect to share! 

The cocktail selection is amazing and you are really missing out if you pass on the cocktails. I got the hope diamond martini which had the perfect balance of tart and sour from the grapefruit liqueur! The maverick and mango mule were also favorites of the table! 

Will definitely be a top choice for a special occasion!"
5,"I recently came here for a girls night out. We were given top-notch service by our waitress. For drinks we both chose to indulge in some martini&apos;s. I had the hope diamond martini, which smooth. It is also beautifully made with the big chunk of purple ice in the middle for decor. 

The steak was by-far hands down one of the best savory steaks I&apos;ve ever had. The melted cave-aged blue cheese did as an add-on was burnt to a perfection, giving it a bold but complimentary taste to the already juicy steak. It was prepared exactly how I love. The medium-rare steak was so soft it just melted in my mouth. Each bite was savory with a thin layer of crisp bitter blues cheese mixed in. I didn&apos;t care to speak, because I was too busy in steak heaven... we both were. You know I&apos;m loving my food when I don&apos;t care to speak. Yes, it was THAT good.  The crab fried rice can definitely be shared by at least two people, but the two of us girls left half, so probably more like 3 or 4. I had never had crab fried rice, and boy did it not disappoint. The rice also had amazing flavors going on. The mushrooms and the crab mixed in tasted great together. It was the perfect side to a perfect steak. Unfortunately no room was left for dessert.

We both decided that from now on, this is our steak spot. I&apos;m not sure why we haven&apos;t been here in so long. Maybe with all of the steakhouses to choose from in Houston, we just overlooked this classic Houston spot. But from now on, it will be on the top of the list."
1,"On  February 19, 2021, I was really disappointed with Eddie V&apos;s at 2800 Kirby Dr., A-120, Houston, TX  77098.  It was recommended to be a restaurant for a highly exceptional dining experience, but I experienced just the opposite.
 
I was concerned with a number of issues before, during and after the meal.
 
First, the entryway was uninviting to say the least. My guest and I were met with a heavy outflow of water at the entrance.  It was unsafe and clearly presented a safety risk.
 
Second, the general manager (Amit) was rude, and dismissive with a crude sense of humor and the  waiter was inattentive.  Not only was it necessary to request water multiple times but the dessert was served late.
 
Third, the quality of food that one would expect from a restaurant of your level and reputation was unsatisfactory.  It was lukewarm at best. 
 
Finally, upon receipt of the bill, I was called the wrong name. 
 
I have eaten in many restaurants throughout the United States, Asia and Europe, but my experience at Eddie V&apos;s has been the worst experience in restaurant dining.  The unsafe entryway, the dismissive general manager, an inattentive waiter, the unsatisfactory food and to be addressed by the wrong name, made for my worse dining experience.
 
Hopefully, the water leak has been repaired. In addition, it is my suggestion they speak with their general manager and other employees about the issues mentioned, so that no one else will have the bad experience that was experienced by me and my guest on February 19, 2021. It was far from the &quot;exceptional dining experience&quot;.
 
Regards

5,"Eddie V&apos;s is one of my favorite restaurants no matter what city we are in!  We have celebrated anniversaries, birthdays, and most recently, Thanksgiving, with Eddie V&apos;s over the past decade and have never been disappointed.  

Our favorite appetizers are the Yellowtail Sashimi, the Kung Pao Calamari, and the Lobster Bisque (and if we are dining at the restaurant - the shellfish tower or oysters!), and our favorite entrees are the Chilean Sea Bass and the filet mignon with blue cheese aged crust.  The Sea Bass is my absolute favorite dish, it is light but very flavorful, and I love the bok choy swimming in soy broth underneath (sometimes I&apos;ve had spinach instead, but the bok choy is my favorite).  For sides we like the crab fried rice or splitting a baked potato (they are huge, and if you get the accompaniments on the side, it&apos;s easy to split between two people), and for dessert the bananas foster butter cake is amazing.  Normally I don&apos;t even like bananas foster, but when we eat at Eddie V&apos;s, I just cannot resist!

Cheers!"
5,"Food was absolutely amazing. Our server, Rodney was exceptional!!! Would recommend to anyone."
4,"My friends and I visited Eddie V&apos;s for a birthday dinner on Dec 5, 2020. We made 8:00pm reservations and when we arrived we were quickly seated. The restaurant was upscale and they a did a great job of keeping everyone 6 feet apart. I would highly recommend dressing up. If not you will feel under dressed. 
    We ordered the Kung Pao Calamari for the table. It was delicious and enough for 3. I ordered the Jumbo Gulf Shrimp. It was stuffed with crab meat. I definitely enjoyed it. I really wanted the South African Lobster, but it was out of my price range ($100) Lol. We also ordered a side of crab fried rice. I highly suggest trying that dish. My friends and I enjoyed it. Our drinks were pretty but a little on the weak side. I got a strawberry margarita. My friends ordered steaks. We all shared the food, it was fulfilling. 
Our waiter seemed to be distracted and forget one of our sides and drinks. He never came back to check on us. When he did, we mentioned he forgot our side dish and he said &quot;Oh, I forgot to tell you we were out.&quot; He recommended something else but we were full by then. 
Overall, everything was delicious and fresh. I would come back here again despite the waiter. I definitely need to try the South African Lobster.  I would&apos;ve given 5 stars but the waiter was blah."
5,"Eddie V&apos;s oh how I love you. I have been to Eddie V&apos;s many times. I am never disappointed. I usually treat myself to Chilean Sea Bass but I thought I&apos;d change it up on this particular night. I ordered salmon and I was completely in heaven. A succulent, well cooked, flavorful, and nice thick cut. Cooked well done to my liking. I ordered my usual crab fried rice and truffle Mac and cheese to accompany it. Same great flavors that I&apos;m used to. I&apos;ll be back sooner than later."
3,"I was a little disappointed by the lack of professionalism of some of the staff, especially at the front. The dress code for the waitstaff appears to be more relaxed than that at the other location. The food was amazing! My salmon was seasoned and grilled perfectly!! The truffle Mac and cheese was great as was the asparagus. The crab cakes were absolutely delicious! Overall, despite the fact that there were several very loud tables, it was an enjoyable experience."
5,Everything was  amazing from the oysters to the lobster taco and the The Hope Diamond cocktail was epic. I love  it.
3,"My drink was stellar. It was a wood smoked bourbon and if it&apos;s still on the menu,you need to order it for the presentation alone. 

The food was lackluster. I was actually prettt disappointed give. The reviews and the price points. The actual restaurant is pretty posh. You should definitely look your best (your FINEST) is not required. 

The staff were pretty attention and sweet. Don&apos;t think I&apos;ll be back. Cute spot though"
4,"I&apos;m not sure why it has taken me so long to review this place. My husband and I came by several months ago for HRW. I got the filet mignon and my husband got salmon.  The ambiance was a expected.  Classy,  sophisticated and great date spot.  What threw me off was the Waiter. I get the whole young, hip or New Age Vibe but black jeans and a barely-there black tank top? Really? And she was way way way too chatty. Not necessarily what you would want from a waitress while you&apos;re out on a nice date. Anyhow, the food was not bad. The steak was cooked as requested (medium rare) and the mashed potatoes were standard Steakhouse fare. The salmon was super bland. For dessert, we got the butter cake and if I remember correctly and I I think some type of chocolate lavacake and vanilla ice cream. I don&apos;t remember. I really enjoyed the gooey butter cake but it was definitely a calorie bomb. Overall, great experience and good food. The price was right only because it was HRW. I&apos;m not sure I would have felt the same way if it had 
just been just a regular night.

Final grade: B
I might return if I don&apos;t have to pay.  Lol"
5,Dined in for restaurant week. Had an amazing experience here. Some locations during restaurant week leave you feel like the &quot;deal&quot; you received was not worth it at all. That was not the story here. The Lobster Bisque and Shrimp appetizers were both equally amazing. Bisque was nice and rich while the shrimp was light and flavorful. The filet melted in the mouth and was cooked perfectly and mashed potatoes were made with care as well. Would 100% recommend to anyone wanting to try this place.
5,"I was over the moon excited to try this place out when my friend organized a gathering for  all of our closest friends. The atmosphere is pleasant, you can small notes of Thai   Sauce and seafood wafting in the air  as  you are being esccorted by a delightful hostess. We arrived during their Happy Hour which ends at 7. We were able to enjoy each other&apos;s company in solitude as the lively buzz of the restaurant hadn&apos;t picked up yet. By the time we got our food, Eddie V&apos;s had begun to play live, soft Jazz. I could feel myself falling asleep and dreaming of the various flavors I was about to experience!

As a group we ordered a variety of items from their happy hour menu and shared with each other so that we could sample them.

My recommendations: 
Steak Tartare 
Lamb Lollipops 
Salt &amp; Pepper Shrimp
Jump Lump Crab Cake
Gulf Coast Oysters on Half Shell

Drinks: Spicy Margarita and Baleit Sour"
5,I came here for my birthday and had the best time. We came with a group of 6 and our waiter was Rodger. He gave us excellent service and great menu recommendations. We came during Houston Restaurant Week so we had pre-picked options. I order the 24 Karat drink and loved it. It was the perfect combination of sweet &amp; tart. I got shrimp for my app and the sauce really made it pop! My main course was the filet cooked medium and when i say wow thats what i mean. They cooked it to perfection and i loved every bite! For dessert i had the bananas foster butter cake. It was a lot of sweets and rich in flavor so i couldn&apos;t finish it but it was tasty! I will definitely be back! Thanks Rodger for making our experience great!!
