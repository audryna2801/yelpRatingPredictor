5,"There are a bunch of Mediterranean and halal type food options in this area of town, but so far this is my favorite. We had been going to gyro hut across the street but decided to mix things up and I&apos;m glad we did. While the menu options are pretty similar, gyro king had better portion sizes and imo, seems to be more freshly made. Food is made quickly and staff is friendly. We have gotten combo rice platter and chapli kebab platter and really enjoyed both. I&apos;ve also had the fruit juices in the past and they are excellent (they have a super impressive juicer if you watch them make it!)

Of note, this is a food truck and does not have any seating (which is ok by me during this pandemic time). They have a sign that says they will be opening/?moving to new location, so not sure if that will be another food truck or a sit-down. I imagine a move may be good for business bc their current location leaves something to be desired (wouldn&apos;t want to be hanging out at this gas station late in evening)."
5,"The employees are not following safety and sanitation procedures. Staff is not wearing masks or gloves; I asked why not and the cashier says &quot;I have a mask its over there&quot; pointing toward the front end of bus. Haha ... if the mask is on the premises then apparently that should suffice. I&apos;ll pass on coming back for now.. it&apos;s just a weird time to not be wearing PPE. 

Food is great every time I come here. Vegetables, meat sauce... everything is fresh and made to order. The juices are fresh as well and are a great combo to the meal. If you like it extra spicy ask for the fresh jalape√±os!"
5,"Without a doubt my favorite gyro food truck. 

The lamb over rice is just addictive. There are many gyro places, food trucks and otherwise, but the lamb here is just so great. I recommend getting the sauces on the side because I think they go a little heavy, but the sauces are also tasty. The red sauce isn&apos;t the spiciest, but it has a nice tang to it. The gyro itself is also very good. The pita is just so pillowy. But without a doubt the lamb over rice is where it&apos;s at. The portion size is also pretty big for the price. During this past year the convenience of getting food from a food truck has made this an even better recommendation. You know it&apos;s good when people have waited in the pouring rain for some food from here. 

Side note: if you&apos;re looking for falafel, I recommend going somewhere else. It&apos;s not really good here. The excellent rating from me is based on the lamb, the great service, the price, and the convenience."
2,"Never again. I order two combo salads today. This was horrible. Mainly because we were served leftovers. I have cooked long enough in my life to know what meat that is oxidized from exposure to air looks and tastes like.

The lamb gyro was dried out and hard and the chicken was dry as hell. I used to love this spot but if thats what yall are going yo do i can go somewhere else"
5,"I&apos;ve tried many of the gyro/Mediterranean places in Houston, and this is the best gyro place by far! The people working there have always been really friendly, and the food is ready fast. The portions are huge, usually enough for me to eat at least two meals. I&apos;d recommend the combo over rice! 

Note: it is a food truck; there&apos;s no place to sit and eat, but the food is worth it!"
4,"Pretty darn good! It&apos;s a food truck and it has a limited menu but it was really good. They give you alot of did for the price.  The service is good and fast.  I tried the combination rice bowl.  It had chicken,  beef and shrimp and rice and lettuce. I don&apos;t know what sauce they use but it its good.  Overall I would recommend."
5,"Gyro King is really cool place and we love their freshly made juices and their platters. We had the Lamb chops over rice, the gyro fries, the chicken tenders platter, and the combo platter. All were very delicious but the lamb chop platter and the gyro fries really won us over!!! We&apos;ll definitely be headed back for more. (Btw make sure to ask for the red sauce and the white sauce, you can thank me later )"
3,"Yno there are places that do the gyro in cubes. Or chunks of meat. There are places that do it in thin slices.

I personally am a thin sliced kind of guy. 

I think the flavor in the meat is strong, and can be a bit overwhelming when clunked together. So I believe to create a beautiful harmony within the gyro it must be thinner slices.

This place is cubed or chunky meat pieces. Again. You may like that but I do not.
The flavor gets a bit too salty and overpowers everything else I&apos;m eating. Luckily the place can serve it quite spicy which I truly appreciate. There were a fair amount of vegetables. Even and balanced. Never felt like &quot;o dang... This is a ton of veggies...&quot; It felt like a solid good amount. 

But.... I have had better. 

The flavors didn&apos;t sing as it should. Or could have. 
I liked it. Trust me. Nothing gets me going than a solid gyro sammy. But I believe it can do better."
1,"Worst customer service ! That guy is rude! and they charge different  amount if u pay in cash and if u pay on credit card, they charge u more"
5,"The Med Center has plenty of gyro places to choose from, but I always find myself coming back to Gyro King. You get a ton of food for a good price! Never have I ever finished a whole plate in one sitting. 
I normally go for the combo platter, which has both lamb and chicken. The meat is never dry and it is packed with flavor. 
If you like spicy, ask for extra red sauce!"
5,Located conveniently near TMC area.. the food was excellent..the salads were fresh.. loved the sauces!!.. very quick service despite of people coming over.. definitely will be back this place to try another dish!!! 5 star from my side!!!
5,This is my new favorite place to get lamb gyros. When you request the sauce on top and not on the side it makes all the difference.
5,"Always a 5 star for Gyro King!! Been here multiple times since I found out about this place from my boyfriend! The lamp over rice is always my go-to since I find the chicken is a bit to the dry side. Love how they have sauce on the side and give you extra when requested. 
The owner is super friendly and welcoming every time I come! Would totally recommend this to anyone who like to try out their food!"
5,The Gyro King food truck is open for all your gyro and shawarma craving needs! I&apos;ve been here a handful of times and I love that it stays open late. I usually get the lamb over rice or the lamb gyro. It comes with tzatziki sauce and a spicy sauce to drizzle. Super filling and delicious! There&apos;s hardly ever a line so you usually get your food in less than 7 minutes. You can also order it on Ubereats!
4,I eat here at least once a week haha I get the lamb it&apos;s good. I don&apos;t know much about eating halal but they are a decent intro I guess
4,"I honestly have to say that I prefer Gyro King over Halal Guys (Houston). Service is quick and I love how it&apos;s literally down the street from me. The portions are huge and it&apos;s not expensive at all. One downside to this location is the parking. Some nights it can get crowded and difficult to find parking around the gas station that it&apos;s located by and the area can seem a little sketch for some people. Overall it&apos;s a great place to grab a quick dinner! 

Favorite item: lamb over rice"
1,Absolutely disgusting food! Very bad customer service. Look below this is what I got! I ordered a mix ( beef&amp; chicken) over rice. He put all burned meat on the rice. Absolute trash foo....
5,"Definitely worth a visit for a delicious tasting gyro. 

You&apos;ll find this food truck in the parking lot of a gas station. 

I ordered the lamb gyro which was $8.75 ( they don&apos;t display prices) and I would have to rate that a 5 out of 5.

The flavors were on point and they give you a good amount."
5,Y&apos;all....this is good AS HELL. I&apos;ve never had a gyro before but omg this is AMAZING its so spicy and flavorful then the cucumber and lettuce help cool it down and the bread is so soft and tasty you gotta try this!!!! And the service was incredible!! So fast!!! New fave food truck
5,"Lamb over rice is my jaaaaam dude! $9 for a to go box worth. I never finish the entire thing in one go so I always have left overs. So $9 divide by 2 is 4.5 soooo with logic, 4.5 for a meal. LOL jk ;) but their food is definitely worth trying. I&apos;ve also had their lamb and chicken over rice. It&apos;s TO. DIE. FOR!!!"
