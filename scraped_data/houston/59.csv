5,"I originally wrote a review for this amazing spot four months ago but the picture I took was terrible. So here&apos;s an updated photo and an updated review. 

This is still considered one of my favorite places to eat. The chicken, scratch that, THE FOOD is never disappointing. That is the main and biggest reason for the continued five stars from me. The entire staff still practices wearing a mask and they are all hard working people who serve you in a friendly and calm manner. They keep the place clean, including bathrooms, and keep hand sanitizer stationed as soon as you walk in. 

Will always suggest Gus&apos; to any and everyone. 100 out of 5 stars!"
5,"I have been to Gus&apos;s several times and the consistency is there. Every single visit the chicken is crispy as can be, moist, and delicious. This time, I got the Mac &amp; cheese (which was delectable), and the seasoned fries (which were good, not great). I have also had the fried okra and absolutely love it. I have yet to have something here that I didn&apos;t like. 

I was born and raised in Kentucky, so fried chicken is in my blood. Gus&apos;s is truly a cut above the rest. The chicken remains very crispy even when ordered on an app for delivery. LOVE the chicken with some hot sauce on it if that&apos;s your thing. 

ENJOY!"
5,"I visited pre covid-19. I ordered the 3 of the dark pieces of chicken with beans and okra as the sides and then an extra order of mac &amp; cheese. I really liked the chicken, it was extremely hot and fresh. The skin was crispy and the meat was juicy. Yum! I really enjoyed the sides as well. The beans were delicious. I&apos;m a huge fan of mac &amp; cheese and they really hit the spot. The servings were quite large and I was left really full. 

Overall, I really enjoyed eating here and can&apos;t wait to visit again!"
4,"Delicious.

My friend bragged about this place like she owned the spot and I finally see what she &apos;s talking about. The chicken was seasoned perfectly and not too crunchy.  The dinner comes with baked beans and coleslaw but with a .50 charge you can sub any of the sides."
4,"Wait times vary for dine-in but expect 15-30 minutes durning normal hours; expect even longer wait times during rush hour. The chicken is outstanding! Parking is on the side of the building. It&apos;s hard to find parking during rush hour so be prepared to wait and find parking. 
The chicken is moist, and the skin is crunchy and seasoned well. The beans were too sweet/thick for my liking. The greens (contains pork) are decent and not out of this world. Bread ties the whole dish together."
5,"KFC better not walk. Better not jog. Nah, they better sprint for their money! Here at Gus&apos;s, they know how to fry up a meaaaan chicken. Like really mean. So mean, I could&apos;ve sworn the fried chicken insulted my mother at some point.

First time trying it out, I walked in on a moderately busy week day. Lunch crowd was fat and happy, munching away at their plates, not noticing my envious glances. I was practically salivating by the time I got to the counter.

The cashier was nice enough, took my order and I made my way towards one of the dining room tables to wait. Beginner&apos;s mistake, turns out it&apos;s not an order-at-the-counter, sit-anywhere-you-like kind of situation. I was a little disappointed, but when I got up to get my to-go packed food, the employee politely offered me a seat at the bar, informing me the dining room was for tip earning servers. Whoops!

In spite of my mistake, he made me feel welcomed. Very nice guy, supplied all of the proper necessities I needed for a proper dine-in experience. Another server came along and made some chitchat with me, and I happily noted how friendly everyone was.

Now onto what really matters, the food. I got a mixed breast and thigh plate with a side of macaroni and cheese. That chicken. Oh man! The way the juices pooled out when you tore a piece off, piping hot and succulent! The outer crust crispy and crunchy. And what many are gonna love to hear, it wasn&apos;t greasy, surprisingly. Not to mention, very well-seasoned. It was better than good for sure.

The mac and cheese was good, nothing too crazy and it&apos;s often hard to go wrong.

I left in a body bag after slipping into a delicious food coma. I&apos;m reviewing from the &quot;other side&quot;. Anyways, highly recommend!"
2,Observed the cook not wearing a mask while preparing the food. Chicken was ok. Nothing to rant and rave about.
5,"The parking lot is a little side entrance next to the building. It&apos;s a one way parking lot so be careful. 

Ordering the food was so easy. Picking up was fast. Waiting to eat it when we got home was torture because it smelled sooooo good! 

We ordered way too much food but that is ok because there is more for the next day. Half a chicken with the coleslaw and beans were good but I think the mayonnaise melted and went into the beans and a little bit on the chicken. The tenders, Mac and cheese, and seasoned fries were very tasty. The tenders are like two to three times the size of the Raising Cane&apos;s tender size. 

I also was talked into getting a sweet potato pie (even though I just got 8 cupcakes from Sprinkles) and it was good!!! The lady on the phone recommended the chocolate pie but next time. 

I would definitely recommend this place to everyone!!!"
5,"Gus&apos;s is delicious! I ordered today via Doordash (because of Covid) and it arrived quickly and still hot &amp; fresh! I ordered 3 Tenders with Ranch, Mac &amp; Cheese and Fried Okra. The tenders were a little overcooked, but they still tasted great. It was a nice level of spice, with good flavor but not so hot that it&apos;s uncomfortable to eat.  The Mac &amp; Cheese was excellent and some of the best I have ever had. Most mac and cheese isnt cheesy or creamy enough for me, which wasn&apos;t the case with Gus&apos;s! And I&apos;m a sucker for fried okra, so of course I love it.  The servings were also pretty big and great for the price. 

Overall, a great lunch and I will be returning, hopefully for dine in soon."
1,"We have been going to Gus&apos;s for a long time.   We tell all our friends how great the food and the people are...last night I took my sons to dinner.   For the first time we got sick, the chicken was not cooked through.  It&apos;s sad that this has happened.   We will be avoiding eating here for some time."
5,"NOM!!!!!!! This place is delicious and lived up to the hype!! My fianc√© told me about this place, and how the chicken was &quot;finger licking good&quot; but I honestly didn&apos;t believe him....SO I had to try it for myself duhhhh. We ordered our food to go and got the 3 pieces of dark meat (and requested all 3 pieces to be legs) hehe. Legs are the best so fight me if you disagree. For our sides we got the mac and cheese and potato salad. Oh my. The chicken was delicious. So perfectly crunchy, and the inside was juicy. They gave us honey mustard on the side to dip the chicken in, and that didn&apos;t disappoint. The sides were great as well. Everything tasted so fresh!! All in all we were in a food coma and were very satisfied. I would highly recommend if you&apos;re a fried chicken enthusiast and are ever in the area!! I will definitely be going back!!!!"
5,"BEST CHICKEN EVER!!! I really enjoy Gus&apos;s chicken! It&apos;s always fresh, crispy and juicy! The flavor is unexplainable... its just that great. Now these sides could use some work.. I&apos;m not a fan of the mac or beans. I&apos;ve vowed to only order the okra and fries moving forward. I reallly like the okra. I also tried the pecan pie it was really good.

The chicken is a must try!!"
5,"Uh yeah so hands down best fried chicken in town. We are regulars here and have been here so many times. Yes the ring of fat around my heart is from eating fried chicken, because I just cant get enough! The chicken is always juicy and flavorful, not matter the cut you get. I always go for the dark meat because its the best. 
-Mac and cheese- is very cheesy exactly what you want
-Beans- smoky, rich a little spicy
-coleslaw- is ok, needs a little more sauce
-Fried Okra- is the best!
-Fried pickles- great batter, has a little hint of dill that goes great with ranch.

Covid-19. They are practicing proper social distancing and the waiters are wearing masks. The place is always clean and the tables are far enough apart where you feel safe dining in."
1,"Churches chicken has better chicken let&apos;s start there.  Side where ok nothing special,  they claim  can they are world famous but they don&apos;t tell you for what!! Because it&apos;s definitely not for good taste... I had such high hopes from this place as it was recommended by several friends however the food is basic not worth the calories"
5,"If you like crisp, spicy chicken, it&apos;s a no-brainer. Their H town location&apos;s tastes JUST LIKE THE original in Austin. It&apos;s mama caliber yard bird."
5,"Just when I thought there is no more place that offers a better fried chicken .. Gus&apos;s came to my life.

My husband came home with fried chicken bag in his hand excitedly, I was not too happy since he did not buy from the usual favorite place we used to buy from.
He said this is Gus&apos;s fried chicken. I was like, no way it is gonna be better .

He handed me 2 chicken.. 
I was shocked since the 1st bite! it was SUPER crunchy, tasty, a bit spicy...juicy!
Gus&apos;s took me to the fried chicken heaven. 
My husband is really spot on with his choice.. once again!

Gus&apos;s chicken is definitely a worthy cheat meal if you are on a diet.

PS: try it with hot sauce :)"
3,"Pretty good chicken with great seasonings. Although it&apos;s not extremely spicy, the spice will sneak up on you. My favorite part of the meal were the fried green tomatoes. Crispy, golden brown, and full of flavor. While that was my favorite part of the meal, I was not as pleased with the sweet potato pie."
5,"Their fried chicken is super juicy and crispy, and whatever is in their seasoning tastes awesome. We usually get the plates like 3piece dark meat with sides. For the sides, can&apos;t go wrong with any of them like the seasoned fries or fried okra. Delicious comfort food. Love the casual ambiance and great for kids."
5,This is the best service I have ever had in my life! The lady at the counter was the best and the rest of the crew was super friendly. The food is amazing like super super amazing. The flavor is bold not too hot just right next to none! The vibe from the employees makes this place everything! Everyone is wearing makes and social distancing unlike other places. I&apos;ll definitely be back here
5,"This place definitely has one of the best hot &amp; spicy fried chicken in town. It&apos;s so crispy and juicy  brb, I&apos;m drooling! But seriously tho, if you haven&apos;t tried this place yet, please do me a favor and visit them. You won&apos;t regret it. We ordered for takeaway, and when we got home, the chicken were still so crispy. So so good!!!"
