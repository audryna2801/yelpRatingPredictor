5,"I am from Arizona, and I went to Houston to check if I want to live here. After I got back from the airport, I stumbled upon Peli-Peli. 

To start off, the hostess was very friendly, and they are obvi enforcing social distancing. The calamari was one of the best calamari I&apos;ve had (and I ALWAYS order calamari if any restaurant offers it in their menu). 

Next up, the clams - it&apos;s sooooo delicious and savory. Eating eat with their garlic bread is like HEAVEN. *drools*

Lastly, I got the Peli Peli chicken because.... I figured I&apos;d try the dish they were named after. I got my Peli-Peli with the rice and Brussel sprouts. Y&apos;all, even their brussel sprouts surprised me, Lol. Like, the best brussel sprouts ever  

Anyways, if I do move to Houston, Peli-Peli would be one of my go to places!"
5,"Such a wonderful experience. I have zero complaints. Lighting and atmosphere made it feel very international. I would expect to get the full experience if I am eating a cuisine from another country. Everything was delicious! 

They limited their capacity but not the distance part, however there was an outside patio area. I didn&apos;t like how small and boxed in it was so I had a corner away from everyone. 

Our waiter was very friendly, knowledgeable, and efficient. I recommend this place for anyone who loves trying new food and wants an experience.

** FYI: The music in the bathroom will make you dance! Lol"
5,"Wow - what an amazing dinner! 

Safety comment first - everyone wears a mask and tables are well spaced out and disinfected between use. 

Now, the service and food.... OMG. 

The hostess greeted us promptly and friendly. And we happened to have the Manager also at the front when we checked in (reservations definitely recommended) That was a bonus - she heard it was a bday dinner and brought glasses of Prosecco to the table for a pre dinner toast - AWESOME touch of service!

Our server Kurt- he was amazing. First he does have a really cool accent, and he is super helpful with explaining the dishes and making recommendations.  And, he was attentive to drinks and timing of the courses. We loved Kurt! 

The food- incredibly delicious, tasty delights that we already miss and can&apos;t wait to come back and try more! 
We decided to just share everything because it was our first time here. Appetizers: Trinchado and Bobotie. Enjoyed them both, although they&apos;re very different. The Trinchado is a savory, creamy white wine sauce with slices of ribeye plus garlic bread to dip... and trust me, you&apos;ll be sipping up that sauce. The Bobotie was this unique, crusty pastry pie crust filled with blended and whipped vegetables and beef. Then topped with a sweet jam... which trust me, I know that sounds odd but it all comes together in this delightful dish. 

Main course - we tried the Espetada; chicken and ribeye. This is a moist- and I mean very juicy and moist, skewered stack of meat with a garlic butter melting on top and dripping down the skewer. Sooooo flavorful! 
You can choose two sauces for each so we mixed it up and tried: Peli peli, Green mamba, Trinchado, and Chimichuri  The peli was a bit spicy, think of a buffalo sauce. The Trinchado was creamy and indulgent, the chimichuri was herby and light and the green mambo was warm yet tasty. Our faves ended up being the Trinchado and Green Mambo. 

Dessert was chocolate lekker tarts and sticky toffee pudding. The tarts filled with Nutella was the definitely favorite as we found the toffee pudding too sweet. 

All in - absolutely loved the food, the service, the ambience... we just can&apos;t wait to go back!"
5,"This is my 2nd time at Peli Peli, and the food was just as delicious as the first. Of course, I had to order the curry crab again - the first time really left an impression with me, so I wanted to savor the flavor again. The bay mussles - delicious. This time, I tried the seafood platter with squash noodles and peppadew slaw (not shown) as sides . The seafood platter includes the bay mussles which is nice especially if you don&apos;t want the entire bay mussle appetizer or if you simply want extra. I like the shrimps from the platter - tender, juicy with a light sweet spicy kick from their peli peli pepper sauce. I thought the slaw paired harmoniously with the seafood platter as the tangy sourness from the mango, cranberries, and lemon cuts down on the creamy fattiness. I guess I was really hungry because I ordered their sticky toffee pudding as dessert, and oh yeah, my sweet tooth loved it. The toffee syrup was a bit too sweet for me, but the cake was soft and moist, paired nicely with cold vanilla ice cream and tangy berries. 

Anyways, don&apos;t take my words for it. Just go and experience the food for yourself"
2,"This was one of my favorite spot, but I&apos;m not sure if I still feel the same way.

Food: 2/5
I can definitely say that I&apos;ve had my expectation really high bec I was very impressed with my previous experience here. But with my current visit, I was def disappointed. 
We ordered;

South African sampler--never arrived bec the waitress forgot to put it in, we were so disappointed.

Estepadas with 10oz ribeye steak with rosaries and lobster Mac &amp;cheese--I got it in medium rare, and that steak still needed a little more time. And the lobster Mac, was so oily and bland. I felt as if the lobster was frozen. I wasn&apos;t please with what I ordered. 

Ribeye 10oz with slap chips &amp; Mac &amp; cheese-- when the manager brought it out, he said that he wasn&apos;t pleased with the slap chips so he brought in another set. Which I understood why--it was overcooked. And again, the steak was not cooked properly. 

Service: 2/5
She was nice, but I was disappointed that we waited 45mins to get our food, no explanation on whether there was a delay or something, cos I would&apos;ve understand that. And the fact that she forgot to put in our appetizer. 

Ambiance: 2/5
With the picture and how it looked before, I knew it was a good spot to have an intimate night. But I was definitely disappointed that it was lacking sanitary touch. The floors were wet and sticky--imagine wearing heels through that, it was like a free ice skating experience. Instead of having an intimate night, I felt like we went to the club with the loud music blaring in the ears that even the server could not hear us. I hope my boyfriend didn&apos;t think that I was yelling at him through that music haha."
3,"First time here for me not the other person I was with. They were so excited to taken me and assured me I would love it. The 3 stars is considering all factors of the experience. Oh, where to start. The server- while  well informed regarding the menu and options he failed at a few things. Although we all had on mask, as he spoke he kept leaning into or over the table, very boisterous ( I could tell you every conversation he has with other tables) he stayed too long and talked too much. It was too much.  Now Is the time to practice &quot;Lass is more&quot;. We both felt the food was over promised but under delivered with flavor. Would recommend Shrimp Mozambique, it as a appetizer. 
Pictures are of the Peli Peli Chicken( tasted as if it was dropped in Louisiana hot sauce) 
Caramelized Brussels sprouts where delicious 
Seared scallops were a bit small, tender but could have used more seasoning."
5,"Peli Peli impresses me each time I go.The food is always so hot, fresh, and delicious. Not to mention the perfect crafted cocktails that are oh so soothing to my soul. Would recommend Peli Peli for a date night, girls night, or even a singles night. Lol Can&apos;t go wrong with PELI PELI :) The Chicken Espetada and the Cape Town Martini are my #1 choices."
5,"Awesome experience and a terrific waiter Jerry. He was  Incredibly knowledgeable with the menu the wine list and he was very attentive and pleasant. FOOD IS AMAZING! If you&apos;re looking for an experience paired with foods that pack flavor, this is the place to go. The atmosphere is inviting, the waiters go over and beyond, the cooks take pride in each dish they prepare and the managers are the icing on the cake."
5,"I&apos;m a Galleria girl and I&apos;ve been coming to this place for many years! I literally cannot get enough of Peli Peli. Not once have they ever dropped the ball with food or customer service. 
Every meal is always so consistent with taste and texture. 
I was very full after this meal and didnt have room for their sticky pudding but I literally cannot wait to go back and grab some!"
5,"Amazing atmosphere, the managers make sure every guest has a great experience, and during the week there&apos;s usually no wait times!"
4,"I&apos;m torn on how to review this place. My buddy said it was awesome so I trusted his judgement and did takeout during Covid times. I love Portuguese chicken so I got the half Peli Peli chicken. Thought it was pretty expensive at $17 but went with it. When I picked it up I saw it is kind of a fancier place, so the pricing makes sense. Food was good, but I felt ripped off as my hometown chicken place charges $20 for a WHOLE chicken with potatoes. I finished my meal from Peli Peli and wanted more. Also wanted more of the hot sauce for the inside of the chicken. Staff was nice enough to make my food right before closing so giving them a solid 4* overall."
5,"Ive only been here once but I think about the food here ALL THE TIME!

I ordered the rib eye espetada which was nicely presented on a hanging skewer. The meat was juicy and tender with just the right amount of salt! The mac and cheese was amazing too. 

Everything my friends ordered, the really enjoyed as well! I have nothing but good things to say about the food here and cannot wait to go back."
4,"First of all the outside seating was comfortable and relaxing.  It was a great spot to people watch while enjoying some tasty gourmet type of South African dishes.

The food is soooo tasty. Everything had it&apos;s own delicious flavor. The beef wasn&apos;t seasoned, but that was a good thing, because you are able to choose a couple of super tasty sauces to accompany your protein choices.  We all ordered different sauces so we could sample multiple ones and they were all soooo good! I enjoyed how some of the dishes were subtly seasoned and others were bold. Yum

Server was great at answering our questions and helping us decide what to order.  

I will definitely go back."
3,"Peli Peli has a limited Menu due to Covid. I visited the Galleria location this evening. I was disappointed with just about all of the dishes I ordered. Below I will rate the service and food on a scale from 1-10 with 10 being 5 star. Here goes:

Service- 8

Appetizer Wings- 4

Main Dish Peli Peli Chicken w/ Yellow rice, green beans -4 ( rice was under cooked and cold,Chicken was bland, Sauce for chicken also bland)

Side Dish Mac &amp;Cheese- 8 

Dessert Toffee Pudding- 6 ( cake was dry)

Maybe the cooks were a little off tonight. I wasn&apos;t impressed. I would not recommend this restaurant to friends. My first impression was not a good one. Please see attached pictures of my dishes and the dishes my friends ordered."
5,"Probably my favorite restaurant that I&apos;ve tried for HRW. The moment we walked in, the aromatic smells just enlivened me. I was so excited to try their HRW menu and by the time that I did, I was NOT disappointed.

I started off with the trinchado with ribeye as my meat choice. There were a couple of bites that were a bit too chewy for my taste, but for the most part, the other pieces were tender. The garlic sauce that it was drenched in added a ton of flavor and it was also a great sauce to dip my garlic bread into, as well. For my main course, I had the ribeye espetada. I ordered it medium rare and the meat was so tender. I enjoyed it very much with the garlic butter dripping down the meat (it was suspended) and the other dipping sauces that I ordered with it, as well. I ordered the mac and cheese and roasted potatoes as sides to come with it and they were equally as good. For dessert, I had the sticky toffee cake. I honestly enjoyed the dessert the most out of the entire meal. Everything was good, but the dessert was my favorite. I would go back just for the dessert.

The manager came by to check in and see how our meal was, and he was such a genuine and kind dude. Enjoyed the ambience, had a really nice, casual vibe going. And the food was delectable. Definitely would recommend this place if you&apos;re looking for some great South African dishes!"
1,"Used to be my favorite spot. I&apos;ve dined here many times. Brought friends here many times. Tonight, I brought friends to celebrate my closing on my new home today and we were turned away because &quot;they are no longer taking walk-ins tonight because we overbooked&quot;. No signs in the door. And I still had to pay $11 for the valet. They didn&apos;t offer us seating in the bar area or any of the empty tables. The employees were dry and unbothered. I&apos;m being disappointed. Last time I will go there."
4,"I really enjoyed this restaurant and their seafood entrees. The outdoor seating is nice, the service competent, and the presentation of the food on point. 

I would certainly return when in Houston again."
5,"Came here on Christmas Day to try something new. Peli peli is a South African restaurant with entrancing decor, and a lively ambiance.Service was phenomenal. Food was unique but not completely foreign or overbearing. Will def return! 


APPS
bobotie: 3.5/5
unique South African&apos;s spin on shepherd&apos;s pie. It has a very savory and tangy taste. It&apos;s nothing mind blowing, but very flavorful.Has a ground beef base with carrot purée, all top with a mango chutney. 

Samosas 3/5
Essentially an egg roll with ground beef and lamb. It was OK.  



ENTREE 
Chicken curry: 5/5. **** MUST GET****
 Curry with chicken + rice. As soon as you take your first bite. You will be mind fucken blown. Do i dare say it&apos;s one of my favorite dishes of all time? 
Just the combination of each component blended perfectly together. Curry was slightly sweet, but still had that kick.  Chicken was so incredibly tender. Rice had a kick and balanced everything out. Red onions were a great palate cleanser  


Espatada: 3.5/5
skewered fillet minion. Since it comes with 3 sauces to dip, the meat itself could need some seasoning if eaten alone. Overall super tender, decent flavor, and beautifully displayed.

OTHER:
- oude fashion: 5/5
Old fashion with a coconut twist. if you are a big whisky drinker, def get this! Whiskey is very smooth and aromatic because of the coconut."
5,"Very good food! Our waiter the day of my Birthday celebration was Kurt D. My birthday dinner was on February 6th and I still remember his name, he did his job right! Definitely left his mark. Food was brought out promptly and was fully cooked, nice food representation as well."
1,"We were excited to try this location since this is where their success story began from. It was a birthday reservation for a total of 12 people so reservations were made days ahead. Elisa, the general manager stated that she would take care of us and would put us in a private room but to our surprise upon arrival, it was just the back of the restaurant away from the main dining area. 

A couple of us showed up on time and we were told that they couldn&apos;t seat us unless we had half of our party arrive. No where on their website where this was a policy but when we asked again from a different employee, we were told we can be seated so clearly, the left hand doesn&apos;t know what the right hand is doing. 

We first ordered our drinks which came reasonably on time however they were watered down. 

When it was time to get our food ordered, this is when everything went downhill. Since it was restaurant week, we ordered our food off of their restaurant weeks menu which was a three course meal that included an appetizer, main entree, and dessert. 

We understand how it can take awhile for food to come out for a large party so we gave them ample time to prepare. Not only did we wait an hour but we witnessed many other patrons that came after us get their food first. This was a total of 2 or 3 tables that came after us but they had their apps and entrees within the hour timeframe. 

We were told by Elisa that due to an order of mussels from our table, they couldn&apos;t make the rest of the apps that were available because it was sold out. This was not told to us until an hour later into service. I&apos;ve worked in the restaurant industry before so when items aren&apos;t available, you would immediately go back and tell the customer that we didn&apos;t have it or we sold out then ask them to order something else. You don&apos;t wait and tell a customer this an hour later. 

Two hours in, they finally had our apps out but was mediocre at best. Scallops were paired with random garlic roasts, bunny chow however was actually tasteful. Instead of having entrees right after, they just kept coming back with more apps that were either extra they&apos;ve made to us. 

At this rate, my patience was wearing thin. My bf went up to ask how long it&apos;ll take because again, we&apos;ve been waiting for a long time now. Was told about 30 minutes. Then 45 minutes later, no food. 

I went up to Elisa for the 2nd time and now was told 5-10 minutes. The food finally came out but at this point, I&apos;ve lost my appetite as well as for the rest of our party. Also our entrees didn&apos;t come out all at the right time and they were made wrong as well. Steaks were ordered medium but came out well done. Food was at room temperature. Some of us just requested boxes at this point and just had them take it to go. This was hour three going into four. 

The main entree I had was their ribeye marnia which came with my &quot;choice of two sides&quot;. I ordered the brussel sprouts and rice. Rice was dry, bland, and has no flavor. This just reminded me of the rice you get from a RICE RONI box you would get from Walmart. Not impressed. The ribeye was dry and well done. Not what I ordered! The only winning thing for this was the brussel sprouts and hah, it&apos;s only a side! 

I chose their chocolate tarts for dessert and OMG, this was embarrassing! Literally just fried dough with chocolate sauce inside and just a scoop of vanilla ice cream with a drizzle of chocolate sauce. 

The cake I bought as a surprise was also smudged. They gave us free shots and champagne but sorry this would not make up for the multiple mistakes you&apos;ve made for the whole night. Our first time experience was just terrible and this will be our LAST time we will ever come to this so called $$$ restaurant. 

Elisa has the audacity to say have a good night to us but there was no apology, no comps for any of the food we ordered. The automatic gratuity was not deserved at all for the waitress. She was nice at first but towards the end, she had an attitude. 

When it came time for our checks, this was another issue. We were told that the Brussel sprouts and lobster Mac and cheese were considered premium level of sides and they would be charged $7 extra. This is where I have a problem. There is no disclaimer on their menu for these sides to be charged the extra $7 and it was never told to us by the waitress. She just listed them off. Had we known, we could have picked other sides. 

We had no energy to fight this as we were all tired and just wanted to get out of there! Never again!!"
