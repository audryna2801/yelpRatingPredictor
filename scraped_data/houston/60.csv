5,"The third Torchy&apos;s run this new year and really happy to see them taking social distancing and masks seriously. 

Got to love that Queso with Barbacoa added to go with the chips. I can almost have that as a meal. 

I&apos;d love them to have a drive through at this location, but this is a pretty good next best thing. 

The downside here is that they really need a bigger parking lot. If some dummy parks their supercab truck in the back half of the parking lot, it&apos;s almost impossible to get by it. 

If you want to get torchy&apos;s tacos inside the loop, this is a good location."
5,The question is one of the best I&apos;ve ever had to be honest. All the tacos are good without a doubt. And they do really well getting the order correct when ordering take out
1,"I almost never leave bad reviews, but this one was definitely earned. 

I sat in Torchy&apos;s for just short of an hour. I watched 6 groups of people--some with well over 4 people-- who had ordered their food after me receive their orders. They brought the food out immediately as I began to leave, but it&apos;d been much too long by then. 

Don&apos;t come here."
5,"After seeing the mix reviews, I didn&apos;t have very high expectations. Even with regular expectations,  this was delicious! 

For my visit, I ordered the Baja shrimp and Brush fire. Both were excellent and complimented their respected salsas really well. Normally, I don&apos;t really like anything breaded in my taco but it was fine by me to have breaded shrimp. The chicken in the Brushfire was seasoned really well.

I ordered a side of the rice and it was not basic indeed. The rice had bits of corn and cilantro which accentuated the flavors of the Mexican rice. 

Adding in a frozen margarita, this definitely satisfied the cravings for a California girl."
5,This location doesn&apos;t have a bar inside compared to the location I visited hear the Heights! Tacos were bomb and quite possibly better than their sister location. Customer service was top notch as well !!
3,"I was recently in Houston and my mouth was watering for Torchys since I originally got some in Austin. I originally planned on ordering on DoorDash but due to covid 19 there was a limited menu which didn&apos;t include my personal favorite taco. So, we decided to brave the outside world and go to Torchys. At first we saw someone taking orders outside with the same limited menu. I was disappointed but I decided to make the best of it. 10 minutes later we had just been standing there while everyone walked past us without even acknowledging our presence....when we realized we could possibly go inside. Normally after being treated that way I would just leave an establishment and never come back but I just really wanted my brushfire tacos. They took the tipsy chick tacos off of the menu which was very disappointing. 

I ordered my brushfire tacos and went to fix my drink. I love their prickly pear drink so I was excited to get some. However, when I pressed for it to come out only water was coming out with a slight pink shade so I had to settle for something else. 

The hillbilly queso and brushfire tacos were great as per usual but the service at this location made me decide not to use this one anymore :("
3,"3.5 Star Rating

Ordered a Party pack of Fajita at 8:30am for confirmed pick up at 11am. 

I entered the restaurant at 10:50am and checked in. They told me to wait and they would bring the food to me when called. I waited until 11:25 (35 minutes total waiting) and it took me having to get the attention of 2 different people to get my food. They went to the back table and grabbed the large bag of food, but I&apos;ve been looking around throughout the time of waiting, I&apos;m not sure how long the food had just been waiting there til someone actually saw it was mine. 

The lack of communication is the biggest factor affecting the star score. The initial customer service was attentive but disappeared after greeting and check in. 

Food was pretty good, first time having it so the peppers were delicious and our staff was overall satisfied with the food. 

I might be back for dine in but at the location closer to my house. Slogan is &quot;Damn Good&quot;, I&apos;d say &quot;Good Enough&quot;

They definitely care about dine in patrons more then catering and to go orders."
3,"I love Torchy&apos;s Tacos! I love their tacos more than air.. haha. But they ALWAYS mess up delivery orders via doordash. This has happened well before Covid times sadly. It&apos;s not DoorDash. The bag is prepped by the team at torchy&apos;s and has been consistently wrong/missing items.  

Please address your expo issues. Add staff if possible to ensure items are checked and handed out accurately. YOU&apos;RE BETTER THAN THIS TORCHY&apos;S... much better."
4,"Texas tacos are really something else. Torchy&apos;s is like the kitchen sink spread of Tex Mex, and despite the at-times odd combinations that come out of their menu, everything is pretty darn good.

I make it a mission to try a new taco every time I&apos;m at Torchy&apos;s, and I&apos;m doing good so far. To date, my favorite has been the Baja shrimp. There&apos;s just something about the combination of tomatillo salsa and crunchy shrimp that makes me feel like I&apos;m back in Southern California, feasting on good seafood tacos! That said, everything else is still pretty good -- the trailer park taco makes me feel a little woozy afterward from how heavy the fried chicken is, and the crossroads is close to a good street taco.

While the breakfast tacos are tasty, I will say that the one thing that bugs me is the lack of seasoning in the egg. A little salt and pepper would go a looong way in enhancing the flavors.

Their queso is fabulous, thanks to the smattering of diablo sauce and the bobbing lump of guacamole in the middle. (Sorry, really appetizing -- I know.) I always have to take a break partway through to cough myself through eating too much diablo sauce, but I&apos;m back at it not long after if I have a margarita in hand.

The parking lot is the transportation equivalent of a dumpster fire, so I prefer to park on one of the small side streets east of Shepherd. There&apos;s usually parking within a five minute walk."
4,Edit: I just had the Green Chile Pork. And I would not be adding this to the &quot;order&quot; list for next time. It was kind of dry.
4,Delicious tacos and margaritas!   The place is not well kept but the food is a solid good!
5,"The service is always great even when the line is long. Make sure to grab a seat cause it can get packed.
My favorite tacos are the brushfire and Baja shrimp you can&apos;t go wrong with that pair. Also, the queso is the bomb it&apos;s so worth it!
The parking situation can get a little tricky so make sure you plan ahead"
1,"Food is solid. Not amazing. At least the chicken waffle was too sweet to my taste. The entire time we were there, the staff didn&apos;t clear any of the table that people finished dinning in. Saw so many people sat down at tables with used cups and napkins still on. Distance is not enforced. Guess the management expects customers clean up after themselves. Will definitely not be dinning in anytime soon. Will only consider to-go orders."
5,"Right down the street from my house so we go often and I have personally never had a single issue at this location. I love the Beef Fajita &amp; Fried Avocado Taco but a MUST is the Green Chile Queso &amp; Chips!! The Queso is unbelievably great 10/10 times. Pour it over your tacos, dip chips or saving it for later it&apos;s all great!"
5,"A friend recommended this place to me while visiting TX and the food here could of not been any better. 
Staff: Very friendly &amp; helpful 
Prices: Cheap
Quality: High
Taste: Awesome

Recommendations: Queso w/Chorizo &amp; Tipsy Chick taco. This particular taco was sooo good, I wish I would if just ordered 3 instead of 1. Oh my God!!! Good food &amp; I need 1 of these in Atlanta, Ga ASAP!!!

I will definitely eat here again!"
1,"Its a Tuesday.

I ordered 3 tacos to go at 6:42PM.
Food handed to me at 7:16PM.

Meanwhile wrote this. 

They prioritize dining in, then online, then take out.

Lol. Not coming back."
1,"We ordered curbside, called twice and twice were told that our food was on the way. After waiting for 21 minutes for our food, we found our food sitting on the floor. We paid a lot of money for us not to eat cold food nor be treated like an animal by having to get our food from the floor."
5,"Great staff who are patient with you and willing to help you find the taco that suits your liking. I&apos;ve come here numerous times, and I&apos;ve only had one bad experience when I called to see if I could still order (it was close to closing time) and the manager on the phone was very rude. Other than that, no complaints and no problems since then!"
2,"This place is all about hype. The Brushfire Taco is good, but not the best taco I ever had or anything. Some of their stuff is ok if u haven&apos;t had it in a long time. I didn&apos;t like The Democrat and The Republican was just decent, but nothing special at all. It&apos;s basically a hotdog in a tortilla. Texas has too many good Mexican places to bother with these extremely Americanized tacos."
4,"Sweet! Look at this taco place that&apos;s got it together! I have to go back and get some merch. Cool branding, a nice consistency in style from the menu to the walls. First time a server (or anybody) said I looked like Johnny Depp. I&apos;ll take it as a compliment. Capn&apos; Jack says I&apos;ll be back."
