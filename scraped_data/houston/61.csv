5,"I frequent this coffee shop very often and I only get one drink. If you&apos;re in need of sunshine in a cup, try the milk and honey with oat milk HOT! 

It&apos;s such a perfect blend of coffee because it&apos;s not too sweet. The honey gives it a nice ease of sweetness and it&apos;s a great compliment to start your day. 

I live roughly 30-35 minutes from this coffee shop, but that drink alone is worth the commute. I highly recommend it and the staff is always friendly, professional, and efficient. 


The shop also does a great job of practicing safety as everyone wears a mask and they wipe off the card machine with disinfectant after every customer uses it. 

I&apos;ve sent several coffee and non coffee drinkers their way, and after trying the milk and honey, they always go back for more."
5,"I sort of went on a coffee binge last week and decided to try a bunch of different local coffee shops in the Heights. I&apos;ve been to Boomtown several times before but I never thought that my drink was stupendous. That all changed this past week! I kid you not, I had the honey cinnamon iced latte, for $4.87 it was on the cheaper side for a specialty drink compared to the other places I tried in the area- and it was great! I now see what the hype is about!! On top of that they are cashless- so they are really trying to take a bunch of precautions in order to minimize risk from Covid-19! I simply cannot wait to stop by Boomtown and try another drink! 

Above all else, the barista was really patient and helped me pick out my drink! I can&apos;t wait to come back to Boomtown! Highly recommend, go try this place out!"
5,Great Coffee! Good breakfast items as well. The line gets long and its stupidly placed but the coffee is worth it if its like a 10 minute wait. A tiny patio that can be nice.
5,"This place has utterly amazing espresso drinks.

I was blown away by how good the espresso drink tasted. The reviews suggested the drinks would be good, but they were even better than I expected.

The pastry I tried was OK. It seemed a bit stale, but I&apos;m still giving a 5-star review because the drink was outstanding."
3,"Sadly I think we are done with Boomtown, for the time being anyways. The service has never been what you would call speedy, but it wasn&apos;t a problem because the ambience was great and it was a fun place to visit. The. COVID hit and they, understandably, had to make some changes. 

But eventually you start to wonder why you&apos;re spending $5 on a coffee that takes 10-20 minutes to come out (after standing in line for at least 10 minutes of not much much longer). 

Today was the final straw though as the staff repeatedly harangued guests to keep &quot;check the floor for the stickers&quot; to stay 6 feet apart, leave the store if they&apos;d been served (even if others in the party hadn&apos;t), move a foot and a half to give other guests space (never mind we had been standing there first... for 10 minutes). 

All while the staff of 6+ were on top of each other behind the counter. And look, I get it that they don&apos;t have a choice but to be cramped, but the impression was that we were the plague monsters and somehow they were clean? I don&apos;t know. Oh, and touching the lids with bare hands. I&apos;m sure the wash them periodically (not that we saw but giving the benefit of the doubt), but how many times did they scratch their face or adjust their masks in between. A non-zero number I would wager. 

It was also glaringly obvious that they have no real system for the order in which orders are handled as several people who were in line behind us were served well ahead of us. Which again, normally wouldn&apos;t be a problem if not for the rest of it. 

It was just ... kind of insufferable. And sadly the attitude they give off makes me think they will be reading this and saying &quot;good, stay away if you don&apos;t want to conform&quot; which makes me sad because they&apos;ve been our favorite coffee shop for years. 

I&apos;m sure that to some reading this I sound like a Karen, but I think there&apos;s a balance to be struck between keeping people safe and making people feel like they are actually welcomed at your shop.  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
5,"One of the most wonderful meet up spots that I&apos;ve ever been to. From the assorted pastry options to the ambiance, it&apos;s a must visit! 

The customer service is phenomenal and would highly recommend! I&apos;ll be back for sure."
5,"Jesus Christ if I could give them 10/5 stars I would!
Amazing service, quickness, and quality!!!

* My friends and I couldn&apos;t figure out what we wanted and the cashier helped us decide based off what we were feeling like. Super friendly and funny, would love to come back again just based off my interaction with them. (And I was at the beginning of rush hour.)
* Talk about fast service! Within less than a minute of ordering my drink, my drink was out and ready. You&apos;d think it may taste a bit off since it was prepared so quick, but no, the man knows his stuff. One of the best chai lattes I&apos;ve ever had! 

Can&apos;t wait to come back again"
5,Super cute coffee shop. They have a wide range of craft lattes and classic espresso drinks. The kitchen closes at 3!
5,"If you need some coffee and you happen to be on 19th Street, then come support this business. They have a variety of coffee drinks to serve the frequent coffee go-er. Not a fan of coffee? They have some other drinks of the menu to satisfy your needs. This place was easy to order from, and staff is friendly. Also, if you want adjustments done to your drink, no problem, they will happily take your order and prepare it to your liking. They also send coffee beans and other coffee related items. Get your coffee here and take a stroll on 19th!"
5,I love boomtown - iced sea turtle all day every day. Their baristas are super knowledgable and they sell all kinds of coffee equipment too! Loyal customer for sure.
5,Good coffee for sure ! Interesting energy good vibes! Reminded me of ATX !! Real good tasting ! Respect to my friend who told me about it !
4,"Before I was into coffee like I am now I stopped in and ordered the affogato (ice cream topped with a shot of espresso). I had never had one before and thought it sounded good. It was tasty; a good sweet treat. Since then, I have visited a few more times and ordered various cold coffees and have not been disappointed. Their coffee has a nice smooth flavor while maintaining the flavor of coffee. I like that their menu has some classic coffees as well as some signature coffees you can only find at Boomtown. 

Although I know a good cup of coffee may be pricey, I wish Boomtown&apos;s prices were a little bit lower. Also, parking is very difficult to come by along 19th, so be prepared to circle around a few times. All in all, I would consider Boomtown when I want to treat myself to a pricier, but good quality cup of coffee."
5,"Looks hole-in-the-wall from the outside, and always full of people on the inside.

This team both takes themselves seriously, and lightheartedly - the house specials can be complex, while one of the merch pieces on display is a onesie that says something like &quot;Coffee sucks...&quot;  :-)

The brew itself - always good, never bitter (in three visits), they blend the drinks well, and alternative milks available.  Had the Mayan Mocha with almond milk - done smoothly and great balance of coffee vs all the sweet stuff.  Thank you barista!

The food itself - simple, clean, well prepared.  Never had a juevos rancheros served like that, but it worked, and was tasty!  (go try one, no pic for you!).  Can&apos;t say I&apos;m down with the alfafa sprouts on the avocado toast, but hey - my wife was happy.

The service itself - the style of the team is laid back, kind, and efficient - just seem like good people brought together, and they enjoy what they do.  Don&apos;t know if it&apos;s the same at the other Boomtown spots, but super happy to find this close to home."
5,I&apos;m so happy I&apos;ve found this spot close to my apartment! The whole bean selection is amazing and I love the bulk buyer jars they sell. The milk and honey latte is a treat and so are all of their pastries. Haven&apos;t tried a single thing on the menu that I don&apos;t like and the baristas are super friendly.
2,"Can&apos;t decide which is worse -- Starbucks or Boomtown.
Maybe I ordered the wrong drink here, but I still can&apos;t believe there are so many good reviews for this place. 
We ordered two of their specialty iced lattes -- the Sea Turtle and a Salted caramel latte. Both tasted so watered down and i don&apos;t know if they even added any sugar. I am not one for sweet drinks or unsweetened drinks but I like a good latte in between.
Lost me but I&apos;m sure they could care less. They have plenty of supporters."
5,"I&apos;ve been going to Boomtown Heights location since (I&apos;m guessing) 2014 almost daily! Daily if possible for sure.

Boomtown has always been close to my heart and to me one of the best coffee shops in Houston! You&apos;ll never find a better latte or americano ! 

The giant cookies are absolutely delicious as well as their macaron selection! 5 Stars Forever!"
4,"Lot of people working on laptops, busy.
Quick service, clean facilities.
I especially appreciate the menu board, explains all the variations of espresso."
5,"Here for the first time. Really cute coffee shop that offers a variety of hot and cold beverages. There&apos;s also a large selection of teas too. They have a menu for a selection of lattes and specific coffee beans they currently are serving. I ordered an iced milk and honey latte. It came out extremely fast. You can definitely taste the honey and there is also a hint of cinnamon. 

The atmosphere is really nice. Lots of people having conversations and some individuals working on their laptops. Great spot to hit that caffeine pick me up."
3,"I have been dying to check this place out and study here. Sadly, I found it to be overhyped, but maybe it was because I didn&apos;t try that one drink that everyone keeps raving about. 

Firstly, my salted caramel latte tasted no different from a regular caramel latte. Actually, I couldn&apos;t even taste any caramel, so I had to add agave as a sweetener. This was kind of disappointing to me, but I do have to admit that the coffee itself was very strong and had a nice flavor. The latte art was pretty, which is a nice touch. 

Secondly, there were many baristas working, yet it took forever for me to order. I was just awkwardly standing in line while one barista was making someone else&apos;s coffee and the remaining were in the back. I usually don&apos;t mind waiting if everyone is busy, but it seemed like the other four workers were just chillin. 

Anyways, I could totally see this being a great to come hang out. As far as a place to get work done, it was just too noisy. However, there were a lot of seating and many outlets, so I&apos;ll give them that. Overall, my first experience was just average. I might come back one day to try some off the menu stuff, so I&apos;ll keep y&apos;all updated."
5,"The only thing I don&apos;t love love about Boomtown is that it is VERY difficult to come on a weekend and get a seat inside or outside the cafe. 

That being said, I still come here for a coffee to go when I pass by on a weekend because the coffee is OUT OF THIS WORLD! 

Now I love coffee. I love STRONG coffee. And Boomtown delivers a smooth strong espresso that doesn&apos;t make you pucker your face from being bitter. I usually only get vanilla lattes to balance the bitterness when I know the coffee isn&apos;t the best but when I come to Boomtown I get no sweetener/flavoring because the coffee itself is so smooth and full bodied that the flavor of the coffee itself is delicious. 

Boomtown offers several kinds of nondairy milk which is awesome (even oat milk!!) and they have a big coffee menu. The menu above the register is helpful as it tells you exactly the milk-to-coffee/espresso ratio in each order and the staff is always great when I have been there. 

(pro tip: if you have a need for excessive amounts of caffeine try their johnny cash- espresso and black coffee, you won&apos;t be disappointed)"
