5,"Simple and Sweet

Take all the good things about an Los Angeles coffee shop and take out the expensive price tag and this is what you get! Agora has a wide selection of pastries and coffee so I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll find something for you. I got the cold brew and my friend got the iced latte. The size of the drink was massive and both tasted great! They have it laid out nicely where people who choose to sit in are 6 feet apart but unfortunately there&apos;s less seats available. The same thing applied to dining inside. Honestly sitting outside isn&apos;t so bad since there are plenty of trees to cover the sun. 

The staff were pretty chill and welcoming. The inside is clean and smells like coffee. There is a parking lot available or you can just park in the neighborhood. Next time I need a caffeine fix, I&apos;ll definitely swing by!"
5,SÃºper Greek lol! I went on a date here earlier this week and I loved the relaxed atmosphere. I was able to find a table for two with two separate plugs to charge our devices. Seemed as if not as many people were out and about so the restaurant was quite clean and empty. 20 minutes into my stay we were notified that they would be closing the location due to the COVID-19. I am extremely happy I was able to try a nice cup of cocoa in a super relaxing environment.
5,New fav coffee place! This is the best coffee I&apos;ve had since leaving London and I love the way the place looks. Huge interior for social distancing Although tables are small if trying to use to work on a laptop. Great place!

It was like being transported to Ancient Greece. So authentic so charming. I envy locals!"
3,"I&apos;ve been coming to this establishment for years and have never had a problem. Until yesterday, first the owner (I&apos;m assuming it was the owner) was upstairs and watched as I sat down for about 15 minutes no one came to clean the table off. After a while I had asked him politely and he had an attitude and someone came after a while had past. By that time, I had already removed the coffee cup off my table. Then the owner came to my table and demanded that I buy something because I was taking up a seat for other customers. Mind you, it wasn&apos;t busy at all... and he had only said this to me and another girl who looked like me. Who also hadn&apos;t been there for that long, I was also waiting on my client to come before ordering anything. I couldn&apos;t wait for you to clean my table off or my client? Why did you only approach me? Why else would I come to a coffee shop? So, he continued to come by the area to check to see if I had ordered anything. Even though there were other patrons who had also came in and hadn&apos;t ordered as well. He never went to them or approached them... just very interesting. Very aggressive in matter for no reason in his first interaction with me as well. 

Not to mention my client ended up not even liking her bland iced coffee. Go figure. 

I give them three stars because at least the wine was alright for $6.

So because I mentioned safety with the homeless situation that is in the area and the Wi-Fi being bad he has decided to respond this way instead of fixing the real situation at hand not what&apos;s outside but your actual establishment. 

UPDATE: Now the owner instead of handling the situation has privately decided to DM to pick a fight. And he&apos;s right!! There are plenty of other establishments that have opened! With WAY better customer service. Brass Tracks, Retrospect,  Tout, Common Bonds down the street... explore!"
5,"I really feel the need to update my review of Agora. IF you have ever driven by Agora going east or west on Westheimer, you&apos;ve for sure gotten stuck behind some fool trying to make a turn on that particular corner.

Agora and Common Bond are neighbors, it&apos;s a beautiful site to see.

Agora has always been this place that I would keep to myself. I secretly would call it my sanctum sanctorum. I would come here when I didn&apos;t want to be found. I&apos;d sit in a dark corner (to which there are plenty) with a hoodie, headphones and drink can after can of beer. No body messed with me and I felt completely alone.

This wouldn&apos;t be a first time date place, it&apos;s more like a &quot;hey I&apos;m in college and I study here.&quot;, kinda place but to come here is to be close to Common Bond so come here early morning so you don&apos;t get swallowed up by the college kids."
5,"I&apos;m sad we had aBush in power, it would have been a much better country with aGore.

This is a great coffee shop in the heart of Montrose which is open super super late and is always absolutely packed with people from wall to wall on the downstairs and upstairs levels. It&apos;s probably the best and most ambitious coffee shop in Houston on many levels - literally and figuratively.

It was the site of one of my first dates with Barbie, so it will always be special for that reason. I&apos;m sure I&apos;ll come here many times in future too."
5,My favorite coffee shop. The ambiance and the vibes are hands down the best. This building looks like a renovated home and has all the feels of it. There is seating upstairs and downstairs and of course outside. Parking is a little tricky but if you can&apos;t find a spot in their parking lot there is street parking. The coffee is A1 and never a long wait. Great place for good conversation or even game night.
5,I love coming here for late night drinks :) friendly baristas who push out drinks like nothing !! Get an iced chai latte
5,"Happy to say I was finally able to check this place out. Several of my friends had told me that this place wasn&apos;t anything special, so I had never made it a top priority to come. I shouldn&apos;t have listened - I loved my experience here. The interior is so cozy and inviting; its one of those places you want to spend an afternoon in. Their menu is huge and they don&apos;t stop at coffee - they sell pastries and beer, too. My friend double-fisted with a Nitro Cold Brew and Beer, and he was feeling pretty jazzed about it. I ordered a seasonal Vanilla Spice Latte, which came with a small shortbread cookie - delicious! They have a really cool upstairs seating section that looks over the downstairs area and the bustling Montrose streets. I am excited to go back and try a different coffee concoction and one of their delectable pastry offerings. 

 Parking is available in a small lot (maybe 8 spaces total), so you will most likely need to street park. Don&apos;t let that deter you and check this place out!"
4,Got their Fresno Cappuccino and it wast too bad. The coffee tasted a little overdone but still kept me awake.
5,"Came here everyday while I was in town. The lattes and Greek coffee were my go to! You also can&apos;t go wrong with an almond croissant. 

I&apos;m definitely coming back when I visit Houston again!"
5,"Very frothy, hot, and sweet it&apos;s amazing cold too.
Comes with a cute little cookie when asked hot and brown sugar cube."
4,"This is one of my go-to coffee shops as a place to hang. I would not recommend it as a place to study or do serious work. 

Pros
- the best thing about this place is the ambience. I&apos;ve been here multiple times with friends during the day and night, great for conversations with friends
- the drinks and pastries are tasty (I&apos;m obsessed with their pumpkin whoopie pie)
- coffee/wine/lounge combo

Cons
- a bit on the pricy side (at my last visit, I got two small pastries, a small can of beer, and hot tea for $20) 
- super small parking area
- wifi is slow and the place can get super crowded"
4,"I&apos;ve been coming to this coffee shop for about 6 years. I like coming because of the ambience. I&apos;ve always like the fact they offer a wide variety of drinks like coffee, kombucha, beer, wine etc. They only cons I have about this place is I&apos;ve noticed over time it gets extremely crowded at night, and the wifi is terrible. But if you&apos;re there for a great ambience then this is your place."
4,"Really loved the vibes in this place! This was the perfect place for me to catch up with my friends. The moody ambience, homey wood structures and quirky seating arrangements made way for good conversation.

They have plenty of drinks/snacks/fresh pastries but it is pricier ($4+ for a can of coconut water). The WiFi when I went was Agora2001 but fair warning it was SOO slow that I got no work done (I did sit by the window if that made any difference).

The lighting is a bit dim so if you&apos;re doing some paper and pen studying it might not be so great at night. The decor here is fab tho! Restrooms are cute."
4,"Great place to set up for a few hours with your laptop to catch up on work or catch up with a friend! It&apos;s very charming, as well. I love the atmosphere as it is definitely not like a commercialized coffee shop. There&apos;s a good selection of baked goods and snacks along with some coffee and a selection of beverages. 

The staff seems friendly and I would absolutely recommend this place!"
4,"I went to Agora today. I haven&apos;t been in a while due to moving further away. As I remember the service was still exceptional. They made me a chai latte and it was nice not to have to wait too long. They served it with a little sugar block and a shortbread cookie. 

The ambience is very trendy and a lot of people come in to catch up with friends, study, and have meetings. They have an upstairs and downstairs space. They also have outdoor patio seating. 

The only reason why this gets a 4 star instead of a 5 star is the limited parking. They really need a larger parking lot because you will likely have to circle around for parking."
5,"If you want the whole &quot;hipster coffeehouse vibe&quot;, this is definitely your place to go. Staff is friendly and this place is nice to meet up with friends to catch up or a casual daytime date. Overall a cool and chill vibe with great drinks."
5,"I am a huge fan of Agora! I&apos;ve been coming to this cute cafe since I was a little girl and everything they have is great!! Their coffee is freshly roasted and the cookies that they have displayed don&apos;t just look delicious-they are!!! 

This is a great place in the heart of the Montrose area and it&apos;s a cute spot if you need to do some work or are just catching a quick bite to eat/drink!!

I would highly recommend Agora and can&apos;t wit to come back soon!"
