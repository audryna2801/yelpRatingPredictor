5,"During COVID, many restaurants have had to up their take-out game and Aka Sushi is boasting their A-game. I was blown away by how delicate and colorful their maki rolls are. They are presented so nicely that even while enjoying them at home, you can taste a heightened sense of finesse. I also love that each roll comes with a specialized dipping sauce which adds yet another layer of refinement to the dining experience. The maki menu is quite extensive, and I&apos;m excited to discover more of the beautiful creations Aka has to offer."
4,"We love this place!! We got takeout for the second time, and it was super easy and quick!! We love the Haystack roll -- it&apos;s the BEST. The Ceviche Maki was a bit of a mouthful, but ultimately the flavors complimented each other well. The French Kiss is always one of our favorites but weirdly fishy this time... - A&amp;J"
5,I was there for lunch and ordered a shrimp teriyaki dish   One gets a generous portion of delicious miso soup and salad with a ginger or miso dressing  The main dish comes with tempura vegetables and steamed rice.  The portions are generous and the flavors are on point.  The green tea comes in a beautiful Japanese ceramic cup.  I sat at the bar where places are separated by plexi glass.  I&apos;ll ask for no mushrooms on my shrimp dish next time as I don&apos;t like them.
5,"Went here last night with a friend and we both loved it. The restaurant was pretty busy, and they had tables blocked off for distancing so we ended up sitting at the sushi bar.

We got 4 different rolls (Houston, spicy salmon, crunchy, rock &amp; roll), stuffed mushrooms, tako sonomuno, and a pink lychee -- all on the happy hour menu and all great.
Only complaint was with the tako sonomuno- it was only four small pieces of octopus and 90% cucumbers, but still really tasty.
If you like mushrooms- 1000% try SOO GOOD 

The restaurant was cute, the staff was nice, food tasty, and great happy hour prices. We are already talking about when we&apos;re coming back."
5,"The nigiris are amazing. I got these off the secret menu. Truffle Tuna and Chili Salmon. Also Crater roll. All delicious.

Service was good. Our waitress was very nice."
5,"AKA is an amazing spot for sushi in Houston. I always crave it because the quality and freshness is better than every place I&apos;ve tried. 
Appetizer - 
Firecracker shrimp appetizer: 3/10 pretty bland, nothing spectacular 
Happy Hour Rolls -
Crazy roll: 5/10 you could pass on this 
Tiger eye (not pictured): 7/10 also a roll I wouldn&apos;t go out of my way for again
*Spicy crunchy tuna/spicy tuna: 10/10 I usually don&apos;t even like tuna rolls but this one changed my opinion, must try
*Shrimp crunchy: 10/10 a must order when I visit, I&apos;ve started ordering 2 of them because one isn&apos;t enough
Spicy crunchy salmon: 9/10 also so yummy
*Houston roll: 10/10 I was hesitant about trying this one but wow it&apos;s a new must have
Kamikaze: 9/10 just your typical deep fried roll full of sauce and flavor, very good

*Senior Jaime: 10/10 
Louisiana (not pictured): 9/10 we liked senior Jaime more but still great"
3,"My friends and I came here around dinner time on Saturday. Took a while for a table of 4. It was busy and they did leave some room for social distancing. We ordered a bunch!!
App: love the spicy adamame!! Not too spicy, but still got the kick in it. I don&apos;t really love the octopus balls. It was meh for me. Needs more seasoning there.

The rolls: I&apos;m not really impressed with sushi rolls here. Everything tasted okay. It&apos;s not woowwww iykyk

Sashimi/nigiri: we ordered eel and chopped scallops. Not a fan of chopped scallops. I love the eel tho! Super yummy, rich, love the sauce! We also ordered chopped scallops with seared tuna and caviar but they were okay. Not as good as I expected.

Omakase: very fresh. I love salmon sashimi here. One of the best I&apos;ve had in town. The other sashimi tasted great! Best dish to finish with!

Service was good. Our server recommended the salmon and he knows what&apos;s he doing! Did a good job, helpful and friendly."
4,"Tried @akasushihouse for the first time and it blew my mind! We came a little early so we ordered some small bites before the reverse happy hour started. We got a bottle of apple sake which was delicious! Honestly I found everything to be 4/4.5 out of 5 and up!! Everything was delicious and fresh! We ate dish after dish as they came out! My favorite was the grilled squid, beef yakitori, shrimp tempura, fried soft shell crab, chopped scallop sushi, the baked mussels are a must, and the dragon roll! Sounds like basically everything I ate LOL. Everything was great though! Service was good and tables were spaced out. Can&apos;t wait to go back! Don&apos;t forget to follow for more food!"
5,We came here for their reverse happy hour &amp; it was so good! I got the Houston roll which is one of my favorite rolls of all time now and the spicy tuna. The spicy tuna was actually pretty spicy which I enjoyed! We also got sake &amp; beer because they were also on the reverse happy hour. We got there at 9pm and there was a wait of about 30 minutes on a Thursday night so just be sure to get there a little earlier.
4,"Really like this sushi place. They have great lunch specials. I&apos;ve never had to wait long to eat here.

I usually get a chirashi bowl. All their rolls are awesome as well.

I got the shrimp tempura and the shrimp was cold on the inside- I would pass on this next time."
5,"My go to sushi spot! I always order:
French kiss roll
Chopped scalp nigiri not spicy
Rock and roll hand roll
Spider hand roll
Hamachi Thai chili
Mango crab hoppers 
Unagi nigiri"
1,"Sushi is decent but for the wait (estimated 15-30 minutes originally over the phone for a simple takeout order on a Tuesday evening but instead took 1.5hr+ with absolutely awful communication), not worth it at all. 

Inside the restaurant was a madhouse with no precautions during COVID and I felt very unsafe waiting for the takeout as I resorted to waiting outside / inside of my car instead. People were seated next to each other at the counter and the cashier front desk area had no proper spacing for responsible COVID measurements to take place.

Can&apos;t recommend even for the quality/price of the sushi because it&apos;s not worth putting my family at risk and can only imagine the lack of health precautions that are going behind closed doors/walls if their client facing areas are like this."
5,Social distancing and covid friendly. All day Sunday a great happy hour! Wine is 4.75! There&apos;s a plenty of vegetarian sushi and other options! I recommend the eggplant tempura it&apos;s delish!
5,"Aka has really become one of my favorite sushi places in Houston. I always feel like I get the most bang for my buck here. Everything is fresh and tasty. 

Things to get: 
Salmon sampler (4/5)- very thick pieces of salmon!!
Truffle tuna (5/5)- this is definitely one of the pricier nigiri options that they have but it&apos;s SO worth it since I love truffle and it just melts in your mouth. 
Senior Jaime (5/5)- I literally cannot stress this enough, but if you come here this is something that you must get. The combination of flavors in this roll is genius. It&apos;s also one of those rolls where every bite is still equally delicious as the one before it. 
Flamin&apos; (4/5)- there&apos;s insane flavors in this one too. Although, sometimes the mayo can be a bit too much. 
Happy hour sushi (3.5/5)- honestly their happy hour rolls are pretty standard, but I have to admit that sometimes I do still love the simple rolls. Spicy salmon, Houston, and shrimp crunchy are all really great when it comes to serving a purpose of getting you extraaa full. 

Overall, I am obsessed with this sushi joint. The vibes are pretty casual. Service is quick and friendly. It really exceeds my expectations when considering quality and pricing. I have been here probably over twenty times and every time is just as great. I cannot wait until they reopen their dining room as it will be the first place I go to!"
1,"Too long of a wait on a Saturday night. Came in with our 3 year old at 5:30pm on a Saturday and were told 20-30 min. 45 min later and we are walking out. No apologies, no communication and no where to sit down (with our 3 year old) while we wait.
Don&apos;t bother coming here on a weekend."
5,"One of the best Happy Hour &amp; Lunch Menus in all of Houston Happy Hour is Monday-Friday from 3-7, with a Reverse Happy Hour from 9-close. Plus ALL DAY Saturday &amp; Sunday!! And they do their Lunch Menu 7 days a week. Great food &amp; amazing prices!Aka is the best sushi..actually...best food in town. High quality and tons of options, all executed perfectly. The happy hour menu is awesome. I get so many plates I couldn&apos;t tell you where to start! Just order away n don&apos;t forget the cheesecake.   Also we Got the shrimp nigiri and the Cajun roll. Both were good. Service was good too and the waiter was nice.  We come here allot of the  prices for the reverse happy hour were great, and the food itself was as well. Service was top notch! Very welcoming environment. 

Definitely going to come back.Fine location for quality Sushi. Service is always super even when they have a full house. This place has an awesome feel to By far some of the best sushi I&apos;ve had in Houston. Small place, great environment. Our server was super quick, everything came out quickly and was just awesome. I will be coming back. Also it&apos;s open till late with which makes it so much better"
5,"I used to come here all of the time and decided to stop by tonight before I went to work and was very happy to see the great customer service and fresh food survived the COVID economic attack . I was greater upon arrival
My food was correct and ready to go the young woman at the front desk was polite and efficient. I can&apos;t wait to come back again soon ."
5,"everytime I come to Htown,  I gotta stop by and have the surf n turf rolls. and tempura ice cream, they&apos;re the best!!!"
5,"Went during happy hour, I loved the curry and houston roll. Will definitely come back again."
4,"Local restaurants need some love more than ever and I&apos;m trapped inside with nothing to do so it&apos;s officially time to tackle my heap of reviews I&apos;ve been putting off to help my favorite businesses stay in business! Quarantine review #1: Aka Sushi House. Just because you&apos;re locked-in, doesn&apos;t mean you can&apos;t have sushi!

I&apos;ve only eaten at Aka twice, but after the first visit I knew it would be one of my go-to spots for sushi in the area. Aka had everything I was looking for: tasty appetizers, a good variety of rolls on the menu, good pricing (particularly during happy hour where many rolls are discounted), and most importantly delicious sushi! Between my two visits my favorite items so far are the basil chicken wings, Flaming roll, Houston roll, Senor Jaime roll, and Sexy roll.

Social distancing specifics: it&apos;s open for take-out/delivery and the sushi is just as good from the comfort of your couch! I know it&apos;s on Favor and Postmates for delivery, but if you want them to get 100% of what you pay, contact them directly for take-out (those services take a percentage from businesses)."
