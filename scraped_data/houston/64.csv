5,"Stopped in today for a Sunday afternoon scoop and was very happy we did! This cute little shop had a friendly staff member explain the color coded flavors which indicated sorbets (dairy free) and gelato. They had a really great range of creative flavors. Unfortunately because of COVID no samples right now, but I was so happy with my scoop I will be coming back to try the other flavors! I got Pomegranate Rose, Blood Orange, and Texas Chocolate sheetcake sorbets. The chocolate was so rich you wouldn&apos;t even know it was dairy free. The 3 Amigos gelato tasted like a Reese&apos;s peanut butter cup and the Cookie Butter was a sweet, cinnamony flavor. They rotate their flavors through the seasons so you will never get tired of their new, delicious flavors! Definitely will be back :)"
5,"This was my first time visiting Sweet Cup. I arrived a few minutes after they opened. The parking is minimal, but I was able to park right in front. The parking lot does need some attention. It has pot holes so watch out for your tires. When you enter the shop it is super adorable and felt sweet and cozy. It reminded me of the old malt/soda shops. They did not have chairs inside due to the pandemic, but there is some limited outside seating. The staff member who helped me was named Audra. She was very attentive and patient as this was my first time at the shop and having gelato. She explained everything about the store, history, and how they make the gelato which was extremely helpful. I ordered a small 4oz which came with 3 flavors. For my 3 flavors I got Chocolate Amaretto which taste like chocolate &amp; cheery flavor mixed, Stracciatella which was sweet cream &amp; chocolate flavor, and Bacio which had the flavors of chocolate &amp; hazelnut. Because they were all in 1 cup it kind of made it difficult to experience the flavors on their own. However, I did make the attempt and individually they were all like silk. Smooth and delicate flavors blended perfectly. You didn&apos;t want the silky creamy taste to end. I feel like gelato should now be my new frozen sweet treat. You should definitely visit Sweet Cup."
5,"This is one of my favorite dessert spots in the area. One of my favorite parts about SweetCup are that they have a rotation of flavors, so whenever I go (I&apos;ve been maybe 5 or 6 times at this point), there&apos;s always at least one new flavor to try! I generally get the creamier/dairy-based flavors, but the sorbet options are really good as well. My all-time favorite is the dirty coconut!!

Another thing I love about this place is that the small cup allows you to get 3 scoops, which is perfect if you like to try multiple flavors in one trip!! (Most places usually only let you do 1-2 flavors for a small.) I feel like the fact that you can get 3 flavors justifies the price, which comes out to be a little over $5 at the register.

Side note: For the longest time, there was this one cashier that literally moved as slow as that sloth in zootopia, like no hate he wasn&apos;t problematic but he just moved sooo slowly, like almost slow-motion lmfao. But the most recent time I went (during the pandemic), there was a different guy, who was really friendly and helped with choosing flavors (we weren&apos;t allowed to taste-test bc of COVID)."
5,"I stopped in for my #YelpEliteTreat and decided to go all in with 3 flavors.  I picked Caramel Butter Swirl, Birthday Cake (contains gluten), and Goat Cheese (Cheese Cake).  I found out that this particular store has been here NINE YEARS! They just celebrated their birthday in February!

The gelato was creamy and fresh tasting, also came with a waffle cone chip. I paired my gelato with a cappucino that was made and prepared fresh in front of me.  

Apparently this location has had some trouble with people trying to break in.  They had several safety measures in place to thwart those trying to steal a sweet treat - good for them!  

Overall everything was great and if you&apos;re in the area and have a craving for sweets, but not as much fat as ice cream - swing on by! They&apos;re friendly, nice and they serve delicious gelato!"
4,"Even though this place is blocks from my place, I hadn&apos;t stumbled upon it until today. It is a small place in a shopping strip so easy to miss.

First thing I liked, as soon as I walked in I was attended and asked if this was my first time there. Which I highly appreciate going somewhere new can be intimidating, not knowing how everything works. He explained how the different size cups work, the flavor options and the diary/nondairy labeling. Only hard things was deciding what flavors to try.

I chose three flavors: Pomegranate, Tres Leches, and Raspberry-Rita. Highly recommend the Pomegranate. The Tres Leches was good, but very sweet. The Raspberry was okay but no where near as good as the other two. I got a small cup, which lets you have three options, and it was the right side to cure a sweet tooth. 

Only negative aspect would be the size of the place, if you go during busy time you may not have seating available. They have a couple tables outside to eat there. Transporting could be tricky, my pomegranate was melting pretty quick in my car, had to eat it quickly."
5,"What a treat! Who knew one tinsy little cup could pack so much flavor! I ordered a small which includes up to 3 flavors.  Brace yourself there are over 18 to chose from. After much deliberation, I decided on the tiramisu, blood orange sorbet and the goat cheese.  I&apos;m not sure I&apos;m confident in choosing a favorite.  They were all very yummy! But wait, since you&apos;re already indulging in a sweet treat, don&apos;t pass up the cobbler cookies! These soft and chewy brown butter cookies come with a pool of fresh fruit preserves in the center.  I ordered one of the raspberry cobbler cookies, put a big smile on my face! Plan on picking up more for friends this weekend! 

Commendable service at this Montrose locations. I didn&apos;t catch her name but she was very friendly, knew her flavors well and seemed like she really enjoyed working here. :)"
5,"Three words: Goat Cheese Gelato! I walked into SweetCup and did not expect to be blown away by their amazing flavors. A small scoop is the perfect amount to satisfy any sweet tooth craving. The three flavors I chose were Goat Cheese, Grapefruit Lavender, and Rose milk. Each flavor was fantastic and full of flavor. If you go to SweetCup I recommend choosing one of their unique flavors, I can not wait to get my hands on some more goat cheese gelato. I think next time I might get a pint to go."
4,"This was my first time here. The shop is kind of small so it&apos;s not the type of place you can really sit down an enjoy your treat but it&apos;s functional. Collin served me today and he was polite and asked if it was my first time in. He let me know that the treats were color coded by non dairy and dairy. He also was informative on the different flavors and when I picked a particular flavor he told me what was in it (Cardamom) to make sure I was okay with that. He provided great customer service! On to the flavors. The 3 that I selected were pistachio, Malai Kulfi, and I want to say Caramel butter cookie?! The flavors were delicious and sweet. If I had to choose 1 out of the 3 that caramel joint was bomb, you could really taste the buttery flavor. Really all 3 were great. They were pretty sweet so a tiny cup is all I would need. I am definitely interested to try other flavors like the goat cheese and the Stracciatella bc it sounds fancy lol. Try it out it&apos;s a go for me"
5,"Im always super thrilled with SweetCup. I&apos;ve only been to the Montrose location twice now. I usually go to the Ella location as it&apos;s much closer. I&apos;ve had friendly service at both locations, but Montrose tends to get exclusive flavors. The vanilla bean tres leches and horchata flavors are my favorite, especially together. 
They have a great selection of both unique and classic flavors. They sell some pre packaged ice creams as well."
4,"This is a hard place to find at night because the strip center it is in is pretty dark. Once you do make your way in, however, you will like what you find. My wife and I were finding it a hard time to choose between the approximate two dozen flavors or so, but each of us got the medium cup with two scoops. Reasonably priced and tastes good, and the lady helping us was very friendly. If you like gelato, I would recommend it!"
4,"This is a sweet little gelato shop. I&apos;m not usually a sweet person but I was waiting for my son to finish his dentist appointment and decided to try this place. The service was excellent, the treat was delicious, and the shop was inviting and fun. They have outside seating as well. They service cookies, brownies, and other treats too. This place is kinda expensive. For 2  eye small gelato cups I paid almost $20 bucks."
4,"Back in 2010, I spent a month studying abroad in Venice. It was one of the best months of my life, hands down. Part of my Italy experience was my gelato addiction. I sometimes would get my fix three times a day so it&apos;s good I don&apos;t live their permanently. Ever since, I&apos;ve always had a special place in my heart for gelato. Which makes visiting a place like SweetCup a treat, pun intended. 

I stopped by SweetCup on a Sunday during COVID times. They&apos;re located in a shopping center and parking wasn&apos;t an issue. One of the nice things about ice cream spots in general is free samples. Because of the coronavirus, samples weren&apos;t allowed and I appreciate their attention to safety. SweetCup has a bajillion rotating flavors which is music to anyone&apos;s ears who&apos;s all about the variety like me. I went with a two-scoop waffle cone with Nutella and huckleberry. 

Quality gelato for a guy who was daydreaming about Italy."
5,"Some of the best gelato I&apos;ve had! I loved ALL the flavors I got - Huckleberry Chai, Vietnamese Coffee &amp; Vanilla Tres Leches. They&apos;re flavors are so unique and delicious! The cashier who helped me was also super nice and friendly! Great place to stop by for a quick and delicious dessert!"
3,"The gelato here is creamy, but I have a big sweet tooth and I felt like many of the flavors just weren&apos;t sweet/flavorful enough. I tried 5 and only really liked the 1st two.

A little pricey. A small cup (up to 3 flavors) was $4.25. Credit card only. 

**Vanilla bean tres leches
**Cookie butter crunch
Banana pudding- I love banana pudding but it wasn&apos;t banana enough for me
Pistachio- also love pistachio but wasn&apos;t flavorful enough
Cookies &amp; cream- didn&apos;t seem that sweet or creamy

Oh they have plenty of dairy free options too (sorbets). My friend had mint coconut and chocolate, I think. They were pretty good for sorbets, I guess. I prefer ice cream. I suggest Creamistry or Jeni&apos;s Splendid Ice Creams (Jeni&apos;s for sure has dairy free options)."
5,"This gelato is delicious. And as a person with sensitivity to diary, I appreciate the well labeled demarcations of gelatos, yogurt, custards, etc. 

The actual gelato is delicious! I had the pomegranate, almond honey and pistachio. All amazing. Definitely come here. Super yum tastic!!!"
4,"Nice little spot to try gelato or sorbet. I&apos;m vegan so I can only have sorbet since the gelato contains milk. I tried  sampling the key lime, pomegranate rose and vegan chocolate flavors. They were all delicious. I settled on the pomegranate rose in a small. I paid approximately 4.25 for a small. I forgot how many ounces but a small was filling. They make this fresh all locally by the owner. The sales clerk was very friendly and recommended great options. Check them out!"
5,"I really wished that the indoor sitting was available at this time, but I understand that the pandemic has changed normal business operations. I got a scoop of coconut rum and walked around midtown area as I ate my gelato. Service was stellar! I was debating two flavors and the attendant tried her best to describe the flavors to me since sampling has been suspended due to the pandemic. Overall, I really enjoyed my experience and I can&apos;t wait for them to re-open. In the meantime stop by to support this local business owned by women!  Don&apos;t forget to bring your mask and be prepared to eat the ice cream elsewhere. I suggest you walk around the area, it will be a great exercise to justify your indulgence"
5,"Found this place through Yelp.  Went with the family.  Ages ranged from 6 to 37 and everyone was extremely satisfied with everything we tried.  Banana Pudding, Dirty Coconut, Goat Cheese, Root beer float with marshmallows, Lemon, Coconut, Chocolate, and some others.  Any time we are in the area we will definitely be back.  May make the drive just to get some more.  We finished all our gelato before we could take a pic."
5,"If you are a true ice cream lover, you need to come to this local shop. The burnt caramel is the most delicious flavor i have ever tasted."
5,"I got the reverse cookies and cream and Vietnamese iced coffee in a cone: Both were delicious very creamy, not too sweet, and light. The place is cute for an ice cream date, they have chairs outside to enjoy if there is nice weather as well.I think it was reasonably priced."
