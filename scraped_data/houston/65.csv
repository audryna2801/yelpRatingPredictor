5,"The food is still great. The people who work here are still great. When I went, they only had patio seating and the inside was closed for dining. You can still enter to use the restrooms. Food is flavorful of course."
5,"Just when I thought Hughies couldn&apos;t get any better, they added a great curbside setup during Covid! There are signs and cones to guide you to the area, and then a staff member either runs out your order or you can look at a menu and order from your car. It was so easy and convenient. They&apos;re also doing their beer and wine specials to go... Tuesday ($4 Texas beers) and Wednesday ($2 fire sale beers) are the best! The beer comes out in big 32oz cans, definitely the best to-go alcohol packaging I&apos;ve seen!"
5,The best patio and food that is served hot and fresh loved the seasoning of the shrimp  my lunch go to for fast professional friendly affordable grub
5,"Absolutely amazing. The specialty beef rice dish was awesome and the kale salad was soo good (and I usually hate salads). Husband had vermicelli grilled pork bowl, it was also so delish.
Very friendly staff, adequately distanced seating and clean place. Came here on happy hour and our drinks were dirt cheap: I had the &quot;smell the van&quot; cider which I recommend (if you like a hint of sweetness without diabetes).
Such a chill place. Give them a try!"
3,"Today I have to come back and update my review and remove a few stars. Only because today I decided to get take out food and the man was very rude. Listen these people in these establishments have to get it together with their attitudes. I&apos;m not about to be disrespected this holiday season and will forever let the world know how these people are. 

Period"
4,"Food and staff were great.  Definitely some where that I&apos;d recommend if you were in heights and would go back to.

Surprised by inside though.  Looks like this place use to be a pub that was turned into a Vietnamese restaurant.

Very chill, nothing fancy."
5,"Went this past week and got two bahn mi&apos;s and a shaking beef entree. Both were wonderful! My partner said to remind him of how much he liked the shaking beef the next time he wants steak. My bahn mi&apos;s we&apos;re both juicy and flavorful and full! The service is good, too. We&apos;ll be back more often."
5,"This place is the best!!!! Family friendly, with so many good beers and so much good food!! I&apos;ve gotten then shaking lemon tofu for years, it&apos;s my favorite dish along with their spring rolls, bahn mis and vermicelli dishes."
4,"SHAKING BEEF KALE SALAD $12 + $1 eggroll (filet mignon cubes. kale salad mix w/ feta, tomatoes, onion, cucumber, dried cranberry, bell pepper, mixed nuts- walnuts and sliced almonds, raspberry vinaigrette)- delicious! I hate raw kale, but this was surprisingly really good and not bitter at all! Portions were great. Beef was flavorful and tender (some pieces were a tad chewier but not bad), the salad was huge (took up a whole to-go box), and the eggroll was also big and crispy. I was so full afterwards.

Shaking beef specialty (filet mignon, steamed rice, Viet kale salad) $12- good amount of food for my friend. If you want more kale salad though, I recommend getting the salad entree! You will still get full!

Only complaint is that we did curbside pick up during corona- We asked for chopsticks to find out later there was no other plasticware or napkins included! We took our food to the park to eat, so good thing we asked for chopsticks. Also, they quoted us 20-25 minutes, however our food was ready in less than 15 minutes. I hate cold food, so good thing we came early."
4,Always consistently good food and service! Everyone wore masks to keep us safe. Love the Vietnamese coffee and sandwiches!!
5,"BOMB SALAD. It all tasted fresh and well seasoned. Came with a raspberry vinaigrette dressing on the side but the kale and beef are both already seasoned so the dressing is just a plus. I liked to dip the beef in it instead of pouring it over the entire salad Beef was well cooked. Not too chewy. Also, definitely get a spring roll with its dipping sauce on the side. The sweet and sour flavor complements the savory salad very well in my opinion. 

Also, it was a lot of food. I have enough leftover for a second meal."
5,"Love the food and beer selection.  

Everything is super tasty and the shaking beef is my go to.  Kids love that the shrimp basket is back and love the revamped dish! Egg rolls and great and so is the seasonal pho.  Wish it was a daily dish in the winter.  All the Vietnamese dishes are great and there are burgers and a huge country fried steak for those that want something else.   The fries are some of my favorite around town.  

The draft beers are always a treat!  You can see their beer offerings on the Untappd app!"
4,"This might be one of my new fav Vietnamese restaurant! 
Love this for dine in or take out. Quick service. Great beer selection.  Everything on the menu has been delicious so far. 

Pros: 
-Loved the chicken wings- deep fried to perfection and juicy!!! Can&apos;t go wrong with any of the flavours. Can also get sauce on the side so you can try them that way instead 
-great salad rolls and egg rolls 
-Banh Mi sandwiches also great. The beef one is amazing 
-Shaking Beef specialty is my favourite. The summer kale salad and fried rice it comes with -- AMAZING! 
-lemon grass beef/ chicken also delicious 

Love the drive thru setup . Drive right up and someone comes to your car. No need to even get out"
3,"First time dining from this place and we ordered to-go. Service was fast and organized. We&apos;ve been wanting to try this place for quite some time. We got lemon grass chicken, spring rolls, and shaking beef. Flavors were alright. The only thing I&apos;d wish was different is the rice portion."
5,I love this place! They have delicious food all around. The fried spring rolls are the bomb. You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu.
5,"This place is a hidden gem; if you&apos;re one of the lucky ones who know about it or live close enough to eat here as often as you like then you know what I&apos;m talking about. Everything on the menu is on point and more importantly it is always consistent!!! quality, quantity and flavor never miss a beat. Keep doing what you&apos;re doing guys!  

1) shaking beef
2) chicken fried steak (wow!!)
3) the wings
4) banh mi sandwiches
5) that kale salad doe :)"
5,"Easily the best kale salad in the city, and I&apos;m not a kale fan. They always have a huge selection of craft beers on tap. Their bahn-mi sandwich is cheap and delicious. Even with their limited menu, this place is worth the visit. Oh.. and add the fried egg. You deserve it."
4,"I&apos;ll start by saying the food is amazing! Customer service on the other hand was just okay. 

I haven&apos;t been in awhile so I called to ask about outdoor seating, the lady on the phone said there was none so I proceeded to ask if you can sit inside? She said no, then I got the hint and asked if it was to go only, she said yes. Odd interaction but when I called back to place order she said it would be done shortly. As soon as I arrived, a man came running to my window to ask for my order and brought it out promptly. 

I got to a park to eat my meal only to realize they didn&apos;t pack any silverware or napkins. Previously worked in the restaurant industry and all Togo orders are served with utensils. Very frustrating that I was sitting at a park with my food and nothing to eat it with.

Dropped the ball there but like I said before, the food is great!"
5,"Came to find this place after a long day at work. Being that I travel, I didn&apos;t know what the neighborhood had to offer, but as a savvy Yelper, this quickly caught my eye. 

I came in on a Tuesday afternoon on a rainy day. Place wasn&apos;t busy but it had satisfied patrons occupying some of its seats. It&apos;s a quaint and definitely unique look on the inside. You walk in, immediately are greeted by the view of the bar surrounded by tables and booths that line the perimeter of the establishment. The decor is that of a gastropub, they even have two flat screens showcasing their craft beer menu, huge plus for me. 

I was quickly shown to a seat of my choosing and brought a menu. Very simple menu and easy to follow. My eyes set on the Beer Lunch section and chose the Banh Mi + Fries and a beer of $6 or less, all for $11 total. the banh mi + fries is $7 by itself without the liquid courage. I, of course, chose to quench my thirst with a cold one, a very tasty one too, Bone Saw was its name, very good. For the Banh mi, I specifically chose the lemon grass beef. Man it was different than any other banh mi&apos;s I&apos;ve tried before. It was Hughe, fresh, crunchy and hot (temperature). The beef had a lemon grass flavor you couldn&apos;t help but fall in love with. The fries, were of course, just fries but they were good, they didn&apos;t mess them up. I was very satisfied with this meal and the good, prompt, quality service. If only I lived closer, I would frequent more. At least now I know a good spot this side of town."
4,Due to COVID hughies only offers outdoor seating.  Came here for lunch to send off a co worker. Unfortunately the music was so loud on the patio it was not the best experience.   Our waiter was seemed very overwhelmed and seemed to be rushing us.  As usual the food was outstanding.  It&apos;s unfortunate I couldn&apos;t have w conversation with my table mate due to the environment.
