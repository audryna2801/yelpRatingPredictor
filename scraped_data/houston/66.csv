5,"I&apos;ve been here many times and this has been my go to since the COIVID lockdowns. Even beforehand I loved coming here due to the atmosphere and the talent the bartenders have here in making cocktails but ever since many of my favorite cocktail bars have closed down, I decided to come here more often and it made me appreciate it so much more.

First the bar is very welcoming with plenty of room for you to relax outside or in along with many places for you to park which is hard to find considering the area. Secondly, all the bartenders are great at their craft so all the classic cocktails will be known and served sometimes with their own twist. For example, their whiskey sours here are some of the best I&apos;ve had at a Houston bar. Third, If you aren&apos;t familiar with cocktails or just want something new, they have some great specialty cocktails that are tasteful and aesthetically pleasing for those who want something flashy for social media. I recommend the Summer Dreams Cocktail if you want something like that. It&apos;s a sweet cocktail with strong vanilla tones that is topped off with sugar that the bartender lights on fire. Also finally, the place has a great liquor selection with some bottles that are hard to find such as the Hibiki 12.

Overall, this is a great place if you enjoy a good drink in a relaxed atmosphere."
5,"Happily found Wooster&apos;s and was pleasantly surprised. Reminded me of an Austin bar with a few TVs and virtually all outdoor and open dining with some swings. Huge parking lot in this area is also a great plus. Cocktail menu humongous and draft list decent. Covid take. Seriously with masks required and QR code&apos;s on all tables. Heaters outside, exceptional music, and quick service while also taking the craft of cocktails seriously. Honestly a perfect bar for a quick drink or a date. Must try if looking for a leisurely drink in this part of town."
5,"One of the best bars to have a great cocktail, specially throughout a pandemic, Paul took his time to make sure we were pleased with our choice of cocktails, he is a true witty master of his craft and even made jokes to make our evening a lot more pleasant, by far the best bar I been in Houston, thank you for Wooster&apos;s!!"
4,"During these pandemic times, this bar is a great date spot to go grab a drink and sit to enjoy some company. Located in Midtown, I highly suggest taking a stop in and trying some of their mixed drinks..

I had to try one of my favorite mixed drink.. an old fashion. Not the best I&apos;ve ever had, but definitely not the worst. Pretty awesome! 2 mixed drinks cost over 20, which seems to be the usual. The ambience is well worth it. Recommend for a date night for sure!"
1,"I have seen many staff matriculate at Wooster&apos;s &amp; NEVER have I &amp; my guest been treated with such a disgusting attitude. Paul you know I am talking about you, because you were standing next to my car smoking a cigarette and I ask you if you were having a good day. Now I ask Paul if he was having a good day because his disrespectful negative attitude towards me and my guest was just uncalled for. You starred us down like we were doing something wrong inside Wooster. We simple sat down at a table BECAUSE AAAAALLLLLLLLLL the OTHER TABLES WERE TAKEN! I have allergies to cigarette smoke. 
Paul your attitude needs realignment honey! I am the customer you are the staff. I paid for service and I expect 100% utmost service suga! 
I have been a customer of Wooster since it OPENED! Paul you are the first to cop an attitude over something extremely petty - a damn table.
First if you want me to move from a reserve table stated 6:30pm then SHOULD have disinfected the tables that other customers were using. Wait did you FORGET WE ARE IN THE 3RD WAVE OF COVID-19! #CDC not in compliance. What happened to social distancing Paul! 
You want to be so anal about the WRONG things you need to check your self before you wreck yourself! So Many HUMANS HAVE DIED FROM COVID-19 you hounding and harassing me and my guest over a damn table is petty! Let me state again, I had to inform you because I was watching you, to go clean and disinfect the OTHER TABLE that was occupied. And you caught an attitude over that, you must not realize COVID-19 is in effect, 3rd Wave. 
Needless to say PAUL, I do not feel you compliment Wooster positive energy vibe. Smoking a cigarette by my car and having a flip mouth response to me when I ask if you were having a good day because you were harassing me and my guest over a damn table during COVID-19. Don&apos;t you know cigarette&apos;s kill your body. You must really be unhappy in your life because you tried to exude your unhappiness in to my life and it won&apos;t happen. That is why God created Yelp! Thank you Yelp!"
5,"I was so stoked to be able to visit this bar. Word around the city was, that they serve up some of the most flavorful drinks in Houston. It&apos;s low key and chill, low lit and warm. Their outdoor heaters make you feel as if your inside of a warm bedroom. I ordered about three mocktails and 2 cocktails. Let&apos;s just say, I wanted to have a good sample so that I could truly gauge how amazing the drinks really were. They make all of their mixes from scratch! This thought and time it must have taken to create such master pieces. You can tell from the pictures I was feeling myself. I can&apos;t wait to try this place out again and order some of the other dishes from their menu. Their hamburgers were pretty great!! The fries were perfect."
4,"Delicious drinks. Even the mocktails were good. Also the apps were very tasty. We had fries, sweet potato tots and the pretzel. Great happy hour specials."
4,"Was there for the NYE. Cocktails was on point, social distancing was at place, people were wearing masks. Didn&apos;t get to try any beers but the cocktail was really good and the price was more than reasonable. A really decent place to get boozy without breaking your wallet."
5,"Ulysses  (Uly) was an amazing person to work with, I think he realizes that his coworker is a person who is unable to perform him normal duties because both times I went to the bar to order his coworker had a horrible attitude seemed overwhelmed to work with patrons (lol) ... Uly he was extremely warming and helpful! 
Please hire more people like him he will help your business go far!"
4,"Perfect for a date night or happy hour with friends! I love the atmosphere of Wooster&apos;s. Indoor and outdoor seating is available. Cocktails are crafted impeccably! I&apos;m a vodka and gin kind of girl, and as I&apos;ve worked through the menu, I&apos;ve never gotten a drink I didn&apos;t like."
5,"Pros: we absolutely loved this spot, we stayed for two drinks because they were so yummy (we were bar hopping), my husband fell in love with the silver surfer drink, and he never goes for eggy cocktails. The service was fantastic, bathrooms were clean, I loved the outdoor and inside areas. We also had the pretzel and it was sooooo good!

Cons: None!"
4,"This is a great bar off the beaten path in Midtown - it is very chill and attracts an older crowd of young adults than some of the more club-y bars in Midtown proper. All bars have their place, but Wooster&apos;s is great if you are looking for a handcrafted cocktail from a giant menu - there is definitely something for everyone here and enough variety that you can come many times and still not have tried everything. They have a great indoor space with lots of tables and an equally sprawling outdoor patio - come in the fall/winter and enjoy their table-side fire pits! 

There is a medium-sized lot dedicated to Wooster&apos;s, but it has always been full when I come, so street parking will be the name of the game. Make sure not to park in the lot for the restaurant next door, even though it is behind Wooster&apos;s - they tow!"
3,Drinks were good bartender was great. Place was busy and vibe was very blah. Stoped by just for pre dinner drinks. I would stop by again to give this place a more well rounded review.
5,"Loved this place. Came in Sunday, right after they open (4pm) and it was empty so had time to sit at the bar and interact with the bartender. Started getting busy right before 5. It&apos;s a very chill bar. 

The bar is pretty cool. They have an outside area. The bar is indoors, they had two bartenders on this day. Both were super nice and attentive. They do make crafted cocktails so it&apos;s not a quick turn around but they do a good job.

I had four Chupacabras cocktails, and it was amazing. Tequila lovers definitely recommend this cocktail. Price was on point. Also ordered some fries, they were the crispiest fries I&apos;ve ever had.

Bathroom: they did a pretty great job. Stalls are roof to floor separated and made from concrete. So perfect privacy."
5,I got the Cloud Nine drink and it was amazing! Very cool vibe. Great for a date or to meet up with friends.
3,"I love the open area. I came here for a pop-up only to be left with juice and innovative dishes by a Nikki v. I had the Wooster sour and the kiss cocktail. Forgot the actual name, but it was the top drink to order. They both were juiced down and there was no alcohol taste to it. I typically like to taste a bit of alcohol but unfortunately, they skimped out. 

They were not selling other food items while this pop-up was happening. So sad. But the food was okay. Noodles were overwhelming with lemon. The tapioca balls were overly sweet, but those Thai Chili&apos;s are amazing as bar food. I would love these when drinking. 

Aside from food and drinks, the atmosphere was fun. The area was clean. There&apos;s parking available in their lot or across the street near the beer garden. It&apos;s free too! It was hard to tell where to order. But you order at the bar for food and drinks. Then sit. I didn&apos;t like how I ordered a couple of drinks then the bartender would call my name one by one. I had to get up and pick it up instead of them bringing it to me like my food. It was a bit disorganized."
3,"I really like the ambiance at Wooster but what I hate is the snooty bartenders. However, the drinks are amazing and I will definitely go back."
4,"Nice outdoor atomosphere. I liked the hanging lights and swinging chairs. There was a nice breeze outside too. So relaxing. The fire pits were a nice touch as well. If you love strong cocktail drinks, this place is for you. We ordered the Low Tide and Port Royal, which were pretty good. I wished that they tasted more tropical, though. Maybe it just wasn&apos;t my cup of tea.

Parking was a pain in the butt. We came just right after 6 pm, and their private lot was already full. We had to drive around for a bit until we found a huge and well lit parking garage nearby called Mid Main public parking. The pricing wasn&apos;t too bad either (see attached photos). This beats trying to find street parking, which was nowhere in sight this particular Friday night.

I do prefer Axelrad more than Wooster&apos;s Garden because they have Luigi&apos;s pizza, taco trucks, board games, and live music. This place wasn&apos;t too bad, though. I&apos;ll return if my friends decide to come here."
5,"The cutest happy hour spot (ends at 6pm). My bf and I came around 5:00 and still managed to get a good amount of drinks in before it ended. The drinks do take a while to make since they&apos;re highly crafted, but all in all worth it. The fries tasted fresh, crunchy, and flavorful. They are a bit pricey ($7) but for a bar snack, I would buy again. 

The outdoor patio is honestly so beautiful. Woosters set up the place to make it universal for any event. Come here for date night, girls night, day drinking, and even studying lol. 

I really like how they have a parking lot just for their bar. You can sit outside and still see your car. On top of that, there&apos;s no charge."
4,"I&apos;ve seen this place many times, it&apos;s walking distance from my home. I love the atmosphere , has a dim setting but outside patio is the highlight . We got some type of fuzz margarita it was really good. The staff was friendly and very patient as I&apos;m super indecisive at the bar"
