5,"Who doesn&apos;t want a lovely, light, filled crepe for dessert after dinner? Yeah, me too!!

Sweet Paris Creperie was a few shops east of where we ate dinner (Tiger House - see my review it was AWESOME) so of course we had to stop in here for a sweet treat on an early springtime evening. 

My daughter and I decided to share the simple yet perfect Lemon crepe, an explosion of bright lemon flavor and sweet delicate crepe that reminded me of my favorite lemon bar cookies, without the crunch. Paired with fresh whipped cream and a scoop of simple vanilla ice cream, this dessert really hit all the taste buds. 

The shop and dining areas (indoor and outdoor) are impeccably clean and surprisingly airy. Charming decor and vivid umbrellas at the sidewalk tables are a treat for the eyes as the crepes are treats for the soul. 

5 Mais Oui, Paris! Stars"
5,"Delicious crepes, both savory and sweet! Such a great location within walking distance to cute shops."
5,"Sweet Paris has excellent crepes. No matter what you&apos;re looking for, sweet or savory they have it. And in the time of Covid, it&apos;s great that they have excellent outdoor seating."
5,"Looking for an affordable brunch or dessert place with a cute aesthetic? This is the place to go!

Some of my classmates and I have absolutely loved going here for brunch. Each crepe fills you up just enough and the prices are SO reasonable. Some of our favorite go-to breakfast crepes are La Canadienne and The Houstonian. Each of that is under $10! How great is that? I&apos;ve tried both but I personally like going with La Canadienne because of the maple syrup drizzle that goes on top, and I do have a bit of a sweet tooth.

For lunch/dinner options, my favorite go-to&apos;s have been: Chicken Carbonara, Chicken Alfredo, and the Nordic. All very delicious! I like that they all each come with a small side salad.

For dessert: I recommend the s&apos;mores or nutella with strawberries and bananas. I also definitely recommend getting a side of vanilla ice cream with it too! Just the perfect hot and cold combination for dessert. I also typically share my dessert crepe too just because it is a little bit too much for 1 person (especially if you ate dinner beforehand).

This place has such a cute aesthetic inside for photo-ops. Service is fantastic and water/silverware self-served. I&apos;ve also tried their nutella hot chocolate here that is AMAZING. I totally recommend it."
4,"Based off one item - oreo crepe!

It was soo soo sweet, but so so yummy! The shop inside is so adorable and definitely have Paris vibes (obvi hence the name of the cafe). I cannot wait to try the savory crepes. 
If you are looking for a sweet dessert after eating, this is great place to check out!"
5,"I ordered a S&apos;mores Crepe togo and it was fantastic. It consisted of a great quality dense crepe served warm with some crisp and a good amount of chocolate drizzle on top. It had an abundance of homemade marshmallows and creamy Nutella filling on the inside of the crepe. On a side note, the Chicken Florentine Crepe is my favorite savory crepe here, while the S&apos;mores Crepe is my favorite sweet crepe from this establishment. Great service on this visit as well."
5,"After eating at this delicious restaurant two stores down called tiger noodle house, my kids and I walked past this place and decided to have a little dessert. The place is stunning and sweet. It really makes you feel like you&apos;re in a cafe in Paris. They even have cute seating outside facing the street. I&apos;m a people watcher so I love a place that has a little people watching view. The place was very clean, the food smelled delicious and they had so many menu items and drink items. I definitely kept telling myself, &quot;I have to come back to this place&quot;. I ordered one Dolce de Leche crepe and it was literally to die for. So delicious, light and fluffy. We were still full from before but didn&apos;t want to miss out on this place. We will be back so that we can taste more menu items because this place was definitely worth the stop."
5,I typically don&apos;t like sweet crepes but the apple cinnamon creme crepe was to die for ... the creme was perfectly cooked and seasoned with delicious apple cinnamon.. drizzled w Nutella...
3,"Sweet Paris in Rice Village didn&apos;t wow me this time. Crepes seemed to be a tad on the brown side and extra chewy, but presentation was on point (as per usual!). Literally, my knife flew out of my hand twice because I couldn&apos;t cut the dang thing. Price point falls quite fairly. You&apos;re looking at paying somewhere between $8-12 for any crepe.

Menu:
They&apos;ve got breakfast crepes; yogurt parfait or something more along the savory side--eggs and such. A humble selection of sweet crepes, and they also have a larger selection of savory crepes. Don&apos;t like crepes? Try a waffle. Full menu and prices can be found at this link.

Atmosphere &amp; Service:
Clean and charming. Sweet Paris is more like a cafe. Get in line, order at the register, and grab a number for your table. Hang it on the kinda cool miniature Eiffel tower table accent and they&apos;ll bring your order out to you. Their kitchen lies behind a glass wall so you can appreciate how they are cooking and preparing the food. They also have quite the espresso machine back there. I&apos;m a sucker for white subway tiles.
In the dining area, chandeliers hang from the ceiling and tufted benches line the walls. The theme keeps stays white on white with metal accents here and there.

Recommendations:
1.) Anything with Nutella - just add some sort of fruit inside your crepe--winner, winner, chicken dinner.

2a.) Grab a cappuccino with your crepe--it&apos;s got a cool little Eiffel tower design. Feel free to snap it and add it to the other 300 pictures they have on here, lol.

2b.) Don&apos;t like coffee? Get a spoon of vanilla bean ice cream along with your crepe. Just don&apos;t think about the calories--no regrets."
4,"It&apos;s a cute little cafe nicely decorated with Paris decor. You order and pay before sitting. You find your own seat. There&apos;s tables inside and outside. 
Pros
 nicely decorated 
 The crepes we tried were really good. Several of us had the Philly Cheesesteak and my friend had the Nutella with bananas. 
 mimosas were the bomb. They were really good. 

Cons
You tip before any service is provided. I don&apos;t like that. 
They don&apos;t have bottled water, even though it&apos;s on the menu. 
They bring your food, but they don&apos;t check on you. 
The Nutella with bananas was good, but had a lot of Nutella.  
Also, they don&apos;t have ranch for the salad."
2,"I&apos;m hoping to write a follow up review once this issue is resolved but I am very bothered by what has happened. I visit this sweet Paris often and have never had an issue, thus why I didn&apos;t check my order once I received it. I ordered a chicken Florentine and the Houstonian plus a Nutella crepe, when we got home the order was totally fine except they gave us the wrong one for the Houstonian. I&apos;m not 100% sure which they gave us but it had chicken something that the person it was for cannot eat. I tried calling the restaurant but got sent to voicemail every time. I understand that they get busy but I feel very frustrated that I couldn&apos;t even call within some time in order to see if I could get the issue resolved. The staff was friendly and the rest of my order was correct but this one issue has really bothered me. I hope when I call later I&apos;ll be able to get a response. This is why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1."
5,"I&apos;ve been coming to sweet Paris for 3 years now &amp; each time I leave with a happy experience &amp; full stomach! 
Jonathan is beyond exceptional, remembers all his customers, very attentive to detail. He definitely can&apos;t do it alone, he has an exceptional team that comes along with amazing service. Ms. Betty is on top of things, she makes you have an outstanding experience as well. This is definitely the spot for a girls brunch, or cute date."
4,"I went to this Sweet Paris with a couple friends while visiting Rice Village on a short trip to Houston. From the outside, the store front is pretty small, wedged between two other stores, but the inside goes pretty deep, with around 15-20 tables. The decor is very bright and cute, complete with succulents on the tables and Eiffel Tower numbed holders. I&apos;m not sure if it&apos;s exactly Parisian, but it is nice and airy.

I ordered the savory crepe called Le California--a lighter crepe that sold me with its truffle oil, cherry tomatoes, and avocado. Unfortunately, they had run  out of cherry tomatoes, so I substituted them with mushrooms instead. It was a pretty standard crepe, nothing exceptional for the price. I really liked the flavors of this one, so if you&apos;re looking for a crepe that&apos;s not as heavy as a cheese-filled carbonara or philly cheesesteak, Le California is a good choice. I also got a cold brew, which was extremely bitter and sour, but that might just be how cold brews taste (I usually get espresso-based drinks).

All in all, I&apos;d probably go again if I happened to be in the area looking for a solid meal, but I wouldn&apos;t go to Houston seeking out this specific restaurant."
3,"Delicious but pricey- $10 for dessert (w/ ice cream)

NUTELLA CREPE W/ BANANAS &amp; STRAWBERRIES $7.95 + VANILLA BEAN ICE CREAM $1.95 (2 scoops)- 
SMORES WAFFLE $7.95 + VANILLA BEAN ICE CREAM $1.95 (2 scoops)- 

Both were yummy (i love sweets!), but I preferred the waffle. I think I just like waffles more than crepes though. Ice cream is kind of pricey, and I wish they had other flavors to choose from."
5,"They have excellent crepes the esspresso there is noce , savory and sweet is tasty and the vibe is nice"
4,"Love this lil place always good, Sweet or savory! Drinks are pretty good. Location is crowded so parking sucks but that&apos;s the sacrifice for good food."
4,"Think of the fancy version of subway except you get to choose between which delicious crepe you get. The mesmerizing effect of watching them create the thin pancake like food while you wait passes the time nicely.

Sweet Paris has a cast of savory and sweet crepe-ations (creations) from Chicken Florentine (pictured) and Croque Madam (ham and cheese) to any choice of berry you desire! The menu can satisfy any craving you are having from breakfast to lunch.

The outdoor seating was pleasant with light jazzy beats keeping us company along with the passing conversations of sidewalk pedestrians.

Onto the setbacks:

The table side service is not existent besides the cleaning of tables. If you want another water or a desert you will have to go up to the register and order separately. This is more of an explanation of their setup than an actual setback. Expectation management.

The coffee game is weak. It&apos;s not the reason I went there but I love me some coffee with my crepes. I ordered the Nutella Latte which was the first time I&apos;ve seen such a fantastic idea but the execution was watery and lacking the flavor punch from the famous spread.

TL;DR Go check out this unique French experience and get mesmerized by the rotary flat disks of deliciousness."
4,"Ventured out to this cute place the first crisp weekend we&apos;ve had in Houston. It was the perfect brunch spot before running some errands. We opted to get both savory and sweets crepes - because, why not? They are quite large and we probably should have shared two between the two of us but our eyes were bigger than our stomachs, per usual. 

My savory pick was Le Mexican which they happily substituted chicken for the carnitas. The filling was tasty with a nice kick of hot sauce. The avocado slices were a refreshing bite. The crepe itself was just perfect. Le California is what my date picked which we both enjoyed as well. Nothing memorable about the flavor but tasty nonetheless. 

For the sweet we picked the Nutella with strawberries and bananas. The crepe was packed with the toppings! The only downside was actually getting the crepe to our table. They assumed that we wanted it as our dessert which was more of a miscommunication as we wanted it all at the same time. After sorting that out, however, it took 2 additional requests and over 10 minutes to receive our crepe despite them not being busy. That was really the only problem we had with the place. Looking forward to another visit."
4,"So I hadn&apos;t visited Houston in a few months and the boyfriend was really excited that I&apos;d be coming to town this weekend for one main reason: to finally take me to the French crepe bakery. Yes. Food is our number one priority and I wouldn&apos;t have it any other way. 

Yelp has the opening time for Saturday morning listed at 10 am, so because we&apos;d arrived around 9, we stopped by Croissant-Brioche across the street and got some coffees and the danish because we have no self-control.

It wasn&apos;t until we walked on over a bit before 10 that we realized they had been open since 8 am! We should have checked behind our phones...

Anywho. The first thing you notice when you walk in is the gorgeous outdoors patio with the Tiffany&apos;s blue and white colored theme. When you walk inside, you&apos;ll notice the same colors on the walls with beautiful chandeliers, music playing and people enjoying their delicious crepes and drinks. We decided to order a sweet and savory dish to split between us. 

CROQUE MADAME 4/5: Imagine a fancy French ham and cheese filled with delicious scrambled eggs, gruyére cheese, thick diced pieces of jam and béchamel sauce sandwiched up in a freshly baked crepe. Very saucy. Very good. I&apos;d order it again. The ham was too thick for me and not tender enough. The entire thing was a bit too salty for my taste too but generally it was great. Not to mention the presentation...so pretty!

DULCE DE LECHE 4/5: Dulce de leche should be a part of the food pyramid. It is so good and so rich. This one was very satisfying to eat with freshly cut strawberries and bananas, topped with a soft chocolate sauce drizzle and powdered sugar. I just don&apos;t agree with using cool whip as a side cream...it&apos;s not real cream in my opinion and doesn&apos;t taste anything like the real thing. Still a lovely dessert to eat and drink with our coffee. 

The service was very friendly and efficient. We barely waited 5 minutes for our food. The number holders were adorable Eiffel Tower stands that added to the adorable Parisian theme. We&apos;d definitely stop by again. This is a gorgeous place to go with a loved one in Rice Village.

PARKING
Available outdoors or in the covered structure (paid)"
5,"First time here and food was GREAT! Would recommend 10/10... also Nutella with strawberries and banana. 

Ps. JONATHAN IS REALLY NICE"
