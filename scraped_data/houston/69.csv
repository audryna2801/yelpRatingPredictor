5,"We love going to El Bolillo, it is always an experience. It definitely reminds me of the bakeries in Mexico, we love walking around with our tray and our tongs picking up all kinds of tasty pastries. The bread is always fresh, bolillos are wonderful and also are the flour tortillas. They have good tres leches cake and chocoflan. We go for every Mexican holiday to find traditional seasonal breads."
5,"For the ultimate in Tres Leches, head to El Bolillo Bakery without any hesitation. There you will discover the most delicious, moist cake drenched in evaporated, condensed and regular milk,  layered with strawberries, peaches or pineapples, wrapped in clouds of whipped cream and decorated with chocolate dipped strawberries and chocolates. 

While you are there, you can pick up a large silver tray and tongs that you can pile high with sweet Mexican pan dulce pastries like panaderos,  canastas de pina, and maridos. Craving sweet empanadas? So many delicious choices. Our family favorites are the sweet potato, pumpkin and caramel. Make sure to pick up a bag of fresh, hot tortillas or Bolillo rolls as well. 

Go during the week. Parking is limited and the weekends can be quite crowded."
5,The best place for pan dulce! I love coming here. The place is alright with social distancing guidelines. It&apos;s not the business it&apos;s the people. Some people tend to crowd around each other or are unaware of how close they are to others. They clean the trays and tongs after each use so that&apos;s good.
5,"El Bolillo is a popular institution of a Mexican bakery here in Houston. Come visit for a veritable panader√≠a experience. Expect a crowded shop floor with walls and rolling bake trays packed with assorted pastries, including cochito (gingerbread pig), concha (seashell sweet bread), empanadas (fruit-filled), oreja (ear-shaped flaky pastry), churros, and more. Honestly, most of the time I didn&apos;t know what I was picking up - I just found the ones that looked good. You&apos;ll walk around with a platter and tongs and just load up your tray with what you want to buy. It&apos;s all super cheap - around $1 per item - so you can get a whole bag of pastries fit for a family for like $5. It&apos;s also all super authentic - most of the time, I was the only non-Mexican (or at least non-Spanish speaker) inside.

To be honest, I don&apos;t LOVE Mexican baked goods. But El Bolillo has some great ones, and the experience is just fun. Stop by for a unique activity and tasty treats!"
4,"I surprised a friend with one of El Bolio&apos;s tres leches cakes this past December. The problem? I live in Dallas, so I called for her to pick it up. 

When I spoke to a rep, I specially noted, &quot;Please write &apos;Happy Birthday to F-A-R-R-A-H.&apos; F as in Frank. A as in Adam,&quot; and so on. I repeated this at least three times to the person whom I spoke to on the phone. I even called later to confirm the cake&apos;s proper spelling, and the person read Farrahback to me.

The day after, Farrah picked up the cake and found it read, &quot;S-A-R-R-A-H.&quot; I anticipated this possible mistake; however, they still did not get it correct despite my efforts.

Even though I wanted to drop a three-star review, I will give it a four for three reasons:

1) She noted how delicious the cake was.
2) I found their cakes very affordable (starting at $25). 
3) I didn&apos;t go on my run this morning, so perhaps I am a bit cranky. 

Will I support El Bolio the next time I visit Houston? Sure! I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll ever order another custom cake from them, though!"
1,"I am a very upset customer. 
I went to El Bolillo on Airline 3 weeks ago to inquire about a specific cake I wanted to order for my friend. The Hispanic man at the counter told me that I didn&apos;t need to order or pay for it then he just told me to place the order 4 days in advance in person. I asked him again if I could place the order at the time he said no. I thought everything would go well. I provided my friend the details the man had told me. 
Today, my friend drove 35 miles from Katy, Texas just to be told that they were not going to be able to make the cake due to the Christmas Season. The Hispanic man could&apos;ve told me this 3 weeks ago and we would&apos;ve taken our business elsewhere.  I spoke with the manager and he refused to take my order. 
My family and I have been loyal customers for many years. We&apos;ve recommended your establishment to our friends and family. This incident was very unfortunate. Now, we are struggling to get someone to make the cake. 
Please understand this situation."
4,"If your looking for authentic pan dulce (Mexican pastries) this is as good a place as any. They also have flan and cakes and you can order custom cakes here.

The good
The variety here is crazy! I haven&apos;t been to a panaderia (mexican bakery) that offered this many things. Everything is super cheap. You can walk out of there with your arms full of pastries and pay less than $10. They also offer fresh baked flour tortillas that are cooked right in front of you in this rotating tortilla cooker. The pan dulce was tasty and of good quality.

The bad
El Bolillo has gotten too big. They have multiple locations and often times when that happens you have an inevitable drop in quality. Their huge variety of things is mostly visual. A lot of their items will look different but taste the same. They use the same dough for multiple pastries so they only alter the way they look. The flour tortillas are not authentic. Looking at the ingredients you can tell they were made industrially but you have the novelty of seeing them cooked in front of you. Their pastries are still tasty but you can find better ones at a more local panaderia.

I wouldn&apos;t return to this location because I have a higher quality panaderia close to my house, however that isn&apos;t to say their pastries are good. They are good and if you have never tried pan dulce you should check them out!"
5,"Little breads are worth the drive. Fresh tortillas are a must. Coconut macaroons are hit and miss...sometimes almost burnt sometimes deliciou.

love el bolillo!"
5,Hands down the best mexican bakery in Houston...prices are cheap and lines go by fast.
5,"This is a hidden gem. I love the Oreo tres leche. It&apos;s unique and amazing. It&apos;s not super sweet nor
Dry. They make fresh tortilla daily here. So many pastries to pick from!"
5,1st time here i like the way they had everything fresh. The price was normal not over priced always a plus. They had so many goodies I would have wanted to try but I gained 5 pounds just with smelling and looking lol. This is a place I will return when I come to H Town.
5,Best mexican bread I have had in Houston. They also sell tortillas and some pretty good cakes for special occasions.
5,"El Bolillo Bakery is a serious treat serving up serious treats. This was a new experience for me but a common experience for those familiar with Mexican culture. Here&apos;s the deal: Grab a large silver serving platter and pick all the pastry&apos;s and breads your heart desires. Grab a warm bag of freshly made tortillas (watch with a amusement as they make them in-house too). Wait in line and convince yourself to take home 2 tres leche cake varieties instead of 3. Go home, be happy. Repeat next weekend. *chefs kiss*"
5,Great selection of &quot;pan dulce&quot;. Lots of people but plenty of bread available. Affordable pricing as well.
5,"Si,Si,Si!  If you love good Latin panitos ,or baked goods, or have not tried this, EB is the place to go!  We were there on Sunday, at 2:30pm,and they were constantly bringing goods out from the ovens. I would suggest going on a weekend if you plan to go later in the day, but any morning will be the same great experience, as well; very fresh products.  Grab a tray and some tongs and shop!  They do make tortillas fresh, as you watch, breads for sandwiches, and SO many goods and  pastries. We chose apple empanadas, conchas, the gingerbread pigs, lightly sugar dusted croissants (Dios Mio!), and Pan Columbiano.  All of this was only $6.60!  Everything was very good, but we especially loved the croissants, pan, and empanadas.
As you enter, look to your right to the open, glass cold case for tres leches, flan and other wonderful treats, individually packaged. Warning: Get your Own, you wont want to share!
They did have some Halloween decorated items, and will have some for each of the coming holidays, as well.
Just the best in H-Town. The line goes quickly, and you must wear a mask inside ,re all Covid safety rules.
Save some of your calories and Wisely spend them at EB this week!"
1,The quality of their bread has really gone downhill. So disappointed as I always looked forward to their soft delicious bread. Will need to find a new bakery :(
4,"This place is like sweet bread heaven. They have a ton of variety of Mexican sweet bread. They also have kolaches, donuts, tortillas and Bolillo (like a hoagie bread). They make custom cakes, you just pre order it.

Parking can be a bit difficult even though people are in and out because so many people go here. Weekdays are probably best for you to grab some pan dulce here. 

Once inside it may seem overwhelming but just walk around the place and see what you may look. Sometimes what&apos;s behind the glass is also on the baking trays they have lined up. 

Good stuff for a pretty cheap price. That&apos;s the downfall none of the stuff is labeled on what it is exactly or how much it cost. We get 8 items for 6 bucks but I&apos;m sure some stuff cost more than other."
4,"What a gem of a find in Houston. I love me a good bakery and so I came here solo to get me some treats. They were a hit!  I brought back the coworkers for some more and they loved it too. I brought the tentative
boyfriend and he thought it was great. Fresh rolls, fresh cake, fresh cookies. The cheese selection was on point and who doesn&apos;t love a Mexican Coke?  Cakes are super affordable and can be pre ordered."
1,"Good bread but the service could improve. Went yesterday Saturday to buy a rosca de Reyes and cashier told me that today Sunday they would be start selling them but she forgot to mention that that would start at 5 pm. So today after mass I was intending to buy the rosca and go out of my way home just to the disappointment that the roscas come out until 5 pm. Not to mention that there is always a lot of people inside the bakery, even with coronavirus. I really think the administrators could do some changes soon. At least I am not coming back. I can get the rosca in many of other good bakeries around Houston, on my way to Tierra Caliente, I can get the rosca right now."
5,"Pros: 
BEST MEXICAN SWEET BREAD IN TEXAS!
Great selection of pastries! 
Extremely affordable (definitely a one $ place)
Friendly staff 
Delicious free smells

Cons:
Parking is a MESS bc it is always POPPIN&apos;

Everyone needs to try this place at least once and pay their respects because it is hands down the best panaderia (mexican bakery) I have ever tried outside of Mexico! I no longer live in Houston but I visit every time I am in town because it&apos;s a family tradition since I was a kid. I grew up on this, and always crave it in Austin. I have lived in multiple cities in Texas and have never found a panaderia with as much variety or as great quality! I always get the following: polvorones, marranitos, all the empanadas, cuernos con queso, mini bolillos, conchas and flan! You honestly can&apos;t go wrong with anything there so don&apos;t be afraid to try one of each if you dare. :P 

The only itty bitty inconvenience at this location is the parking situation bc it&apos;s always poppin&apos;! People love this place and in recent years has gained significant popularity. 

This place will always have a special place in my heart since I have been going to this location since I was little kid. Love coming back with my mom so she can spoil me with all the sweets."
