5,"This is our weekend go-to. All of their pastries are consistently high quality, fresh, and delicious. We also enjoy their seasonal coffee drinks. 

You walk into the restaurant and are greeted with a bright, light-filled space, very large inside and there is a patio outside. There&apos;s a large glass case with pastries, cookies, macarons, other sweets, and cakes. Many different loaves of bread on the back wall as well! Order at the counter Togo or order to eat in. 

Their lunch items are good too and the portions are huge. 

The staff are always friendly and helpful!


By far one of my favorite spots in Houston, and this location specifically is great."
5,"My boyfriend and I came in on a Sunday afternoon. Parking is scarce. To drink we started off with some mimosas.  For our meals we ordered from the weekend brunch, they have a menu for the weekday as well. My boyfriend ordered the bacon and egg flatbread , it was delicious and crispy. It does have a red sauce that was semisweet but still a good pairing for the flatbread. I ended up getting the French toast which was very fluffy and sweet.  They had a wide variety of desserts, will try to come back to taste ! 

Seating is also a scarcity on a Sunday early afternoon. We ended up seating on the patio to enjoy the beautiful day. They are a dog friendly patio.

Overall the staff was friendly and the food was delicious. We will definitely come back!"
5,"HRW FTW!!! So worth and very filling. 
Ordered by calling in a togo order and got the tomato basil soup (hearty &amp; flavorful), CHARCUTERIE BAGUETTE (delicious bread and yummy deli meats/veggies) and the trio macaroons). 2nd order tomato basil soup, Texas club sandwich (toasted bread and yummy deli meats) and the turtle brownie (very rich). They had a designated parking spot for togo/pick ups in the front of the restaurant. And you just call them when you arrive. You can pay ahead through the phone or in person. Would come back for sure for a simple brunch/lunch!"
3,"This place is very cute, but the food is not always amazing. The place itself is really bright and clean, while the customer service is polite and friendly.

I&apos;ve ordered the club sandwich here, which was unfulfilling, one of the least satisfying club sandwiches I&apos;ve ever had. Hard to say what it was about that sandwich... The bread was dry and the filling was lacking in flavor and it was overpriced. Club sandwich is hard to mess up, so I don&apos;t know what happened there. I&apos;ve also tried the various cakes, including a chocolate cherry cheesecake, which looked so gorgeous but it tasted not as great as it looked, although the couple of dark candied cherries they included in that cake were delicious.

I&apos;ve also ordered the croissants, which were actually pretty good, and the drip coffee, which was high quality. So I&apos;d recommend those."
2,"They tell you in their name who they are, so I shouldn&apos;t have been surprised to have a perfectly &quot;common&quot; experience here. 

I always want Common Bond to be better than it is. But every time I come here I leave with a renewed sense of why it&apos;s just better to cook at home. 

This morning I ordered a flatbread. When it arrived it looked delicious. Sadly it was not. Halfway through eating it I literally thought, &quot;Maybe I&apos;ve contracted Covid-19 because I can&apos;t taste anything.&quot; Unfortunately/fortunately I do not have coronavirus and my tastebuds have not betrayed me. What has betrayed me is the chef who is responsible for creating a breakfast pizza void of flavor. It&apos;s actually an accomplishment. I mean, how do you make bacon bland?! 

Largely reminiscent of the BBQ Lean Cuisine pizza, I kept thinking, &quot;I paid twenty bucks for this!! The Lean Cuisine is only 3 bucks and will save me 17 dollars over this insult to flavor.&quot;

I just kept looking for a bottle of Sriracha.....anything to put some modicum of taste on the food. I left without eating a 1/4 of it. 

Common Bond is the place you go when you are stuck in an airport on a long layover. Its easy to forgive airport food because it&apos;s.....airport food. But I&apos;ve had lots of airport food better than it. Common Bond is cutesy and looks appealing but at the end of the day it&apos;s just a place to go to get the job done on your way to whatever is next. For me, it was a trip to McDonalds to get a McGriddle. Although I&apos;ll have cramps for the rest of the day, I&apos;ll at least have tasted something and not feel......common."
4,"Super yummy!! 

Came here for lunch with some friends - the line was pretty long and it was difficult to find seating but overall great experience.

Slightly on the pricey side but very tasty.
The pastry selection is absolutely amazing, everything made my mouth water!
The cranberry orange scone was delightful - the sweet frosting balanced out the crumbly scone.
The Nutella croissant was doused with Nutella (which can be good or bad depending on how you look at it), very heavy but the croissant was truly amazing. 
The brussel sprouts were my Favorite- I can&apos;t wait to go back just for these - they are perfectly roasted and soft. The honey glaze and pancetta pair so well! No one can say that they don&apos;t like brussel sprouts after eating this dish!

Super cute spot to visit, quite busy but worth a stop!"
5,Great location and atmosphere. The Blackford cheesecake was so delicious with my Michael latte.      I will be back here.
3,"Really great atmosphere and croissants, but not much else.

Once you walk in, you&apos;ll be met by a friendly hostess and the scent of butter wafting through the air. Ahhh. It has a modern, cozy, and rustic atmosphere that makes it worth the visit. 
The food itself could use some work. I had a blueberry muffin which was dense and cake-like, a scone that was borderline bread, and biscuits &amp; gravy that were bland and disappointing. The walnut chocolate chip cookie had a good texture, but it wasn&apos;t anything to write home about. A perfectly decent cookie.
The croissant was a different story. You know in Ratatouille when Colette describes fresh bread to Linguini? A &quot;symphony of crackle,&quot; she says. She proceeds to hold the bread up to her ear and give it a gentle squeeze to demonstrate. Biting into the chocolate croissant sounded exactly the same. Flaky layers upon layers of delicate bread surrounding two squeezes of chocolate. 

Overall, it&apos;s worth a visit for their croissants and atmosphere, but I wouldn&apos;t have high expectations for their other items."
4,"Came here for brunch. There was a pretty long line but it was worth it! We got the Chicken and Biscuits, Onion Soup, Truffle Mac N Cheese, and the mushroom goat cheese flatbread. They were all delicious! The flatbread is now one of my favorites. The crew were very friendly and helpful. I love how they had cups of water out by the coffee bar ready to grab. Brilliant idea! I would definitely come again for another brunch!"
5,Came here for breakfast . I wish I could have tried everything as the pastries looked amazing. I got avocado toast and coffee . Quick service and self serve dining . Stellar place !!
5,"I LOVE this location. I&apos;ve dined in at this location and placed multiple orders to go. Each time was a pleasant experience. Today I picked up a Valentine&apos;s Day cake. It was so cute, and tasted delicious. Shout out to Lee for excellent customer service and getting my custom cake. It came in a nice box and was secure driving home. (My previous review was actually for another location that isn&apos;t as good as this one, oops)"
5,"Amazing... everything! Seriously, I was beyond impressed with all of the food items we ordered for brunch as well as the incredible job they do with their branding/packaging. 

A few of the highlights:
Avocado toast: the seeded bread gives you that crunch every time, even if you don&apos;t have a radish in your bite. 

Parmesan fries: perfectly cooked and crispy even with this being a togo order

Bacon/egg flatbread: cheesy with so many yummy toppings

ALL of the pastries! Although I&apos;m sad we didn&apos;t eat the pistachio croissant, I&apos;ve heard so many good things about that 

Yes, this was way too much food for 3 people. We had leftovers but got to enjoy so many different bites of food."
5,"People of the world, if you love sweets, you love art, you love baked goods, you love nice decor, and you love friendly people, they you got to try out Common Bond! Just look at the pictures and you can tell everything is beautiful! We stopped by this place, as we were in the Inner Westheimer district and were overjoyed!! I got soo much food to try and left really happy! Wish I could buy the entire menu to give a critique! Well, I guess that&apos;s why there is next time!! Come out and support them, you will love it. ChowChow Time!!"
5,"Delicious pastries and goodies ! Seasonal pumpkin croissant and apple cider ginger snap cookies, and even spiced apples! They serve alcohol too, beer, and wine. And their coffees are unique and scrumptious too... we got a lavender latte :) 

The flatbreads are so big and delicious. We got the mushroom and goat cheese. 

Will definitely be back for more!"
5,"Normally I don&apos;t frequent Common Bond because while I do really like their pastries and food, it can get expensive since everything is so tempting and prices add up (think ~$4 for a croissant). That being said, I recently found out a game changer that will definitely have me coming back more often!!:

Every day, 1 hour before closing, their pastries will be 1/2 off!! This was seriously game changing because I love their pastries and breads so much but can&apos;t afford to get $4 croissants that often. I went in a couple days ago ~45 min before closing and got a pistachio croissant, butter croissant, almond croissant, Boston creme, walnut choco chip cookie, apple cider ginger snap cookie, and a whole loaf of bread - everything all together came to a total price of ~$16 which is seriously seriously a steal for this place. Their croissants are huge and so buttery and airy - so worth it. Also their Apple cider ginger snap cookie is maybe one of the best cookies I&apos;ve ever had- it&apos;s super chewy and pillowy with the perfect balance of spice and sweetness. And their bread!!! A WHOLE loaf of multigrain for $2.50 you seriously can&apos;t beat that kind of quality with that price. Highly recommend. If you come the hour before closing, come early because I got the last pistachio croissant and Boston creme that day so if you come earlier there may be a bigger selection. 

However not all of their desserts are on sale- the tarts, macarons, and cakes are still full price. Previously when I had gotten the cakes and macarons, I thought the cake was a little too sweet and the macarons were ok for their price. Their pastries are really where the good stuff is in my opinion. 

Definitely recommend here if you want to get a great croissant and some great bread!! 

In terms of parking, they have a lot right next to their door. However I&apos;ve had problems finding a spot there during peak brunch hours. When I went there around 8pm though, I had no problem finding parking"
5,"I had their tomato and ricotta flatbread and I loved it!! It had lots of veggies and the balsamic vinegar really ties it all together. 

Common Bond is known for their varied of pastries. Their chocolate and butter croissants are super flaky. The Kouign Amann has a crunchy sugared outer layer whilst being soft and somewhat flaky inside. The blueberries muffin is somewhat pedestrian but it does have a sweet aftertaste to it."
4,Common Bond will always have a special place in my heart. It&apos;s got some tasty pastries that I love. Always a sure way to make someone&apos;s morning. I think the pastries are the best thing that the bakery has to offer. Food has always been just okay for me. The montrose location is my fave.
4,"Supporting one of my favorite local restaurants. 

I usually come here for dessert but I&apos;ve been on a &quot;fry hunt&quot; looking for the best fries in town and had to order the Truffle Parmesan Fries to give them a try. 

The Parmesan and truffle were very apparent which I loved. My only complaint would be that they were a little too greasy for me. 

I&apos;ll be back for more of their delicious cakes and pastries"
5,Cute little gem that always hits the spot! I always order the almond croissant and the tomato basil soup! I always park at the additional parking spaces one street down.
5,This place is my go to spot for Birthday desserts in a pinch! They are nicely priced and people absolutely love the high end look of the personal size dessert.
