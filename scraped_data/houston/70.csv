4,"Love it!!!! 

 The check in was fast and friendly!

My only problem was a spot was on the toilet but I had Clorox wipes to clean the room ... otherwise the room was clean AND vacuumed!! 

The beds were very comfortable... we didn&apos;t want to get up!

Parking: the first night I did self park... never again lol I hated walking to the parking garage. The next day I did valet parking and it is was amazing!  

We had a view of the Minute Maid stadium which was beautiful both day and night. We slept with the curtains open... 

Angelina was our housekeeper and she was very sweet and friendly!!! 

Downside... no microwave in the room.... the drink that we paid $3 for out the machine was hot... the toilet stopped up- but the repair man came right up when I called."
5,"Possibly the nicest gym I&apos;ve been to at any Marquise, this gym is world class and on par with JW Marriott Marquise Miami. Check out my vid. 

Everything you need, they got you cover. After 6.5 months of not going to an actual gym, I always make sure I stay at a hotel with a nice gym to get my work out done.

I&apos;m glad I moved from the Hotel Icon Houston here just for the gym.

Our room has a nice pool view and cabanas, the pool lit up at night. 

Comfy bed, typical layout for Marriott Marquise, good amenities and good lobby restaurant. 

The staffs kept the place spotless, wear mask, gloves for cleaning staffs, social-distancing enforces here. We felt very safe here.

We will definitely return here if we are in town again. This hotel lives up to the Marquise Marriott Bonvoy par!"
5,"It&apos;s a must go spot!!!! Hubby n I go every year for our Anny! From the service, to the lazy river and the sexy cabanas; it&apos;s the best spot to get that sexy back! We always would do breakfast the next day at Walker Street Market but I believe their still closed due to Covid. If you&apos;re in town, you&apos;d love it! Oh the bar connected to the hotel is dope too! Drinks were nice and they do a good job at social distancing!"
3,"I have never stayed at this hotel (although I wish I could afford it. Looked up prices the rooms range between $250-$350 per night) THIS REVIEW IS JUST FOR THE TEXAS WINTER LIGHTS EVENT
My son and I came here for their Texas Winter Lights event (open to the public Monday through Thursday evening) THIS IS A PAID EVENT (Adults $15 Kids 2-6 pay $5) You get to enjoy their heated Texas shaped pool, watch a movie by the fire and enjoy games and play areas for kids.
The hotel interior is beautiful and clean. All guests plus staff were wearing masks! On the particular night we went it was a bit cold (mid to low 60s) with a breeze so would have been nice if they offered hot chocolate or coffee for the kids and guests. 
The pool was not at all heated I didn&apos;t get in but my son enjoyed it! They have tubes you can use to float in the pool. We wanted to go in the hot tub/jacuzzi but there was literally about 20 people crowded in a small hot tub. No thanks we passed on that. Overall the event was nice to swim and enjoy the downtown scenery at night, very beautiful!"
1,"Very sad!

I was super excited to hear that Grinch was playing at the most prominent hotel in Houston, Texas. The host at the front desk was extremely rude and biased. I felt as if I don&apos;t even belong inside their hotel. My friend and I have been pushed aside while he attended to the other customers around me. The 6th floor contained the amazing beautiful pool of Texas. My friend and I were distraught that the movie screen was extremely small with limited seating. The movie only played on one side of the pool and we had nowhere to sit. We walked around to find available seating to enjoy the movie but it was pointless. Another family of 6 was disappointed just like me and we ALL left after less than 10 minutes. I will NEVER step foot inside this hotel ever again. Please work on your customer service. I lost money for the movie and parking. Terrible experience!"
1,"I am extremely disappointed with this locations management, a few months ago I stayed here and enjoyed it up until I see 2 valet charges on my account, keep in mind I&apos;m visiting and don&apos;t have a car here in Houston. I spoke with a employee and for weeks they keep telling me a manager will reach out that never happened. I need my money back I refuse to pay two valet charges that were wrongfully put on my account."
5,The Staff at the Marriott were so nice and wonderful. My husband and I spent our 1 year anniversary there this weekend and they upgraded us to the hospitality suite free of charge. Definitely can&apos;t wait to go back in the summer to hangout by their pool. Highly recommend
3,"I did two staycations here over the summer. One for a romantic weekend and the other for a weekend with my kids. 

Of course, the lazy river is the highlight of the Marquis. And with that being said, we thoroughly enjoyed and spent most of the day in the pool/lazy river and relaxing poolside. Also, the bartenders and other staff working the terrace were friendly and helpful. Drinks and food are on the pricey side, but I did notice that the pours weren&apos;t so bad (at least in my situation). 

My only complaint is that it does get rowdy on the floors at night after the pool closes. One night, there was a tremendous amount of &quot;ratchetness&quot; taking place in the hall outside of our room. 

Other than, I like the Marquis."
1,"Absolutely the worst experience and I would never stay at another Marriott ever again. 
First off, the rooms are not being maintained and cleaned correctly. The water on the bar had been opened, obviously the room is not cleaned or sanitized correctly or they would have put fresh water in the room
The second thing is the whole floor and elevator smelled like marijuana. I don&apos;t know what floor it was coming from or from where but man the small was so over powering I was dizzy. 

The third thing is that there is no place to get a beverage of any kind , if the bottled water is tainted there is nothing to drink but tap water ,  also the 1 bottled water that is in your room is $5. I would have paid it if the bottle had not already been opened and the seal broken. I did not know we would need to bring something to drink with us to a hotel. This specifically pertains to the evenings after the restaurant and cafe are closed. The vending machines are not functional and when I asked at the front seat they said they have not been refilled due to COVID. 
I will say Katrina saved the day at 6 am by getting me a Pepsi and Dr.Pepper from the back. I am super grateful and appreciative of  that. 

The beds are hard , the pillows are too soft and have no support sleeping is impossible.

Also the amount of homeless people that harass you as you step off the property is scary and very detracting.

The final straw was the valet. We paid over $50 to valet our vehicle and then when we went to go get it at the end of our stay it was almost an hour wait. Absolutely unacceptable. We are use to staying at upscale resorts and this was our first and last Marriott stay. 
It was my birthday weekend and what a let down for my husband who went out of his way to plan the event. 

Such a shame , poorly done Marriott"
2,"I visited here for my  birthday 11/11 and the only positive is the visual of the pool. From the moment I walked in I was dissapointed, first with the greeting from a taller slim black man who didnt say hello at front desk and when checking in didnt advise charges just put paper down to sign. The room is not what you pay for, it is super basic and not impressive, from the bathroom to the fact there is no microwave. Most restaurants are not open including the bar, and as others stated the parking situation is very inconvenient and not worth the headache. Maybe they can demand higher prices when there is a game day or events but during covid it just is not worth the price. Take your money elsewhere."
1,Worst hotel I&apos;ve ever encountered. I live in Houston and temps are 18. I have no heat nothing. I took both shih tzus to the Marriott for safe keeping over this strom. I have documentation stating they are ESA animals. I was turned away. I am a corporate event planner in addition so I will never do business with a Marriott property again. Not to mention the illegal nature of my experience. The ADA will certainly like to hear of my experience. Best to you.
5,"Gotta luv that lazy river, wish my grandkids were with me, not really but they would of enjoyed it a lot. 
The room was big and clean and the bar downstairs served good food."
4,"The hotel is nice but big - it feels Loose - 
The lazy river in the pool fun and just chill with couple of beers 
The gym is good - and the room is good - 
The staff were really nice but There is something missing."
3,"Don&apos;t get me wrong. The room was clean and comfortable, the service stellar and the view was to kill for.

But I don&apos;t  know what it is about up scale hotels. The more you pay, the more impractical their bathrooms are and the less you get. 

The room has just a shower and no bath tub. No problem.

But the shower head is about 7 feet off the ground and if you are a shorter person you won&apos;t be able to reach and adjust it.

Also, you can&apos;t turn the water on without getting wet. (The door opens in, on the side opposite the faucet.)

Another also. The towel rack is on this door that opens in the shower, so your towel will get wet when you open the door. Why not put it on the other door so it doesn&apos;t get wet???? 

Another also: They have no special fan. So after you shower, the mirrors are completely fogged over. And if you stink up the place, it won&apos;t be safe for a while.

In addition, they have the toilet paper roll on the back wall so you need to be a contortionist in order to reach it. Because of the angle, ir rIpped prematurely every time. I feel really sorry for those that don&apos;t have full mobility. In addition, the TP always unravels and ends up on the floor and in the garbage can (Yuck!)!

In addition, the bathroom has poor lighting. I usually shave in the shower, but then look in the mirror if I missed any spots, but I couldn&apos;t, because I couldn&apos;t see, because the lighting was so poor.

I also think charging $14.95 per day for internet unless you join their loyalty program is atrocious. 

You are already paying $200 per day plus  and they want to charge extra for internet? Are you kidding me? And no free breakfast either.

I just don&apos;t get it. The more you pay, the less you get."
1,"Ok, I&apos;m not going to tell you not to stay here; but if you do stay here, I want to offer some helpful advice, especially regarding bedbugs.

- Small, rust-colored blood stains. My son chose the bed with these, so I didn&apos;t notice until after the second day when I made his bed. He sometimes has nosebleeds, and even though his nosebleeds usually don&apos;t leave stains that look like that, I dismissed it. Welp, that was a bad move. This was blood from bedbugs FEEDING on him; or perhaps it was from bedbugs feeding on the previous guests, and the sheets weren&apos;t changed. Neither option would surprise me.

- General filth and poor customer service. I just got a bad feeling from this hotel, and my wife kept telling me she wanted to pack up and leave. I didn&apos;t want to because we paid $750 for a mediocre room for two nights. My wife&apos;s feelings seemed irrational to her because She couldn&apos;t put my finger on what felt so icky. My wife used sanitizing spray on all the surfaces, and that made her feel better, but it shouldn&apos;t have. Now, I will listen to her gut. If a place just feels dirty, I will at least check for bedbugs! And I will probably leave no matter what.

- Bedbugs look like small ticks. How do I know this? Because I saw one. SMH. It was dead, and I literally just thought my son brought it in on his shoes because we&apos;d been walking outside that day. No, no, no! I didn&apos;t know what a bedbug looked like, but now I have totally researched the heck out of them, and I know I saw one.

- Even if you don&apos;t think your room had bedbugs, it takes a while for the bites to show up. So don&apos;t bring your stuff back into your home without immediately washing it on the highest temperature setting. What happens if you bring it in your home? Disaster. You have a huge effing disaster on your hands. 

So, in sum, poor customer service, filth, bedbugs, super expensive... was there anything good about this hotel? Yes, if you have a child, the pool is a great place to teach anatomy and physiology. There&apos;s apparently no dress code, and the place is essentially a club, visible butt cheeks required. I&apos;m not a prude, but would it be too much to have a kid-friendly/no-grinding/no-lap-dancing area?"
3,"Go for the pool scene, and ignore &quot;reserved&quot; seating. I&apos;m changing my rating criteria to reflect The New Normal. No stars lost for lousy restaurant service at the pool, or any closed services, or even the fact it was a hassle leaving the parking garage. The room decor for our 14th floor, Corner King suite was reminiscent of Hotel 6!?! The AC would blast on for a few seconds, effectively waking me up, then settle down and wind off. Really missed my earplugs, but never expected this in a new hotel. Desk had no USB ports: all on one side of the bed with Alarm Clock"
5,"2 words: lazy river...

...in the shape of Texas!!

Everything is bigger (and better) in Texas(?) This Marriott is great - nice staff, excellent M Club lounge, pretty nice rooms. I&apos;ve never had a problem there - not with noise, cleaniness or sleep quality. What more could you ask for. Theres decent food choices near by and a pretty park across the street to run or walk around."
3,"When the Marquis first opened, the food wasn&apos;t very good. Fast forward to 2020, and the food is much better. I attended a conference there early in the year. They served us breakfast and lunch, and it was all tasty. The food was hot, fresh, and well seasoned. Definitely worth a try."
2,"I&apos;ve been coming here at least once or twice a year for staycation with friends since my initial reviews and it feels like every time I come back, I keep getting more and more disappointed. Although some of the disappointments are not necessarily the hotel&apos;s fault, they still affected my stay. So let&apos;s get to it.

Wristbands: The last time I checked in here, I was told that I could only get THREE wristbands instead the usual four. I&apos;ve always been a gold Marriott/Bonvoy member so I always ask for an upgrade if it&apos;s available (it usually is). However, with an upgraded room (usually available in king size only), they would only provide three wristbands vs the usual four. So I guess no more asking for upgrades for me in the future.

Perks: Ever since Marriott and SPG merged and they officially changed their loyalty program&apos;s name to Bonvoy, many perks have been taken away from gold members. The two perks they took away that I care about the most are access to the lounge (only for platinum and up); and I only get late check out through 2 pm (it used to be 4 pm but that&apos;s now only given to platinum members and up). 

Hospitality: Gone are the days when the front desk staff used to be super friendly. The last couple of times I stayed here, the staff who checked me in just looked like they&apos;d had enough of dealing with hotel guests and just didn&apos;t want to anymore, except that they had to. 
I get it: the hotel&apos;s always super packed because everybody wants to stay at the hotel to enjoy the pool deck, but that doesn&apos;t mean you shouldn&apos;t still be friendly. At the very least what you can do is fake it.

Pool Deck: Still about the same - super crowded and overrun with kids on Saturdays and more quiet on Sundays. There are hotel staff/security walking around the area to make sure people behave and they&apos;re checking on wristbands. However, they will not kick the kids out the infinity pool past 6 pm when it&apos;s supposed to be kids-free zone. You&apos;ll find kids in the infinity pool and the hot tub. 

You want drinks or food? You&apos;re better off ordering at the bar instead of waiting for your server because they will take forever to come to you. Not necessarily their fault because the pool deck is crowded, but it&apos;s just way too slow.

Another thing they did that irked me is they closed off a major section on the pool deck and called it &quot;Back of the Park&quot; area and they charge you, I think $15 to be in that area. So management decided to make finding loungers, which is already a challenging process, even more challenging.

Will I still come back here? Sure since the pool deck is still a lot of fun. But that doesn&apos;t mean I&apos;m not disappointed with how much they&apos;ve taken away since the first time I stayed here."
5,I stayed twice here during COVID and I enjoyed my stay at this beautiful hotel the staff was friendly and courteous.  Very clean and nice hotel although all the amenities were unavailable at the time but that&apos;s expected due to COVID so no complaints there.  The pool was nice and ordering food and drinks pool side was seamless.  Just a bit of information the valet parking is a bit pricey I&apos;m talking $53 a day for anything over 6 hours.
