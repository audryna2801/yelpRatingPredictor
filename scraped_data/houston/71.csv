5,"Any organization that truly lives their mission is a WIN in my book. Even though this is only my 2nd time there... I am always recommending as a must-go coffee shop. 

My first time was pre-COVID so I arrived with my backpack in tow to do some work. But of course (for very good reason) the indoor seating is replaced with covered outdoor seating - so my shoulder got no relief, but I ain&apos;t trippin! 

I visited today (in the midst of Texas just foregoing all rules of engagement - shutting off power and water) and they were open with FREE COFFEE, FREE SOUP, FREE CHOCOLATES! I mean - just awesome. And again, because TX is just on another wave, there was drinkable and potable water available for anyone who needs. 

If you don&apos;t know, a 2nd cup exits to eradicate human trafficking (through awareness, action and survivor support). They do this SO well - you come in for coffee and get educated - YES! Everywhere you look you are reminded of their mission. 

So I&apos;ll be doing a Round 2 but needed to leave this here. You are able to see the true measure of an establishment (in this case) in times of crisis, and A 2nd Cup comes all the way through. It&apos;s not just about goooood coffee but a great conversation starter to an issue that very silently plagues the world."
5,"I first want to give a shout out to the owners of this establishment. Houston has a major problem with Covid 19. With many not following recommended guidelines of the CDC, cases continue to rise. I was very happy to see that the entire coffee shop was closed down to dine in customers. Everyone was wearing a mask and the cashier wiped down every surface after every customer. I felt very safe and I thank you for keeping my safety and health a top priority. Now on to the coffee. 

I order a cappuccino and it was perfect. The coffee is smooth and they followed the correct portions for milk. I typically find coffee shops serving me lattes instead of cappuccinos because they do not property measure portions. The coffee was great tasting and smooth. No need for sugar. 

I also ordered an egg and potato taco and it was very delicious. Nothing over processed or fake about it. I also appreciate the normal portion size :) 

Will def be back soon"
5,"Second cup is one of the best coffee shops in Houston. Love the mission of supporting survivors of human trafficking, and the food and coffee are great. Pre covid I would work from here all the time! Sweet Toff is where it&apos;s at."
5,"Now more than ever it is important to support local businesses, but a 2nd Cup deserves extra support due to their mission of helping eliminate human trafficking. Dine out and do good! 

First things first - this place has a ton of parking! How rare in this area. Once you walk into the shop you are welcomed by a warm atmosphere filled with aromatic coffee plus unique gifts you can purchase to help support underserved communities. I also love the menu here, lots of fun flavored drinks, pastries, and breakfast items. I went with the iced mint mocha - definitely recommend for my fellow chocolate mint lovers! It was the perfect blend of coffee and sweet. I can&apos;t wait to come back and try some other items here!"
3,"Flat white.
Vanilla latte.


Vanilla latte. Felt too... Light. No flavor.

Flat white should have felt stronger. But it was very smooth. 

Overall. Not that impressed."
5,The atmosphere is amazing and the cause behind the business is amazing as well.  They help end human trafficking and also will work with victims and train them in the hospitality business and give them skills as well as jobs to help with the recovery process!  Plus everything&apos;s tastes yummy!!  Make sure to stop by and grab a coffee or snack and support to end human trafficking!!!
4,"The drip isn&apos;t very good, so if you&apos;re looking for great drip coffee, I wouldn&apos;t recommend here. The food also isn&apos;t that great. It mostly seems pre-made. I&apos;m not even sure if they have a real kitchen. 

The tables were rearranged to offer more seating which is nice because it was always really hard to find seating. 

I still think this is a great place with awesome, sweet drinks, some good espresso, and good pastries. It just needs better drip in my opinion.


I think A 2nd Cup deserves a 4.5. They have one of the best spaces to work, good hours, a great mission, decent parking, and some of the best sweeter coffee drinks. They just need solid drip coffee and maybe more pastries because they&apos;re always almost out."
5,"Coffee is so delicious, had the sweet toff iced with almond milk and it was so smooth and not too sweet. Want to try the horchata latte next. Service was fast and friendly. They also have cute things for sale inside."
5,"Their lattes are amazing! I am not usually a sweet coffee person, but if I&apos;m in the mood for a sweet drink, I like to get their Red Baron, which is Raspberry. Their food menu looks great, but I&apos;ve never had any. 

The atmosphere is more study heavy than social. They also have different community events and info on their store. If I am not mistaken their mission is to prevent and raise awareness of human trafficking."
5,"A 2nd Cup is an open lay out coffee spot with plenty of seating and outlets. If you want to have a group meeting or work time, this is an excellent space for collaboration!

They have creative and tasty coffee options. I have tried their seasonal flavors like lavender and pumpkin. They did not disappoint.

I regularly get their Coconut Coffee one or their mint one.

I also love that 2nd Cup is connected and invested in the community. They support several local organizations and sometimes have free yoga! 

Awesome spot!"
5,"Delicious food, good coffee, excellent service and a very worthy cause. The vibe is so laid back. You will see hipsters, professionals and moms with babies. Support this business which supports an end to human trafficking!"
5,"A great coffee house in The Heights area of Houston. Food is a little pricey, but I also have to acknowledge how polite and friendly the staff are. They are also very helpful when trying to decide what you want. Next time I go there I&apos;m gong to have to try the chocolate chip cookies I hear they&apos;re pretty good. 

Even with how much seating this facility has it&apos;s almost always near full whenever I walk in. And almost always the noise is still kept at a minimum for such a packed coffee shop. It&apos;s nice. 

As for my options I went in and got some Cold Brew, along with their avocado and toast. The cashier asked me if I would like to add either bacon or fried egg to it and in my excitement of hearing about breakfast food (because I love breakfast food) my stomach answered her for me and yelled out &quot;both.&quot; 

That&apos;s probably why my bill for just a coffee and some toast ended up being $16. Something still hard for me to justify. To any sane human being I would think that&apos;s grounds for at least a one star deduction but my stomach tends to make financially reckless food decisions before my brain could process. It really wasn&apos;t their fault I could&apos;ve said no. But I don&apos;t say no to breakfast food. 

No regrets, it was delicious and basically an entire meal in itself."
4,"Why wouldn&apos;t you want to enjoy a cup of coffee while helping fight against human trafficking? Can&apos;t beat that! Not only was my Matcha Latte tasty but it made me feel good that some of the proceeds help with human trafficking. The day I visited it was nice &amp; quiet with plenty of seating. Perfect place to go if you want to get some work done.  Disclaimer: I am not a coffee head but I definitely enjoyed my latte (I am a latte girl, just give me my sugar please) :-)"
5,"One of my top coffee spots in Houston. It&apos;s got the whole package - delicious coffee options, spacious seating, outlets, high ceilings, great service, and it never gets too noisy. 

I&apos;ve tried the Mochanut, Duke of York, and Red Baron and really loved all three, but my go-to would be an iced Duke of York. The minty-ness makes it all the more refreshing. 

I&apos;d say it&apos;s not an ideal spot to catch up with a friend, as the wide tables make it more conducive to study or group work. 

Give it a try and support a great cause!"
5,Pricey but worth every penny! The breakfast croissants as beyond perfect. It&apos;s so worth every penny. Which by the way the money helps end human trafficking. Winning!!! Got a mocha latte with heavy cream and it was perfection. I&apos;m in love with restaurant. Great little gift shop as well!
5,"It&apos;s gets so busy here! But for a reason, it&apos;s very big and an amazing place to study in! I believe it gets busy because there is a high school in front of the cafe so there is a good mixture of people inside the cafe. The food is great, I always order a croissant sandwich and I am well satisfied and happy while I am there studying."
5,"Really nice vibe in here in terms of decoration, service and what the shop stands for. This coffee joint focuses on raising awareness for human trafficking in Houston, which I think is awesome. There&apos;s even a little shop here where you can purchase items to support the cause. There are lots of  parking spots in the lot. This is also a great place to study as is it spacious and there is lots of seating. I didn&apos;t see too many outlets around though. Came in the afternoon of A holiday and it was pretty packed but I still saw some open seats. There were a lot of people studying on their laptops and some catching up with friends. I got the iced chai latte here and it&apos;s great! There is a rewards program as well. Will be coming back soon for sure."
4,"I learned about A 2nd Cup at a Nonprofit Board Connection Fair that was held by United Way of Greater Houston. The lady that I met was introducing herself to individuals at the fair and providing info about the coffee shop and their mission. She also gave me a 10% off coupon to enjoy--cant wait to use it because I did not utilize it yesterday. I met up with my now colleague and old professor/coordinator for breakfast/coffee.

I enjoyed the veggie taco and a macchiato while my colleague enjoyed avocado toast and an iced coffee. The ambiance is very chill and there were many individuals there studying and/chatting. The food was really, really good. I will definitely return. I love the cause and I appreciated the cleanliness. 

Parking was a little tricky at first, but I ended up finding a spot directly in the front of the shop shortly after someone left."
5,The mocha nut! Such a good drink. I love supporting this place due to all the details inside about supporting great causes. Also you can rent space and its very cozy inside if you need to study or get work done.
5,"I love the iced mochanut, breakfast sandwich on a croissant and they have an amazing chocolate chip cookie. All of it supports a great cause"
