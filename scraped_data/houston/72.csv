5,"Stumbled upon this place while browsing Yelp, and I&apos;m glad I found it!

There is a small parking lot behind Uchi, and this place is only takeout only at this time. You enter in the side door, place your order, then wait outside until they bring out your prepared drink. 

I had a latte with a but of their spiced honey butter and almond milk, and it was nice! It was very smooth, not too sweet, and the &quot;spiced&quot; part of the honey butter wasn&apos;t too spicy. The girl at the counter was very friendly as well! Will return!"
5,Fantastic coffee and they are handling Covid very well. They actually have their own roasting capabilities so all the beans are very fresh and it would be a great place to pick up some beans if you make coffee at home. They do have some outdoor seating currently but no indoor seating. I also tried the chocolate flavoring which tasted like a mocha as opposed to just some fake flavoring
5,"This place is an absolute win!!! I was looking for a quiet place close to Mid-town to get some work done and stumbled upon this gem. The inside is pretty cozy and inviting. The place is not too rowdy, but had a steady flow of customers coming in for their caffeine fix and there&apos;s a beautiful patio off to the side to enjoy if it&apos;s nice out. They also had a variety of coffee. I was there for a while so started with the sumatra espresso in a cortado and had a Yemeni espresso in an Americano to go (which was super cool for me as I&apos;d never tried espresso from Yemen). The baristas were so friendly and such a delight to talk about coffee and other things with and I had a great experience. I will definitely be back when I return to Houston!"
5,"This is one of my favorite coffee shops in Houston! The coffee is consistently good, and the flavors are even better. All of their syrups are homemade, including their unique honey butter and some seasonals. My go-to is the caramel or vanilla latte, and on my most recent visit, I tried the dirty chai. It wasn&apos;t watered down and tasted great. If your coffee preference leans more toward sweet and creamy, then I would definitely recommend this place! It&apos;s unassuming and down to earth and has all the makings of an intimate coffee shop with a great location right off of Westheimer."
5,"My favorite coffee in Houston. Lattes and cold brew are consistently awesome. They sell Fusion beans, which are also great. Very friendly baristas."
5,Southside Espresso was a quaint little spot tucked right off the main drag. The customer service was excellent and answered all our questions and we had a lot lol! We order a couple of double espresso and two excellent hot teas and these were not brought out in paper cups no they were brought out in actual espresso cups and the teas in the beautiful cast tea pots that just made the experience that much better for us! This place was recommended to me by a dear friend and am so glad we popped in! I highly recommend this place!
4,"Another gem of a coffee house. I love the eclectic interior coupled with the baristas that are committed to their craft. Having a hard time deciding what to get? Pick a seasonal flavor from their list and ask the barista what it goes best with; mine hooked me up with a mint chocolate latte. Yes, it was as great as it sounds. 

Parking is available in a small lot just off Westheimer during the day before Uchi&apos;s valet kicks  in. Otherwise, street parking is your friend."
5,"I came here on a Saturday morning for my daily coffee and breakfast.  There is a huge parking lot that they share with uchi and rosemont.  I&apos;ve heard that the parking might be valet at night but that wasn&apos;t my experience in the morning.  Anyway, plenty of free parking.  The interior is nice, hip, but small.  There are some smal tables and chairs for sitting but wouldn&apos;t recommend doing a hardcore study session here due to the limited sitting and lack of electrical outlets for laptops.  It&apos;s dog friendly though and there&apos;s a lot of outdoor seating areas.  It would be a good place to meet up with a small group of friends or date.

I ordered the strawberries and cream danish, which was delish and latte with honey butter syrup.  Very tasty and unique flavor for the traditional latte.

Will definitely return!"
4,"Great service, delicious coffee. We had the French press house blend good smooth flavors and the Fire Side Latte which was sweet, creamy and delicious. The marshmallow is roasted to perfection crispy on the outside and soft/gooey in the middle"
5,"The atmosphere, baristas, location and, most importantly, the coffee are excellent! This is definitely one of the top coffee shops around here. The place is small, but cozy. Some seating inside and out, but not much."
3,"Small quaint coffee shop that doesn&apos;t have enough seating. The coffee shop is more for people to take their drinks to go. You can definitely buy coffee and walk around the cute neighborhood.

My husband loves going here because he enjoys their coffee. He drinks cold brews and black coffee. He said they are just right here. I&apos;ve tried their latte and it was okay. It was a bit too strong for my taste.


The customer service was not the best. I&apos;ve definitely experienced better. The tone of the cashier seemed like she wasn&apos;t happy being at work. It was a bit negative/tired. She didn&apos;t make an effort to smile or make small chat. 


Good coffee but not a great place with customer service."
5,Shoutout to the best coffee in Houston. This is the one shop that never fails in consistency.  Support Southside!
5,"Good fresh coffee &amp; chocolate croissants! Friendly, prompt service &amp; very quick wait time. Perfect place to stop this rainy Houston morning. I parked in the back lot shared with Uchi. Easy peasy."
5,Great drinks and awesome selection of whole bean coffee
4,"Cute little coffeeshop in the Montrose area. Very chill and relaxing atmosphere. The coffee is always great and the employees are super friendly. It&apos;s a tiny space so there&apos;s limited seating. If you do decide to lounge around, there&apos;s free wifi to get some work done (or, you know, browse Facebook).

The parking situation isn&apos;t the best. I usually try to find a nearby spot on the street which can be quick or I end up circling around for 15 minutes."
5,"Easily one of my favorite coffee and tea spots in all of Houston. The staff here is exceptional, and I&apos;m a tea drinker and they have a great selection and even brew the tea for you in a teapot and give you the pot to keep on drinking. Today, I ordered a Peppermint Tea and spiced it up with a little bit of honey, which they have on supply on the counter. Nestled in the heart of Houston&apos;s Montrose District, this is definitely a great place to stop as you walk on a coffee tour of the city. Also a great, quiet place to study or grab a bite before heading over to one of my favorite creative Sushi joints Uchi next door. Thanks Southside! You guys rock."
5,My new favorite coffee shop! The drink selection is amazing! The drink was made perfectly! AND the baristas definitely set the tone. Great folks! An amazing atmosphere. Oh...&amp; there&apos;s fun dip!!!!!!
5,I consider myself lucky this is my local coffee spot. DO NOT underestimate the power adding the honey butter to your iced oatmilk latte.
4,"Southside Espresso is simply divine.

My husband and I came here on a Sunday afternoon and we both ordered a Vanilla Latte, although mine had almond milk and his had whole milk. From my husband&apos;s expression at first sip, I&apos;m pretty sure he loved his latte as much as I did. My Vanilla Latte W/ Almond Milk was so rich and creamy, in a heavenly way. It was so amazing and definitely ranked in our top three places for a latte in Houston. The baristas here are so nice and friendly and the interior of the shop is very cozy, but a little relaxed and hipster. There are a few tables, so it&apos;s a great place to do some work or study or catch up with friends.

Southside Espresso is basically attached to Uchi in the back. Finding parking was definitely ROUGH. We could not find parking anywhere on the streets and eventually gave in to valet parking. We felt ridiculous. Who has to valet to get some coffee? It&apos;s not even this bad in San Francisco OR Los Angeles. Hence, minus the one star. Would love to come back though, just wish the parking situation was a little better!"
5,"I stopped by here for the first time today to get some studying done and am so far, loving my experience. Right when I came in, I was able to find a table and an outlet and was greeted by the baristas who were extremely helpful in letting me know their recommendations. I ended up with the lavender latte and it is honestly one of the better tasting lavender drinks that I have been able to try in Houston! The vibe and the drinks as well as the location make it easy for me to rate Southside Espresso 5 stars. The only downside is that parking in the lot behind the cafe may get tricky during peak hours. Overall, it&apos;s worth a visit, it definitely lifted my mood!"
