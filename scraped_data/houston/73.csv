5,"Love this place. I eat here all the time. The sliders are my favorite! I always get the cowboy slider. You can&apos;t go wrong with beef, bacon, haystack onions and bbq sauce! 

This place is a 2 for 1 stop. Downstairs is a grab and go market with fresh food cooked daily. You can get sandwiches, breads, cheeses, jams, sauces, baked goods, salads to go and more. Don&apos;t skip the counter! There you will find all your homemade favorite foods to take home for dinner like meatloaf, Brussel sprouts, roasted potatoes, pastas etc...

Upstairs is a full dining room and bar. Note: you can order food from the restaurant menu downstairs if you prefer to sit on the outside patio. They are also dog friendly. 

A huge plus is that they are open for Breakfast during the week! They have a bacon, egg and cheese biscuit that will blow your hair back! It comes with bacon jam! Yum! 

Must Gets are:
Bacon breakfast biscuit 
3 Pig Mac &amp; Cheese 
Cowboy sliders with Not so standard fries 
The Cobb wedge salad 


Bonus: They also have art on the wall that changes frequently and available for purchase."
5,"This was my first time at this restaurant. I loved the menu selection. The portions are generous and shareable.  You can pick items a la cart or dinner plates.  I had the ahi tuna dinner plate. My mother joined me and had the pot roast dinner plate.  The sides are delicious! For a starter, we had the monkey bread with artichoke dip. Yum!  

You may be wondering about social distancing. We arrived on a Thursday at around 6.  We were at least one table away from the closest table. It wasn&apos;t crowded and they have outdoor seating as well. You can also do pick up."
5,"Urban Eats is truly a hidden gem! I&apos;ve been convincing my foodie boyfriend to try out new places close to our house, and this cute little spot really impressed him. Inside, there is a little section for selling various food items (like jams and such), and it has a nice coffee house vibe with a counter for ordering. On the outside, they have a spacious patio surrounded by pretty foliage. There&apos;s also an upstairs bar and rooftop patio! Ambiance wise, this place has it all. The food is honestly the best part though! I&apos;d recommend a carafe of mimosas, the deviled egg starter and the monkey bread with artichoke dip (YUM!). Overall, I&apos;m excited to go back and try the unique looking cocktails and entrees!"
5,"One of the best brunch spots in Houston! Came here on a Saturday morning near noon with my girlfriend for some mimosas and a highly anticipated delicious brunch. The only downside of it was finding parking, but we ended up getting lucky our third time around and found parking right in front of the restaurant entrance. Perfect timing and third time&apos;s the charm, right?

After finally finding parking, my girlfriend and I finally entered the restaurant - which is on the second floor of the building. The first floor is the bakery and coffee shop (which, unfortunately, I did not get an opportunity to try, but there is always next time). We were seated fairly quickly since we chose to not wait and sit inside rather than wait on a table available on the outside - we were hungry.

We got seated and ordered our drinks - I ordered a matcha latte and my friend ordered a mimosa. The matcha latte was delicious for sure. We originally intended to go for the lunch HRW menu, but we were really craving some good brunch instead. I ordered the biscuit flight, which was a basket to keep the biscuits warm, and it came with 4 different spreads. The biscuits were also different, as well. It was really delicious, especially if you want a carb overload. My friend ordered the Urban Breakfast with which it included a lot; the usual bacon and eggs with potatoes and biscuit and gravy. The portions were HUGE and very decently priced. My total price for these huge biscuits and drink came out to $15. It was definitely worth it.

I definitely plan on coming back here again to try out their lunch and dinner options. The ambiance was nice, the food was incredible, and the service was great!"
4,"Got the to-go Houston Restaurant Week menu twice because I really enjoyed the appetizer (cheese and meat platter) and dessert (flourless chocolate cake) I got the first time. Also, even though it is listed as $45 on the HRW website, it is apparently only $35!

Here are all the things I tried from the Restaurant Week menu:
- Cheese and meat platter: Lots of variety, yummy!
- Tuna: I wasn&apos;t sure from the menu description if this was sashimi (what I was hoping for) or just a sashimi-quality tuna steak (what I got). I liked the sauce that came with it, but I think it would have been much better on the salmon (other fish choice). Without wasabi, I just don&apos;t think tuna steak has a lot of flavor.
- Lobster ravioli in sage sauce: Yummy, not a huge portion (but makes sense for the ingredients and this price point)
- Chicken parmesan: Liked that there was the red sauce on the chicken and another sauce on the noodles
- Flourless chocolate torte: Rich, not a huge portion (which makes sense for this price tag)"
2,"So, I&apos;ve been here many times and they do a good job.  Well today was huge miss. I ordered curbside service because my family and I wanted to take advantage of this beautiful Houston weather which doesn&apos;t come around much and do a picnic down the street.  I specially asked if they could provide utensils, napkins and paper towels.  After driving around for 15 mins to find a parking space we dig in and to our surprise no utensils, napkins, etc.  we had no choice but to return and get utensils, ketchup, etc and the worst part is no I&apos;m sorry or let&apos;s us make it up to you.  Lastly, the salad had no dressing on it and was dry.  Nice job Urban eats."
5,Staff is very friendly. Although the parking lot is small... I always luck up on a parking spot. Went for brunch...the food was so so so good. Hearty portions. I could not even finish my eggs Benedict. The carafes were reasonably priced and they did not lack on the champagne.
4,"Unfortunately it took a few minutes for us to be seen by the hostess and when she finally showed up, she sat us without even a &quot;hello&quot;. Otherwise, the food was excellent. We ordered and shared the Biscuit Flight -- the strawberry jam and honey butter -- wow!! I had the Market Omelette, my husband had the Campers Hash and our friend had the Berry Waffle. Everyone cleaned their plates and we even had leftovers. I hope the service becomes a little better because I would love to give Urban Eats a solid five stars!"
5,"I&apos;ve been to Urban Eats at least ten times in the past for both happy hour and brunch. 
This visit was different. 
I&apos;m pregnant (with my first) this time around and craving their Monkey Bread! 

They offer it with four different accompaniment options. I always get the MB with friends, but decided to try two of the other options. 
I ordered the MB with ratatouille and baked goat cheese, along with a side of bacon jalapeño jam... 
allowing me to try both options.

I thought I&apos;d love the ratatouille and baked goat cheese. It had fresh ingredients, just as expected at Urban Eats, but the mixture didn&apos;t measure up to the expectation. The bacon jam however had such depth in flavor. It was smoky and sweet at the same time, with perfect bacon pieces throughout the jam, giving it perfect texture. 

I ordered it to-go, so once home it was set on my serving tray. Voila! My craving is served!"
5,I&apos;ve been here a few times (breakfast and lunch) and have always had a great experience. Service is prompt and friendly. Came here for a weekday lunch and got the half salad and soup special. The salad and tomato soup was delicious. My partner got the two burger sliders with fries and a small side salad. Quality of food is great and filling.
5,"I ordered the Bewitched cocktail, glass of Rosé &amp; the Cowboy sliders on my first visit, the sliders were amazingggggg 10/10. Absolutely loved the ambiance of this establishment and the market area is the cutest thing ever! Amazing place for a date and the outdoor area is so cute and relaxing...I will be returning soon"
4,"The Breakfast Bacon, Egg, White Cheddar and Jalapeno Bacon Jam Brunch Sandwich is always decadent and delicious. This is my go-to menu item. The biscuit is soft and fluffy. The bacon is usually thick cut and cooked until crispy. The bacon jam didn&apos;t really add any flavor to the sandwich."
4,"Good atmosphere and good food!  It was our first time visiting and we really enjoyed sitting on the balcony on the second floor on such a nice night.  I enjoyed my food - the sauce on my chicken Parmesan was excellent!  We were thrilled about the pork chop, but we liked this restaurant so much that we aren&apos;t going to let keep us from returning.  We are looking forward to another visit and tasting some of those sliders people are talking about!"
5,"We went for a birthday brunch. I had the bacon breakfast sandwich with jalapeño mozzarella bread and a side of potatoes. It was delish . I also tried there peach bellini and blackberry mimosa . They were amazing. Also let&apos;s talk about the vanilla latte!!! Y&apos;all, it was the best latte I have had in a while and I am a coffee snob . I will definitely be back ."
4,"Really neat first floor, like a local mini food market. The restaurant is upstairs. I ordered the &quot;award winning&quot; Mac and cheese. If you like truffle, it is a really tasty dish!"
5,PET FRIENDLY and Fanstastic food !!! We went for brunch one Sunday got the breakfast pie and honey chicken biscuit . It was incredible ! The Hollandaise for the pie was out of this world!
5,"Conveniently located in the heart of the heights. Urban eats offers counter service downstairs and full service upstairs. Good food, great atmosphere and friendly staff. We ordered the monkey bread, buttermilk waffle with mixed berries and honey butter fried chicken biscuit. The portions are generous and shareable. Must order monkey bread when you come here. They literally melt in your mouth. Socially distancing-no problem! There is enough space to accommodate 6ft social distancing as well as outdoor patio seating but when we went it was not busy. Will definitely be coming back."
4,"I liked this place because it was comfortable and clean. It is expensive. Service was kinda slow, tbh. The artichoke is a no go -- terrible and dry. The sliders and fries and fried green tomatoes were fabulous. 
I would like to check out the bakery downstairs. 
But overall it&apos;s a good place to go especially during pandemic when you&apos;re tired and need a comfortable place."
5,Good food ! Good service! Good atmosphere! Just the different vibe to this place and management! But definitely check it out when you have time for some unique healthy foods !
5,One of my favorite morning coffee spots.. great for a quick cup of joe and meeting! seating area is well spread out and comfortable to be around. the upstairs patio area is good for Sunday brunch.. looking forward to coming back
