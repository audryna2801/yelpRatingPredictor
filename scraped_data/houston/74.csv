5,"First time being here since covid-19 hit and I must say that if they weren&apos;t already one of my favorite restaurants they are now . They are taking covid-19 and all of its precautions very seriously and I really appreciate that. 

I even forgot my mask in my car that was valeted and the lady at reception offered me a mask. This is the first time I have noticed this at any restaurant post Covid.

Keep on doing what you&apos;re doing! Hopefully this will blow over soon and we can all enjoy fine dining here again!"
5,"My mom and I come every year to Brennans during HRW and love it every time! 

This year was no different than others, the restaurant was extremely clean and the staff was all wearing masks and gloves. Tables were spread apart and I saw staff wipe down all the chairs and change the whites after a family left. Definitely felt safe during this COVID time.

This year the menu seemed to have additional items on the brunch menu, which was great! Everything was delicious!

I can&apos;t wait to come back and enjoy another meal and banana&apos;s foster!"
5,"Wanted a classy place to celebrate a friend&apos;s birthday. This was above and beyond. Classic southern restaurant. Praline by the front food. Masked up staff. Socially distanced. Amazing service. 

The bread and biscuits from the start were great. I made reservations saying it was a birthday. Our waiter instantly said Happy Birthday. Sat at a nice table in amazingly comfy seats. 

Turtle soup was amazing. Never thought that would come out of my mouth. So glad I tried it though. 

My mint julep was of course pretty and good tasting. 

The red fish cake was my main course. It was okay. I&apos;m sure for those who like red fish it would have been amazing. Bit out of my comfort zone. It reminded me of a crab cake. 

For my after meal, I chose to have beignets and cafe au lait which prepped right at the table. It was amazing and so smooth to drink. I could have drank so many of those. The beignets with their dipping sauce were the perfect ending. 

My friend had the banana foster which is done table side. Great little show and so simple.

Overall all the staff were super friendly and knowledgeable. We asked random ones questions and always got great responses."
5,"Thank you, Brennan&apos;s for creating experiences that are damn near magical.

Dinner on Saturday night with my brother, sister, and our super significant others.

Atlantic Oysters - Sweet and perfect
Turtle soup -  for 30 years, I&apos;ve never missed ordering and never been disappointed
Shrimp Chippewa - I can still taste those grits the day after. (Seriously, a compliment however awkward it may read.)

The service is so gracious, from reservations and throughout the meal, it always inspires me to be better with my family, customers, neighbors, every single person... at least for a little while.

During this crappy time that&apos;s so frustratingly uncertain, there are still people and places -- institutions -- that consistently still wow, and they should truly be celebrated.  

The work you do, the effort required to make that magic, is even more important now."
5,"A really beautiful restaurant with fancy leather chairs that just make dinning so much more comfortable. Coat check was lovely and easy. We had a fabulous waiter, Joe who was witty and funny and took excellent care of us. 

I had the midnight melody cocktail (delicious) and then the winter bubbles, and finished off with a dessert cocktail, orange chocolatini which was Wonderfully decadent. 

The soup trio is a must, because the turtle soup was fabulous, the gumbo great, and the specialty soup was cauliflower which ended up being my favorite!! If you love rich creamy soups like I do - get that. 

I had the lamb shank which was cooked perfectly, and the flavors exquisite. Believe it or not I was even more taken with the flambéed shrimp entree; it had the richest, creamiest, most tasty grits I&apos;ve ever had! 

And for dessert they had many selections. We went with the lemon meringue - excellent. 

And we took a complimentary praline on our way out for the road :) 

All in all everything about this experience was exceptional. Will most definitely be returning!!!"
4,"Had a really lovely bridal brunch here in their small private room. The room itself was light and airy being upstairs with plenty of natural light They allowed us to decorate and bring in a cake. We were well looked after by the waitstaff but also had our privacy. The food was delicious, as were the mimosas :).

Parking was easiest via valet, however it does cost $5, but we were able to get cash back from the bar! Easy access to hop on US 59 when leaving the restaurant.

Great spot for a small private party, and I cannot wait to come back for a regular meal!"
5,"Came for Tardy Gras and their special menu for that night and left so happy and full. Everything was top notch delicious. I don&apos;t usually like hot fish but since we are trying to go plant based I didn&apos;t want to hit the red meat too hard. My husband on the other hand went balls to the wall and got the ribeye and the one appetizer without seafood. It was all spectacular as Brennan&apos;s usually is. The strawberry shortcake was clearly house made and the best one I&apos;ve ever had. It&apos;s been a while since we&apos;ve had a full meal where everything was absolutely delicious so we are extremely thankful to Brennan&apos;s for putting together Tardy Gras for this girl who grew up every year with Mardi Gras and for the excellent service and terrific food, as usual."
4,"Let my just say, vibes was nice here.  My waiter was pure AMAZING! 
Brennan&apos;s create Halloween martinis and specialty drinks.  What an sweet treat. 
Celebrated my birthday here. I&apos;ve had this place booked marked for a couple of years,  visiting here,  I remember stopping by, just to see what Brennan&apos;s had to offer for a brief spell. 
For starters my table guest and I had the shrimp gumbo.  Which had an fantastic roux. 
They had chef special,  which was a Red fish,  I got that,  and the menu filet steak,  which I was informed it&apos;s better than the $99 deal.  

Redfish and slice potatoes is served on a covered cast iron dish. Spectacular. 
My butterflied filet mignon that I requested to be served well,  was initially delivered rare medium.  It was Tuff to cut,  which my server agreed, and pleasantly suggested that he returned it to ther kitchen to be corrected.  
The filet was paired with mushrooms and something else, ( the sides wasn&apos;t too appetizing,  it tasted like fat in my mouth,  but look like to be a potato but wasn&apos;t. ).
 I feel as though the flatware could really use an update. I was disappointed that I forgot my flatware at home.  (Brennans doesn&apos;t have three silver plastic ware that&apos;s discreet)."
3,"I think this is a Houston classic in some ways. Located between downtown and Midtown and has a very historic feel. We&apos;ve come for lunch and it is usually packed, pre and during COVID. Valet only. 

The atmosphere here is a very southern classy feel and so is the food. Turtle soup with sherry (gotta try this) and they have a variety of seafood inspired dishes. Each time I go, it is good, the food is average, but the experience is still high end. Turtle soup is a classic, but the taste is okay. I&apos;m really not sure what great snapping turtle tastes like so it might just be me. I&apos;ve tried a variety of dishes for entree but the catfish poboy ($24) really didn&apos;t do it for me today.. bread tasted a little stale and I definitely ordered the wrong thing. Bananas foster for dessert is another classic here. 

Overall, a good spot for a classy get together but I feel like the food doesn&apos;t live up to the rest of it or the price."
5,"I&apos;ve been anxious to visit Brennan&apos;s of Houston as its one of the most talked about restaurants in Houston. I&apos;m happy to say it&apos;s lived up to it&apos;s great compliments! Food and service were excellent! Our waiters were very attentive and quite entertaining. The only complaint (and it&apos;s not a big deal) was valet. I saw two guys standing off to the side having a convo and didn&apos;t seem too interested in working. I had to ask them if they were offering valet as I was a bit confused. Nonetheless, a great experience! 

Don&apos;t forget your praline treat at the front door. An excellent sweet treat for the drive home!"
5,"Always a fantastic dining experience here!

My friends and I tried out their HRW 3-course dinner menu for $45/person and we loved it. I had the salmon belly (soooo tender and the pecan butter made it so much better), the grilled gulf fish (soooo flavorful and awesome with the brown butter cauliflower puree), and the mini beignets with the side of cafe au lait anglaise. Out of the desserts though, I&apos;d recommend the strawberry mille-feuille! It was such a beautifully made dessert and not too sweet. The bananas foster, too, is always a hit!

Our waiter was very attentive and gave us great recommendations. 

We&apos;ve dined here before and have always had a lovely experience. Don&apos;t forget the pralines on your way out!"
5,"Is it weird that I tell people that the best salad I&apos;ve ever had was Brennan&apos;s? Legit, Brennan&apos;s has so much good food but that salad blew me away! My mouth is watering thinking of it. 
I went for a business meal and we were all in love. My colleagues said this location is 10x better than the one in NOLA. 

I can&apos;t remember my entrée selection because that salad was so good but I remember being very pleased! I&apos;m sure I had some type of fish.

The service is also really good. We parked via valet.

I&apos;ll definitely be back!"
3,"I came here for a special dinner where they served a specific menu. The service was on point. As I walked into the room I was asked what type of wine I would like and a mini crab cake ball, but of which were pretty decent. The servers were very cognizant about our drinks and always had them filled even if I had hardly touched the wine or water. 

To start off, we were served bread which was like a baguette. I thought it was decent but not anything special. It did go very well with the turtle soup however. I really liked the flavor of the turtle soup, minus the sherry. Adding the sherry is optional and I would actually avoid adding to much to the soup, but that is my own preference. 

The fish had a good flavor and paired very well with the corn and sauce. I was very surprised how well the flavors complimented one another with a hint of sweet from the corn and slightly salty sauce. 4/5 

I wasn&apos;t too impressed at first with the bread pudding. My first bite had a huge punch of whiskey flavor which I&apos;m not a fan of. However, as I continued to eat it, the whiskey was not as strong and overall was tolerable. 3/5"
5,"I finally visited Brennan&apos;s of Houston and not even the weather was going to stop me. It was raining heavily that night! When I arrived, the host held the door open for me, a nice gesture I really appreciated. This set the tone for my entire experience. Soon after, I was promptly seated. 
I ordered Shrimp and Grits and I paired my meal with a glass of white wine, which my server recommended. The shrimp was cooked in front of me. It was an exhilarating experience. Truly, I felt like I had a private culinary show all to myself! For dessert, of course, I tried the famous Banana foster.  It was a little too sweet for me, otherwise, the bananas were crisp and soft. Overall, the service was great and the food was carefully infiltrated with southern love."
4,"I visited here for a business dinner on Fat Tuesday, not knowing it was Fat Tuesday. My colleagues and I were greeted by a few drag queens decked out in Marty Gras attire, and were given beads, crowns, and other things before we even sat down at our table. We did not realize there was a mandatory course menu that day and ended up eating quite a bit more than we were intending after having a big lunch. 

Throughout the dinner there were various shows put on by staff including a dance, jazz show, and magic show. It was really quite entertaining and I am glad we were able to visit during such a festive time. 

I ordered the Wild Shrimp Remoulade, Gulf Fish Borgne, and the King Cake for dessert. My colleagues had various other dishes - but we shared a Banana&apos;s Foster and Beignet dessert. All of the dishes were fresh tasting - there was nothing spectacular about anything but it was pleasant. The Banana&apos;s Foster is a show when you order it, and definitely worth getting for a first time dinner to the restaurant. 

This is definitely a special occasion restaurant - and we had a very good time. My two colleagues had never been before, and enjoyed the experience immensely. That being said, I don&apos;t think I would dine here again on my own dime - the price point seems a bit high and I just don&apos;t love the food enough here to justify it. If you love creole food, it is definitely worth a visit once though."
5,"Yummm nice place for an anniversary, or any special occasion, we went for Valentine&apos;s Day, but also because we love good food 
Nice relaxing courtyard/ outside area. We got a two dine special, all the food was top notch...we would def try this place again, table side desert also mmmmmm"
5,"Great food and service with a very personable jazz band   The experience was classy, 
patio was clean, very New Orleans vibe and perfect for our sister Sunday brunch"
3,"Visited this evening (9/5/20) for a 6:30 pm  reservation for 3 to enjoy Houston Restaraunt Weeks. Everything was timely and at the everyone from a wait staff perspective was wearing a mask.

Upon getting seated in what appeared to be the main dining room we were promptly greeted with a smile and ordered drinks. Something appeared to have happened at the table next to us in the back corner because the manager came over and apologized to the that party. 

After receiving our meal, post incident next door, our waiter changed his entire tune. He was no longer friendly, didn&apos;t come back to check on us or ask if we needed anything else. We could have used another cocktail (we had only had one) at this point. 

Our next interaction was when he brought our check out asked how we wanted it split. No thank you, good night etc. We left the table walking right past him and didn&apos;t even acknowledge or greet us. Despite all this we left at least a 20% tip which seemed more than he earned. 

We came to enjoy a meal out for once in the last several months and this was our experience. We get that things don&apos;t go perfect. We weren&apos;t asking for that. Simply to enjoy having someone else prepare a meal and treat us like we were special for 90 minutes. Our table also had the only black person in the entire room and what seemed to be one of the younger tables (average age at table in the 30s). I hope that was not the reason for the lack of service and friendliness. 

Food: 10/10
Waiter: 2/10

We&apos;ve been multiple times and have not had this type experience. I hope this was an off night but it&apos;s unfortunate it happened to us. We will be back for the food, not the service."
4,"My family had brunch during HRW and overall had a great experience for $20.

There were some hits and misses with the food and service- we had to ask for silverware and the table nearby must have had some younger patrons who left a mess under the table, but our server Aaron was genuinely sweet and attentive.

As for the food. My heirloom and pickled green tomato salad was cold, refreshing, and full of tart flavor. I would order it again. The rest of our table had gumbo and turtle soup and I heard no complaints. For the main course, I narrowed it down to the Benedict duo or the shrimp and grits and asked Aaron to choose for me. He picked the grits, which were delicious, and there were four good sized shrimp. The rest of the table ordered the highly recommended shaking beef tips. And while the flavor was good, the Asian-inspired dressing had fish sauce that left an unappetizing lingering smell. It seemed out of place at Brennan&apos;s.

For dessert, we were treated to two plates of complimentary pralines (we were celebrating two belated birthdays). I was very happy because when we left, the praline bowl in the foyer had been cleaned out!"
5,"We went to this place for the first time on a double date and sat in their patio. They have a beautiful back side patio. The service was amazing, both in terms of friendliness and good information and suggestion. Our server suggested great cocktails. We got Red Snapper and quail. The red snapper came with fried oysters, shrimp and crab and was one of the most delicious meals I&apos;d had in Houston. The portions were the right size and the mixture of the tastes was perfect. The quail was tasty too, but it was stuffed with Tasso so it had less bird meat and more of stuffing, and was in general and smaller meal. We ended up ordering six more fried oysters. I would definitely go back and recommend this place."
