5,"Went here to celebrate my sister&apos;s 21st birthday. The atmosphere was perfect. They seem to be taking precautions due to covid. The staff were great and paid attention to our dinner party. The food was definitely wonderful!

Will definitely go back.
Definitely good for date night as well!"
5,I truly enjoyed this place! First time here for a friends birthday dinner. We have a private area which was nice especially with the covid concerns. Our waiter was super attentive and very knowledgeable of the menu. I ordered the blood orange margarita and beef Wagyu and kimichi dumplings to start off! It was super delicious. For my main course I ordered the king crab roll and mushroom risotto hotpot rice. The presentation of the hotpot was very cool! Everything was great and I will definitely be back!
5,"Such a great place, great experience. The vibe when walking in, the music, the lightening all sets for a great evening. It is a very open and modern. Part of the cooking area is glass and is open so you can see what&apos;s going on. 
We opted for the Omakasee.. highly recommend! Chef&apos;s selection was great. You get to taste a little from each section. Presentation of the food was spectacular!"
5,"Great spot for a special occasion or fine dining! The ambiance is really extraordinary. You really get what you pay for! 

I highly recommend the Wagyu Flat Iron with Maitake Mushroom and Sukiyaki. The beef was perfectly cooked. It was very tender and juicy. Honestly, some of the best steak I have ever had. The appetizers are simply amazing as well. The dumplings were very flavorful with plenty of filling. The sides are highly recommended as well! The sweet corn with soy garlic butter was divine. 

Overall, my experience here was fantastic! The food was exceptional, and the service was top notch. I&apos;m glad I live so close to this spot, I can&apos;t wait to come back to try their omakase!"
5,"Man oh man where do I start!!! My husband brought be here for one our anniversaries (don&apos;t judge yes we celebrate 2 bf/gf and husband/wife) anyway this could have easily been for our wedding anniversary.  The atmosphere was chic and intimate we had the pleasure of having Sky as our waitress. She was pretty, informative of the menu, gave suggestions, checked on us periodically without interfering with our quality time and was nice enough to take our pictures at the end! Wonderful service all the way around! 

Now on to the food. My husband pushed me to get the Alaskan King Crab and Ms. Sky also told us it was very good and that she gets it when she is off that&apos;s how good it is. I am so glad I listened. That crab was sooo good and sweet if we were not at a classy place I would have licked my fingers lol. 
 We also got the NY strip 10oz with garlic butter and it was melt in your mouth good, even cooked at medium well for my husband. For sides we got the Mushroom Rice Hot Pot, Crispy Brussels, the sweet corn, and 2 sushi rolls that we devoured so I don&apos;t even have a picture. We also got a bottle of Chardonnay that was reasonably priced. They were so sweet they gave us each a glass of champagne for our anniversary. I forgot to ask do they have happy hour because I am in love. Please check it out."
5,Great service and phenomenal food! I can&apos;t wait to go back and try some different things. I give five stars because it was a place so worth balling out for lol you can really have so many experiences here and we had a bit of everything for our first time but would love to go back for a steak dinner and also a more casual dinner (I&apos;m coming back for you karaage!)
5,"Freddie had served us before while we sat at the chefs table and did a phenomenal job!!  Today we sat at the bar with Hen...and hands down he was amazing!  As a matter of fact since we told him of our terrible experience with Mastro&apos;s he got the manager to take off our first orders of cocktails!!  Winning!!

We always have an amazing experience here, the food is ALWAYS fresh and the service is hands down ON POINT!  Can i get a hallelujah?!!

One of my favorite sushi places in Houston, and I highly recommend the Decadent Omakase...you get a little bit of everything!  You&apos;ll enjoy and take in the journey of tantalizing your taste buds!!"
4,"The restaurant was one of three restaurants in Houston that served authentic Kobe beef (see https://oishii-desu.com/2020/11/27/where-to-buy-kobe-beef-online-and-which-38-restaurants-are-certified-to-serve-it/).  The sushi was OK, the Kobe beef was really expensive, and the Yamazaki 12 pour was a bit expensive.  I definitely would not come back to this restaurant unless it was a very special occasion."
5,"I don&apos;t quite know how to describe this experience because it was by far the best food I&apos;ve ever had (and I&apos;ve eaten all over the world).

I had never tried A5 wagyu and it blew my mind! Warning: it is expensive. About $65/oz. with a minimum of 3 oz. We ordered more than that...

Every penny was worth it. Not only was the staff extremely friendly and helpful, the level of excellence and presentation was beyond belief.

I would (and am going to) return many times and recommend it to everyone. This has to be one of the best places to eat in America, certainly in Texas."
4,"Went here on Valentine&apos;s Day with the earliest reservation made. The service was great and attentive. Started with the yellowtail sashimi which was okay. The beef with truffle was amazing. I got a side of Serrano pepper because i love all things spicy. The scallop was the same as last time, kinda over cooked. Would not order it again. The wagyu was okay. I don&apos;t know what it is, but i think it tasted smoked or the way it was cooked isn&apos;t the style for my taste buds. It&apos;s not bad at all, just probably not the taste for me. The bone marrow is still the same for me. It&apos;s overly sweet but it did come with toasted bread. I think it would be best without the sweet sauce. The sushi was special ordered with foie gra on all. The chef accommodated us which was nice. Otoro was best. The others were okay to me which was flounder, sea pearch, and snapper. The crab was good but if truffle was added, it would be amazing! Overall it was a regular experience to me. My friend would come back to eat other things, but this probably wouldn&apos;t be my first choice."
5,"OMG!!! Is this one of the best Japanese steak house in H town or what. I have been here for the passing 2 years for my birthday, and tried varieties of dishes and specialties. Simply put it, everything is amazing. 

Parking is easy, you can valet on the first or self parking on the second floor, easy access. When you enter the restaurant, you know they mean business. There are 3 sections in Roka Akor,  bar area, main dining area and hibachi area. I enjoyed sitting in the hibachi during the day, there&apos;s lot sunlight coming thru the windows, really relaxing. The bar is amazing, I&apos;m not really a drinker, but there are tons of liquor and wine choices display on the nice bar shelves. 

Service is always spectacular, they are always so attentive, I can&apos;t remember how many times they came to check up on us. 

Let&apos;s talk about the food, happy hour menu is the most economical, they are always half off and lots of things on the menu to try. But the most memorable thing is Roka&apos;s Omakase. I don&apos;t know why it took me so long to eventually tried it, but I was just so glad I did and I will be coming back for it over and over again. 

There are about 10 courses also, according to the manager their class omakase is a combination of their specialties on the menu. Mussels with baked bread was so good, mussels are super fresh, baked bread is sweet and crispy, and quantity is just surprising. Fatty tuna with Foie gras on top plus the gold flakes are the most tasty item, it just simply melt in your mouth.  

Omakase is usually come with hot and cold dishes plush raw fish. When the sashimi came, I was not impressed, just some common fish, but when I tried it, OMG again, they are all so fresh, the hamachi is even bit crispy on the red part and sweet entirely. SHOCKED!!!. 

I could go on and on about every single dish, all super delish, but to top everything is the last item, Wagyu beef, sooo good. Came along with risotto in a pot and some fresh grilled veggies. 

Overall, one of the most amazing Japanese steak restaurant in Houston. No questions about it, I would say the best but it wouldn&apos;t be to fair since every restaurant has their own specialties also. 

Highly highly recommended."
4,"Finally tried this restaurant and they didn&apos;t disappoint! My favorite was their toro tartare. So soft and fresh, love the pairing with yolk, caviar and quail egg decor. 

The salmon avocado roll and wagyu &amp; kimchi gyoza weren&apos;t too special. The wagyu &amp; kimchi dumpling was a bit salty for me, could&apos;ve been the strong juicy wagyu. 

They have desserts too! 4 kinds, just ask the server. I really enjoyed their fruit shaved ice. The mochi in the shaved ice is especially so chewy! I ate by myself but the portion is enough for two. 

I want to give a shout out to my server, Skye. She was personable and friendly. Great customer service! 

I will definitely be back to try their drinks and other appetizers! Great ambience. Casual &amp; classy.

As for parking, you could do valet or you can park at the garage, self parking 2nd floor :)"
5,My favorite omakase spot in Houston! Their wagyu is to die for. Great spot for sushi lovers looking to splurge a bit.
2,"It was one of my favorite Japanese restaurants in town.
I&apos;ve been here many times in the past, the food was always good and not so noisy so I chose this place to celebrate my husband&apos;s birthday.
we ordered omakase for the night, In the middle of the dinner while we were enjoying the food, the manager came to our table informed us that our car has been broken into, so from there you can imagine how the night went.....
The restaurant located on the first floor of a high-rise building. It doesn&apos;t have its own parking lot, so you&apos;d have to use the valet that the restaurant provided but it&apos;s through a third party (the restaurant is not responsible for things you lose). We always use valet&apos;s at restaurants. In the 17 years we have lived in Houston we never had our vehicle robbed and vandalized while dining out.
We asked the building for the video footage the next day. Unfortunately our car was parked in the corner where there was no camera coverage. Why did the valet pick a spot that had no camera coverage?!? 
That night, the restaurant did compensate our dinner however we would much rather pay the bill then have a free meal and our car vandalized and our possessions stolen. What made it worst was this all happened on my husband&apos;s birthday during our celebration.
We left angry and fearful. Angry how could this happen at our restaurant when we were dining, fear our home would get invaded, fear for our safety every time we go outside.
We were told by the manager the valet owner would fix our car the next day. He tried to use a &quot;third party&quot; company to come to my house to fix the broken windows so I contacted the restaurant again then the management agreed to help out with the bill from a legitimate company. All this trouble because I picked this restaurant for my husbands birthday. Hopefully they honor their words pay what they said they would."
5,"I&apos;m a horrible person for taking so long to review Roka Akor! Roka Akor is the love of my life! I go to business lunches or dinners a lot and I almost always suggest Roka. There are so many fabulous sushi places/steakhouses in Houston but Roka is my favorite. 

The service is always great, it&apos;s easy to get a reservation, and the food is just sooooo good! 

I&apos;ve had so many items on the menu I can&apos;t even list them all, but i&apos;ll tell you my favorites:
Beef Tataki with Black Shaved Truffle, Truffle Jus, Pickled Daikon - MUST HAVE. Absolutely delicious. The truffle is the perfect touch and even better when my (CRAZY) co-diners don&apos;t eat theirs and then there&apos;s more for me.
Sweet Corn with Soy Garlic Butter - I know, it&apos;s &quot;just corn&quot; but trust me, it&apos;s not. It&apos;s SOOOO delicious!
Hamachi and Serrano Chili Roll - simple but so tasty!
Lobster and Gulf Shrimp Dumplings - must have! I&apos;d like to have these all to myself usually but I&apos;m kind so I share and i&apos;m thanked greatly for it.
Any of their steaks are really delicious. Just make sure to order medium or whatever the server suggestion is. Please, for the love of God, don&apos;t order ANY of their steaks well done. This is coming from a reformed well-done offender....You&apos;re wasting your money if you&apos;re ordering well done here!

Really, anything you get here is going to be delicious so do yourself a favor and go visit!"
5,"Yellow tail, uni, king crab, king salmon, toro, Kamari, Akamatsu, and a5 wagyu. 

Really no complaints. This is a beautiful place for a date night.  
Yellow tail - nice flavor and good hint of sour
Uni - fatty and sweet
King crab - unique with a lot of meat. the butter was soooo good. 
King salmon - fatty and delicious
Toro - my favorite!! Fatty and decorated with gold :)

Definitely try the beracuda! It&apos;s so different. Very nice smoky flavor (I forgot if it&apos;s Kamari or akamatsu. Just look for beracuda)"
4,"One of my favorite spots for date night esp since the bf loves meat and potatoes and I love all food. The menu is split in half by the raw/seafood items and the meats on the other side. 

1. On our first visit, we ordered about 9oz of the wagyu (3oz minimum) and thought the presentation was so cute over the little fire. I can&apos;t remember any of the differences between the different prefectures, but our server was incredibly knowledgeable and was able to eloquently describe all of that for us. The ones we picked were all melt-in-your-mouth delicious, as expected for A5 grade. 

2. To supplement the meats, we also ordered the Korean spiced lamb chops and a side of the fingerling potatoes. The lamb and potatoes have now become the bf&apos;s staple every time we visit because of the seasoning, tenderness, and portion size. 

3. Uni and chicharrones: interesting but not memorable pairing. The chicharrones were too thick and some were a bit stale, which overall did not allow the uni to shine. Presentation was cool, but I would have rather ordered an uni nigiri. 

4. Tuna, foie, caviar, gold leaf nigiri: heavenly and my absolute favorite way to spoil myself. There is so much richness with the fatty tuna and foie gras and the caviar and gold leaf really elevate the presentation. I understand gold leaf has no taste and some people might find it ridiculous, but this is roka, so treat yourself. 

5. Shishito peppers: yummy and great sharing appetizer. I love it with the bonito flakes, but would have loved it even more with an aioli. 

6. Salmon belly nigiri: good but not the best I&apos;ve had in Houston. 

7. Scallop nigiri: again, pretty good but not the best ever.

8. Unagi nigiri: pretty standard. 

9. A5 Japanese wagyu beef gunkan: recommended by our server as a &quot;sleeper pick&quot; and I have zero regrets ordering. This had so much depth of flavor as essentially a beef tartare with caviar and some roasted garlic flavor throughout. I&apos;m really not sure what else was in this, but was a delightful pop of flavor. 

10. Lychee martini: LOVE.

11. Green tea custard with banana: hands down my favorite dessert in Houston and quite possibly that I&apos;ve ever had. I&apos;m a huge sucker for anything green tea and really loved the rich, creamy green tea panna cotta that was topped with bruleed bananas on top. Pretty partial to the random two lumps of mochi that were in there, but I would come to roka solely to eat this."
5,"This was hands down our favorite restaurant in houston until we got the bill ‍ 
I went with my bf to try the wagyu steak bc he loves steak and had never had wagyu. We weren&apos;t sure how to go about ordering so we let the server make suggestions and went with it. We ended up doing the wagyu flight, which allows you to sample all 3 wagyu types. It&apos;s priced as market price on the menu and we knew it would be expensive... but had no idea the 9oz flight would be about $600! Our total bill was $800 with apps, drinks and desert!! It was a delicious meal, I&apos;ll give them that! But not $800 delicious  other than the wagyu, meal prices were reasonable. If you go for the wagyu just know you&apos;ll pay about $200 per 3oz."
5,"Oh Roka Akor you made me so happy AGAIN tonight! 

I picked up curbside and &quot;devoured&quot; the wonderful delish prawn avocado sushi roll, spicy edamame, yellow tail sashimi - decorates with edible flower petal, &amp; sweet corn.

I placed my order on-line which made everything so easy!

I definitely recommend ordering to go from this wonderful sushi restaurant!"
5,"We came here to celebrate a birthday in a small group. Great second visit! We really enjoyed all the food and the service was excellent! Our server was very knowledgeable and helpful about all the sushi. My friends and I really liked the salmon, shashimi, black cod and fresh veggie roll."
