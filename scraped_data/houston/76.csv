5,"I&apos;ve returned several times since my initial review, and each time has been fairly perfect.  Trulucks reigns supreme in many ways, elevated by the perfectly prepared seafood, sexy ambiance, and excellent service.  

Stone crab claws are still a sweet and delicious favorite.  The large is a nice size.  Several varieties of crab are served here, but these stone crab claws are a house favorite.  The calamari here is a surprise favorite of mine due to it not being heavily battered and greasy like some places, and little slivers of bamboo shoots, carrots, and pepper are the perfect addition.  The sea bass continues to be one of my favorite go to entrees.  Save room for dessert!  The carrot cake is phenomenal and accompanied by tasty candied pecans and a caramel drizzle.

Consider sitting at the bar for some enchanting live music by talented musicians.  Perfect to set the mood for a date night.  There&apos;s a small patio to the side of it for a quick breath of fresh air and privacy.

Staff is professional, attentive, and up to par with what one might expect from such a fine establishment."
5,Service was very friendly and helpful.  Ordered Miso Glazed Sea Bass with scallops and crab fried rice and rolls to go.  The take out packing keep the food warm and protected from possible spills.  The fish was cooked to perfection... tender and melted in your mouth.  Crab fried rice was bomb. The rolls were nice and fluffy.  Want to be treated like royalty.... come and check it out.
5,"I ordered a cup of my # 1 favorite soup togo for curbside, Lobster Bisque from Truluck&apos;s. The Lobster Bisque here is always fantastic in flavor, thickness, richness and quality. It has a buttery, creamy taste to it with several chunks of fresh lobster in it. You can also tell they use lobster and not shrimp like some places do. You can taste the lobster flavor, lobster pieces and thick, buttery broth in this very delicious soup. I also got their delicious bread with it which taste very good and fresh every time and goes very well with their menu items. The bread is usually served buttery, but I got the bread without butter and it was still amazing and was a great partner with my soup. A cup of Lobster Bisque here is 13 bucks and the bread is 3 bucks if you get it togo. The flavor, quality and service at Truluck&apos;s are awesome."
5,"TRULUCKS&apos;S what&apos;s not to say. First time here and both service and food were top notch. Walked in everyone was pleasant and friendly. Husband made reservations and once there I requested a booth by the wall. Our hostess did awesome doing just that. 

Our waiter:
Raul is his name. Such a welcome and friendly waiter. Told him it was our first time. And he took the time to explain the dishes. We ended getting the valentines special. Lobster,T-Bone steak, mashed potatoes  asparagus, and a seafood lasagna. I got a wedge salad  all was great. Took left overs and they hit the spot that night. Will definitely  back again"
4,"Well rounded and as expected!

Location- Galleria area, convenient for those doing business or that live or are visiting the area. Walking distance to various hotels, office building and homes/condos/apartments.

Parking - valet or self park, plenty of space.

Ambience - perfect low lights, live music until 9pm on Tuesday nights, loud but you can still hear one another even at a table of 4. Still good for social distancing while indoors in a Pandemic.

Food

- Lobster bisque cup was a perfect amount as an appetizer 
- or if you just want something light as a meal, get the Lobster Bisque and add the fresh warm lightly toasted lightly salted Parmesan yeast rolls that&apos;ll be plenty. The rolls came and I said omg I can only eat one this is way too much. See photo! Lol. 
- Miso Glazed Sea Bass, Crab fried rice was good. A bit sour and heavy on seasoning, but good. Also there was little rice and little to no crab lol. 

Seating - I ate in the bar area at a cocktail table which was great as I could enjoy the live music. (Pianist). The bar has seating for about 7 in the Pandemic and another 3 cocktail tables and 5 booths that seat 4-6. Then there&apos;s loads of table dining in the dining room area away from the live music but you can still hear it. 

Great for dates, in town family or general family nights out, business meetings, etc. 

I&apos;ll be back no doubt. Hopefully next time with the love of my life ;)"
5,"Jasmine.  Oliver.  Are just a few of the most amazing people in hospitality.  Myself and a group dined at the bar a few evenings ago.  Even though we had been working on site building a concept.   We were not the most presentable in attire for the standard of lucks, but we were still welcomed and served to the highest standard.  Crab, wine and cocktails always cures a day of work.  Lucks gave us an amazing evening, thank you for the hospitality.  

Cheers"
4,"First time here for a company party and really enjoyed it. The ambience was nice and our waiter was great. They were great at recommending food and drink items. I enjoyed all of it. I ordered some kind of special they were having which was a filet mignon, scallops, shrimp and some crab. Also got the lobster mashed potatoes which was to die for"
4,"We ordered the seafood tower, calamari, meatball steak, lobster and branzino. My favorite was their calamari. Not a big fan of their steak. Overall it was 4/5."
4,"Crab Fried Rice, Lobster Mashed Potatoes, Parmesan Rolls, Carrot Cake. Some were better than others, but overall, very good! 

Only had a bit but the bread was sooo good. Flaky, fluffy, and fresh. The mashed potatoes were just okay. I wish the lobster pieces were full and not as chopped. The sauce it came in was okay, I expected more richness but I only had a bit of that as well. That crab fried rice though.. VERY good! A good amount of crab and great portion size. The sauce it came with was perfect! Know that mushrooms are included, so if that&apos;s not your thing, ask for the rice without them. 

The carrot cake was SO GOOD! I&apos;d literally come back just for the cake. Portions are huge. It took my 2-3 days to finish and I only ordered one slice. The icing wasn&apos;t overpowering or too much despite being in between each layer. 

Can&apos;t wait for things to open back up so I can come back and dine in!"
5,"Came here for the first time for a date and it was amazing! From the minute you walk up to the door the service is great. The place is clean and the live performer really set the mood. The only thing that was a little disappointing was the size of the oysters when I ordered the oysters on a half shell, the taste however was still really good. For dinner I had the surf and turf which was the chefs special for the night and it was the best steak and scallops I&apos;ve ever had. My server Kris made my experience perfect, he suggested a great wine and provided great service. I will definitely brag about how fantastic this place was and I will be returning. I was having too much of a great time to take pictures but I will next time!"
4,"Service was nice
Tried the Alaskan King crab,  for the first time. For the price I didn&apos;t expect it to be served with butter that was not hot. The candle never heated the butter even when I left my crab meat sitting in it for over 10 minutes.  My crab meat wasn&apos;t warm as I&apos;m use to.  I really like that the shell was pre cut, to have easy access to the meat. 
Packing it up for later my butter was left out as requested. The rolls was great and soft"
5,Came here for a group party of sort so we really tried everything . Simply exceptional food ( the sea bass was good not great). Service attentive and high end as well . No sense going to detail - everything was very very good ! If you want season ( especially crab) this is the venue !
5,"This spot is so delicious! I loved the steak, crab rice &amp; escargot! Service was amazing &amp; so was the setting. Quiet with great slow music."
4,"This was a lovely dining experience, the servers were on point and friendly. We spent over $600 here for a party of six adults so a little over $100 per person including alcohol and an alcohol tax..which I had not heard of before. Starting with the appetizers- jumbo lump crab was tasty, Crab Dip Taramasalata which was basically hummus mixed with blue lump crab and olives was tastier than it sounds. Final app was not flavorful at all, left most of it as it was Hawaiian Tuna Crudo. Speaking of Hawaiian as my main entree I ordered the Hawaiian Kauai Shrimp and it was terrible that&apos;s why I&apos;m knocking off a star. The coconut rice that it came with was more like a dessert sticky rice, and the waitress warned me it wasn&apos;t like regular rice but I didn&apos;t heed her warning..my bad! The other entrees were great especially the scallops (phenomenal!), ribeye, and sea bass. The tastiest sides had to be the mushrooms, my husband doesn&apos;t like mushrooms and he even found these to be scrumptious. I would go back just for those mushrooms..."
4,"Perfect dinner setting! The restaurant had a live musician singing and playing the piano.


If you are looking for an upscale seafood/steak menu this is the place to go. 


The waitress suggested all of our entrees and drinks for us which was a perk for the indecisive like myself. She made awesome recommendations! 

The redfish was delectable. It was paired with a rich cream sauce that had spice and also a nice zest to it. The lemon drops hit the spot as well and weren&apos;t too pricey. 

Another perk is that this restaurant is capable of seating large parties and will customize a menu for you and your guests. They offer a private room for celebrations and gatherings."
5,"Spectacular AS ALWAYS!!  

Who has the best seafood in Houston, they do!!  Best staff, ambiance, rest rooms LOL you name it. 

I had one of regular meals, starting with the lobster bisque SO COZY, filled with lobster, creamy &amp; hot. Fantastic!!

Moving on to the oh so tender lobster tail, loaded, super stuffed with crab OMG....mouth watering goodness!!!  

The meatball appetizer was stunning, tender, gigantic &amp; packed with flavor.  

Just know that if you want to impress AND have the best seafood ever your in the right place!  

They never fail you!"
4,"I spent my anniversary here. First impression, I enjoyed the ambience of this place. To start off, they offer valet or you can park your vehicle yourself. The gentlemen opens the entrance door for you when you enter and when you leave. The mood is quite romantic, dim lighting with white tablecloth. Since it was my anniversary they sprinkled real roses on our table. The waitress was super knowledgeable about the menu and is quite attentive. She stops by occasionally to check if we&apos;re doing ok. Free bread and butter to start. Food was good, portion was great. We got a free dessert as a perk and it&apos;s quite yummy. A great place for special occasions. As far as the value, it&apos;s really up to you. For the two of us, we spent a couple hundred. 2 glass of wine was already $41. All staff does wear mask and gloves. They gave us each a small bag to place our mask in when we arrived at our table."
5,"WOW!!! This is not my first time here (came here for Valentine&apos;s day a while ago) but I HAD to write a review after my amazing experience tonight!! 5 start service and 5 star food! Our server was Kris and he was excellent! We were also greeted at the door with such kindness and welcome it felt like I was VIP! You are required to wear a mask upon entering but what I thought was so neat was that they give you a bag for your mask so its not just sitting on the table or seat.

Now onto the service and atmosphere: this is a fine dining restaurant so you are going to spend money but it is sooo worth it. It is mostly booths but it is very nice. Like I mentioned, Kris was our server and he is no stranger to fine dining. He knew the menu back and forth, gave great recommendations and awesome service! He was quite funny too. 

Now the food (what you all really want to know). I ordered two glasses of pinot noir, the California was my favorite. For appetizers  we ordered the salt &amp; pepper calamari and the crab cake. The calamari was very good, it was different because it came with carrots and green so the flavor was crunchy and tangy but yummy. The crab cake was amazing because it was allll crab, no extra breading like some places and alll sooo fresh. The main course was the chef&apos;s special which was blackened salmon with crab, shrimp &amp; scallops on top! OH MY GOSH!! Can we say cooked to perfection!! It was literally all my favorites in one meal paired with the side of lobster mashed potatoes. Now this is a MUST try! The lobster was perfect! Not rubbery or overcooked at all, and the potatoes tasted like heaven. For dessert they brought me a birthday special that was something like a marshmallow engulfing  an oreo with icecream. Needless to say I was stuffed!! 

We were beyond satisfied with our visit and can&apos;t wait to come back again!"
4,"My new favorite restaurant in Dallas. The experience was just awesome from the live music delicious food and exceptional service. 

I&apos;ve eaten here three times and ordered the exact same thing. Get the crab cakes! Y&apos;all the best crabcakes ever! Lump crabmeat slightly seared, no batter like at other places. That delicious crab cake I mention cost $20 for ONE, it&apos;s worth it though. 

Along with my crabcake I ordered the crab rice ingredient heavy but savory. The dessert tray display makes you want to get one of each. The presentation was five stars! I settled on the chocolate bag however the taste fell short to my liking. It had a &quot;plastic taste&quot; if that makes sense. 

 RSVP and request first floor seating close to the window trust me looking forward to trying the  Houston location."
5,"Decent find dining restaurant. The calamari was so good.  We wanted to give our compliments to the chef, but she was in vacation. Such wonder recipe anyway.
The manger Oliver poured water for us and gave us a very warmly welcome. I can&apos;t remember the waiter&apos;s name, I felt sorry for it, he was so nice. 
Best bread I ever had in town! The sea bass was a must-try dish.
We all appreciated that the restaurant can offer such decent food and service during such difficult time."
