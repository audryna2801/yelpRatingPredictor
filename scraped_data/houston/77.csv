5,"Friends have been raving about this place, so we finally gave it a try. Pizza and salad were both tasty. Pizza crust was not too thick or too thin; not too crunchy nor too soggy; it was juuuust right. Take-out preparation time was quick and delivery was prompt. Our only complaint was that the delivery advertised on the website turned out to be just UberEats or DoorDash when we called to order (it would be nice if this was clear on the website). The pizza customization features were very limited on UberEats compared to the actual Gypsy Poet website... we couldn&apos;t figure out to how to request to add meat to our pizza on the app. We&apos;ll definitely have to go in-person sometime to try out all the extras we wanted!"
5,Gourmet artisan pizza anyone?  We found a new favorite pizza spot in Houston!!!  Ordered 4 pizzas and the dessert Nutella pizza.  Our group agreed the Capellone &quot;Big Hat&quot; pizza with sausage and mushrooms was our favorite with the Pepperoni Madness pizza a close 2nd.  Friendly staff and neat hangout spot:  my only request to ownership:  HOW ABOUT OPENING A 2nd LOCATION IN KATY?  Outdoor seating as well that is pet friendly.  Parking can be tricky though as it is downtown.
5,"The best pizza in Houston. I&apos;ve only been here twice (once for takeout and once for dine-in) and I ordered the Big Hat with sausage pizza both times. This pizza is so delicious and the crust is just the right amount of crispy and chewy. This past time, I also got the portobello salad which was also super yummy. I want to try other pizzas next time. 

The only negative is that the menu is quite limited and it does take some time to get your pizza."
5,"Thank you my fellow Yelpers! You are right on! 

We walked 1.2 mile each way here to try their famous pizza... Wow The Gypsy Piet did not disappoint. 

The place was practically empty when it first opened, we ordered the Fanny Pak as the young cashier recommended. It was as good as it gets. Possibly 2 of the best pizza we have had, it can surely stand up to New York pizza in a heart beat!

Generous size (don&apos;t why people think it&apos;s small), how much food do you need to eat for lunch?  Comes with cheese topping on a corner, basil and chili flakes too... it was just enough truffle oil to make it so delish.

The Italian tomato sauce, the thin crust, the arugula all together was so bomb good!

Portobello mushroom arugula salad was delicious. I love warm saut√©ed or grill mushroom on a fresh salad. 

We were full to share just that. We were so happy that Yelp nailed this one for the book again!

So if you in Houston,I&apos;ve think crust pizza, got to come here!"
4,"Definitely use Google map because it&apos;s hidden away in downtown. 

Little shack,  between some homes,  doesn&apos;t have name outside,  so if you blink you&apos;ll go right past it. 

Cute but small picnic area outside to sit or nicely decorated inside area.  I also really enjoyed the 90s music they played. 

The staff was 2 girls and 1 guy,  the two ladies made the amazing pizzas and the guy worked the register,  all very sweet. 

The pizza was hot,  so fresh and so delicious. I never knew how amazing honey tasted on pizza!!!! I love how they served each pizza pie on butcher pair and tray, with a side of basil, pepper and shredded cheese. 
You can sit and watch them making your pizza and see all the fresh ingredients they use. 

The menu is small,  a few choices of pizza,  two salad and dessert choices.  I do wish they offered a basic house salad or caesar on their menu. 

I loved this place and wish they&apos;d open up a second location closer to me.  Outside the loop."
5,"Stumbled across this place on Yelp and so glad we did! The pizza was amazing. 

The staff pointed out the top 2 pizzas and we ordered both. Pepperoni madness had a bit of sweet to it which was fantastic. Fancy backpacker was also incredible. 

Also a decent selection of beer, wine, and soft drinks. Loved the inside seating options and the outdoor area."
3,"So I needed a quick bite before bed &amp; got The Gypsy Post sent via Uber Eats. After seeing all the awesome ratings I decided to give their pizza a shot. It took me forever to decide but I went with the Sicilian Journey. They were pretty quick to cook the pizza &amp; get it on the way with Uber Eats, which was awesome. But the pizza itself just didn&apos;t have a ton of flavor.. it wasn&apos;t bad but  didn&apos;t blow me away. The quality of the pizza &amp; ingredients were there, but just lacking a little something. Would love to try the spicy honey pepperoni one day because the crust was really good &amp; cooked perfectly."
5,Whoa! This could be the best pizza in Houston. The flavors are on points. Online ordering is so easy. Will definitely come back.
5,"We went to the Gypsy Poet after an awful experience at another area pizza place that same evening, craving something good to make up for that prior disappointment. So glad we ventured here based on the strength of the prior reviews!

Gypsy Poet has a nice relaxed scene to it though business appeared brisk. We were kindly greeted and scanned their menu. We ended up ordering two pizzas and dined in. Chose the Fancy Backpacker and Pepperoni Madness.

Our pizzas came out in about 15 minutes and smelled and looked awesome. And the first bite confirmed it. Wonderful fresh ingredients, and we loved both pies, devouring them quickly. Some fresh basil was supplied to add as topping which was great.

Gypsy Poet really knows how to make a terrific artisanal pie. A great spot for pizza lovers."
3,"My first time here, Friday night.  Ordered 2 pizzas and cokes.  Friendly staff, pretty busy place.  Pizza was very good, only issue was that it took too much time to get pizza."
5,"I have been wanting to try this place since it opened and we made it out today - and it definitely won&apos;t be the last! This is a husband and wife owned business that is the perfect combination of what you want in a restaurant - great quality, ambiance and love for the art of great food  

We got a few things:

1 - portobello salad - 5/5 yummo! Perfect balance of acidity and taste with a hot delicious portobello cap. On recommendation of the owner, save the leftover dressing and cheese to dip your crust in

2 - Margherita pizza - 5/5 again, so lovely and perfectly dippable in some olive oil or leftover dressing. Would definitely get again

3 - Dream catcher - 4/5 really good but I think the Margherita surpassed expectations w its simplicity and taste. We aren&apos;t HUGE goat cheese fans which is probably why we liked the Margherita more but still amazing 

4- tiramisu- 5/5 wow again! So tasty and not super sweet. Tasted very fresh and perfect, we had to go back for round 2 because we fought over round 1 

5 - vino - perfect selection of red and whites. We tried the malbec and it was delicious!

Thanks for the wonderful food, ambiance and hospitality - look forward to coming back soon!"
5,"Sicilian journey is my favorite. Pepperoni madness tasted sweet, not sure if it&apos;s because of the tomato sauce, but this is just my personal preference! The place has a very good vibe! I&apos;ll definitely go back to tryout other pizza and have more Sicilian journey."
5,"This pizza is simply amazing!!&apos; The closest pizza I had in Houston to real authentic Italian pizza from Italy!! Service is outstanding, I ordered &quot;Margherita the Queen&quot; and it was fantastic!! They give you fresh basil , red flakes, and parmesan on the side with the order!! I&apos;m definitely coming back again!"
5,Great Pizza!   I ordered the Cinque Formaggi Pizza and it was Delicious!!!  I have never had a pizza with goat cheese on it and I would definitely try it if you have never.  It is thin crust pizza so you will probably eat the whole thing. The pizzas are not very big so each person should really get their own. It is a little pricey but it&apos;s very delicious. The place is clean and the staff is friendly. I would recommend to try it out I would definitely come back
5,"5 stars is right. Arguably the best pizza I&apos;ve had in Houston.

Awesome lil wine/pizza bar that&apos;s great for dates or just a casual outing. Highly recommend! Vibes of the place make you feel like you aren&apos;t in Houston."
4,"Good pizza in the quiet part of Midtown. You wouldn&apos;t notice the place if you randomly drove by it. The inside reminds me more of a cafe than a pizza shop.

I took my order to go. My margherita pizza came out ten minutes after order. It cooled down quickly on my 8 minute drive home. The crust is thicker and more filling than Pizaro or Piola and cheaper too. I liked that it had small globs of buffalo mozzarella which added to the value plus a long stalk of basil set on the side.

I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order this again off of Uber Eats."
4,"I&apos;m starting this review off of vibe and brew solely while I wait for my pie to be ready. 

First off, my receipt included two discounts; $2.25 off the pizza and $2.50 off the brew (I don&apos;t ask questions, jus swipe n move) .. pretty dope start to the experience I try to be as frugal as possible. Secondly, southern hospitality man .. always something I look for at my establishments.

Anybody that knows me knows how I feel about pizza .. I was looking for a new place to try around me and this place had 5 stars. Five. My interest was piqued. So far the vibe is hipster and chill jus like they say everywhere else, but not that overwhelming annoying forced hipster .. more so chill. So we&apos;re at a hopeful 3 stars right now for vibe, discounts, and the southern hospitality. 

Alright so the pizza came. I see why they all have 5 stars .. it was amazing. I always go for pepperoni the first time I&apos;m trying a place to judge it properly and .. yes. Even though the pepperoni has a slight honey taste to it (I don&apos;t like sweets usually, or mixing my sweet and savory food) it was still delicious. The little personal note written on my box is right up my alley, I love letting people know how much I appreciate them with words. 

If I had to speak directly to the establishment about my experience .. I would simply jus say thank you .. a genuine thank you. I&apos;m very skeptical about giving full 5 stars no matter how much I adore a place .. because that means they have no room for improvement at all .. but seriously when I go back to try 2-3 more pies .. if my experience is anything like the one I jus had .. they&apos;ll get 13 stars from me. 

Again, thank you guys .. you&apos;re appreciated. Oh, and they serve complimentary basil! Even if it wasn&apos;t fresh, I appreciate the sentiment."
5,"Who knew that while quarantine was making me distant from friends and stuck at home all day - that it would bring me one of my new favorite Houston pizzas!!!? Thank u for take out and delicious crust Gypsy poet you are a good one. 

1. Pepperoni madness - obviously a must try. It has honey on it so it&apos;s kind of a no brainer (the shine you see is not due to oily peps as much as it is that sweet honey goodness). It&apos;s crust is so chewy and actually flavorful!! 

2. The 5 cheese - the extra cheeses really elevate this pizza. If you like strong cheese (blue cheese etc) this is for you!! (I have been known to get a side of honey for this pizza too.....)

3. Fancy backpacker - I thought this pizza was yum and I appreciated that the topping came on the side so they didn&apos;t get all weird during their travel to my home. I am partial to the first 2 on the list, but if this flavor sounds good to you definitely give it a try. They have truffle oil on it which actually was INCREDIBLE, but the reason I wouldn&apos;t get it again is because of my personally preferences on prosciutto on pizza. (I need small bite size pieces instead of a huge slab! Who can relate?) 

This place is so cute inside and has some outdoor seating as well. They seem to always have some fun local artists on display and have great customer service. I can&apos;t wait for when they open and I can compare their pizza there to the pizza in my living room. 

Ps - they write little notes on the takeout box (quotes, thank you, etc) and it makes me feel so cool to have found a local place that does a little thing like that (Pizza Hut would never). I officially feel like a local houstonite/houstonian?"
5,"I. Love. This. Place. 

Best pizza in Houston, with the coolest (and cutest!) people that work there, who are fun and friendly. 

Pepperoni Madness is MY FAVE!!!"
5,"Best pizza in Houston, or maybe in my life. You can tell the ingredients are fresh and the pizza is so flavorful, you definitely get your money&apos;s worth. I&apos;ve ordered to go and dine in from here and I was impressed on both occasions. They have a cute artsy inside dining area with couches and tables plus an outdoor area with picnic tables. The staff was SO nice and kept the place very clean. I will be back again and again!"
