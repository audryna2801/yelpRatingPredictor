5,"Wow, great quality and freshness! I was looking for sushi delivery and I ended giving The Blue Fish a try.. and I was really impressed. I ordered a spider roll, spicy tuna, and The Blue Fish Roll. Believe it or not a great spider roll can be hard to find, and this place was spot on! Spicy tuna and Blue Fish roll had super fresh fish and good flavor. I wasn&apos;t too into the cucumber wrapping (instead of nori) for the Blue Fish roll, but the quality of fish made up for that.

My review here is for delivery service. Food came in a pretty timely manner considering all the traffic around the area. Sushi was well packages (each roll came in its own container), ample soy and wasabi, and disposable chopsticks provided.

Price is slightly on the higher side, but you can&apos;t beat the quality and variety. Def more to try next order.."
5,"My favorite spot for Spicy Tuna Rolls. I know super basic but most places don&apos;t actually give you &quot;spicy&quot; in your spicy tuna rolls. Service
never disappoints. Happy hour menu is legit. And the sake is delish. I do really like their cucumber flavored sake and their lychee martinis. COVID precautions are taken seriously and there is sufficient space amongst parties."
5,"I have been going to Blue Fish since they first opened and it never disappoints. The downtown location was unexpectedly closed when we arrived on a Friday for lunch, so we made our way to the Washington location. Miso soup, specialty rolls, sushi and cocktails were fresh and delicious. We had a very friendly and efficient server. All staff were wearing masks and they have tables spaced out for social distancing."
4,"I ordered delivery and was very pleased that they sealed the bag and the containers inside were taped and safely packaged.   I appreciated the effort they put in to ensure customers are comfortable and avoid any contamination while being delivered.

Shrimp temura roll was good.  If you are ordering to go, I would suggest that you select the option to put the dressing on the side.  Mine was soggy but next time I will select that option and I think it will help. Otherwise the roll was good.

Miso soup was good and garlic broccoli was a nice side.
The vegetable tempura was ok but I liked that you could select which vegetables that you wanted.  The sweet potato could have been a little softer."
5,"My husband and I love Blue Fish. Charlie, Mia, and the rest of the gang always take care of us and make it a very enjoyable experience. 

We highly recommend the Ahi Tower to start. For rolls, we always get the Rock Manhattan and the Rainforest. 

Hands down our favorite sushi restaurant in Houston!"
4,Didn&apos;t think I would like it but I was amazed. I don&apos;t usually eat sushi but I did today for my girlfriend restaurant birthday adventure. Luckily upon arrival not that many people was there which was amazing lol. Can&apos;t remember the names of the dishes but they where freaking amazing. Check out the pictures but the pictures do not do any justice. Employees where super professional and also helped with explaining what  certain dishes where on the menu. The establishment looks amazing as well and all employees followed covid protocol with mask gloves an enforcing social distancing. Highly recommend this restaurant
4,"Great service and tasteful food to match! We enjoyed everything we ordered which was: spicy edamame, squid salad, salmon belly, tuna, popcorn shrimp, calamari, and tofu. The dishes that stood out the most to me were the tofu and salmon belly.  I&apos;m only knocking a star off because the parking situation was a little confusing. It was an empty lot and the only option was valet, not a big deal as we were able to find parking on the street, but I just didn&apos;t see the reason to valet the car. Other than that great place with a good atmosphere. I&apos;d recommend it to others!"
4,"I have to start by saying I am not a huge sushi fan. I was persuaded to venture out of my comfort zone and build up the courage to try some raw fish. All things considered, I thought The Blue Fish was a great introduction for well prepared and fresh sushi. My boyfriend is a huge sushi lover and he was very impressed with everything he tried-- especially the albacore tuna! After trying a bit of the Blue Fish Tower, I ordered the Crab Pot Stickers and the Beef Bulgogi. They were both delicious and fabulous options for the cooked food lovers like me! Overall, The Blue Fish is a great restaurant if you&apos;re alright with smaller portions and pricey meals (after all- it is sushi!)."
4,"Went here last night as part of my BIRTHDAY WEEK! (Yes I said week lol) Anyway, the food was pretty good. We got the Lobster roll and Lava roll, me personally I like the Lava better than the lobster. Next we had the noodles and shrimp fried rice, BOTH were amazing. Service was good, nothing special but not bad either. Restaurant presence was very nice! The bar area is gorgeous!"
5,"Soothing environment. Crab cake is crunchy on the outside which I like. The Miami Vice is my fav! The waitress recommended the Asian Pear Margarita it turned out good, it&apos;s sweet."
5,"Came to Houston for a weekend with family. This place was recommended by our aunt. 

We were seated as soon as we got to the restaurant. 

Parking is easy as the have a parking lot with ole ty of space. 

We were serviced by Kyle, his service was outstanding. 

I ordered the Alaska roll and added cream cheese to it. 

We also preserved a dragon rolls, spicy tuna, chicken teriyaki and miso soup and kids bento box. 

Everything was cooked to perfection. 
 
The chicken teriyaki was ok not amazing but good. The miso soup very normal. Really good but up to expectación. 

The Alaska roll was really good  with cream cheese, maybe I would add a bit of crispy to it to make it perfect. 

They serve beer and also have Japanese sprite. Food came out quick, in about 10-15 minutes and it was a large party. Ambience is casual and once again, service was awesome."
4,"Came here on a weekday for lunch at 11am. Really large building and huge parking lot for the Rice Military area. We were the first ones there, and I think about 5-10 tables filled up by 12/1pm. 

We ordered a variety of rolls (mega lobster, samurai, rainbow etc) and some apps (tuna tower, fried chicken (spoiler not great)), and some yellowtail and salmon sashimi. I like the rolls here because they don&apos;t try to be authentic or anything and is just unabashedly fusion/deep fried/ full of random sauces. Service was good, food is decent, parking lot is ridiculously big. Overall a good place for American style sushi that everyone can appreciate"
1,"My wife and I have been dining here for nearly nine years. After Valentine&apos;s Day was &quot;cancelled&quot; because of the ice storm, we decided to celebrate in belated fashion last night. The hostesses were very rude and acted as if they wanted us to leave. We came about 45 minutes before the restaurant closed. The pregnant lady had a very nasty attitude towards us I am sorry to say. I explained that we had been coming there for years, and they chilled out a little bit, but gave us a crappy table all the way at the back, and started lecturing us about the proper way to visit the restroom. Our server was great and the food was as good as ever. I spent about 100$ on dinner, so about half what I would normally spend, but unfortunately the rude host staff had ruined our night. They didn&apos;t even acknowledge us leaving on our way out. Next time we are in the market for sushi I will find a place that keeps their hostesses on a shorter leash, and does not allow unskilled, talentless hostesses (all 3 were rude) to pretend they are in charge."
4,"Good neighborhood sushi spot. The service is always incredible, hats off to the entire staff for consistently good service. Our favorite rolls are the Rock Manhattan roll and the Shark Bait roll, and for happy hour can&apos;t go wrong with the popcorn shrimp and a salmon avocado roll. 

Taking off one star because it is 1) a bit pricey for what it is and 2) hit or miss on some of the food items, but the menu is large and I&apos;m sure has something for everyone"
4,"Nice quick spot for sushi! We stopped by on a Sunday night without a reservation and were sat immediately. Our server was kind, polite and attentive. They have sheets where you can place your order. For our appetizers we ordered: stuffed jalapeños (4/5) stuffed crabby goodness, yellow tail   (5/5) I absolutely love yellow tail! The sriracha adds a nice little kick to it!

Our main dishes we ordered:
-Lobster Roll (4/5): This is their infamous roll! It is quite appetizing and most of all FILLING!

-Miami Vice (3/5) &amp; Sundae Roll (3/5) both were decent to me!!

I would definitely come back. It&apos;s close to our house and the ambiance is nice!"
1,"We went to Blue Fish tonight.  Our food and service were excellent and we were seated a comfortable distance away from other tables. initially in the bar area.  About halfway through our meal people started to arrive and seat themselves at a six-top table next to us. By the time we finally got up and left, the six-top had expanded to two tables of 15-20 people who were literally on top of us.  While all walked in with masks, they immediately took them off and made the rounds to hug everyone at the table and then linger around ours.  No social distancing and no regulation from the management. 
We  got up to leave  due to the crowding and talked to the manager on duty.  Her response was that they kept adding people, but she made no attempt to correct the situation or putting the employees and other patrons at risk.  We usually go to Blue Fish a few times a year, but will look for a new place.  It is hard when we are trying to support our local restaurants and they won&apos;t follow even basic guidelines to provide a safe dining experience."
2,"I tried The Blue Fish for the first time this past weekend for a friend&apos;s birthday, and was left unimpressed. I ordered two items through the course of the dinner. The first was the Salmon Tartare on crispy rice cake, and the second was the Blue Fish Tower.

 I&apos;m not a fan of spicy food, so when the first item came out, and I realized it was spicy, I decided to order the second. The first was an understandable mistake on both my part and the restaurants because although the item was not mentioned to be spicy on the sushi menu, it was noted on the full menu. However, for the second item, it was entirely on the restaurant. 

Before ordering the Blue Fish Tower, I had checked both the sushi menu and full menu, and neither mentioned that the Salmon was spicy. I also made sure to double check with our server, and he also assured me that it was not spicy. However, when it was brought to the table I could tell without even trying it that it was spicy salmon, so again I question it with the server who reassures me that it&apos;s not spicy. Not wanting to make a fuss during a friend&apos;s birthday, I decide to give it a try. However, it was definitely spicy, making it unappetizing and unenjoyable for me.

At that point I didn&apos;t have much of an appetite left having struck out 2/2. Aside from being spicy, the items ordered were fine, but not amazing enough to justify the price point. The Salmon Tartare was $14, and the Blue Fish Tower was $16 for small portions of fish.

Overall, I would not return. Parking is a hassle since it&apos;s valet or paid street parking unless you want to park farther away, and there are plenty of other sushi restaurants in Houston."
5,Awesome!  Great service and incredible food!  Ricardo was very attentive and friendly.  Ambiance was nice and the music was at the perfect level!  The tofu was top notch.  Fried rice was perfectly prepared.  Our rolls were delicious!! We will be back!
5,"Had a great dinner here and looking forward to coming back. 

We came on a Saturday evening during Happy Hour (only available at the bar).  So we snagged seats at the bar and had a couple drinks and appetizer from the HH menu. Service was prompt, the drinks &amp; app were great, and we enjoyed a little bar time. 

Then we got a table for our meal. Our server, Kyle, was attentive, prompt, funny, and really took care of us during the evening (never even hinted we were taking too long at the table on a busy night; and we were there a long time chatting). So definitely try to get Kyle- he made it an even better experience. 

Food was fantastic - we tried the Rock Popcorn shrimp and thoroughly enjoyed its crispy, tasty flavor and the dips it came with!  Then moved on to rolls: Vegas (favorite!), Louisiana (tasty!), Dragon, and Sundae (2nd fave).  All were fresh, presented beautifully, and were good size- we didn&apos;t eat it all. 

We ordered a few more cocktails: Hibiscus Paloma and Grey Goose dirty martini. Paloma was a fun drink to try, sweet but with a tang. Try it! 

We valet parked, which is complimentary, and thought that was a nice touch as it made it easy. And had a fantastic evening. Looking forward to coming out again!"
4,"Love this place. Super easy to get in without a reservation. Friendly staff, great food. My only complaint is the valet. It&apos;s never busy enough to actually need it as the parking lot is never full, and with covid it&apos;s really frustrating to force someone to get in your car just to park it 20 feet away when most of the lot is empty."
