5,"Man... I love me some sushi; love me some simple, fresh, &amp; delicious options!

Oishii has def made one of my top favorite sushi joints! A great hand full of vegan options, and the prices are unbeatable. It&apos;s a busy spot, my friend who invited me shared that it&apos;s always like that. We waited for about 20 min to get seated for lunch, worth the wait!

I had the number 14. 
Vegetarian Sushi &amp; Maki Combo (contains no dairy per waiter)
So Good!

Can&apos;t wait to take the wifey!

COVID Notes
-Indoor seating available
-Social distance &amp; masks required.
-Customer service was delightful, safe, and helpful
-Ordering was effortless &amp; smooth
-No issues at all.

Thank you, Oishii, for having Vegan Options!"
5,"This is me and my husband&apos;s go-to sushi spot in Houston. We&apos;ve been coming here for date night about once a month for two years. The sushi is always - no matter what time of the week or the year we visit - super fresh and made to order. Even the deep fried appetizers are made to order. The tradeoff is that you have to wait a bit for your food, but we have always considered the wait worth it! 

The restaurant itself is very small (and at further reduced capacity due to COVID), so expect to wait if you are visiting on a weeknight or weekend. Your best bet is to CALL AHEAD and make a reservation as early in the day as possible. Friday and Saturday nights book very quickly! The good news is that the staff are a well-oiled machine and are stepping-and-fetching from the moment you&apos;re seated until you pay your check. The tiny adjacent parking lot is also very small and awkward to get in and out of, but not impossible.

We have visited enough that we have become familiar with the staff. We have only had a less than stellar experience with one young man who made a rude comment about the quantity of sushi in our order. Everyone else is always fast and very polite. They always have at least one server who doesn&apos;t wait on tables but refills water cups, so our glasses never get empty. This is a must with all the soy sauce!

Pros: Portions are generous and prices are fair, especially for the amount of food you get. The lunch specials and dinner combos are excellent value. Water cups stay full.

Cons: Parking can be a real pain, especially on weeknights and weekends. And if you are scheduling dinner on a weeknight or a weekend, you will have to wait for a table unless you make a reservation!"
4,"Solid sushi spot that is very popular in Houston. My fiancee and I got one of the specials that came with some sashimi and 3 rolls for $28. We also had miso soup. They were pretty solid portions, and the fish seemed pretty fresh.

The parking is very difficult here because the lot is tiny and usually pretty cramped. I have not been back here since COVID started so not sure how they are handling the pandemic."
3,"You&apos;ll never find as cheap of sushi for the quality you get. It&apos;s cheap but not typical of cheap sushi, which I would never touch because of the poor quality. 

Quality 3/5
Price 5/5

Not the best quality at all, but definitely not bad. For me it would be a good place for take out. It was packed inside so be prepared to wait 1.5 hours for even take out orders to be completed."
4,Super popular and affordable sushi spot! They are always busy so call ahead unless you have time to wait around. For Togo orders they will bring it to your car which is super convenient. Limited parking in front of the restaurant but they also have a small parking lot on the side.
5,"This is my go-to sushi spot in town, hands down! The prices are unbeatable for the quantity and quality you get, and the fish is so fresh every time (even when we order takeout). My faves are the sashimi plate (and within the sashimi plate, the salmon, escolar, and tuna), crazy sunny maki roll, and spicy salmon hand rolls. My only critiques are how minuscule the parking lot is and the number of attempts I have to make when calling to place a takeout order to finally get through (the line is ALWAYS busy and it takes on average 10 tries, no joke). Despite the logistical difficulties, I happily come back at least once a month because it&apos;s too dang good."
4,You can not beat the price here! I come to Oishii every time I crave for uni! And they delivered! I love me some fresh uni sashimi. Presentation is not at its finest but quality is great! Eel and chopped scallops are amazing too! Love!! Baked mussels app is also 1 of my fav. Haven&apos;t loved any of the rolls here tho. Happy hour can be a little busy. Expect to wait for an hr.
5,"Um wow. This place is sooooo good! So packed all the time so be prepared to wait. Luckily, I did not have to wait the day I went. 
The sushi is SO cheap! But I had their Masu (which I never can find anywhere except uchi and it&apos;s 8x the price! I was nervous cause it was so cheap but it was very good!
I had a soba bowl as well and the broth and noodles were delicious. 

I&apos;ll definitely be back!"
4,"What&apos;s the saying &quot;third times a charm&quot;? Yeah, it&apos;s true in this case. I&apos;ve tried Oishii twice before and both times have ended with stomachaches. Thankfully this time was so much better!

My friends chose Oishii as our place for dinner and I reluctantly agreed to join after my picnic at McGovern Centennial Gardens. The waitstaff was very accommodating to our party of seven. I can understand why people like Oishii so much, the prices are so cheap! I ordered the spider roll, rock n roll, and philadelphia roll and my tab came out to $13.53 before tip. It&apos;s really hard to beat those prices unless you venture out to Hokkaido on Bellaire Blvd. The rolls were tasty, but my only complaint was that vinegar in the rice was a bit too prevalent for me. 

All the workers were wearing masks, gloves, and the booths had a plastic barrier between them. I would give them an A as far as their Covid safety measures. 

Oishii is now on my list of options for cheap sushi places in the inner loop area. If only I would have made it to happy hour so I could have seen what it had to offer."
5,"Throughout college, I always stopped by here for happy hour and years later I&apos;m still doing this anytime I&apos;m back in Houston. They have a great happy hour selection on drinks and food all under $9!! And for the happy hour food, I believe it&apos;s but 3 get 1 free :) 
Can&apos;t beat the happy hour prices and food is pretty decent!"
5,"YALL LPT (only if you&apos;re dining in): When ordering from the menu look at the appetizers - it&apos;s BOGO FREE for $4.00 only. I ordered the spicy tuna roll, the dynamite roll (mixture of different fish sushi), tempura, and gyoza. So freaking filling - it could have been a whole meal by it self for only $8!"
5,"We showed up hungry and didn&apos;t think to take pictures before we dug in, but we had soooooo much food! 

It&apos;s always an awesome experience coming to Oishii, and even in the middle of the pandemic they are open and absolutely accommodating to make patrons feel safe and welcome. 

Anyone who&apos;s been in before knows they are usually very busy and with limited occupancy there is no change. So be prepared to wait a bit if you show up at a busy time I&apos;m pretty sure they&apos;re accepting to-go orders for folks wanting to eat delicious food in the comfort of their own homes! 

Edit: we were back and I remembered to take pictures this time. Yes, I was totally &quot;that guy&quot; in the restaurant but the food is beautiful AND delicious!!!"
2,"The food here is decent to below average. Service is super slow and waitress is not attentive. We waited for our meal for half an hour. Not a lot of parking spaces are offered. Staffs wear masks ,but the servers did not wear gloves. The sashimi/nigiri did not taste fresh. I would skip this place for sushi. The agedashi tofu is the smallest out of all the Japanese places I&apos;ve been to."
5,"Great quality sushi and very affordable! Fish is always fresh tasting.

They have awesome lunch specials. I always get the 9 piece sashimi and a side of sushi rice and the California roll.

I&apos;m always satisfied after coming here!!"
5,"So last night, I was watching sushi mukbangs and just had to get some the next day! I came here for happy hour and ordered most things not on the happy hour menu but the prices are so reasonable if not cheap that it didn&apos;t matter!

Must-have:
Seared salmon (my fave)
Salmon belly
A5 Wagyu (second fave. I&apos;m mad it melted in my mouth too fast)
Chopped scallop

Things worth trying:
Pork gyoza
Kani salad (people pleaser because it&apos;s basic)
Baked mussels
Salmon flower
Hamachi Kama (always a good choice anywhere)

I don&apos;t care too much for the maki. 
The quality of fish here is pretty on point and definitely worth the price. 
Don&apos;t get toro as sushi, get it as sashimi. 
Food came out quick. 
Rice is a little bit too vinegar-y for me but it didn&apos;t bother me too much.
Expect a wait because it&apos;s a small place.
Service was great.
I would suggest asking the waiter for popular items as some of this stuff was not on the actual menu."
4,"Let&apos;s get started:

Very, very small parking lot.  

During covid times, everyone who works here is wearing a mask and has gloves.   It is packed with customers and we got lucky for a table.  

Sushi price wise is so cheap. The salmon was fresh, the unagi baked well that I didn&apos;t run into any bones, the yellowtail was buttery, but sadly the tuna and tuna toro was a no go with the cuts not removing all the veins. 

Hand rolls were delicious. 

Monk fish liver was one of the better ones I&apos;ve had, uni was so so and wasn&apos;t as fresh as I would&apos;ve like, ocean trout was too fishy for me, but my friend loved it so it&apos;s up to your palate on this one.  

Would I go again?  For sure!"
4,"Sushi was worth the wait! We tried to call for take out and either the number wasn&apos;t working or they were just so busy that we couldn&apos;t get through. But we decided to just go in and order to go. The wait for to go was 1 hour and dine in was 30 minutes so we dined in and only had to wait 15 minutes. Happy hour deal was great for drinks and apps. Staff was nice but our sushi took quite a long time. You can definitely tell this place has regulars and they are favored for sure. Nonetheless, they have a great variety of rolls and everything was really good."
5,"Reviewing as a vegetarian. There are so many options here for vegetarians!! I love the egg options and always add cream cheese to the vegetable roll. Also liked the mushroom rolls (add cream cheese). The place is a bit cramped feeling, but they technically do maintain all Covid related precautions. It&apos;s a small space though, so expect a wait unless you call ahead or have a small party size."
5,"I love the happy hour here! I&apos;d recommend coming about an hour before you want to eat to put your name on the list if you&apos;re going during happy hour because it gets really packed (even for weeknight happy hours). The parking lot is super small, but you can park in the lot just to the left of the restaurant too when stores are closed. I&apos;ve never had a problem with the service here; they&apos;re always fast to refill your water and nice about getting you extra sauce if you want.

Things I&apos;ve tried:
Fried gyoza (pork dumplings): standard, decent
Tempura pickles: so good with the spicy mayo, if you like fried pickles, highly recommend these!
Veg. Tempura roll: slightly larger than the other rolls, crispy
Dynamite roll (mixed fish): decent, cheap mixed fish sushi but it&apos;s hard to really get the fish flavors
Fried bananas: a nice sweet way to end your meal, comes with whipped cream
Spicy salmon: what you&apos;d expect
Oshinko roll (pickle radish): Good pickled radish
Seaweed salad: good standard seaweed salad, not on happy hour
Eel roll: good, not on happy hour menu
Soft shell crab roll: good, not on happy hour menu

Not a fan of: 
Kanpyo roll (squash): didn&apos;t have much flavor, tasted like sweet potato
Ika tempura (fried squid): really oily and chewy, didn&apos;t like
Kani sunomono (crab and cucumber salad in vinaigrette: did not like"
