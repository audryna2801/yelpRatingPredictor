5,"This was a great choice from start to finish! Upon arriving the doors opened exactly at 11am with the manager welcoming everyone in with a smile, warmth and love. We were seated right away and the waiter Ava was amazing from the first hello; she made great recommendations and boy was she right about the cold but warming to the soul BC ice tea! (Yummy) and not to mention the breakfast shot; yes it&apos;s a shot of bourbon, oj and bacon on the side! (I know it&apos;s a must see and taste to believe) I was seated with a party of 7 and we ordered most of the menu (haha); (the menu is limited.. yup you guessed it due to Covid) anyway; the options available were amazing. We had the pancakes, chicken sausage, burrito, veggie omelette, fruity pebbles French toast, burger and fried chicken and some other stuff... I&apos;m still full and probably won&apos;t eat for another day. LoL 

Anyway, everything was great, unique flavors, served hot, presented well and hearty. It was Valentine&apos;s Day so it was fairly packed. I have to add that I&apos;m visiting from out of town but felt so at home at this restaurant, the manager and his wife were so friendly, funny and welcoming. He checked on our table and ensured service was amazing and it definitely was. ( thanks Ava) I will come back here again and can&apos;t wait until the entire menu is available. This is definitely a new favorite for me! Can&apos;t wait for my next visit!! Make sure to visit this spot, it&apos;s a must. Ohhhh and the atmosphere is so chic, rustic and trendy. Perfect for couples, family, friends and private events."
5,"2020 was a crazy awful year but at least my Thanksgiving dinner was amazing. We had great service from a wonderful young lady named Christina. We had a little chat with her while waiting for our fabulous dinner to arrive. Found out she&apos;s Cuban and came from Miami like me. 
I also met another young Cuban guy who was very nice as well. Ok back to our bomb AF food. Check out the pics and menu of what they served. 
Since the pandemic didn&apos;t let us get together with the family we decided to do our own thing for once in 24 years. No Regrets at all. I&apos;m looking forward to my next holiday dinner."
5,Visited during covid. Quite busy but they manage to distance tables and all servers are properly masked. Enjoyed my entree immensely. Had the smokehouse Benedict and swapped the pork for chicken. Yum yum. Perfectly cooked.
5,"This place was so good! I came here with my girls on a Sunday for brunch. We got a carafe that easily serves enough for 4 people to have 2 rounds. 
We got the mushroom chillaquille, which were to die for. But not only that the totchos were bomb.com
If you go, you have to get the fruit pebbles French toast with ice cream! All the portion sizes were big as well and easily shareable. 
Over all my friends and I are vegetarian, and they were able to accommodate to us!"
5,"I want to start by saying the only reason why I gave it a 5 star is because our server Jacklyn went above and beyond to make my experience better, I just lives off her energy. Food wise it was a 3/5 and I&apos;ll tell you why. I&apos;ve never in my life ordered something and return it. I also don&apos;t like giving servers a hard time, but I gave her my feedback after she asked me how was it; my response was the Shrimp &amp; Grits I ordered was not good at all. Usually if I don&apos;t like it, I&apos;ll probably just take it to go &amp; probably never eat it or have them trash it. 

Okay, so when I tasted my shrimp &amp; grits; my first reaction was like why is this tomato sauce so acidic &amp; salty? And then when I took a few more bites I started to get a heartburn. At the same time the grits were thick and I&apos;m not a fan of that, I like mine to be a bit creamy. In addition, my shrimps were small &amp; for a $24 dish I expected the shrimp to be bigger. My server came to check on us and she can see the dissatisfaction on my face, so she asked me if I wanted something else. I told her no because I&apos;m not one of those hard to please customers, she responded by saying &quot;I want to make your experience worth coming back&quot; that right there is the reason why I am giving this place a 5 star, so y&apos;all thank her for that. 

I went ahead and ordered the Carolina BBQ salmon, the fish was cooked perfectly, pink &amp; glistening in the inside. My spinach complemented the salmon; I didn&apos;t really enjoy the BBQ sauce, so next time I&apos;ll just ask them not to put it on. I will say that I enjoyed my salmon 10 times more than the shrimp &amp; grits. I&apos;m not a chef but my advice is whoever is the chef needs to reevaluate that tomato sauce because it was out of line. It literally overpowered the entire dish. 

Overall AMAZING service, I enjoyed the salmon but not the shrimp &amp; grits. At the end, Jacklyn was so sweet &amp; brought us out a couple of complementary mini donuts to make up for the food, that was such a nice gesture. Will I come back? Yes."
4,"Solid go-to brunch or whiskey lover spot. Their most popular food items are the fruity pebbles french toast and the donut burger! I&apos;m not much of an Instagram foodie anymore, so we ordered the not as cute options: short rib chilaquiles (pictured in front), shrimp and grits (not pictured) and smokehouse Benedict (pictured in back). 

Drinks are bomb. They have a whiskey wall/room with so many options. We got a few rounds of mimosa carafes for the table and a wake up call.

One thing to note: they can be very pushy about the 1.5-2hr time limit (which is allowed and totally understandable!! However, they reminded us several times - on the phone during reservation, on the phone to confirm day of, when seated, and 10 minutes after ordering). We were well under the time but felt rushed, so 1 star off for that.

I&apos;ll definitely be back for brunch, and hopefully I won&apos;t feel as rushed next time bc the food and ambiance is great!"
5,"You know what I love better than good food? Great customer service. Last evening I went back to one of my favorite spots Bosscat for a quick bite and drinks before I hit the town. I ordered the 12 hour short rib meal. In short there was way more cheese in those scallop potatoes than necessary. The manager came over after the meal and asked about it. I shared my feedback. He shared from the looks the food wasn&apos;t prepared to their standards. He took care of it for me. I have had many great meals here and the service is always excellent. We also continued to drink and drink some more. Here are a few recommendations of libations from last night we had to get your evening started:
the bosscat * the bosslady * the good life * wouldn&apos;t you"
4,"I&apos;ve been to Bosscat a handful of times and it&apos;s always enjoyable. The servers and bartenders are friendly and the place has a chill fun energy, but with a sense of classiness. It&apos;s the type of place you want to go with friends for drinks after work, a date or for brunch (my favorite). The staff wear their masks properly which is much appreciated during this time.

Their cocktail menu has a variety of options that you can&apos;t go wrong with. They specialize in whiskey drinks for my fellow whiskey lovers. My favorite drink is the Boss Lady, or something like that. As far as food, I have only had their brunch, which is pretty delicious and filling!

Also, they do have a small patio on the side and surprisingly, it&apos;s dog friendly!"
4,Super cute place with lots of fun art/decor/furniture. Went for drinks one night with 10 people and was able to have a large semi-secluded table which was awesome. Drinks were perfection. Highly recommend!
4,"What a great place for brunch! We came here to celebrate a friends new job and as a going away brunch before she leaves the city. 

The restaurant was decorated for Christmas and we loved how decorations fit in with the whisky bar decor. The staff was attentive, friendly, and was always wearing masks for covid protection. The tables were spaced out and I felt very safe coming here during covid. 

We started with a strong cup of coffee which I loved! I ordered the breakfast burrito and my boyfriend got the Smokehouse Benedict which were both amazing! The breakfast burrito had a nice crisp on the outside and a great combination of egg, cheese, and sausage inside! The spicy chicken sauce on the side was a great bonus and added the perfect amount of flavor to your burrito. The Benedict was also very tasty and came with a hearty serving of potatoes which were perfectly cooked and crispy! 

Overall the food and service was great! Will have to come back to try their whisky list and dinner menu!"
3,"Went to Bosscat a few years back and had a lackluster experience but, decided to go with the flow when a friend picked this place for their birthday. 

Love the indoor outdoor option that opens their &quot;garage&quot; doors and lets you sit near there instead of all the way inside.  Definitely helped to curb my covid anxiety. 

The drinks were okay, not anything to write home about. The appetizers were pretty good including the Buffalo chicken dip and the pig candy, which was their play on cracklins. I ended up getting the short rib as my main entree. Well, honestly we all did because it seemed to be the best option on the menu. It didn&apos;t disappoint, it was tender flavorful and a pretty generous portion.

Overall, Bosscat is pretty good. I wish their whiskey beverages were better considering they boast on being a whiskey bar but otherwise, I&apos;d go back - for the short rib anyway."
5,"Top spot for quality American food. Great location to chill, eat some good food. . Ample seating inside and out. Friendly, knowledgeable staff is accommodating and ready with suggestions should you request. The food is absolutely spectacular. 
The food is fresh! We had a burger &quot;the chef&apos;s way&quot; and let me tell you. It wax a mix of flavors that all come together as a sparkling symbiosis. 
The staff is very helpful, attentive and at the service of their clients. They have a special policy to help you if you feel unsafe.
There is so much more to say! I will be back and I highly recommend this restaurant!!
This is a really cool place to hang out indeed"
1,"I&apos;m so sorry to leave this review. I know it happens every now and again but I got food poisoning and I&apos;m literally afraid to look in the direction of this place. This is why it&apos;s taken me damn near a year to write this review. 

I love the ambiance. The drinks. I don&apos;t even remember what I had but I believe that I found it tasty though I did realize that something was off. It wasn&apos;t until things were coming out of the top and the bottom of me that I realized that something was WAAAAAY off. God help me!!!

I wanted to love this place. Unfortunately I can never go back. I even missed my flight because of this (pre-covid). Sux. Truly."
5,"So, I&apos;m not a real vegan but this has to be the best vegan anything I have ever had. The mushroom that&apos;s used as the protein is packed with a lot of flavored and the texture is still meaty. The bun is soft and has a nice outside crisp to it. I&apos;d take this over a real burger any day. 
I normally sit at the bar and the bar tenders are always kind, attentive, and they make sure you&apos;re satisfied! 

The music and the lighting of the restaurant provides you with a nice chill but fun ambiance."
3,"I was looking forward trying their 12-hour beef short ribs, the meat was very very tender and was just right but everything else around it was very salty. I also ordered pig candy, Dr. Pepper chicken and whiskey okra and they were all salty! I think the taste (recipe) of the food was good but was overwhelmed by salt, if they cut their salt in half or more, it would be great. The ambiance and staff were great."
5,Great ambiance! Service was great and terrible at the same time. Our waitress and server were amazing. Hostess was rude. Food was meh - not good not bad! I would return because the place is a good hangout.
4,"Drink: The Bosslady wild turkey bourbon, citrus, seasonal berries, flowers. It was delicious and refreshing especially since I am a whiskey novice. 

Appetizer: fried oysters with comeback sauce. The oysters were amazing, fried to perfection and the comeback sauce was excellent. 

Crispy fried chicken sandwich and Mac and cheese. I loved the chicken. It was flavorful and seasoned well. The Mac and cheese was very cheesy and creamy. 

Very good first experience! I&apos;ll be back for happy hour soon."
5,We came in from out of town and wanted a place with great food.  The wood and brick combination created a dark intimate atmosphere and ambiance.  The whiskey room is a site to see.  Their fried apple pie is one of the best apple desserts I ever ate. We loaded up on appetizers and enjoyed every one.  The beef short rip with au gratin potatoes was awesome.
5,"Now this is a place to go to for brunch. Everything was absolutely amazing. There was a long wait, even with Covid. I waited about 45 mins to get a table but so worth the wait! What attracted me to this place was seeing pictures of the fruity pebbles french toast and wow it&apos;s a must get item! They put condensed milk on it and it&apos;s definitely a game changer. All the food we ordered was great and the service as well. Our server was amazing, she was so nice and checked up on my table frequently even when the restaurant was so busy"
5,"First time here, as we were visiting from Atlanta. From start to finish, everyone was friendly and service was immaculate. We had the gulf shrimp &amp; grits and corn crusted catfish with the mushroom risotto. Both dishes were amazing, it was a lot of food so they boxed it up for us to go. Update: it almost tasted better the next day! 
The drinks were as good as they looked! 
The actual restaurant aesthetic: amazing, and restrooms were extremely clean. When we&apos;re in Houston again we will be visiting and ASK FOR RIGO! He was so attentive and gave great recommendations."
