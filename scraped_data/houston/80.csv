5,"Was craving a bagel one day and came across this place on Yelp. If a place has hundreds of reviews and they&apos;re over the 4 star mark, you know it&apos;ll be good. Yelp didn&apos;t let me down. 

It&apos;s in a small commercial strip and apparently they previously occupied another building in the same strip and moved. It&apos;s small but due to COVID, they have a good system to get people in and out. Trust there will be lots of people because they&apos;re just they good. If you don&apos;t like waiting, you can place your order online and make it an even shorter trip. 

On to the bagels, so far I&apos;ve just gotten the Garlic/Onion bagel with schmear and as a breakfast. Each time it was fresh and delicious and I&apos;m almost embarrassed to say how many times I&apos;ve been seen finding it. Might even go today - just THAT good."
5,"I love this bagel place!! I came here one weekend for a deli sandwich and loved the bagel and spread so much that I came back the next day for another deli sandwich. 

I tried smoked turkey and roast beef on my deli sandwich (two different days I went), and on a plain bagel with plain cream cheese. You can add on veggies as you wish, and you can pick the bagel/spread you want on it. Adding spread costs a little bit extra but I think it&apos;s worth it. I loved how they give you a generous amount of meat/spread on the sandwich. The bagels are delicious and fresh, and the cream cheese to top it off is excellent. 

This place has a line out the door on weekends, and for good reason!! Hot Bagel has been careful about COVID precautions, limiting the capacity in the shop, not allowing dine-in, and requiring masks. 

I&apos;ll definitely be back for more bagel sandwiches. I understand why people line up to get bagels from here. Try ordering online if you don&apos;t want to be in that line! 

Parking situation: on-site, but can be limited with how popular this place is!"
5,"Best bagels in Houston, please don&apos;t argue with me on that, ok you can BUT id still win haha...No but seriously they are so good. I usually get a bagel sandwich, eggs and cheese and their delicious veggie cream cheese *drools. I also order a few plains, strawberry and my favorite: blueberry. Their cream cheeses are so good too!! Strawberry cream cheese?! yes please 
You can order ahead of time or in person and they work pretty fast.
I highly recommend you give it a try!"
2,"i was excited to check this place out since i was in the area and because i love a good bagel and this shop has good reviews. 
pros: decent bagel, tasteful shmear. 
cons: wait was EXTREMELY long, no type of social distancing while waiting outside in line or inside the shop. employees are packed together. lack of customer service - pretty much nonexistent. 
i was very annoyed with how SLOW the line was moving and also with how none of the employees acknowledge customers in line whether they&apos;re waiting inside or outside. 2/10 experience for my first time and i most likely won&apos;t go back since it is out of the way. 
i would recommend online ordering to skip the wait and to be away from everyone else."
5,"Keep calm and eat a bagel! The Hot Bagel Shop in Houston, TX is a powerhouse of bagels and other bakery items. The Hot Bagel Shop is known for its New York-style bagels. From the reviews, I hear that from reviews, that the shop is very crowded in the mornings. I believe it. So prepare for that. When I went in, it was the early afternoon after the lunch hour which is perfect. There were no lines what so ever. The team members of The Hot Bagel Shop were very helpful. I struggle sometimes with trying to figure out what I want when I go somewhere for the first time.

From my experience, I saw that they also sold their cream cheese separately just in case you wanted something a little extra. They have so many different types of cream cheese, it&apos;s so hard to choose. 

 I ended up ordering an Everything Bagel toasted with sausage, egg, American cheese, tomato, cucumber, chives creams cheese, and red onion. Just a combination of FLAVOR. 

They sell out fast with certain bagels so make sure that you get there early!  I recommend trying out The Hot Bagel Shop!"
4,"This place is so popular and it is always busy, parking can get a little crazy. I got there at around 1pm, they already sold out several flavors of bagels. Service was fast, got my bagels right away after I ordered. The bagels are big, taste fresh and delicious, go perfectly well with the house made cream cheese. The cream cheese tastes just like the Philadelphia ones. Highly recommend the blueberry bagel, so good! A perfect simple and quick breakfast!"
5,"I love this place! The bagels are great, and they are very generous with the cream cheese. My husband had one of the pizza bagels and loved it. The service is quick and friendly. The prices are very reasonable. I wish I lived closer, but will certainly go out of my way for these bagels."
5,Very good bagels and spreads. This is probably the best bagel shop in town. They do a good job of controlling the flow of traffic in their store.
5,"While looking on Yelp for a bagel place this morning we came across the Hot Bagel Place. There was a line out the door when we got there (although I&apos;m not a fan of ever standing in line we know it is a good sign when there is a line). The bagels are very good, especially the sweet ones. We tried blueberry, Apple cinnamon and banana walnut, they were all good. The cream cheeses are also very good, tasty and good quality. We did not enjoy the mini-dogs though, tasted stale, not the best thing on their menu."
4,"Really good bagel sandwiches! Wow. The cream cheese is just another level and they pack that cream cheese layer LIBERALLY on the sandwich which I love! That to me is the star of the sandwich. The reason of 4 stars is bc the ordering is kind of confusing. I tried making an order online but it only showed for the next day. I called to clarify and she said she could take the orders over the phone or we can submit it online and to give the names of the orders to ensure it&apos;ll be made that day. Kind of bizarre. Also, when picking up the food it was hectic with hand raising as it&apos;s format to call out who didn&apos;t get their food or who should be next to pick up food but nonetheless a pretty good breakfast sandwich and enjoyed it!"
5,"First time in today and wow--I&apos;ve seriously been missing out! I went for lunch and picked up a sausage dog, two honey wheat bagels and a insanely large cookie. The menu selection was still vast, even mid-day. The cashier was super friendly and knowledgeable (the mustard on the sausage dog was SPOT ON!) The bagel was fresh and the cookie is every cookie monster&apos;s dream! I will be back ASAP!"
5,"Although I have had a favorite bagel shop and bakery since the late 70s, the hot bagel shop is quickly becoming my favorite bagel in Houston, this small shop packs a mighty punchAnd I have never had anybody give me a negative review about them"
5,"My bagel was indeed hot and very delicious, staff was friendly and fast. Portion is more than fair for the price in my opinion. I was sad they were out of the jalapeño bagel but I will be back to try it!"
5,Best Bagels in town! Im from New York and these bagels took me all the way back there!
4,This is specifically for their bagel dogs. They are excellent and well priced and served immediately. Think corn dog but in bagel dough instead. Their bagels still aren&apos;t amazing but the bagel dogs are worth the trip and the line. And it&apos;s nice they&apos;ve stayed open and have the line spaced out and everything pretty hygenic during covid.
4,"We are fortunate to live just two blocks from HBS. Love the new location and all the folks there are bright and cheerful in the mornings. I do have to say though, that they tend to go overboard on the spreads. My wife has started ordering her bagel just toasted and puts spread on when we get home. This morning I ordered mine with cream cheese and asked for a light spread. Well, when I got home I couldn&apos;t believe it. My bagel weighed almost 2 lbs. I scraped off a baseball size amount before diving in. 
Wish I could post a picture of this massive hunk of cream cheese left over."
3,"RECOMMEND THE BLUEBERRY &amp; JALAPENO bagels, JALAPENO SAUSAGE KOLACHE, &amp; HONEY WALNUT SPREAD.

blueberry- good flavor but wish it were softer
sesame
jalapeno- most unique. very soft
everything (supreme)
onion bialy
onion &amp; garlic

the rest of the bagels kinda tasted generic &amp; i expected softer bagels. i wouldn&apos;t go out of my way for these though or wait for them either. they are reasonably priced at $8.75 for half dozen combo (6 bagels + 2 medium 4 oz spreads).

JALAPENO SAUSAGE KOLACHE $1.89- this was good! large, juicy sausage!

ORIGINAL BREAKFAST SANDWICH $4.99- egg, bacon, i chose cheddar cheese on a supreme bagel. it was pretty large actually, but it wasn&apos;t anything too special. 

HONEY WALNUT and the CHIVES CREAM CHEESE spreads are delish! the honey walnut is more unique."
5,"I literally don&apos;t want to write this review because I want to be selfish about finding the best BAGEL shop EVER. Hubby and I haven&apos;t eaten a bagel since we left Las Vegas and if you know anything about bagels, Las Vegas is not a place for bagels.

We were trying to remember the last time we ate a bagel and we thought it was about 10 years ago. Really? 10 years? The only reason we even thought of trying this place out was because Lucky, our puppy, was getting groomed at the Petco across the way.

When we got here the line was out the door (always a good sign) but surprisingly the line went super fast. We didn&apos;t even wait 5 minutes. The staff behind the counter was working as fast as they could and the wait staff (2) at the register were ringing up the orders like pro.

Got a jalapeño bagel with salmon cream cheese, hubby got an everything with salmon cream cheese too, 6 mini dogs ($2.50 for 6), OJ and a bottle water. When we got our bagels they were toasted to perfection and had the most cream cheese laid on it like you wouldn&apos;t believe. You know how you go to bagel places and always want more cream cheese? This place packs on so much cream cheese that you can take some home and make another sandwich. The bagel was crispy, toasty and soft. Don&apos;t know if that makes sense but that&apos;s what a bagel should taste like. Schmear (the cream cheese) was delish. The whole meal as served up hot and if you wanted to you could share one bagel. Really, it&apos;s a robust serving.

In addition, we expected a $20 price and was pleasantly surprised to eat breakfast in H-Town under $13.00!

Now that we&apos;ve found this place we are def returning!"
4,"We read this was one of Houston&apos;s top three bagels shops so we braved the 30 minute tasting wait last Saturday morning. One of our ICU attendings had bought some for us last year but I hadn&apos;t had a chance to check the place out myself. I also grew up eating New York Deli and Coffee Shop off of Hilcroft so I had a Houston go to for bagels already. And more recently we had ordered Ess-a-bagel from NYC which is the gold standard for bagels. The kolaches from the minis to the full-size were delicious. The dough was just right. The regular bagels were spot on. The only reason I didn&apos;t give five stars is because we took some to go and whether they were in a paper bag or a plastic bag, all the bagels didn&apos;t do well overnight on the counter. So note to self, don&apos;t get too many extra because you won&apos;t get the same taste."
5,"The Hot Bagel Shop is such a wonderful hidden gem for a simple but tasty breakfast! I&apos;m wondering why I haven&apos;t come across this shop sooner! 
The Hot Bagel Shop offers a fairly large selection of bagels and spreads, along with bagel kolaches as well. Whether you want something savory or sweet, you&apos;ll have plenty of options and combinations to choose from. They also have pre-packaged spreads you can buy to take home! 
 
I ordered the a banana nut bagel with cinnamon honey butter spread, jalapeno and cheese sausage kolache, and breakfast bagel with sausage and egg. The jalapeno and cheese sausage kolache was definitely the winner out of the three items I tried. On the other hand, I would not order the breakfast bagel again because the flavor was lacking due to the uneven egg &amp; sausage to bagel ratio. I felt like I was eating a plain bagel. 

The place was really busy when I visited, with the line extending from the register to the door the entire time I was dining in. I didn&apos;t find the wait to be too long, because the turnover rate for each order was reasonable. Parking was a little difficult during busy hours, since the lot in front of the store has limited parking spaces. I ended up parking in a lot behind the complex."
