Most recently, we ordered a take-out spread consisting of Fresh Spring Rolls, a large bowl of #18 pho (beef noodle soup with eye round steak, well-done flank, fatty brisket, and soft tendon), and a chicken pho bowl with tofu. The spring rolls were sturdy and the filling boasted a variety of textures and subtle flavors. The peanut sauce on the side was incredible - pungent, punchy, and basically drinkable. My beef pho really hit the spot, and I was impressed with the complexity of the aromatic, meaty broth, especially when accented with just a few drops of sriracha and hoisin. After mixing everything together, the plentiful slices of beef, cilantro, red onions, and chewy noodles made for a delicious experience. My wife thought her chicken pho was just alright, so if you&apos;re on the fence - go beef!"
5,"Came here for brunch on a Monday morning. Parking was super easy - the plaza has a parking lot. I got the Chicken Rice Noodle Soup. It hit the spot, what else can I say. 

They have three different size options: Small, Medium, and Large. All with different prices. You can even select white or dark meat for the chicken in your noodle soup. I got the small and it was under $8, including tax. It was great. It also came with cilantro, mint leaves, etc.

The only criticism I had was that not all of the seats were placed six feet apart so be careful - COVID is no joke. They&apos;re not really mindful about seating other parties away from one another, so you have to be the one to ask them to seat you further. I&apos;d recommend going when they&apos;re slow or ordering to-go. They do not have outdoor seating."
5,"I&apos;ve gotten pho to-go from Pho Saigon a few times in quarantine, and it never disappoints. The value for your dollar is unbeatable, with large portion sizes, quality meat, and tasty broth."
5,"Food: 5/5
Service: 3/5
Cleanliness: 3/5
Decor &amp; Style: 3/5

In terms of taste: GREAT! In terms of everything else? ehhh, just okay. But hey, that&apos;s all most Vietnamese restaurants! Service is subpar (they come up to your table once or twice throughout the whole stay). Great flavor, great broth, what else do you need?"
4,"This spot was great! We ordered the pho with eye round steak and well done flank. The broth tasted amazing and the eye round steak was perfect, but there was a lot of fat on the well done flank. I would definitely come back here again but just order the pho with the eye round steak! The thai tea was also so delicious!"
2,"First time during this place in midtown.  I live just a few streets away and many people recommend this place so I figure if give it a try.  Before this, the only places I&apos;ve had pho was in Chinatown, Pho Tran and Pho Sapa, both great places with a rich broth.

There were a few things that made my first experience here disappointing.  On Yelp, it states their opening hours are 8am daily and that they updated their store hours 3 months ago.  I walk over and get there around 8:45 and I see they are just opening the window blinds.  The worker said they don&apos;t open until 9, I asked if it was just on Saturday because their hours on Yelp and  advertised on their door says they open at 8am.  No response.  ‚Äç

They let me sit down inside and waited until 9am for the waitress to take my order.  Every pho place I&apos;ve been to, whenever I order the special Pho (dac biet) I ask for the tai to be put separate so I can dip in the soup myself  and not have the meat overcook.  She said they could not do it on the dac biet because there is very little tai meat in it.  First time a pho restaurant has told me that living in Nola and Houston.  

I ordered the tai and gan, large.  Even with a large, there was not a lot of meat provided.  More disappointing was the soup broth.  It was too sweet and not a rich broth, it was really clear like a chicken pho broth and there was probably too much sugar and MSG in it.  

I took pictures of their updated menu with slightly higher prices than what was currently on Yelp."
5,"One of the best bowls of pho in houston
Pho dac biet plus get thai tea - cafe sua da - dessert"
1,Ordered spring rolls and I don&apos;t remember adding a side of hair. Im disgusted and I want to raise awareness that this place is unsanitary!
5,"Phantastic (I know...) place! Have been on noodle withdrawals since leaving New Orleans a few months ago. Found Pho Saigon on yelp with best reviews

Someone was waiting at the door to seat me immediately, took my order and had the appetizer out in 1 minute, noodles out within 2. The efficiency is unbelievable

The spring roll was great with the peanut sauce (a little sweeter than what I&apos;m used to, likely higher oyster sauce, but still very good)

The noodles were excellent, were not too dry nor too soggy. Broth had excellent flavoring as well

The sambala must have been house made as well because it had way more of a kick than standard store bought stuff

Will definitely come back whenever I&apos;m in Houston"
4,"This is a good spot if you are craving pho. I admit, other than the egg rolls, I have not had anything other than Pho. However, there is no need to eat anything else. Their broth is flavorful and not so fatty. There was only one time where the broth was diluted which made it a little bland, but they have been consistently good otherwise. Their egg rolls are also very good as the stuffing is very flavorful and they are deep fried to perfection. 

This place can get crowded but wait times are reasonable if there is a wait.  Service is fast as your food arrives in short order but anything after that can be a challenge.  The focus is getting your order on the table and onto the next customer they go. I normally don&apos;t mind this set up until I realize I forgot to order a drink or need something else.  

I will keep coming back for their pho, egg rolls, and occasionally, their iced coffee."
3,"I went yesterday and wanted to post a review. I ordered Vietnamese coffee and the beef Vietnamese sandwich to eat while I waited for the to go order of Vermicelli with Chicken. I asked the waitress if the chicken was white meat and she said yes. The coffee was good. The sandwich had very little meat on it and was dry but the bread was amazing. Thank goodness I ordered the extra meat and had to ask for fish sauce to put on the sandwich. The flavor of the meat was very good. When I was paying at the register, I asked the girl checking me out (and it was the same girl that took my order and said the chicken in my to go order was white meat)  if there was fish sauce in the to go order. I asked her 2 times and she said yes twice. When I asked my husband if the vermicelli with chicken was good and if it was white meat. He said it was NOT white meat and there was very little chicken in the order and NO fish sauce in the to go box which resulted in a dry bowl of noodles, veggies and a very small amount of chicken! We are still in search of a great Vietnamese restaurant that is reasonably priced. I won&apos;t be returning here."
5,"I come here often with my dad and they honestly have one of the best seafood pho&apos;s I&apos;ve ever had. the service is great, their food is amazing. Their sandwiches are 10/10 and while youre there you can&apos;t miss out on the mango boba smoothie."
4,"Affordable Vietnamese in the heart of Midtown? Say no more.

On the very rare days Houston gets cold, this will likely be my spot for getting some delicious pho. After all, food comes out very quickly here. We ordered a bowl of pho dac biet and bun thit nuong cha gio. Our dishes were out very quickly, allowing us to dig in fast.

The broth here isn&apos;t very salty, but I do have to say it pales in comparison to other noodle shops. It&apos;s not very dark and lacks the depth I think could come from roasting bones or an extra 30 minutes in the pot. The meat and green onion-to-onion ratio was great, however. I&apos;m always chuffed by brisket that isn&apos;t already overcooked by the time it arrives at my table. They&apos;ve got all the right herbs to go with your pho, but you&apos;re left with just a measly quarter of a lime wedge for the broth. As an avid citrus consumer, I&apos;d ask for more next time. 

My significant other thought the vermicelli was great. The egg rolls were crunchy and spiced with what tasted like a healthy dose of five spice. Don&apos;t have much else to say about it though, as he destroyed the bowl faster than I could snatch a few more bites. 

If you&apos;re in need of liquid comfort, might I suggest turning to this instead of other 21+ alternatives?"
1,"I have been here for many times, and today, the food was disappointing.   I had a Pho small bowl with soft tendons and meatballs.   The soup was warm, it seems like it was placed inside the styrofoam cup for longer than 30 minutes.   The quality of food significantly decreased compared to my last visit."
5,"Best Pho in Houston!! The Pho is always consistently good here. I also love the egg rolls. My daughter loves the egg roll that comes with the kids meal and I order an order of veggie egg rolls, which as also delicious. We order the lean beef pho which is super yummy!"
5,"This is our first visit here, and we loved it . We got the combination pho and the broth is flavorful and the noodles is al dente  will definitely be back for more"
4,The service is always fast and they try to move people quickly because they have big lunch rushes. However you never feel rushed to get up. If you don&apos;t like to sit with other people or hate crowds this is not the place for you. The pho is amazing and one of my favorites. The reason I deducted a star is because their bahn mi is not the best in my opinion and can definitely be improved.
5,"Favorite place in the entire world for years. There are definitely days that the noodle ratio might be a little off, or I have to grab somebody&apos;s attention for extra limes, or other completely normal judgments.. but man let me tell ya - this broth is just my absolute favorite flavor ever. Most days I don&apos;t have to do much to it but add a little spicy. SUPER FAST SUPER AFFORDABLE SUPER RELIABLE for a real a$$ Pho place not a bougie one."
5,"If you are looking for great pho and the taste of Vietnam, without spending money for an airline ticket and a visa entry, this is the place to go. The broth of the soup is very heavenly. Food came out very quickly and it is tasty. Wish they were closer to where I lived in Missouri."
5,"Pho Saigon has withstood the test of time and remains amazing.  I absolutely love their Pho Khong Thit (with chicken broth) -- it is so good, and I crave it all the time.  In keeping with the times, they also just released a new vegetarian pho with a vegetarian broth.  It is really interesting and pretty good, very heavy on the shallot flavor.

I would highly recommend Pho Saigon to anyone who is looking for quality pho!  It has been and remains great!"
