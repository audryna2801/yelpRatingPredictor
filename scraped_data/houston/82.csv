However they are not following any type of covid protocol. Employees wear masks around their chins while there is little social distancing. We tried to go on a Saturday so it may have just been a crazy busy day. The line to wait to get in was difficult to figure out where it began but the staff n the policeman were helpful.

We ended up going to their food truck. Experience so good n the food was flavorful! If it wasn&apos;t for their covid protocol this would be a five star review."
5,"First visit here and it was love at first smell.  I heard about it on a local TV show and have been looking forward to trying it out since.

My hope was that we&apos;d get to eat in at the restaurant but even at 11:30 there were what looked to be at least 100 people there and more arriving.  It&apos;s definitely a hopping spot.  Most people were masked but others weren&apos;t... and there didn&apos;t look to be any social distancing which deterred me from wanting to even bother staying. 

We opted to get our turkey legs from their food truck which had a limited menu. The line moved pretty fast.  I ordered the Hennessey glazed one and my friend got their regular one.  Once we got back in the car with them, the smells coming from the bag...  Lawd.   Btw, my pic doesn&apos;t do it justice. 

Needless to say, the legs were amazing.  Meat was falling off the bone and the sauce was great.  The only thing I would change is the amount of red pepper flakes and giardiniera that was on the bottom.
Regardless, I would order again!  And there&apos;s so much on their extended menu that I want to try.   We&apos;ll most likely place an order ahead of time for pick up.  

Turkey leg hut is definitely a must try!"
4,"Finally after being in Houston for almost a year I made it  in. The line here is long and I think it&apos;s become a part oft the cult following--a right of passage into this place. We waited in line for two hours on a Saturday afternoon from 3:30-5:30. I found out the kitchen shuts down during this time. At 5pm the line started moving quickly as other patrons had cleared out. It was worth the wait. The turkey leg was absolutely amazing. I got the stuffed turkey leg with dirty rice, sautéed spinach and fries. It&apos;s way more food than one can eat. I now understand why everyone who walked out had a doggy bag. The turkey leg is fall off the bone good. And I devoted the other half for Sunday dinner. 

To wash this down I ordered a stony island. It was a huge cup of alcohol  with a few splashes of juice. I asked for more pineapple juice and made it better. 

With better planning I will go during the week. If you have time to burn, this is a good spot. DJ, hookah and indoor and outdoor seating. Put it on your Houston bucket list. I give it four stars for the wait time and the beverage."
5,"Found a New Favorite This Past weekend!!!!!

Turkey Leg if you want the pics I can send you them.

But I&apos;m not going to put that baby on blast like that.

Servers need to think before they act...it&apos;s COVID!"
3,"I&apos;ll start by saying I can&apos;t deny that the food is good. I got the Cajun bowl, a Turkey leg, and the side of spinach. Everything tasted delicious (the spinach could use some work though) but there were also many things wrong. 

1. The price: these prices are ridiculous for anything that&apos;s not a Turkey leg. $8 for a side of spinach?? What the hell? Are y&apos;all buying spinach for kings or something? $30 for a Turkey leg with some shrimp and alfredo sauce? Are you joking? What in the world would warrant those kinds of prices? Disney World, known for price gouging people serves Turkey legs for $11! And TLH want to charge an extra $10+ for some Mac and cheese and 2 pieces of crawfish? What a ripoff. People will still pay those prices though unfortunately so I don&apos;t expect that to change. 

2. Crowded as hell in a pandemic, that&apos;s so irresponsible. People without masks, masks under their noses or on their chins, smh. 

3. They forgot my damn shrimp!! What the hell? I pay almost $30 for a Cajun bowl and they leave out one of the main ingredients? Is this a joke? You bet your butt if I was charging people out the ass for a plate, I would be perfecting each and every plate. Also not a drop of crawfish in the crawfish Mac n cheese. Is the Mac boiled in crawfish stock or do y&apos;all actually put crawfish meat in there? I also bit into something hard and inedible in the dirty rice, had to spit it out. I don&apos;t know what it was, maybe some sort of seasoning or gristle but not very appetizing either way. 

So honestly, the food tastes good but everything else pretty much confirms I will never eat here again. I can get good food for way less in the dozens of other amazing restaurants in houston, and they&apos;ll get my order right too!"
5,"So my Yelpie friend, Irysh M, shared a photo of a stuffed turkey leg and it was love at first sight for me. I looked them up and saw that they are located in Houston. Sold and bookmarked! Found myself in town last week and I knew my trip would be incomplete without this turkey leg. We got there early and was lucky enough to snag a street parking spot. The staff welcomed us and we were seated right away. 

I already knew what I wanted but when I saw the menu, I wanted to try so much more. I knew I didn&apos;t have the stomach space so I got what I came for...Alfredo shrimp stuffed turkey leg. The turkey leg was stuffed with a mound of Cajun rice, topped with a few shrimp and Alfredo sauce on the side as requested. It was hot and fresh and came out fairly quickly. The meat was so tender, seriously, plastic fork tender y&apos;all. 

One turkey leg shared between my friend and I for lunch was plenty. I can&apos;t wait to come back and try more menu offerings. This was a wonderful birthday lunch for me. The vibe was fun and energetic. You gotta check this place out!"
5,"Cool vibes. Good music. AMAZING FOOD!
We ordered the Alfredo Shrimp Stuffed Turkey Leg which is a Turkey leg topped with Cajun Alfredo sauce, creole dirty rice, &amp; grilled shrimp. OMG FLAVOR packed throughout with literally fall off the bone Turkey!!! The Cajun/creole makes a it little spicy if you&apos;ve got a low tolerance palate. We added a side of red beans and rice for him and sautéed spinach for me which were equally flavorful. Being greedy, we also ordered the chicken boudin which is like a hush puppy with meat and their rice inside... REALLY tasty. We topped it off with drinks - Stony Island and Side Piece which were good too. 

We literally enjoyed everything AND the doggy bag we had later. Our wait was about 30mins. Seating was available under tarps with heat lamps so outside but comfortable during our chilly visit. The music wasn&apos;t overbearing so we could talk without yelling. Parking was conveniently located on the street or TLH lot. I&apos;d recommend to consider sharing anything stuffed as the portions ARE plentiful. 

The icing on the cake is that the customer service was superb! Our waiter had a great introduction &amp; timing. He was able to suggest menu options and had an overall pleasant demeanor. 

There were so many GREAT things to say about this establishment and it&apos;s BLACK OWNED!!!  We would definitely recommend... hell we might go back tomorrow"
4,"I haven&apos;t had a Turkey leg since the local fair back in 2014 and I&apos;m so glad TLH was one of my stops while in Houston. I ordered the herb garlic flavored leg with a side of Buffalo sauce. 

The Turkey leg was so tender and flavorful I wish I had time to stop again! As you can see in the picture the meat fell right off the bone.

I ordered from the food truck next door because they close from 3-5 for a shift change. So keep that in mind if you plan on dining in!"
5,"A friend recommended this and I was blown away by the famous bowl they had. I believe it was the Cajun Bowl. Spicy dirty rice, Cajun crawfish, Mac and cheese, salmon, shrimp, I added Turkey and it had some type of sauce. The portion was so huge I had to save some for later and ate it throughout the day.  Anytime I&apos;m in Houston this will be a place to eat for me. Excellent."
5,"This place never fails. I&apos;ve eaten here many times, and it&apos;s always consistent. I&apos;ve tried all of the turkey legs. The crawfish Mac and cheese and Alfredo are my top two favorites. The last few times going here I&apos;ve ordered the Cajun bowl. It is amazing. There is rice dressing, crawfish Mac and cheese, and salmon covered with Alfredo and shrimp. It is definitely a must try."
5,"I genuinely expected to have a bad experience at this place. The reviews prepared me and my date prepared me. He told me that I shouldn&apos;t expect good customer service and should just go there for the delicious food. But it turned out way better than I expected and I think it&apos;s because we got Jamal as a waiter. He was a very good waiter! He suggested things for us to try, he was nice, he recommended drinks and they were all great. He put things on the side if we didn&apos;t want them on our food. Anyway, I had a great experience at this place. I don&apos;t know when I&apos;d come back though because the wait to be seated is insane. I&apos;m glad I did get to experience this food though. It&apos;s fantastic."
2,"Long wait in the cold only to get cold food! For sone reason, if you order the Alfredo and dirty rice Turkey legs your food will be smoking hot. I ordered the crawfish Mac n cheese. It had maybe 2 crawfish out the entire serving and was cold to room temp both times they brought it out. Turkey leg was hot underneath but the Mac n cheese was cold. I&apos;m sorry but that&apos;s too much diary for me to eat cold. The strawberry sweet tea was good. The boudin balls are just the dirty rice with sausage added fried into a ball. The menu states the boudin balls are supposed to come with TLH special sauce. They brought me 1 packet of ketchup and 1 pack of Newman&apos;s ranch dressing. I guess I was supposed to mix those two together to get a special sauce lol! SMH"
2,"My friend picked up
Some to go because there was a huge line. But the to go line was faster. 

Well I have tried this once and maybe I got the wrong thing? I got a turkey leg stuffed with Cajun crawfish and  Mac and cheese. It was SO salty. Not much flavor or else the salt  masked it.  I could not taste the crawfish  flavor sadly. 
Also, I found the meat to be dry. Bummer!"
5,"Believe the hype, the food is delicious and the atmosphere is lit. Reservations are highly recommended because without them the wait is between 60 to 90 minutes. Music, hookah, and good food.  I ordered the Hennessy glazed turkey leg and it didn&apos;t disappoint. It has just the right amount of kick and it is more than enough to take for leftovers for later."
5,"The place was very very very packed busy filled with great smells and awesome music! The best part was the flavor packed food. My favorites are the Mac and cheese, spinach and corn. I will be back !"
5,"I been following this restaurant on Instagram for a long time and heard so many good things about it. So I couldn&apos;t wait to visit Houston to try out for myself. It was so worth the hype. 

When we arrived around 4pm their was a long line but someone told us that the restaurant was closed and that they will allow more people to come in around 5pm when they open up for dinner hours. We waited for about 45 minutes before being seated. Around 6pm we noticed that the crowd did die down and there was no wait. So I would get there around then to avoid the wait. 

The food portion was huge. I was with 3 other people and we prob could of shared one turkey leg. I never tasted anything like this before the turkey meat was falling off the bone soon as I put my fork in it. I tried the Buffalo lemon pepper turkey leg stuff with Cajun rice that was awesome it was the perfect blend of spices If you like hot food. The baked potato had so many toppings and was enough for 2 people. I ordered the Hennessy glaze turkey leg which was good also. It kind of remind me of a sweet hickory bbq sauce. The stuffed turkey legs were the best thing on the menu in my opinion. I honestly can&apos;t wait to go back to try something different."
5,"** BLACK OWNED BUSINESS ALERT ***

If you are visiting Houston, Tx and you&apos;ve never been to turkeyleghut , you have ruined your trip an done yourself a disservice. I&apos;ve been here 3 times and I keep telling myself I&apos;m not going anymore but THEY ARE CONTINUOUSLY ADDING NEW ITEMS TO THE MENU.

Pic 1: I got the stuffed turkey leg with crawfish Mac n cheese  and the side of dirty rice. Now let me tell you that dirty rice and Mac n cheese did not come to play with any of y&apos;all. The dirty rice has that southern kick and the crawfish Mac n cheese has the Louisiana crawfish taste with the creamy Mac n cheese texture, these are definite must try&apos;s .

Pic2: This is the best of turkeyleghut all in one bowl. Dirty rice, crawfish Mac n cheese, blackened salmon, gulf shrimp , topped with the creamy Alfredo sauce ALL OF THAT

Pic3: Is my favorite the Ciroc mango wings , sauce dripping down. Those wings are fried to perfection and the sauce compliments the rest . 

Not to mention that it&apos;s always a party at turkeyleghut , with live music bands, and different celebrities stopping by each weekend it seems like. Y&apos;all need to get on over to turkeyleghut and stopping playing and when you do make sure to tell em Timmy sent you! Follow @Timmyinthecity on Instagram!"
1,The food at this place is great but for the life of me I can&apos;t understand why they think it&apos;s a good idea to have their customers standing in line for hours. The majority of restaurants who have an extended wait time allow their customers to get a text when their table is ready. It&apos;s like they enjoy the &quot;look&quot; of having a line wrapped around the block. That is not good customer service! I hope they will see this feedback and think about the best interest of their customers and make it more convenient when there is an extended wait time.
5,Wednesday night is live band night at the TLH. There was not a wait nor a line and this made it pretty easy to be seated quickly. After ordering I was handed water sealed in plastic cup for safety. It didn&apos;t take long for the food to come. The wings were a nice combo of sweet and spicy. The turkey leg and the Alfredo made for a good blind also. It&apos;s a nice place to visit on a night when it&apos;s not so busy. So do yourself a favor and come when there&apos;s not a crowd for a better experience.
