5,"They are definitely enforcing social distancing over here. Every other table had no chairs, they cut down on the bar seating,and the menu was provided by a QR code. 

&amp;&amp; as always the service, drinks, and food were amazing."
5,Loveee this wine bar! By far one of the best wine bars I&apos;ve been too. It&apos;s a nice size space with an patio area in the back. They are practicing covid protocols requiring masks and social distancing. The staff are great! Very friendly and knowledgeable about the wine selections. This spot also has a good amount of beer selections as well. They have small bites and charcuterie boards as well. Definitely a nice date night spot I will be returning when I come back to Houston!
5,"This is my go to wine bar. Everything from the ambiance, food, wine selection and service is superb. I was really excited they finally opening up after being closed during the quarantine. You could tell they put a lot of thought into creating a safe environment for their staff and customers. The selection of cheeses is on point. Our waiter, Thomas, was extremely friendly and very knowledgeable about wines and how they paired with the selection of cheese. The s&apos;mores is the icing on the cake. After indulging in amazing cheese and wine, dessert was the only thing left. You can&apos;t come here and not order the s&apos;mores. The idea is so unique and fun! Definitely check this place out if you haven&apos;t already!"
5,"Looking for a romantic date night with a great selection of wines, or are you looking for a relaxing atmosphere to hang out with some friends or read a book on a Sunday morning? Well this is the perfect place. I came here back in 2015 and have been coming since. I have tried and variety of wines here and my knowledge has expanded since. So if you want to go somewhere to try wines and become more informed in the wine world, well then stop by this Houston gem!"
4,Really enjoyed the vibe at this place. Intimate setting for wine drinkers or those of your who are just getting into wine. Our waiter was knowledgeable and provide more insight into the wine menu. Tables are spread out and capacity has been reduced due to COVID. I would recommend for a date night or small gathering of friends. Wouldn&apos;t recommend for large parties.
5,This is a great low-key neighborhood wine bar. We come here at least once a month for a nice bottle of wine and a meat &amp; cheese board. The service here is always amazing as well.
5,The atmosphere here is very relaxed vibes. We had two bottles of the Riesling (one dry one sweet) and a board with cheeses and meats chosen by our waiter to pair well. It was very good and paired well. A nice spot to take your time with a few bottles of wine and good friends. Friendly staff and would come back again with no hesitation.
4,"Super cute wine bar that I happened to drive by one evening. So glad I did because I decided to pop in for a glass. It&apos;s kinda tucked away so you might miss it. There&apos;s a tiny parking lot in the rear that can accommodate about 8 cars so it seems like the perfect walkable neighborhood wine bar for those who live nearby. 

The size of the lot fooled and while it&apos;s not a huge place by any means, it&apos;s a lot larger than I expected. There&apos;s even a patio out back with seating. The inside is cozy and dimly lit. AND I was pleasantly surprised to see Happy Hour deals on glasses and bottles on a Sunday. Their list had some great choices and some good looking bites to eat. I just grabbed a quick glass but I&apos;ll be back soon to enjoy a HH bottle!"
5,This is such a nice little wine bar. I love the ambiance of the place; it&apos;s cozy and moody. The waiters/bartenders are always super helpful and give great recommendations. Their cheese boards are delicious! You should also get their olives (Castelvetrano - my absolute fav) and their pretzel!
5,"First time visiting this place.  Amazing experience.  Beautiful bar...nice little patio, quaint little areas to enjoy food and wine.  We sat at the bar and enjoyed bottles of wine and had the best charcuterie board we have ever had before.  Then had the smores  board  all the trimmings needed to create your own smores..fire and all..truly a great place to enjoy a night out...best experience I&apos;ve had in a long time.  And the service was just as amazing as the food and wine..we will definitely be going back soon.."
5,"13 Celsius was a pleasure..very eclectic, rustic and modern/chic to say the least. This gem had a fine list of wines from around the world. One interesting thing I&apos;ve learned is the reason why this wine bar is referred to as 13 Celsius is because all of their delicious wines are stored at this exact temperature. Making each taste as vibrant as the next. 
Bravo! I had the pleasure of trying a french cabernet for the first time. Amazing!"
5,"It&apos;s time I update my review, friends. 

So they no longer feature the Sunday half priced glasses of wine, but they do offer half price bottles of wine (select menu while it lasts) on Sundays. 

13 is still a great place to Sunday Funday (in a calmer, more adult fashion), have a date night, girls night, drinks with the parents, etc. 

Fantastic service, still one of the best cheese plates in town... And the DIY s&apos;mores! It&apos;s more than just marshmallows and melted chocolate. They throw in fruit and nuts too. 

Love you, 13. You&apos;re one of H-town&apos;s original true wine bars (est circa 2007, right?). Keep doing your thing, baby girl. XO"
5,"Amazing wine bar with a fantastic wine selection. A good mix of bubbles, whites, Rosé and red wines. The staff was very knowledgeable and friendly. They definitely knew their wines. You can get a 3 oz, 6 oz or an entire bottle. They also serve some food and charcuterie. A great place to come with friends or before dinner. It had a very nice atmosphere inside and plenty of seating. Overall I was very impressed and plan to return soon"
5,"This venue hosts a variety of events each month catered to the awareness of wine from different regions from around the globe. I recently attended an NYE 1920s Dinner party that they put on of which the collaborated with Chef Tarsa Gary. The menu featured Sparkling Champagnes, vibrant Reds and Sweet Porters which paired nicely with each of the 5 courses served. This wine bar has a very nice ambiance and the staff was lovely. I would definitely recommend coming to this wine bar again."
5,"We are in love with 13 Celsius! From the walls to the service. It&apos;s such a charming  place with an old South American air to it. The facade reminds me of old houses in South America the bright colors and the vintage finishes so warm and chic. 
The service is excellent very welcoming and friendly oriented to detail at all times. We trulhad a delightful time. 
Their wine list is impressive and the cheese options are on point. I love the relaxed vibe the only thing I regret is not having visited before. 
It&apos;s definitely one of the best in houston."
5,"Great spot for a date night or happy hour! The wine selection is huge and the staff is very knowledgeable and happy to make recommendations. We sat down outside and received table service, which was a nice surprise. The staff was excellent and friendly and the ambiance inspire and out was lovely. There is plenty of seating in both spots.

The only downside is the parking, there isn&apos;t a ton. I recommend catching a ride and getting dropped off !"
4,"Been here for wine and their s&apos;mores platter, which is definitely the best I&apos;ve had in HTX thus far! It has the most stuff, from dried fruit to peanut butter, to jelly. The bartenders are always very kind in terms of letting you try different wines, and they are quite knowledgeable as well. They have bar seating and various tables and couches around the place. The environment is a bit run down, but that might just be the look they are going for!"
5,"I came here on a Sunday evening for a light dinner. The vibe and atmosphere was chill. There were some groups of people so it had some liveliness to it but definitely not annoyingly loud.  I walked here so I can&apos;t comment specifically about the parking but since it&apos;s midtown I&apos;m sure there is street parking available and it&apos;s not far from the light rail McGowen station stop.

I sat at the bar and was quickly served. They have a huge wine menu and you can order by the glass. I heard somewhere that you can get discounts if you pick from a bottle that&apos;s already opened but I didn&apos;t try that this time. I ordered some rosé and brie with bread. The bread and cheese was delicious! Very fresh and warm. The wait time for the food wasn&apos;t terrible either and the service was great.

Will definitely return here to try more of the menu!"
5,Great atmosphere. Great drinks. Great service. An awesome date spot or chill spot. We sat outside and enjoyed their champagne tastings.
5,"One of my top 3 wine bars in Houston!! If you have never been here you at least have to come for the s&apos;mores dessert and a nice bottle of red wine to go with it. All the waiters have amazing suggestions and know their wine. Such a perfect place to have a relaxing night with friends or a fun date night! Can be intimate, or a bar full of fun! Thank goodness I do not live right down the street from here or I would be there way too often! There isn&apos;t anything I don&apos;t love about this place!"
