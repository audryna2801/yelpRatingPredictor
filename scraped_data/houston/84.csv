5,"Bruh, why the hell did I wait so long to try this place out?

I was at Costco to do some shopping and decided to go to Hopdoddy in the Village for dinner. While at dinner, my sister suggested that we went to Milk &amp; Cookies for &quot;the best chocolate chip cookie ever,&quot; so we did.

This place was only a few minutes drive away from the village. There&apos;s a small parking lot right outside of it, with one spot reserved for bicycles parking only. I think it was around 8 or 8:30 when we got here, but there was only one group of customers so the wait wasn&apos;t long.

While we were waiting we noticed that the people behind the counter were super friendly to the customers in front of us. Their attitude definitely didn&apos;t change when it was our turn: super friendly, all smiles, and helpful.

We ordered a dozen of the chocolate chip cookies, a blueberry muffin (per cashier&apos;s recommendation and because I love blueberry muffins), and a double scoop of Milk &amp; Cookies ice cream on a waffle cone.
Now that ice cream? Delicious!! The blueberry muffin? EPIC. And the chocolate chip cookies? HOLY CRAP! Arguably the best that I&apos;ve tried in Houston.

A couple of downsides though: 1) all of that cost us around $45. Pretty pricey for cookies, a muffin, and some ice cream. But take into account where it&apos;s located and it does make sense - but definitely not for everybody. 2) This is a to-go location only. There&apos;s no place to sit so you either have to enjoy your ice cream in your car or sitting on the curbside. I did the latter.

Definitely will be back and next time I&apos;m going to bring some friends with me so they can try some awesome sweetness as well."
5,"It&apos;s difficult to go through Houston without making a stop for a delicious chocolate chip cookie! It&apos;s become a bit of a waistline issue for me for sure. Their cookies are soft in the middle, almost like raw cookie dough, but not raw...just ooey and gooey perfection. The ice cream is homemade, strawberry is my favorite but the chocolate made with coconut milk is hard to beat. 
The quaint neighborhood walk up window is reminiscent of simpler times with families, kids, and people of all ages walking, riding their bikes, or driving up to satisfy their sweet tooth. Even when it&apos;s out of the way it&apos;s worth it!"
5,"This a very wonderful place with outdoor seating and pet friendly. I have only been there for breakfast and lunch. I highly recommend the avocado toast. This little hidden gem is in West University Place and fun to watch the ladies that lunch.  There cookies are supposed spectacular,  but I have not tried them. I prefer more savory food."
5,"Just the thinking of this place to write the review has me craving the cookies from this place. I live 45 minutes away but decided to take the trip alone on my day off. The service is impeccable! The workers are super friendly and the definition of &quot;southern hospitality&quot;. They were so friendly and helpful that I felt the need to leave a large tip and I basically just ordered my food through a window and did everything myself. The chocolate chip cookies are THE BEST COOKIES I&apos;ve ever had! The cookies were large and moist. They also have sugar cookies shaped like Texas which are great for the &quot;gram&quot; and also very delicious. However, out of fear that they would sell out, I had called earlier to have one put aside. 
 
While waiting in line, I met another family who also drove from the Woodlands to this place just for the cookies. The drinks are also equally delicious. Overall, I&apos;m glad I don&apos;t live nearby because I would be at the window buying sweets once as day."
3,"Cookies are served under-baked to achieve the melty chocolate experience. For those who prefer a good chewy or crispy cookie, this is not the place for you! 

I will appreciate that they have an extensive menu aside from cookies with even a gluten free option. Breads, ice cream, a few sandwiches etc. 

There is typically always a line on the weekends so be prepared, but they do move through people quickly. That being said, coffee service seems to lack accuracy due to the speed. 

The coffee cup lids don&apos;t fit on the cups securely, you&apos;ve been warned!"
4,"Have you ever drove by Tiny&apos;s Milk &amp; Cookies and wondered why there is always a line, even when it&apos;s cold outside?! (Yes, it sometimes gets cold in Houston.) Welp, I finally understand why. My friend and I spent the day shopping and needed a little afternoon pick-me-up prior to dinner. What we didn&apos;t anticipate was just ruining our appetitive for dinner altogether! Cause when you get to the front of that window, you just want it all! They definitely promote social distancing in line; there&apos;s spots on the floor telling you where to stand! Everyone seems to comply! 

I went with the strawberry and mellow brick road (their version of rocky road) ice cream! Two huge scoops on a waffle cone, though they do split scoops as well. That strawberry is fantastic! The right amount of tart and sweet, creamy, and full of flavor! The mellow brick road was good with the strawberry cutting back a bit on the sweetness but when I got to the bottom, it was just rich and too sweet for my tastebuds! Though if you have a sweet tooth and love chocolate, this is definitely for you! The cone was crispy and tasted freshly made. A hint of cinnamon in the waffle cone itself. I loved everything about it. Of course I couldn&apos;t leave without pastries! I got the almond croissant and the morning bun cause they were out of cinnamon rolls! I actually didn&apos;t try these until a day or so later so they weren&apos;t as fresh, so I can&apos;t judge them. Though it didn&apos;t reheat well and I would recommend rating them pronto if you grab some! Staff is super friendly and the line moves quickly! I think the line was about 6-8 deep when we came on a Saturday late afternoon!! Will definitely come back for ice cream!! They have drinks and behind Milk &amp; Cookies is their restaurant Tiny&apos;s No 5!"
4,"I&apos;m personally not the biggest fan of their chocolate chip cookies: they are very indulgent and I can&apos;t ever finish a whole one in one sitting. 

However, I recently started frequenting Tiny&apos;s for breakfast and I&apos;m a fan! They have a good variety: donuts, croissants, muffins, and cookies (never too early for cookies). 

Some of their croissants are less like the traditional crispy French ones. They&apos;re more airy and collapse immediately after taking a bite, but still very buttery and tasty nonetheless. 

The cheese danish is interesting, has a lemony icing. 

Cinnamon roll - a okay. Nothing crazy special about it, but I like it and usually order one whenever I go."
4,"I love this cute little shop! This is my go to place in Houston for freshly baked cookies. The other reviews are right, the chocolate chip cookies are delicious!

The shop is an outdoor walkup to a window where you order. You almost miss it when driving to it because it&apos;s in the middle of a residential neighborhood. But once you see it, you&apos;ll know because it looks so fun! There are a few parking right out front, but if there aren&apos;t any there, then there is street parking in the neighborhood.

They have a variety of items besides cookies, like coffee and pastries. I&apos;ve only tried the chocolate chip cookies and the sugar cookies - both I highly recommend. I also took some cookies to my family in another city. They were still fresh after two days, and they were even better after microwaving them for a few seconds."
5,"Tiny&apos;s has quickly become our favorite ice cream shop in the city. After trying many of the local creameries, we were recommended Tiny&apos;s for their fresh-baked cookies and homemade ice cream. We&apos;ve now been there at least three times and it never disappoints! 

You can&apos;t go wrong with their signature milk &amp; cookies ice cream, which is vanilla ice cream with big gobs of cookies. Yumm! Their season pumpkin flavor was the perfect fall treat. Opt for the Mellow Brick Road if serious decadence is your preference: chocolate hazelnut ice cream, marshmallows, and chocolate dipped waffle cone pieces. You really can&apos;t go wrong with any flavor at Tiny&apos;s! They also have a large assortment of cookies and pastries that all look delish. Perhaps for another time!"
3,"I don&apos;t think people talk enough about the cookie-brownie - I think that&apos;s the best thing on their menu.

Went there to bring back a gift for family and friends, so I ordered a size-able order including more than a dozen of their chocolate cookie which they are know for.  A bit risky since I&apos;ve never had them before.

My favorite places to get cookies all-time are Chip and Dominique Ansel in NYC (both I think are much better than the famed Levain Bakery), so it may be a bit unfair to compare any other cookie place to them but I can&apos;t help it.

Cookies here at Tinys are modestly sized, have a good degree of moisture, and are more enjoyable when re-toasted.  I personally prefer thicker/larger cookies like the ones I mentioned in NYC, so you can really enjoy the gooey insides.  Otherwise, I think the outer-layer/crust to inner layer ratio isn&apos;t as favorable.  I have to say, their cookie-brownie combo is pretty darn good, mostly because I think it helps preserve that inner/outter ratio.  If I were to go back, I&apos;d probably order more of that.

I&apos;m glad I called ahead to place the order and went straight to the pickup line because I was on my way to the airport and the normal line was really long when I got there, so keep this tip in mind!

FYI here is my yelp rating system

5=worth a trip, something you&apos;ll crave
4=worth getting but only if you&apos;re already in the area
3=only worth it if it&apos;s free/discounted, not worth paying full price
2=would not even eat it if free, waste of stomach space
1=the place should shut down"
5,"I&apos;ve tried many chocolate chip cookies in Houston, and Tiny&apos;s has one of my favorites! The first time I had them they were fresh from the oven, but I actually thought they were too gooey and the cookie fell apart when I tried to eat it so I wasn&apos;t as much of a fan. This girl likes her soft chewy under baked warm cookie but that batch was too under baked lol. Other times I&apos;ve gotten their cookies to go, and they were perfectly baked! Their cookies are thick and pretty sweet, with just barely crispy edges and soft buttery centers. Ask them to warm it a little or warm your cookie a little at home and top with ice cream for an especially yum treat! 

The place itself is very cute, a little hard to find at first but worth the search!"
5,Super cute little spot! Perfect for a quick dessert. I loved the milk and cookies ice cream. Their baked goods also looked great.
3,"First off, all the vibes. Despite Tiny Boxwoods being closed during Covid-19 .. they allowed us to frolic on their gorgeous patio. The southern hospitality was very much appreciated.

Went here for a client to do a photo shoot for her line .. was pleasantly surprised at how the mint chocolate chip ice cream was presented. It wasn&apos;t green like the usual ones I&apos;ve eaten which intrigued me. From what I could gather the mint was in the chocolate pieces .. all around yes from me for delivery. It was good, but not great. I wanted to try the honey lavender ice cream but I wasn&apos;t feeling that saucy today. 

My people got the birthday cake and fresh strawberries ice cream. Neither one seemed impressive and they both agreed it wasn&apos;t worth doubling back for. I definitely wouldn&apos;t rush back. I&apos;m always open to trying other things on the menu though .. that&apos;s jus my personality. Plus I&apos;ve been meaning to try Tiny Boxwoods 1 day anyway."
5,"If you&apos;re on the hunt for the best chocolate chip cookie in Houston... actually in Texas -- it&apos;s here at Tiny&apos;s. 
The whole menu seems great but the reason you&apos;re going is to get a delicious fresh made chocolate chip cookie - that or the Cookies and Milk ice cream which has fresh cookies folded in - not dough. Total game changer and everything I dreamed of. 
This is an outdoor walk up bakery with other pastries and drinks. Right beside is a restaurant which is not the same - just next door. The outside is a cute photo op for your cookies or even for a cute selfie."
5,"Seriously amazing chocolate chip cookies! I knew we were in for a treat when I saw the line going around the corner when we arrived. My husband, daughter and I shared 2 chocolate chip cookies and 1 scoop of cake batter ice cream. The ice cream was so rich and creamy, honestly one of the best ice creams I&apos;ve had. The desserts are a little pricey, but they&apos;re expertly crafted with quality ingredients, so it&apos;s totally worth it."
5,"Cake batter Ice Cream and chocolate chip cookies were so delicious. The cookies are fresh, soft, packed with flavor and just the right size. The ice cream just is fresh also. You can taste the richness. While I was there I saw someone there with their whole bridal party. That just speaks volumes that on a special occasion like that they would stop by to grab a bite."
4,Very cute place for a quick bite. Line goes by fast and food comes out quickly. Definitely overpriced tho.
5,"Heaven in West U. Seriously. If you&apos;re in the market for something sweet and decadent it&apos;s definitely worth the wait. Great, efficient service, too. Everything is freshly made daily. Loved the cookies and muffins the most. I don&apos;t eat dessert often, but when it&apos;s time for a splurge I&apos;d recommend this spot."
5,"Such a classic and cute place. You wouldn&apos;t really think much about it since it&apos;s located pretty much in the middle of a neighborhood, but it is such a delicious and amazing place to stop by for dessert! 

As a stand, you will have to wait in line outside, which, in Houston, can be somewhat brutal, but trust me - it is worth the weight and the money you&apos;re sure to spend. 

My go to item is the fresh strawberry ice cream on a waffle cone. Give me that any day and I&apos;ll be a happy camper. There&apos;s just something about the perfect balance of freshness and sweetness that will keep you cool in the sweltering summer days and remind you of the sunshine and warmth in a cold winter day. 

Other things that I highly recommend if you&apos;re not an ice cream aficionado are the cookies (of course) - just your simple chocolate chip cookies, warmed up will make for a great pick me up dessert or snack. I also love the scones and the breads they make. The scones are great because they&apos;re not dry; they&apos;re actually really moist and buttery. The breads are seasonal. Depending on the flavor you&apos;d like, you&apos;ll have to catch it in the right season, but regardless, they&apos;re always delicious."
4,"Everybody in Houston told me to check out this bakery. It was definitely well worth it. It&apos;s like Levain in New York, b.patisserie in SF and Extraordinary desserts in SD...Houston&apos;s got Tiny&apos;s.

I come to Tiny&apos;s pretty often, every few weeks. It&apos;s a treat myself COVID kind of visit. I&apos;m obsessed with their chocolate chip cookies. The sugar cookies are not anything special, but I can see if you want to purchase some bougie sugar cookies so you can decorate them with your kids, then why the COVID heck not? My favorite items are their cinnamon rolls (humungous, delicious texture, not overly sweet cream spread on top), brioche buns (similar to morning buns but a little puffier and fluffier in texture, denser and with delicious cream inside). The morning bun with their raspberry filling isn&apos;t my favorite, but it still tastes great. I also love their savory rosemary and cheddar scone. It&apos;s a fantastic bakery where you can call ahead to order or order at the window. There isn&apos;t a dine-in for this Tiny&apos;s, although their restaurant isn&apos;t too far away. There is plenty of space by it where locals come by on bikes and kids can just chill and eat in peace.

I wish that there was a way to have a pick-up line for those who order via phone. Once you order through the phone, you still have to wait in line with those folks who are ordering in person which ends up making the process a bit longer than necessary. They do do a great job of distancing everybody out with their boxes and tape markings on the floor though! Props. I also love that they all wear masks and provide hand sani. I also wish they had more non-meat savory options. There&apos;s literally only one item that&apos;s savory and non-meat. I&apos;ve never ordered their drinks, but a lot of folks get their coffees and ice cream too. They also have donuts, which look delicious...but I&apos;m more of a local cheap and not overpriced kinda donut gal. Love you Tiny&apos;s!"
