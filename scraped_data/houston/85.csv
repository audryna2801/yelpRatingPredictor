5,"I love how fast they are and great their service is when I come here! I came here with a friend to grab some takeout after a run, and it was so fast! I ordered a chicken shawarma sandwich. It was honestly very filling and I was actually only able to eat half of it in one sitting and I ate the other half for a second meal. The prices here are very reasonable and you get big portions.

I also like their hummus a LOT. It&apos;s so fresh and tastes so delicious! They offer such a wide variety of options if you decide to get a platter instead of just a sandwich. The portion is HUGE and expect to be very full afterwards or maybe even have leftovers. 

I also tried the strawberry juice when I came here and it was so refreshing and delicious! 

I&apos;ve never had to wait too long whenever I&apos;ve come here and they also offer a private room for big group events."
5,"Customer Service Done Right!

Let me start by saying, I have been a regular at this place for the past 7-8 years. This was the perfect neighbourhood Mediteranian go-to place for me until I recently moved away. Yet, this doesn&apos;t stop me from going there every once in a while. Although with COVID19, this has been a little different.
They have a variety of salads/sides and a good selection of meats. They also have fresh skewers of kababs made to order. I highly recommend the different hummus and the pistachio quinoa salad for the sides. For meats, the curry chicken, or any of the kababs are my favourites. Also, don&apos;t forget the bread for your dips. 
This place has a cafeteria-like setting where you make your plate from the other side of the counter and pay before you get to eat/leave with food. This last time I was there, I ordered my usual with kabab for takeout. After paying for food I had to wait-just like usual for the kababs to be ready. After a short wait, my kabab box was handed to me in exchange for the token and I was on my way. The restaurant was about to close for the day and I probably was the last few customers for the day anyways. The real challenge began when I got home and settled to dig into my dinner I was so looking forward to. To my surprise, the kababs were missing! The box was there, the pickles for the kababs were present, there was the aluminium foil - but NO KABABS! Annoyed as I was I changed to get on my way back to the restaurant, but realized, they had already closed. I kept calling their phone and to my luck, the call was answered. A person named Ali answered, heard me and apologized. He also offered for me to come to pick up the kababs, but there were no ubers available at that hour. Ali then agreed to get it delivered to my apartment complex and apologized again. This gets them 5 stars in my opinion!
A few tips for the restaurant: Please train your staff well! Mixing the sides while filling the to-go containers is not cool. Also forgetting the food and handing over empty containers is bad! There are a lot of people with no jobs out there due to COVID and the staff should be thankful for having one!"
5,"I&apos;ve heard all the best things about Fadi&apos;s from their sweet service to their delicious foods from locals who have been here for decades. They were right.

Fadi&apos;s is the best Mediterranean food I&apos;ve had in Houston yet! I called for pickup, and when I got there the process to pickup was very self-explanatory and clear. There was plenty of parking in their shared parking lot with other businesses, and they were clearly very busy too with some folks dining in...but mostly with takeout orders. I got their falafel plate and was happy to hear that you CAN split the number of sides up, so if you get two sides...you can do half of that and end up with four sides with smaller portions. I would HIGHLY recommend that because there are so many sides to try from salads to dips to other small bites. They give you huge portions for your sides too, so that&apos;s a plus.

I got the pomegranate eggplant (VERY flavorful, probably my favorite), chickpea salad (kind of on the sweeter side like a macaroni salad), tabbouleh and some hummus. Their falafels from the falafel plate were SO flavorful and the perfect amount of moist. Their falafels are the flat patty-shaped kind that are deliciously light green on the inside. I loved their falafels. I wouldn&apos;t get the chickpea salad again because I&apos;m not a fan of how heavy on the mayo it was. BUT if you&apos;re a egg salad or macaroni salad fan, you will love this. Everything tasted SO good and the pricing was fair. Totally recommend!"
4,"My favorite go to restaurant for dinner. Great salads, hummus, gyros, etc. It is buffet style and the service is always fast!

This location is great, but more so than any other restaurant, the location matters! The various  Fadi&apos;s locations do not all have the same food options. This is my personal favorite!"
5,"Love Middle Eastern food, but can&apos;t make up your mind what you want? Fadi&apos;s is the perfect place for a delicious, fresh taste of the Mediterranean. Salads, hummus, falafel, Shish kabob, veggies, fish and more. 

This was our place to go with our extended family for Friday or Sunday dinner. Pick up a tray and fill your plate with fresh dips, lentil soup and the weekly special snapper or rice. Get a basket, or two, of pita bread piping hot from the open brick oven. From baby showers to office parties, Ali always showed us the special treatment. Add an order of baklava for a sweet ending to a perfect meal. 

Fast forward to COVID dining, Fadi&apos;s was the first place that we ordered takeout and it has continued to be our takeout place for Sunday dinners with our immediate family. Can&apos;t make up your mind? The veggie sampler, with so many choices for assorted hummus, Baba ghanoug, fattoush, beets, couscous, okra, pomegranate eggplant, basmati rice, coriander potatoes, and more, is a great taste of the dips, salads and veggies. Great falafel, lentil soup and kabobs. Perfect for catering, too. 

On #ThankYouThursday, thanks to Ali for the great hospitality that he and his staff have shown our family and friends over the years. We will be picking up another great to go order, including a veggie sampler, this weekend."
5,"I ordered a Beef Kabob Sandwich and a Chicken Kabob Sandwich both togo and both were fantastic. Both sandwiches were very delicious and very fresh. The meat in each was very well seasoned, very juicy, tender and nicely charbroiled in flavor. The veggies went well in the them and the pita bread to hold everything was very fresh n tasty in both. I also really want to try their Lamb Kabob and Chicken Curry on my next visits here. Great service as well."
1,"I have had authentic Mediterranean cuisine and this was definitely not it. 
Food was greasy and extremely over cooked plus way over priced."
5,"4.5 stars for delivery service. I love this place and its a 5 star place when you dine in. High quality of food and consistency as always. Delivery is a bit tricky because the ordering experience lacks the same visual appeal of seeing all the salads and sides next to next in the restaurant. Also some of my favorite sides aren&apos;t available for delivery (or perhaps I don&apos;t recognize the names). Also pita bread costs $... but its usually free when you dine in.. That&apos;s just weird. Not a big deal either way, but still..

Nice to beat the crowds, avoid the lines, etc.. Food comes packed pretty well with separate containers matching when you&apos;d get separate plates when dining in."
4,Great food selection in a friendly atmosphere. FADI&apos;s Meyerland is always a good choice for a relaxed middle Eastern cuisine place.
5,"I am late to the party, but Fadi&apos;s is absolutely amazing!! The options are endless and the food is incredible. I am in love with the cafeteria style service. You can pick half or full options. You can try something new every visit. 

My personal favorites would be the garlic hummus and pita bread. They probably have the softest bread in all of Houston. I also recommend the kebabs. The meats are grilled right when you order them, so they come out so juicy and tasty. The serving sizes are really big. I always leave feeling completely satisfied. 

You can&apos;t go wrong with a trip to Fadi&apos;s! The service is fantastic and the food is incredible. I cant wait to be back!"
5,Great food the tabouli is always just right and chicken kebab with hummus are my go to. It&apos;s pretty consistent so I would recommend for someone to try
5,One of my favorite restaurants to eat at. My wife and I love to eat there and split a plate. You can get two sides and split them to make 4 small portions which is plenty for two.
3,This is so different than the Fadis in the memorial area and the food is noticeably different and less quality. They don&apos;t have the same items. I prefer Aladdins when eating all the same dishes I got
5,"The BEST Fadi&apos;s I&apos;ve been to! This location has very unique decor giving the complete feel of what this restaurant is all about. Aside from that, the food is incredibly flavorful and good!! Great spot to eat lunch after church with our toddler."
5,"I looove Mediterranean food and Fadi&apos;s definitely hit the spot yesterday! I tried the avocado and spicy hummus, tabbouleh, rice with fish, chicken curry, and the lamb kabob... everything was delicious!! So fresh and so good!"
5,Fadis is.. well so delish! Tons of vegetarian options. Try the pomegranate eggplant and the fried cauliflower. They also split sides into two if you want. I usually do 3 sides and split it into 6 to try a bunch of stuff. Love their salads!
5,"Love Fadis. Great choices and always consistent. I love the hummus (all of them are so yummy) and the different salads. Great place for vegetarians and meat eaters alike. The stews are great and the pita bread is always warm, soft and fresh. I am not a fan of the desserts here (baklava is dry) but they have several options. They have meeting/event spaces here too which are great and can accommodate large groups."
5,"Wowza! They have amazingly fresh dishes here. LOVE the couscous side with the nuts (forgot the name) but MAN, so so so delicious. Like I can&apos;t stop thinking about that. I&apos;ll be back."
4,"I&apos;ve been two Fadi&apos;s twice, once for takeout during corona times and once a couple of years ago. If you&apos;ve also been to Dimassi&apos;s or Aladdin&apos;s, you&apos;ll notice that the menus are really similar---almost identical. They&apos;re all great and I don&apos;t really have a favorite out of the bunch. Fadi&apos;s Meyerland location is in a shopping center so parking won&apos;t be a problem. 

Walk in, pick up a tray, and then choose what&apos;d you like to have from their extensive options. Fadi&apos;s provides great value for the price, it&apos;s a nice spot to get a quick and meal that&apos;s also delicious. Some of my go-to&apos;s are the fresh pita bread (you can&apos;t say no to that!), the lamb shank, the rice with vermicelli, and the Lebanese mashed potatoes (not your typical mashed potatoes. Think of a breaded ball of mashed potatoes!)"
5,Great atmosphere and a wide variety of great food. The line moves really fast. I would definitely be back for more.
