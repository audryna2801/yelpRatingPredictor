5,"Long wait, but it seriously tastes so good so yummy

Inside: Covid restrictions included: face mask required to come in. There isn&apos;t much waiting space so be prepared to wait in the car. 

We were a party of 15 obviously a big party. We were able to stay in the room where food came out so food runners were constantly there. Not a problem for me we were tended to really fast and service was great! 

We went on a Saturday morning so brunch was yum. Everyone ordered practically everything on the menu and it ALL was good! They had a coconut coffee that was amaze! I had two  

Manager was very kind and I couldn&apos;t have asked for any more than i received there! 

Sorry no pictures to post but i promise you it&apos;s all worth it!"
5,"Love this place!! Came in for Sunday brunch with friends and the restaurant was packed. We had to wait about an hour or so for our table but it was worth it. I will say however, this place is small and the tables are close to each other so it is not very COVID friendly. The staff were attentive and friendly. They were following COVID regulations by wearing masks. 

For my main entree I ordered the Tacos de Huevo with potatoes. I also was able to sub the black beans for a side of potatoes as well. I really enjoyed my dish and the tacos tasted delicious. The dish consisted of 2 tacos with scrambled eggs, cheese and potatoes. I also ordered the Caramelo (iced caramel coffee). It was a pretty big drink and it came with a caramel lollipop. It went perfectly with my dish. For dessert we ordered churros. It came with a chocolate sauce for dipping (4 pieces). 

I would come here again and order the same dish that I ordered before or try something new!"
5,"Wonderful! The service is great, I enjoyed sitting on the patio for brunch. The cafe de coco is a must try! 

I had the chicken tinga tostadas. They were a bit spicy but very delicious. I will definitely be coming back. Great food and staff!"
5,"What a fantastic &quot;hole in the wall&quot; my wife found! When we arrived we thought we would have to wait long but a table was ready outside for us. Very personable staff, very friendly. We had the chocolate en olla, caramel coffee, agua de sandía with chamoy, nopalitos, chilaquiles, arroz con leche, and flan. The only two things I did not care for were the agua de sandia and the arroz con leche. Everything else was FANTASTIC! The agua the sandia is not a fresh product, it is definitely a mix they use but the chamoy helped with the flavor. The arroz con leche was a bit runny for my liking but good flavor. As for the flan, it is a must try. I never get nopalitos for Mexican breakfast but something compelled me to try it and I&apos;m glad it did. The balance between nopales, tomato, and egg was well executed. My wife&apos;s chilaquiles were spot on and some of the best we have ever had, yes I said WE because I had to try them. 

Only other thing I would say is that the portions were small which in reality it&apos;s the right portion we are just used to huge amounts of food. I didn&apos;t leave hungry though and will definitely be back because the menudo and tacos looked good!"
3,"Such a cute little spot tucked away in Montrose with some delicious food.

I went on a Sunday and the place was SUPER busy - 30 minute wait. But once my food arrived I saw why the place was teaming. 

Food was amazing. I had the flauntas which were perfectly crisp, topped with lettuce and cheese and served with 3 sauces. I really enjoyed the spicy sauce that was orange. Yum! I had an iced coffee which was just perfect. Not too sweet and creamy.

My only issue is there is no social distancing. Tables are crammed in. They haven&apos;t even attempted to try an add additional space. Also I was seated in the back room that is just off the kitchen. I saw one of the servers in the kitchen pull down her mask to use her teeth to tear the film off a bottle of flavored syrup. Covid or not servers shouldn&apos;t be opening product with their mouths. That&apos;s just... gross."
5,"Great spot for Mexican breakfast or brunch like mom makes. My sister brought me for my birthday, First time visiting and enjoyed sitting outside in the beautiful weather. The food is delicious &amp; the agua de jamaica with chamoy rim was so delicious! Highly recommend it if it&apos;s available (they have a daily flavor, ask server)! My sister had the Bandera meal (omelet, with potatoes &amp; side of fruit. You can add bacon, chorizo, chicken or sausage for extra) and enjoyed every bite. I was simple &amp; had El tradicional  (potatoes, eggs, tortilla, bacon &amp; side of fruit). The staff was friendly and quick. Looking forward to eating here again."
5,"I love this place. I come here about  once a month. Love the cozy authentic vibe ! There&apos;s a reason there&apos;s always a waiting line.  If you don&apos;t know what to order you can&apos;t go wrong with the huevos divorciados . I get those everytime. Everything else looks great but I haven&apos;t tried it because those huevos divorciados are life. Anyway, enjoy!"
4,"Good food but definitely felt like something was missing . My mom, my sister and I arrived Saturday afternoon close to noon. The cafe was extremely busy and extremely packed. ( no social distancing!) We put our name on the list and waited outside for about 15 minutes until we were called in. We quickly ordered drinks with the server and she brought them out quick. 
Same with our food. I ordered the sopes with chorizo and although they were good, I definitely felt like a side of some sort was missing. Same for my moms shrimp tacos that had a small sample size cup of beans next to her tacos. My sister ordered a cajeta french toast and mentioned that it was good but didn&apos;t really taste like cajeta. She also received it after all 3 of us had finished our meals. Came here only because it was my sisters birthday brunch and she picked the spot but I probably wouldn&apos;t come back on my own. The parking and the lack of social distancing is enough for me to go somewhere else for Mexican breakfast.."
4,"This review is for a pre-covid visit:

This place was very cute, in what looks like an old home converted into a cafe.
We went for brunch, and were impressed by the affordable, and delicious food we got!
- Cajeta toast: How could you go wrong with this - the bread itself was delicious
- Molletes: My favorite of the three items we got
- Chilaquiles: Good, but probably my least favorite of the three

If you&apos;re looking for a brunch/breakfast place in the Houston area, I definitely recommend this place!"
5,"This spot is great. I always used to pass by it on the weekends, but wasn&apos;t too sure what the place was, until today when a friend of mine introduced me to the place. 

The service was great, and extremely fast food in which our food came out. We ordered chips and dip thinking we would munch while we wait for our food, but by the time the chips came, the food came directly after lol.  The food was great, and fresh and what we ordered. 

The only thing I would say would make this place even more of a perfect brunch spot, is to have some kind of alcoholic drinks. Their drinks were amazing, it would be great to have a few mimosa and light drink options. But I understand having a license for all of that is a process. I&apos;ll definitely be back another time!"
5,"This place is a definitely a brunch go-to! I love everything from the ambiance, the small-family restaurant feel and the food. I have had to wait a few times but it seems to go by fast. 

I ordered the migas with half red salsa and half green salsa with a caramelo (iced caramel coffee). I am definitely a fan of this combination."
4,"finally got to check this place out today since our neighbors La Guad are closed for the holidays. they were packed! we got the red sauce chilaquiles with scrambled eggs, added chorizo. and the tostadas de tinga. 

the smokey chipotle chicken on the tostada was incredible! chilaquiles were good but didn&apos;t come with salsa, i prefer mine a little on the wet side. we got it to go, so if i was eating there i would have just asked for a side of salsa. so i just added some from home, no biggie

overall delicious and we&apos;ll be ordering again! lots more i want to try and i know i&apos;ll be craving the tostadas again soon"
5,"This is definitely my family, and I, go to Mexican brunch place. But for my family, it&apos;s their favorite got to Brunch and Lunch place overall. The wait is long since it is a small place and very popular, but it is so worth it. When I come here I interchange between the sopes, menudo (only on weekends), chilaquiles, and molletes. It&apos;s all just so good and authentic Mexican food. I don&apos;t know who is the Chef but I understand why they are there. My family and I are never disappointed when we come here. For drink if I need my coffee I order the cafe de coco, but if I want something refreshing I order their aguas frescas. It does change but my favorite one so far has to be the tamarindo. The staff is also amazing. Super friendly every time we come here and just overall sweet."
5,"This place is amazing!!! I&apos;ve had the chilaquiles with both green and red sauce, the huevos divorciados, and the cajeta toast! All of which were incredibly tasty! My friend had the omelet and tres leches cake which she absolutely loved. The caramelo coffee was so sweet but pretty! The food came out very quickly. Both times I&apos;ve been it&apos;s on the weekend and they are always very busy. If you don&apos;t mind sitting outside- if is first come first serve so just keep an eye out for the open tables!"
5,"Very nice staff and a perfect place to enjoy outdoor seating in beautiful fall weather.  I ordered coffee wich is pretty good considering I consider myself a coffee snob.  The coffee is served in Cielito Lindo-branded mugs.  The restaurant could use one more wait staff. I wasn&apos;t given a spoon nor brown sugar until later.  I was ready to drink my coffee but couldn&apos;t.  Take heed management. I ordered a blue corn quesadilla stuffed with shrimp.  It&apos;s quite tasty and served with  spicy red and green salsas. There is a small side of vegetarian beans too. Though the menu says it&apos;s served with nopal salad, the chopped up nopals are served as a dressing to the dish.  I look forward to trying their &quot;Chocolate de olla&quot; in cooler weather and some of their aguas frescas.  Please note, this place is only open for breakfast and lunch."
5,"Authentic , delicious, amazing ,fresh and amazing! Cozy hidden gem , a must try . Must have patience it is small and it&apos;s busy. Great customer service! Food is delicious!"
4,Very cute (and very cold) cafe. We ordered the French toast and chilaquiles. Hot chocolate had hints of cinnamon and i think the coffee did too. Everything was Delicious and fresh... my date wanted to go back the next day!
4,"Let&apos;s start with the positives first. We came at 10:30/11&apos;ish and got sat immediately. Our food came quickly. And the flavors of both of our dishes were amazing.

The cons, the server goofed up on  couple items (it happens), and the portion size was small on both of our dishes. 

Overall, solid option for brunch."
5,"I always love coming to this place, the décor and atmosphere is so welcoming! I usually order the café de coco and for food I can&apos;t just choose one plate! I will occasionally order the chilaquiles rojos, just keep in mind sometimes it is spicy, but I prefer these over the green ones. Other times I&apos;m here I will order the molletes with is just a soft round bread with butter and chorizo on top. It&apos;s so delicious but also has a kick. If you find yourself here on a Saturday or Sunday I highly recommend the Menudo, I remember one weekend it was super spicy, and they never made it like that again. I loved it, but I understand the majority of their clients may not handle that level of spiciness. Overall their food is great, real authentic Mexican food."
5,"Cute little gem in a converted older home, but the inside in very up to date!

The food was amazing and the Mexican Hot Chocolate was delicious; highly recommend a cup (or two).  Hubby opted for the tacos and I ordered the traditional breakfast.  The presentation was very pleasing.

The staff is amazing, friendly and very attentive but not smothering.  We will visit again when in the area!!"
