5,"Hot take out.  Quesadillas were excellent and made as ordered.  Had different tacos: Texas brisket, Baja fish, Caribbean Chicken and honey chipotle rib.  All were excellent.  I loved the spice on the Caribbean chicken and would say it&apos;s my favorite.  

We will definitely be back if we need tacos.  Highly recommend take out!"
5,"Great tacos, reasonable prices, awesome delivered! Liberty Tacos has become a regular party of my weekend ritual. The Caribbean chicken quesadilla, breakfast tacos, and wide assortment of fusion tacos are all really delicious. My go to is the Caribbean chicken quesadilla and bacon and egg tacos. Flavors are pretty good, comes with extra sauces on the side, and consistency is solid after several times.

My review here is for delivery service, and food comes within a reasonable time frame, still warm and delicious to eat. Food is packaged pretty well and tortillas are still firm and haven&apos;t torn. 

I know people like to compare this place to Torchy&apos;s Tacos, and I think Torchy&apos;s may have the lead on over the top saucy tacos, but Liberty Taco does hold its own, and would say delivery quality is slightly better (b/c its less saucy)."
5,"Yup, Liberty Taco is my fave taco spot (not street-style, for those who are extremely picky/knowledgeable about their tacos) so far in Houston.

I have only ever called in to pick up my order here since COVID started. But I knew this was a spot I needed to check out after seeing the high ratings and plethora of reviews for this spot. Their phone service is superb. They have never gotten my order wrong, and they also read out the menu especially because I don&apos;t eat meat as a pesca. 

My go to&apos;s are their veggie breakfast tacos (potato, egg, cheese) and (bean, egg and cheese). OMG they get it RIGHT every single time. Moving from Austin, I thought I was going to be at a sore loss for my solid breakfast tacos...but Liberty Tacos makes up for what I miss from back there. Their seafood is also DIVINE. I&apos;ve had their shrimp quesadillas as well as their shrimp tacos and grilled fish tacos. I gotta say EVERYTHING is done right. Their tacos are definitely my favorite items to order, but their quesadilla is filling too (and comes with a solid side of guac).

I love this spot. Everybody there is nice and their wifi is free and STRONG. Their parking lot isn&apos;t too large, but I&apos;ve never had trouble finding parking. Call to order and pick up. Trust me. They also have dine-in seating, but it&apos;s limited and spread out to abide by the law. They&apos;re fab. Support local."
5,"Found this spot thru Door Dash. 
Have yet to have a variety of taco that isn&apos;t good and LOVE the Queso_ it&apos;s got a spicy kick with chunks of yummy Queso fresco mixed in. 
Good customer service and decent price for the value of the food. 
Regular customer now"
3,"This place reminds me a lot of torchys, from the look of their food to the look of their place. The Caribbean chicken taco was delish. A little bigger than torchys, but they taste similar. The queso LOOKS like it&apos;s as good as torchys but it&apos;s an illusion. The consistency is chunky and the cheese itself is bland. The chicken tinga was a bit much. Extremely wet. Whatever marinade they used was all over the outside of the foil packaging when I picked it up out of the bag. When I opened the taco, all the juices dripped from the foil onto my pants .  I&apos;m sure you can imagine how annoyed I was. The chicken was fine, it was just too wet. Even the tortilla was a soggy mess. Lastly, the kogi taco. I enjoyed it. Kind of reminded me of a steak street taco w a hint of sweetness. Very simple, kind of dry, which didn&apos;t bother me cause I wanted the opportunity to actually taste their taco sauces (the hot one tastes like Diablo sauce from torchys. The mild green one taste like most green taco sauces) 

Sorry to compare yall to torchys so much like this, buttttt that&apos;s what y&apos;all are giving the gorls"
5,"I didn&apos;t expect much for the first time here, I was randomly on the way home and brought up Yelp to find a few options in the area. Came across liberty. 

The environment is small and personal, but not too small to where it feels cramped. The staff is friendly, the place is clean, the order process was pretty easy 

The drinks was one of the highlights for me, they have this very unique soda system with all these different flavors that make you want to just go try each one by one. They all tasted great as well.

The tacos were great, cooked well, and the portions were really well too, so two tacos is filling enough for most people I would say, unless you have a huge appetite, then you may be able to get by with 3. I do wish it had more seasoning Is maybe my only constructive criticism, but it&apos;s not a huge deal, especially since they offer sauces"
5,"Tacos are very flavorful and great size. Prices are good. Nice Atmosphere and service.  Vegetarians come thru!! These spot on tacos will leave you full and  happy!!
We will be back"
4,This spot has the best breakfast tacos in town. The barbacoa is really tasty and traditional. The queso is loaded and it&apos;s also quite good. Only issue is to-go orders are occasionally wrong. Check your order before leaving the store.
4,"Great tacos my favorite fast food restaurant , they serve breakfast day or night. Prices are very reasonable.safe environment to eat at"
5,Wish they had better outdoor seating cuz we&apos;d come here with all the family and more often. The tacos are sooo sooo good! We sit on the patio. You order at the counter but they always provide great service and deliver all we need outside. This is just super consistent and tasty. That hot sauce is yummmm and hot!
5,"Great Tacos! Definitely my go to in Houston. I prefer them over Torchy&apos;s and Blanco. #SorryNotSorry. 

I&apos;ve tried a bunch but the one that&apos;s stuck with me over the years is the Baja shrimp tacos (wrapped in lettuce). Another fav or mine is their Habanero spicy sauce. It&apos;s so good that they sell it by the jar!  I buy it every time. It brings the heat but also has lots of flavor. 

I believe they&apos;re also BYOB. Which is great!"
4,"Give me liberty or give me tacos!

Well I can have both.  This popped up on my YELP after my Tuesday jog so of course I rolled up here for taco Tuesday.  Ordered two breakfast (brisket &amp; jalape√±o sausage), Liberty steak, Cajun fish, and the Cali club.  All were packed with filling which is what I expect living in Texas.  I don&apos;t have a favorite as all of them were delicious, filling, and flavor filled.

This place has been hit by the pandemic sadly but they seem to still have good business with take out orders.  My take out was packed securely and still was presentable when driving back the 15 minutes.  While I thought about eating in the car, the comforts of your home with tacos in front of you is much more enjoyable than eating while driving.

This will likely be in my taco Tuesday rotation.  Maybe when things open up, they can build one near me.  Do it Liberty!!!"
4,"Really good tacos with friendly service.  Jerk chicken was a little dry but still good, but Brisket tacos were great!  Would definitely hit this up again!"
5,Very good tacos and quesadillas.  The price is also great and good quality and portions.  Love it
5,"WHOA ...wasn&apos;t expecting much, trying a new taco spot AND WAS I SURPRISED (in a good way)!!!

environment ~ clean // 
service ~ attentive, good attitude // 
food ~ fresh, flavorful 

(*i ate the Texas Brisket, Kogi &amp; Honey Chipotle Rib)"
4,Mmm. Tacos here were delicious! The liberty taco and citrus pork were both so flavorful. I think my favorite from the two was the citrus pork.
4,"Decided to check out taco
Place when I was in this area and it didn&apos;t disappoint. I ordered the chips and salsa ( the salsa is served warm) I personally am not a fan of hot salsa we specially when it&apos;s 109 degrees outside but it was fresh. I had 2 tacos the beef ribeye and the shrimp taco with mango. Both of the tacos were delicious and very generous portions. The tortilla chips was light and fresh!"
2,"Lmfaoooo, if you want made up americanized tacos this is the spot!! 
If you want real deal tacos this isn&apos;t it!"
4,"This is a good spot for fusion tacos in the Galleria area. The price per taco is a little cheaper compared to other &quot;gourmet&quot; taco places, which is always nice. They also have a pretty wide selection of tacos on the menu, using lots of different sauces and cooking styles so that each taco is pretty unique. Also, we got some fountain drinks from their Stubborn Soda drink station (see picture)! Lots of really great flavors and appreciated the uniqueness of the beverages to go with the tacos. Plenty of parking out front.

In terms of the food:
- Chips and queso are pretty solid, nothing super special but just what&apos;d you expect from good queso. Goes with the tacos well.
- Tequila Shrimp: #1 taco here, in my opinion. The shrimp has really great bubbly texture and all the accompaniments (grilled jalapenos, fresh mango) really enhanced this taco.
- Texas Brisket taco was really good. #2 favorite taco here. Brisket is cooked nicely and the additions to the taco really adds to the flavors. Fair warning: it&apos;s a pretty hefty taco
- Cali club: my girlfriend really liked this one, but for me it felt like a chicken tender wrapped in a tortilla. It&apos;s what you&apos;d expect.
- Caribbean chicken: it was okay. Cilantro flavor overpowered a lot
- Thai Basil chicken: probably my least favorite of the tacos. It had a nice spice to it, but overall, I didn&apos;t find the flavor profile as appetizing as the others
- Citrus Pork: not bad. Good flavors and worth trying once, but not sure if I would get again."
5,"Some of the best tacos in Houston! I usually go for the brisket breakfast taco, but I came for lunch today. My club taco was divine! The bacon and chicken tender were both super crispy, the Serrano ranch had just enough spice. I will definitely be back for lunch to try the other options!"
