4,Got breakfast delivered courtesy of Uber eats. Had a taco which was okay but we are in Houston and the breakfast taco world is competitive. Avocado toast was pretty good but not completely toasted. The juice was great and I sipped on it all day to get me through a 13 hour shift. Overall pretty good. Been here in person before and felt the same way. Pretty good
4,"Was waiting on a friend nearby, so decided to pick up coffee and pastries, this place is awesome!  Service was top notch!  Loving the rustic vibes!  Had the Vietnamese coffee, and its probably one of the best ones I had in an American coffee shop!  The affogato was pretty delicious and strong too!  The strawberries and creme croissant was to die for!  Definitely need to check out this spot when you are around, do not let the area scare you!"
4,"We had our annual family photo session upstairs at HTX Studios, so we decided to grab lunch after. I chose the Power Bowl with tofu, and other than the tofu being a little too salty, the rest of the ingredients (black beans, arugula, avocado, and sweet potato chips (?)) complimented each other REALLY well. I also tried hubby&apos;s smoked salmon sandwich, and it was delicious. I didn&apos;t get to try the avocado toast, but my daughter looked like she enjoyed it! We also got bacon Mac n cheese for my son, which he devoured, but he&apos;ll eat anything with bacon. Lastly, the OJ was good, the passion fruit lemonade was a bit tart and not passion fruity enough, but the anti-inflammatory concoction was really good and had a nice kick to it. 

There was plenty of space to social distance, but the line was long and moving slowly, especially considering it was 3 pm."
5,"Went there today for the first time for brunch. So many businesses have been closed due to Winter storm URI. I had been wanting to try them for a while and just never made it over. My friend suggested this place instead of tacos so I was happily surprised by the variety they offered. Im a picky eater who doesn&apos;t eat beef or pork and sometimes menus are limited for me. 

I got the breakfast BLT with potatoes instead of salad because I was worried about how they would wash the lettuce. Then realized they have arugula on the sandwich so  it really didn&apos;t matter. 

Anyway. The breakfast sandwich comes standard with fried green tomatoes, a sunny side up egg, bacon and a chimichurri sauce on a brioche bun. I subbed for Turkey bacon, scrambled eggs and it was really good. I had a hard time deciding what to eat because everything liked so good. My friend told me she went there everyday for a month when she was studying and got something different almost everyday. 

They have pastries, coffee, and food. The environment is cool and the design of the place feels open and spacious. You can watch the baristas make your latte and enjoy the colorful pastries and macaroons on display. I can&apos;t wait to go back and try the bread pudding and cbd vegan cookies. There truly is something for everyone here. Now I see what all the hype is about. 

My only question was about the to go coffee cups. My friend ordered a latte and asked for it in a to go cup instead of the mug they provided and she got a little backlash from a barista telling her to go talk to the cashier bc it&apos;s a charge. For a first timer, I&apos;d like to know something like that before paying. Overall a good experience with tasty food and great ambience. Especially after a winter storm where we all felt we might freeze to death."
3,"Wow. Just wow. The customer service from a few baristas is extremely lacking in this place. I ordered a double espresso with a little cream and a little vanilla. It tasted like crap. But when I asked for a tiny bit more cream, I was told &quot;no&quot;.. his rude explanation was that I would be getting a different drink if that were the case.. seriously? A latte has MOSTLY milk.. with a little espresso. I have been ordering this drink for YEARS.. like over 10 years... and have never ever had this rude experience. Like he was thinking I was trying to cheat him out of milk?? What on earth?

After talking to the manager, she was understanding and remade my drink. Apparently people try and cheat their way and get more milk and not pay for it?? Why do these people exist? And why would the barista assume that&apos;s what everyone does? This world has gone down into the dumpster fire of mistrust and rudeness. So sad. 

This place is mostly cool and the manager was very helpful so I changed my original rating from one to three stars."
4,"Tout Suite is a trendy bakery and cafe with fancy food items and a large open space for lounging and working.

The baked goods are tasty - and also a bit pricey. I quite enjoyed the fancy creme brûlée macaron and the ham and cheese croissant. They also offer coffee drinks (and some alcoholic drinks), though I didn&apos;t indulge this time.

The cafe sits inside an old renovated car dealership. It was an industrial, warehouse vibe with dimmer lighting and lots of open room. It can get a bit louder and energetic, so it&apos;s good for a team project - but maybe not for silent reading.

Overall a cool place. I personally wouldn&apos;t make it a regular stop, but it can be a nice getaway to crank out some work or just treat yourself."
2,"It wouldn&apos;t be my first choice for brunch or even for drinks. It&apos;s hard to justify spending that much for simple food and drinks... I mean I get that it&apos;s fresh and all that organic stuff. But for the price of a meal, I&apos;m pretty sure I could spend on groceries to make the same meal for 5 people.

Then you have the overpriced bottled beverages and or hand crafted drinks... Sorry, its good, just not that good for the price. I have yet to find anything delicious about this place."
4,"I need to preference this review with the fact that I came here for dinner because someone in our group loved their chicken sandwich. As a coffee shop, this place gets 5 stars! It&apos;s got a great ambiance and is so cute and lovely. The lights are dimmed so it makes for a nice, non-harsh work environment. They also seem to have great coffee/warm drink options along with nice desserts.

As I mentioned, I came here for dinner. This is not a dinner spot so this was our fault and I do not recommend it for dinner simply because they don&apos;t have many options and some of the menu items weren&apos;t very flavorful. My date had the chicken sandwich with fries and he really was not a fan of the fries or the unique ketchup (maybe made in-house). I think it&apos;s because the shop is health conscious so they probably didn&apos;t use any salt in either. Others at the table mentioned not liking their fries + ketchup. He also said his chicken wasn&apos;t very flavorful. I had the fresh farm plate with salmon and I will say that the salmon was very very good. Me and the other person who ordered salmon were the only ones at the table who had at least one thing they really enjoyed, others felt pretty so-so about their food.

Final story, go there for coffee, drinks, desserts, or to work, but not for a full meal."
5,"Everything tasted amazing, loved the fresh squeezed oj and Derrick was very helpful!!"
4,"Tout Suite is a great little coffee shop located in East Downtown Houston. The location is a little sketchy and parking situation can be difficult but once inside the rustic atmosphere and vibe is perfect for a casual brunch or afternoon coffee. 

Masks are required for all customers and there are tables reserved/closed for social distancing. While these measures are nice, there was no social distancing while in line and the larger tables still had you sitting close to and sharing table with other guests. 

We got the brunch breakfast croissant sandwich and the Migas. The Croissant was perfectly buttery and flaky. I have gotten this sandwich once with sausage and once with ham and i would definitely recommend the ham. My meal also came with a hash side which was amazing but very oily so maybe not for those who want something on the lighter side. The Migas were delicious! The tortilla strips were a great addition and the skillet was topped with sauce, providing the perfect amount of spice! 

The coffee was amazing! We got a triple shot americano and a cappuccino which were both perfectly brewed!"
5,"Love iittttt. Coffees, sammies, sweets all 10/10.

Side note: Darryl was especially diligent and kind during our stay! 10/10 recommend him! Hope to see him on our next visit"
4,"I&apos;ve been to Tout Suite a few times in the past but never had the chance to review them. I&apos;d usually order the juices and cakes which are typically good. Their cafe sua da is quite decent.

As it was Macaron Monday, they had their weekly promo of buy 3 get 1 free. I&apos;ve never tried their macarons before, and from reading so many good reviews about them, I decided to order a few. I wasn&apos;t disappointed haha. The chocolate one was amazing and so was the honey lavender. The texture and flavor were both spot on. I haven&apos;t stopped thinking about them since haha. The cookies n cream and rose flavors were ok. Flavors are on point but these two were too sweet for my liking.

The tiramisu crepe is a must have. Everything about this cake was delicious. From the layers, texture, to the flavor of it. No complaints.

The interior is quite trendy with great rustic vibes. Tout Suite also has WiFi which makes it a great hangout and study place. It is always packed so it might be tricky to find seatings."
5,This restaurant has a wide variety of fresh and organic ingredients and food. Great smoothies and desserts too.
1,"Im really disappointed in today&apos;s visit to Tout. I&apos;ve been a customer for years now and have raved about them to family and friends. I usually walk out of there very satisfied and relaxed, however today the orange juice did not taste like freshly squeezed orange juice should taste. ( I&apos;m a regular customer of tout juices and am 100% familiar with the taste of what a real fresh squeezed orange juice should be)
I politely made it aware to the staff that the juice did not taste freshly squeezed she directed me to who I believe is the manager who without any hesitation immediately said no it&apos;s fresh and that there was nothing he could do. So disappointed in HIS customer service."
5,"One of my favorite coffee shops in Houston! Food is amazing, you get a free refill on drip coffee, and the prices are reasonable. Great space here too to work."
3,"Second visit as far as my coffee it was on Point I really enjoyed the jolt of my Mocha Coffee w/ caramel. The cupcake was okay but the Vegan Chocolate Chip Cookie was Amazing!  There was not as many cake slice choices as usual that was disappointing being that&apos;s what I went for. The vibe in the place has changed tremendously since my last visit. I would describe it as dark,drappy and not a place I would meet friends for coffee, tea or anything. Parking can be a hassle if you are there during peak times and also caution for the homeless ppl outside asking for money. Lastly, the seating inside is not comfortable."
1,"I used to love this place but times have changed. The food is overpriced, the employees are rude, and the policies frankly don&apos;t make sense. Ordered 40$ worth of food and was told I couldn&apos;t have my laptop out, which was one of the main reasons I chose to go to this spot this morning...to get work done. Was using my own wifi and taking up a small table for one. Don&apos;t see how me having my laptop out makes any difference."
3,"This place is good to come if you want to do homework , but it&apos;s really a hit or miss. It can be way to packed and the music can be a little to loud. Also , if you are someone who wants a good amount of space on your own you should come early. The food is alright , but it&apos;s pretty pricey but it is good quality and very filling."
3,"Tout Suite is an aesthetic place to be. However the food was mid. I enjoy the Grilled Cheese Sandwich from Mcalister&apos;s Deli much more. The Salmon Sandwich just didn&apos;t sit with my taste buds well.

5,"I can&apos;t get enough of this place...I might cause physical harm to someone for a Seared Salmon Sandwich from here. Plus, they put something in the ketchup that makes it taste better than any ketchup I&apos;ve ever had. Macaroons? Fuggedabout it. But the crowning treat there are the Brookies. I love those things. Not much of a coffee drinker, but I&apos;ve never had a bad cup here when I do. Staff goes hard as well. Derrick is my guy. Don&apos;t think about eating here...just do it."
