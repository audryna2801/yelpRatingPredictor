5,"Really enjoyed lunch at Postino today. Hostess was friendly and helpful when our group arrived. Everyone wearing masks and gloves and tables well spaced out. 

It was my first time here so our server explained the Boards and menu. We tried the meatball appetizer and everyone at the table loved it. 

I got the half panini and soup - fantastic. Soup of the day was Chicken Florentine and it was packed with flavor and lots of chicken - perfect doe this chilly day. The roasted turkey panini on ciabatta was hearty and very good. And, had a glass of the Viso wine recommended by our server. It paired well and was fun to try something different. 

Overall - thought the service was good, safety measures were in place, food was fantastic - and now I can&apos;t wait to go back and try some Boards!"
5,"I first tried Postino in Phoenix and was ecstatic when this location opened in Houston! Postino has the. best. happy. hour. ever. All wines and beers only $5 before 5:00 -- and the beer mugs are HUGE! You can even get a whole bottle of wine for only $20. The bruschetta boards are also fantastic. My favorite bruschetta flavors are: (1) Pistachio/Date/Ricotta + (2) Red Pepper Jelly / Goat Cheese + (3) Warm Artichoke Spread... and I&apos;m not even vegetarian! The patio is pretty big, so social distancing is not too tough. Parking could be better at this location. Since they don&apos;t have a parking lot, it&apos;s street parking only... but it&apos;s probably better not to drive with all the cheap drinks, anyway. The consistently friendly service keep us coming back every time!"
5,"Absolutely fantastic! The gorgeousness of the ambiance was perfect. We decided to relax on the outdoor patio area which I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
The staff was beyond hospitable and welcoming.
With a nice bottle and TO DIE FOR BRUSCHETTA our Saturday sunset evening was complete!"
5,"I truly love this place! 

The waiters know me and my co workers, so I guess you can say I earned the title of being a regular and I am definitely happy with that :)"
5,"Has always been one of my favorite places! No wonder it&apos;s always packed. 

I usually get the butchers block and the bruschetta boards. My favorite is the one with the fig and marscapone. I had their seasonal pumpkin squash one, and that was pretty good too."
5,"Been back multiple times and I fee horrible I haven&apos;t written a review.  

No one can beat their happy hour. $5 on wine before 5 pm.  

&amp; they always seems to be happening, even on a Monday. Lol"
5,"I&apos;ve gone back several times and each visit the food gets better, the service gets better! Posting has become one of my favorites spots, either location, The Heights or Montrose!"
4,"I met with a business partner here. 

Parking was a little challenging due to boutiques and other businesses being around but I eventually found a spot. 

We were seated quickly, a cute window seat where we people watched and enjoyed lunch. 

The sandwich and salad combo was delicious. 
We paired our lunch with a nice red blend. 

Cute spot will go again."
5,"We had a fantastic first experience! 

We ate a late brunch and were seated right away. We ordered a peach Bellini mimosa and a cucumber honey lemonade, both of which were wonderful.  Hungry enough to eat three plates between the two of us, the meatball shakshouka, P.R.E.A.M. bowl, and soft scramble toast was really more than we should have ordered! The prices here are super reasonable and the portion sizes do not disappoint. The should shakshouka was just a bit spicy and was perfectly filling; the pream bowl was well-balanced in both flavor and nutrients (meat, vegetable, grain); the toast was piled with eggs, the prosciutto was perfection, and even the toast itself was surprisingly good! Maybe the truffle oil gave it the added oomph. For dessert, we enjoyed splitting fresh fruit and a French press coffee. 

The service is good, and the atmosphere is fresh and modern without being pretentious or obnoxious.

We definitely plan to return to try new dishes. I would highly recommend others to give the place a try if they haven&apos;t already!"
2,"Slow service. I don&apos;t like trying to figure out who is the server. At least make them wear the same top. Good food for someone who&apos;s looking for expensive fancy toast with jam on it lol. Honestly a lot better restaurants in the heights for better or same price is just a two in my book. Not sure what the hype is about. 
I&apos;ll go to heb next time . Don&apos;t worry about responding just my two cents."
4,"This is a lovely date spot with a super cute outdoor seating area to enjoy good food &amp; drinks ! The bruschetta board is a must try - I selected the following starting with my favourites.

1. Brie &amp; Apple w/ Fig Spread - this one&apos;s on the sweeter side but it was my favourite 
2. Smoked Salmon &amp; Pesto - the capers were a perfect touch 
3. Sweet &amp; Spicy Pepper Jam w/ Goat Cheese - great combination of flavours 
4. Warm Artichoke Spread - super creamy"
5,"Came here one night for dinner. Ordered a charcuterie board and meatballs. I liked the menu! It&apos;s full of snacky type foods and everything sounds great! You can order a few things to try as much as you want. Good spot to take friends and share different plates with.

The wine was extremely good! It was sweet and smooth. I had a few glasses of it. 

The service style was interesting and unique. You don&apos;t just have one server. All of the servers work as a team so you have multiple servers helping you. If you need something, any one of them can help you."
5,"I enjoyed the ambiance here it was such a great experience I would definitely come back ! 
I thought the server was very attentive and sweet"
4,"If SoDoSoPa at Kenny&apos;s house from South Park is real, this area and Postino comes pretty close to representing it. Bread boards, salads, sparkling wine, and everything hipster and millennial can be found here.

Came by for a weekday lunch and grabbed a cauliflower app, skewers, and a mixed bread board. As pretentious as the bread board is, it was actually decent depending on what combinations of toppings you choose.  The skewers were bland and the roasted cauliflower is solid. We got a chicken and mozzarella panini and the fig/whatever was in there panini. Both are pretty tasty. If you enjoy hot girl summer and reliving SoDoSoPA, this is the place to go to experience the Heights in all its glory."
4,"So glad this wine bar is back open during COVID! Everyone wears masks except while sitting and eating. They currently are not taking reservations but you can call ahead and get on the waitlist in order to bump your place in line! 

This time I ordered takeout for the $25 wine and bread board Tuesday special! The bruschetta was amazing and perfect for takeout! We ordered the Brie with Apple &amp; Fig, Sweet &amp; Spicy Pepper Jam with Goat Cheese, the Warm Artichoke Spread, and the Salami &amp; Pesto. My favorite is always the warm artichoke spread but the sweet &amp; spicy pepper jam with goat cheese was a close second!"
4,"So happy they have an outdoor seating area, perfect place to sit down have a glass of wine and eat some delicious food. Their bruschetta boards are the BEST! I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever had one I haven&apos;t liked. They have great deals also! Will definitely be making more visits here and inviting some friends over."
5,Such a cool place! Love the ambiance here and the service is great! Wine and tapas are very yummy! They have a great wine selection. Go here!
4,"Searched for pizza, was given this place.... btw... no pizza on the menu but what a hidden treasure we found. Wife got the Brussetta board, she loved it especially the pepper jam and goat cheese. I got the nine iron, I found it very good as well. A pitcher of shinner was cheaper than a glass. Cozy, great atmosphere, patio option for seating. I could see this place being a great hangout spot."
2,"This was my first time at the Heights location, but I&apos;ve also been to the Montrose location for the soft opening.  Perhaps it&apos;s the location, or maybe it&apos;s because we&apos;re in the midst of a pandemic, but it didn&apos;t seem like there were as many options in the Heights. My sandwich was good, no complaints, but my son&apos;s pb&amp;j sandwich, homemade chips, and fruit was not so good.  The bread tasted old and stale and the chips were unfortunately soggy. Even the grapes were tiny and sour. 

So the manager wrote a nice response to my review, and I followed up (per his/her request), but I have not heard back. I would have been willing to give it another shot, but I guess it&apos;s a moot point. In reading other reviews, though, it sounds like this is more of a Charcuterie board and wine type place."
4,"This place is buzzing even in a pandemic! 
We ordered 2 Bruschetta board- We loved the sweet and spicy pepper jam with goat cheese the most! followed by prosciutto, burrata and bacon (for my friends), brie apple and fig, smoked salmon, salami and pesto lastly, ricotta, dates and pistachio. That was a lot of pistachio and it overpowered all the other taste (least favorite). We also ordered Tuscan Tuna panini and Prosciutto and brie panini. Both of them were yummy and thorougly enjoyed! We were able to share all this food between the four of us and were quite full!"
