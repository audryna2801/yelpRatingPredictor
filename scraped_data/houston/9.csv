5,"My fianc√® and I decided to have our anniversary dinner here and we really enjoyed our experience. We ordered the chef&apos;s tasting omakase. We also ordered a lycheese and sastsuka cocktails. It was a 10 course meal and we were so stuffed afterwards. Our favorite was the fatty tuna, the pork katsu, and fried milk for dessert. Highly recommended to get this omakase. We paid roughly $300 but it was worth it! 

However, you also have the choice to choose the type of omakase you want and just fill out a form which was cool. Maybe next time we will do that just to be able to try all the other delicious dishes they have. The service was great and thank you Nora for always making sure our table was clean and your hands were clean before taking our picture or serving our food. I know that is something small to recognize in &quot;normal times&quot;  but it&apos;s almost a big deal especially during this pandemic. 

For parking, there is complimentary valet parking at the back if the restaurant. I recommend this place and will definitely come back!"
5,"I haven&apos;t been to the restaurant in person yet but ordered takeout as a birthday celebration.  I had always had this bias that Uchi was just another overrated sushi place where you&apos;re paying more for &quot;brand&quot; and ambience than the food. I stand corrected. The food was absolutely amazing. The fish was so soft, the right warmth level, and flavorful. The wasabi they placed on the rice (nigiri) was subtle but added a lot of flavor to the nigiri. The (I&apos;m assuming) yuzu paste they added to the top of the scallop nigiri was so flavorful and really brought out the sweetness of the scallop.

It is pricey though considering what your $$ gets in terms of quantity. I was left feeling a little hungry even though we spent $200+ (for 2 people) BUT the flavor of the fish/dishes made worth it. I basically loved every fish/scallop nigiri and/or dish in the attached pictures. 

If it was this good as takeout, I bet it&apos;s even better dine in! Would highly recommend this place and I heard the happy hour is more bang for your buck which is definitely something I&apos;ll be checking out in a couple months."
5,"Uchi has always been our go to for those special evenings, birthdays or anniversary. This time, it was for anniversary, where we ordered take out (we would never do that, but for Covid), and to no surprise, we thoroughly enjoyed the food. We are vegetarians and Uchi has always amazed is with their evolving veg menu. Though got take out the selection was limited, which I understand because they don&apos;t want to compromise on quality or experience. We could not order some of our favorites but shout out to Jessica, who helped us with the selection and portions, and made sure our experience was amazing. 
Been going to Uchi for 8 years and they just keep surpassing our expectations. Kudos to the team for the food, service and customer satisfaction."
5,"5 stars for the amazing service of our waitress, Angela, and the food here at Uchi Houston. 

My partner and I came in for an early anniversary celebration. Angela seemed incredibly knowledgeable of the menu and created a welcoming atmosphere for us from beginning to end. We were excited for every dish because Angela had a back story for each and every one. She was friendly and attentive, making sure to check on us at the appropriate times. We were even provided complimentary Uchi salad the candy bar on the house. She really made us feel like we were special on our anniversary even though there were other people dining in that night. 

I recommend avoiding the rolls but to definitely try all their sashimi/sushi options if possible. One that really stood out to me was the unagi. I&apos;ve had unagi in the US and in Japan but Uchi&apos;s preparation of the Unagi was my favorite. It was not too sweet, and it seemed like they had torched the top somehow but it was a little crispy so there was a perfect balance of savory/fatty/sweetness that came with the unagi. For the low price as well, it was one of my favorite items of the night.

Angela also suggested we tried the fried milk. It&apos;s not something I would normally gravitate towards but I had read reviews of it in previously and took the plunge. My partner and I were instantly in love. The outside crust was fried to perfection and all the textures and flavor of the dessert was perfectly balanced and not too sweet. I could have had two or three more servings of this because it was so good. 

This is an anniversary dinner to remember and we really have Angela to thank for it. I really recommend Uchi Houston for your special celebration!"
5,"Great food and the hospitality was michelin-star comparable.

If you appreciate the detail in food, you&apos;ll have a fun time here."
4,"TL;DR: In summary, 
1.) Book an &quot;omakase&quot; in advance for a date night.
2.) EAT. MOAR. NIGIRI.
3.) Whenever it&apos;s available again, eat at the bar.

Uchi will forever remain a part of my memory as it is the first omakase I&apos;ve ever tried in HTX. Since then, as a couple we&apos;ve continued coming here and enjoying a grand night out, blessed with the situation that we had almost no clue what we&apos;d be fed--we just knew we were gonna eat GOOD. With omakase their&apos;s always one or two dishes you can say &quot;meh&quot; to, but in the grand scheme of things, Uchi always delivers quite a show and always knocks it out of the park with their tongue flipping pieces of nigiri. 

Tonight was different and I understand that changes will need to be made due to the pandemic. I mostly miss being able to eat at the bar... There&apos;s always something special about being able to see what goes on behind the bar, and anyone else that knows their way around their kitchen can easily appreciate such things--even in silence. 

The Pandemic:
We couldn&apos;t let one of our favorite spots fizzle out, so before the year ended we wanted to continue supporting Uchi and also redeemed the gift card given out to folks who ordered takeout months ago. Prior to modifications, Uchi was strictly take out only for the first few months following March. Today, tall makeshift plexiglass barriers constructed with wood sit in between booths. Again, no bar seating. The entire bar is plexied to the teeth, as well. 

Look &amp; Feel:
The restaurant is quite beautiful using classic architectural elements curiously with a hint of a popular modern/contemporary accents... black Industrial piping with lots of wood. I can&apos;t help but stare at the liquid chalk board in the back, and by chance, we always get reservations on the left side away from it, so I&apos;ll find my eyes wander towards that direction while waiting on the next dish or if conversation runs dry. 

Food:
Their sushi is top notch and their selection is impressive, even in comparison to other high end joints. An experience like this brought me back to a time I tried a Michelin star in New York, but this time each piece has an amazing spin or accent. You know you&apos;ve stepped into the right restaurant when they don&apos;t leave you a bottle of soy sauce at the table. With the omakase you will be met with palette cleansers between dishes and there will be a devised menu in which flavors should build onto each other. For Uchi, I can give a bow to their food. It&apos;s nothing short of amazing, but why I can&apos;t give it 5-stars is due to some items being inconsistent in quality and sometimes a rather predictable theme for the omakase (fruits and tangerines with everything), and in comparison to other joints, the price tag can be considered quite hefty.

But c&apos;mon dude. I don&apos;t care if they&apos;re advertising grade 20 wagyu--I probably wouldn&apos;t get it again. That hot rock wagyu was a bust, but I admit the novelty factor was a 10-out-of-10; but ponzu sauce for beef...? I guess they were going for something like a &apos;tataki,&apos; and 4 itsy bitsy pieces that cant fit on a ball of rice...? The cuts felt extremely underwhelming; the wagyu barely had any fat lines and even though we tried very hard to maintain the tenderness &amp; texture while trying to get a good sear, it just didn&apos;t deliver. 

Service:
With the omakase, Uchi aims to please and takes in consideration your critique. If you particularly don&apos;t like something, the guys will try to bring you something that will make you happy. 

Recommendations:
1.) Tom Kha Gai soup - trust me, I was surprised, too. Who would&apos;ve thought you&apos;d find the BEST bowl in Houston at a sushi restaurant? Not me. On our second trip back we had to request for it with the omakase and the team accommodated us. That&apos;s pretty freakin&apos; cool. 

2.) Nigiri sushi - there&apos;s just too many to name. I will say they probably have some of the best tuna (of any cut). One of the best bang for buck pieces there is the blue fin akami. 
If you&apos;re there for social hour, always get that AND the chef&apos;s choice. It sits at $4/pc but the I&apos;m sure the fish rotates based on how much they have in stock or how the chef feels on that particular day, and today they were serving loup de mer--and good God, I had to get another couple pieces after trying it; ontop they accent the fish with a bit of olive oil, a few flakes of kosher salt, and something green (maybe some kind of dill puree?). 
I&apos;m always a fan of amberjacks if the restaurant has them. 
Their vegetarian option, eggplant nigiri, I remember was fantastic, but not so amazing this time around. 

3.) Omakase - really, this should be at the top. It&apos;s the ultimate foodies&apos; date. Just let the staff take care of you as the chef will often make dishes outside the menu and ask for your honest opinion, so even if you are a regular, you&apos;ll still get hit with occasional surprises! Been there three times now for birthdays and anniversaries and they usually kill it. Of course, my favorite part is the nigiri."
5,"Been here a few times now. Food and service are always excellent. Reservations recommended. The menu can be overwhelming as there&apos;s a lot to choose from, and if you are not familiar with Japanese cuisine/terms, but still don&apos;t worry there is a great knowledgeable staff who will describe to you everything and will help you to order what your there for. What I had there, everything was amazing and will prepared. Environment was clean and I felt so safe while eating there."
5,"This is by far the best restaurant I&apos;ve been to in Houston!  So good I had to go twice during my short trip.  Everything here is fresh and phenomenal and the happy hour menu offers a great way to introduce people to these outstanding dishes in a less expensive price point.  Coming from NY I can say that this is a standout spot that reminds me of many of the places in the big Apple....except we would be paying double or triple the price.  

The staff here is warm, kind and funny...wish I  remembered their names but I would request the same two servers over and over if I could.  They even brought us out a dish on the house as we were celebrating an engagement.  I wish I could make friends with someone here so I can get a reservation whenever I wanted.  I&apos;d book a flight instantly just to eat here and fly back!"
5,"Lots of vegetarian options, and highly recommend the chef&apos;s choice makimono roll! The chef makes a custom roll depending on how they feel that day, so every time it&apos;s unique!"
5,"We&apos;ve been to Uchi 10+ times and we&apos;ve had a fabulous experience every time! Be sure to make a reservation. I love the ambiance inside and it&apos;s a perfect date night spot. Their menu is fantastic and they also offer a happy hour from 4-6:30.  All of the fish is very high quality and tastes amazing. I love the creativity behind their dishes. Also, their wine list in amazing! As a wine nerd, I really appreciate the selections. They also have sake and beer and sake cocktails. It&apos;s an incredible place all around. We always have great service!"
4,"Very limited patio seating, but they do offer in door dining as well. 

Menu was a bit overwhelming with the amount of selections.  They do offer a vegetarian and a social hour menu as well.  Food was fun and have a southwest take on sushi. 

Service was phenomenal and was very helpful at getting us through the menu. Guiding us through their menu.  

 had a good variety and the foie gras was terrific. Maybe it&apos;s bc I forgot how good foie gras is since they banned it in CA.  One other piece that was excellent is the tannin bune (uni w/smoked roe) those are two best pieces. 

Fish was cut and processed well, rice was season well, but a bit dry. Vegetarian sushi was interesting with eggplant, avocado, tomato cut perfectly in size. It wasn&apos;t forced and made into an odd shape piece. Knife skills"
5,"This place was absolutely phenomenal! From the service to the food, everything was just fantastic.

We made reservations for a Saturday evening and our waiter (Jon) was just incredible. He did a whole TikTok dance for my family over a Duo call. We had one of every dessert and the food was just delectable in every possible way.

My favorite was the sake namida (which unfortunately I wasn&apos;t able to get a picture of - as we devoured it immediately). I ordered the hot rock and the sake salmon sashimi which was phenomenal. The only thing I could possibly say that wasn&apos;t all that wonderful, was probably that the hot rock wasn&apos;t hot enough to cook my meat, but as soon there was mention of it, it was immediately replaced. So all is well.

Jon suggested that we get one order of every dessert and my favorite would probably have to be the Fried Milk. The concept really baffles me, but man was it good on my tongue. I absolutely enjoyed it so much. Thank you Jon for the recommendation because now I was able to try one of every dessert."
4,"This is a review specifically for the curbside pick-up Vegetarian Dinner for Two, which carries a lofty $75 price tag. Excellent value without question, however, as the experience includes 7 small-ish meatless courses, a pint of seasonal sorbet, a bottle of wine, and an extra DIY dessert. 

Overall, the appetizers were tasty and contained some surprises, though only one or two were genuinely memorable. The Veggie Mushi was an absolute flavor bomb of sweet, spicy, and sour in the vein of a Thai Tom Kha soup. The Kinoko Usuzukari (thinly sliced mushrooms) is essentially an interesting vegetarian take on a delicate crudo; the vinegary and umami notes are delivered via fine sheets of spongy fungi topped with shallots. The copious charred and salty edamame were a nice filler course. The Brussel Sprouts with lemon and chili were decent, but the original Uchi sprouts with caramelized fish sauce are leaps and bounds better. The Miso Soup was unremarkable. 

Among the choices for mains, we went for the Pitchfork Maki, a whirlwind of complimentary textures between crunchy shallots, crisp shishito, and buttery avocado, and a welcome zap of citrusy heat from a bright yuzu kosho blend. The Bok Choy was OK, but the cashew butter and lime-tomato salad stole the show. 

At this point, we were content but not stuffed. But our palates were fairly saturated from the onslaught of colorful and savory courses. The simple and refreshing summery strawberry-apricot sorbet with a crunchy butter crumble really hit the spot. The final throw-in was a savory miso-pecan bread pudding, which soaks overnight and goes in the oven for 20 minutes before getting the maple caramel sauce treatment. Crazy decadent and maybe could&apos;ve used more sweet and less savory, but no complaints otherwise. 

We enjoyed the meal and felt it was appropriately priced, but it fell short of truly wowing us."
5,"My family enjoy their 10 course omakase. Each dish was unique and an eye opener for me. My favorite dish was their fried milk dessert...it had every element of a perfect dessert: crunchy, soft, cold, warm, sweet, and a bit of saltiness. Uchi will always be my special go to spot!"
5,"Murderpoint oysters (10/10)were so good. So good!! Only $2 during sake social 

Yakai berry (10/10): so good. Light and refreshing 

Hama chili (10/10) a classic and must have. Again you should order 2. It&apos;s really good. Yellowtail, ponzu, actual Thai chilis (spicccy), orange and purple basil. 

Yuca frites (7/10): nice little snack. 

PORK BELLY(10/10): egg jam, atchara, crispy rice. Very filling. I like how the crispy rice is on top of the meat, so the rice doesn&apos;t get soaked. 

AVOCADO MAKIMONO (10/10): one of the best rolls we had tonight. 

Negi Hama futomaki (5/10): just okay. 

Spicy sake maki (8/10): I liked this as well



NASU NIGIRI (10/10): eat hot and omg wow. I loved all of the components. Eggplant, lemon curd, Goma shio 

FOIE GUNKAN (10/10): candied quinoa. Fish caramel. Shiso. Omg sooo goood!!! 

Toyosu selection (7/10): yellowtail was the special tonight. 

Brussel spouts: good as always. 

Ham and eggs (6/10): my husband liked this. I did not. Too much mayo for me. 

Hamachi nigiri (7/10): I liked this one very good

Zero sen (10/10): this was so good. The sauce was a sesame paste and oil mix which complimented the sushi roll really well. 

Fried milk (10/10): most popular and favorite dessert

Coconut Tapioca (7/10): very light and refreshing the hazelnut gives it some crunch."
5,Every dish we tasted was excellent. I have been twice and have been impressed both visits. I suggest trying as much as you can and reorder your favorites after.
3,"Wonderful options. Unfortunately I believe the establishment obtained an extremely confident attitude since recognition of being one of the beat restaurants listed for Houston. 

-Amazing pairings
-Mediocre but not extremely exotic infusions of flavor
-Extremely disappointing proportions
-Price point is beyond the combination of proportion &amp; creativity.

Sincerely,
EM"
5,"WHAT. In. The. World. After years of hearing all kinds of glowing reviews, I finally had my first Uchi experience last night. Since then, I&apos;ve thought more than once about my meal, and I honestly am at a loss for words to sufficiently convey how amazing everything was. Everything. Start to finish, including the valet guy. 

I don&apos;t even understand how these people use mostly simple ingredients and marry flavors together in such beautiful ways to make interesting dishes that are somehow also almost universally accessible to any palate or preference. These people are freaking sushi magicians. There&apos;s no other explanation. It doesn&apos;t even make sense. 

My husband and I traditionally have a knock-down-drag-out-year-end-date-night, which is how we ended up here last night. In classic 2020-COVID fashion, we arrived to this meal mentally and physically exhausted from the week and had zero desire to make any decisions. Thankfully, we had the good fortune of Aziz being our server and he took care of everything. We sat back and he had plate after delicious plate sent out to our table with perfect timing. We had flounder. We had 72 hour short ribs (twice, actually). We had Walu Walu. I don&apos;t even know what Walu Walu is, but holy mackerel it was amazing. Even Uchi&apos;s basic sushi rolls are unbelievably good. Each delivery to our table had a simple, comprehensive explanation for how to eat each dish to maximize the flavor. &quot;Pinch this with two fingers and eat with the protein facing your tongue.&quot; &quot;Be sure to get a slice of orange with each slice of Ahi.&quot; &quot;The foie gras is on the rich side, so we&apos;ll send this one out close to dessert.&quot; I&apos;ve eaten some good food in my life, but never have I watched a restaurant staff work in such perfect harmony to ensure my entire dining experience was as pleasant and enjoyable as possible. It was truly something special to witness and to experience. 

On the topic of COVID, I was particularly impressed with how Uchi has been able to adapt to a socially-distanced, safe dining experience without it feeling sterile or uncomfortable. The front desk did an incredible job of communicating with us in advance of our reservation to explain the protocol for arrival. There are undoubtedly less tables in the dining room than there were pre-COVID, but it doesn&apos;t feel empty or odd inside. It&apos;s a warm, intimate dining experience without the anxiety of dining too close to strangers. 

For anyone who has not yet had the pleasure of a visit to Uchi, I can&apos;t possibly recommend it enough. You may have to make a reservation well in advance to get in, but you will not be disappointed."
5,"How have I never reviewed Uchi!  I love it SO much!!!  We recently had their omakase for 2 &amp; picked it up via curbside pickup.. the pickup experience was very smooth.  You book a pickup time online &amp; they call you to take your order.  When I arrived there was someone in the parking lot checking us in &amp; directing everyone to a parking spot.  I waited maybe 10 min for the food to arrive.  The food itself was amazing, as always!"
5,"Came here for my birthday and sat outdoors on their patio which fortunately was shaded and had fans (a must in humid, hot Houston weather). Since it was social hour, we practically ordered the whole menu and left feeling way too stuffed but extremely satisfied.

My favorite dishes were yokai berry (so refreshing and light), pitchfork makimono (who knew vegetarian could taste so good), and tempura walu (perfectly battered). Would skip the yuca frites since there are better fried items available to try. 

Service was excellent without being too intrusive, and my waitress even gifted me a sashimi dish for my birthday which was a nice touch. Would definitely be back to try other regular menu items in the future!"
