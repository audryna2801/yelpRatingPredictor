5,"We are absolutely blown away by the food and service we received. My boyfriend and I are both doing Whole30 (a very restrictive diet) which usually requires making most everything at home but we were hoping to have a break for one night and it exceeded our expectations.

First in trying to determine if we could eat there, one of the kitchen managers graciously talked through every item on the menu and whether it was compliant or how it could be. When we went to order curbside, one of the managers came out and took our order to ensure we had any modification that we needed. 

Everything was PHENOMENAL! Make sure to ask what&apos;s compliant, but we got the sweet potato noodles (borderline W30, I knooow), salmon (with a side of chimichurri) that came with an asparagus/arugula salad and we also subbed a side for kale salad, but the true winner was the cauliflower appetizer. We took a bite and both said &quot;oh sh*t.&quot; The combo of the roasted cauliflower with their tahini/harissa sauce and dates was just to die for."
5,"Quick lunch with a girlfriend, the grass fed burger was a delight and the hummus came with veggies and pita bread. This meal was very filling and healthy! Definitely a good spot to go to if you&apos;re looking to order good food with your health in mind. Absolutely love the service here and the measures they&apos;ve taken for covid are wonderful!"
5,"Food was so delicious I didn&apos;t even get to take a picture! We got the butternut squash soup (waitress was nice enough to split it into two bowls for us) as an appetizer and it was great!! Flavor blends were tasteful and refreshing. We also got the turkey burger (without Gouda) and it was sooo bomb! The jalape√±o sauce they had on the burger as a condiment really made the burger stand out. Also got a drink that had gin, orange, and honey in it (forgot the name) and it was delicious!!! Not too strong but had the right kick to it. The menu is limited due to Covid, but still had all the right things to make a great meal. Will definitely be back when we have a healthy craving during date night!"
5,"Best vegan pizza I&apos;ve ever had! 

I got the butternut squash pizza (sans onions). I was skeptical because non dairy cheese usually isn&apos;t good but this ricotta was amazing! The texture wasn&apos;t weird and had plenty of flavor. Also not a fan of kale but True Food does it will. I also tried the Apple lemonade and it was strangely delicious and refreshing. This is my new go to if I want pizza."
4,This is a good place for lunch or when you want to eat out but still want to be healthy. They have a great outdoor patio and a large indoor space as well. I ordered their ancient grains bowl with a grilled salmon and it was delicious and hearty. I also tried their flourless chocolate cake which was not very good. Definitely stick to their bowls and salads and not their desserts.
4,"Another pleasant surprise for me. Parking at the wrong time of day can be a challenge; however, there is a parking garage near by. I visited for lunch during the week. The place is super green and healthy! The potential is great for this place. They do serve wine and other spirits. I had the burger and it was excellent! The service was excellent. They are practicing social distancing to the point where there are barriers between each sitting area. Overall was impressed and will visit again.
I do recommend"
5,"LC, you are the best hostess. We went there the first time, and you and your kind welcome smile makes everything perfect. I was starving (no lunch that day), so your suggestions helped us order the food. Food came quickly, and the starter was delicious roasted Brussels sprouts we enjoyed very much; the seasoning was perfect, and it was not overly cooked. We ordered Salad, Salmon, veg dishes, and steak Tacos with roasted sweet potatoes. Since we were outdoor and the heater was on, that makes us more comfortable. In the end, from the entrance to the outdoor table, drinks, starters, our favorite dinner with excellent service, everything was perfect--what a way to start the new year day. We will recommend this place and please check out the pictures, and you will love the Presentation. We are so looking forward to going back."
5,Love this place! My boyfriend and I visited for Valentine&apos;s Day brunch. Food was healthy and flavorful. They were very accommodating to special allergy and dietary restrictions!
5,"This place is the best! It really hits a niche in Houston that we&apos;ve been waiting for. It&apos;s got a great Southern California vibe in the heart of Uptown. Light, flavorful fare which is always fresh and vibrant. Never disappoints and you always feel good about eating their food. And excellent and friendly service. Two thumbs way up!"
5,"True Food Kitchen has many healthy and delicious options. I went and started off with a matcha horchata and the roasted Brussels sprouts. The matcha drink was amazing, super creamy and flavorful, only thing is that it was a small cup for $6.50. The Brussels sprouts were great too. For entrees we got the chicken and mozzarella panini, and the quinoa teriyaki bowl. The panini was great, we got both the kale salad and sweet potatoes as a side and those were yummy! The bowl was just as great and love all the veggies that were served in it. Our total came out to $60 with tip. A little pricey for two people but since it is considered a healthy restaurant I did expect to spend more $. 
Lastly, the atmosphere was nice and service was welcoming. Outside does have heaters and bathrooms are nice and clean! I would love to come back to try the food from a different season."
5,This is such a great go to with your girlfriends for lunch or dinner or even a solo midday lunch spot.  I love how everything is so fresh and it just feels good knowing that you&apos;re eating good clean food while you&apos;re out and not at home. I also love how the restaurant no poke in the whole kitchen.
2,Consistently going downhill! I used to love this place because they had a variety of options and tasty food. The last few times we have gone they have has less and less on the menu and are constantly out of items. Today we went and they had no buns and no meat or beans for the fajita. I feel like they should&apos;ve told us they were missing several of the already limited menu items before allowing us to purchase drinks. Will not return.
5,"My family and I had True Food Kitchen for dinner tonight and the experience deserves five stars!  From the moment we walked through the door, the service was so attentive and friendly.  The aesthetic of the restaurant itself is pleasingly fresh and bright.  I love that the menu features so many healthy comfort food options...I had the lasagna bolognese, which was delicious, rich and flavorful without being at all heavy.  I also had a side of brussels sprouts that were fantastic. My toddler absolutely gobbled up the kid&apos;s chicken teriyaki bowl, which included chicken breast, wild rice and stir fried veggies.  I was very happy that the chicken teriyaki was was so appealing to my toddler without being salty or covered in a sugary sauce.   In summary, just really good service, atmosphere and food!"
4,"Great food for everyone.  Offers healthy options and family meals provide enough options for picky eaters.  The portions are on the smaller side, but will satisfy most.
The customer service is amazing!  Curbside pickup is very easy."
5,"I was looking for a restaurant that would accomodate my Vegan friend&apos;s tastebuds and True Foods didn&apos;t disappoint!

Just a tip--if you&apos;re looking to accommodate various eaters ie. Vegans, Vegeterians, and meat eaters, searching up Farm to Table in Yelp gives you some pretty good results, thus my find of True Foods. Menu has plenty of menu options for all mentioned above and accommodate order requests changes. For example, my friend ordered the Brussel Sprouts starter, but didn&apos;t want the vinagarette, just basically roasted. Addiotionally, the menu is seasonal, so it is hard to get tired of coming here because they offer new items every season. 

You&apos;d think the food would be the highlight of a meal, but I honestly have to give equal kudos to the drinks. I choose the Skinny Marg that includes Organic Tequila...Oh My Gooodness--it was potent! It took me an hour to drink it. I usually put away shots of Jose Cuervo like its water...something bout that Organic Tequila is sumthing special. It&apos;ll make you feel good with just one drink. Plus the concotion was so pretty and refreshing with mint and cucumber mixed in.  Definetly a must try! 

Our meals were pretty delicious. My Grass fed burger was tasty. Cooked medium well, the meat was still moist. Combined with the nuttiness of the flax seed bun, it was filling and flavorful. My friend raved about the butternut squash soup. In fact, when her brussel sprouts didn&apos;t turn out quite roasted but rather burnt, the waiter compensated by bringing her anything she wanted-- and all she wanted was another bowl of soup!

Glad we came. We were celebrating my friend&apos;s birthday and she choose this place out of the places I researched after looking at the pictures online, but the aesthetics in person just leave you all warm inside. The various lighting mixed with the rustic undertones just keep things light for casual gatherings but can also be romantic in others. Plus you can have a conversation with someone while youre dining, which is a must in my book!

Garage parking suggested and walk up to street level via Whole Foods to get to the restaurant and treat yourself to some true foods."
5,I was a bit skeptical at first because their menu isn&apos;t that big. Their sunrise bowl was amazing! It&apos;s under the brunch section. I ordered their green tea as well because i didn&apos;t want anything too sugary so I was already expecting the green tea to not really taste that flavorful but it was amazing! Definitely some of the best green tea I had
5,"Food was fantastic! But our server Zuri was absolutely INCREDIBLE. Super knowledgeable about the menu, very attentive, and very personable. He&apos;s the best server this place has! The manager Eduardo also was very nice."
5,"True a Food Kitchen is one of our go to&apos;s for a nice weekend family brunch.  It&apos;s on the pricier side so we don&apos;t go too often, but we love the healthy options &amp; kids&apos; menu!  The kids usually share their Almond Butter, Banana &amp; Apple Sandwich on seeded grain bread served with a side of carrots &amp; tzatziki &amp; an order of scrambled eggs.

TFK also have a great selection of unique beverages.  Pictured are the Matcha Horchata (oat milk, cinnamon, matcha, &amp; vanilla.. my all time fave, I get this every time we come here!) &amp; the Sparkling Prickly Pear Tisane (prickly pear, hibiscus, lime). 

The staff are knowledgeable &amp; friendly, we&apos;ve never had an issue with service.  If you&apos;re going with a larger party definitely book ahead, otherwise, they take walk ins, but you might have a short wait if you&apos;re there during the weekend lunch rush."
5,"I ordered my favorite dish here for curbside takeout, their Margherita Pizza. It was awesome in flavor and quality. The size of this pizza there is 10-12 inches, which is perfect for one person. It looks just like a pizza from Naples with the crust thickness, basil, cheese and sauce used for it. It is definitely one of my top 3 favorite pizzas in the South, along with Grimaldi&apos;s and Angelo&apos;s in Webster. Great authentic type pizzas also never need more than 1 or 2 toppings either imo, bc the sauce and cheese are the main parts to look for in their taste. The basil gives a slightly herby taste to the fresh sauce and cheese used in this pizza. The MP was 15 bucks and the service was great too."
5,"True Food! One of my favorite restaurants to go to for a clean and healthy meal. In addition to the location, I love that they have outside seating and plenty of seating inside. I have never had to wait. The customer service has always been great and my most recent waiter, Zuri, was awesome and super helpful with recommendations and ensuring that we enjoyed our meal.

I usually always order the spaghetti squash casserole, and this time I added shrimp which was a nice touch. We also ordered the hummus for the appetizers. The portions for everything are so filling. They also have so many great refreshing drink options and I usually get the ginger one.

I definitely recommend a vist- it&apos;s a great spot to have lunch or dinner with friends, family, or colleagues. The best part is that it&apos;s vegan friendly, so there are A LOT of good options for everyone."
