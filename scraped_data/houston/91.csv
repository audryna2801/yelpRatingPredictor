5,"I&apos;ve been to Bollo before with a friend and loved the food and service we got on a Saturday for lunch.

We ordered take out last night and wow! Everything was so delicious and fresh! We ordered 3 pizzas, a salad and an app for us and some friends and had plenty leftover for lunch today. 

Another great thing was they told us 45 minutes and it was actually done during that time. So many places get it wrong on time for take out. All our food was still very hot and ready to eat fresh when picked up!

I definitely will be coming back for some more pizza from Bollo!! Especially that Anglio pizza!!"
5,"We have finally made it to try you!! For starters, your staff was very welcoming, the atmosphere is nice, and they follow proper COVID protocol. Speaking of, they even have an advanced air filtration system!

On to the food...  the Black Truffle Burrata was very tasty.  Not overpowered by the truffle flavor, but not lacking either. The Linguine Carbonara was also very good, which was surprising, since this place specializes in pizza (so we thought.) Better still, the pasta noodles are made locally at Fabio&apos;s, right down the street.  Please read below in the description for details about the delicious pizzas."
5,"SUPER GOOD! I ordered the Carne Trio pizza and Parmesan bread. I wasn&apos;t a big fan of the bread but my family liked it. It tasted like good quality bread with garlic, lack of seasoning and good shaved Parmesan Cheese on top. But the pizza was spot on and I will be ordering again. 

The pizza was cooked quickly and to perfection as I ordered to go. They do have an outside area for dining.  The prosciutto, pepperoni and Italian sausage were a great trio with the oh so good cheese. I like my pepperoni slightly crisp on the edges and boy was it good. The crust is light and airy like I like it and not thick. 

The restaurant clean and everyone appeared to be COVID safe. It&apos;s family friendly too but also intimate enough for a good date. 

I&apos;ll definitely be back to try more pizzas!"
1,"I&apos;m black. 

As I am walking in, a staff member at the hosts counter puts his hand up and points to the back. I didn&apos;t acknowledge him because I didn&apos;t know what/why he was pointing.

He then states &quot;pick-ups are in the back.&quot; I allowed that moment to sit in the air a bit to ensure everyone had a chance to digest what he just insinuated. 

Another guy at the host counter awkwardly asks &quot;sir, can we help you?&quot; I give him an interesting look before responding. 

I then say &quot;I&apos;m here to eat.&quot; The young lady at the counter (yes there were three staff members standing there) begins to fidget with a computer after I stated that I had a reservation. 

Time of arrival: 3:04pm. 

I would tell you about the suggestion another staff member made about my credit card not swiping but, I think that warrants a second bad review. 

Time of Swipe: 5:55pm (approx.)

Good pizza. Cool drinks. Micro and macro aggressions towards me as a black man. 

I sat at the first table outside to the left of the entrance if you were walking in. Blue Captain America T-shirt. Levi&apos;s jeans. And some new kicks."
3,"I will get to the point:

I ordered the original bollo pizza. The dough is very thin, I opted for truffle oil on it that I barely tasted, and it was overall lacking flavor. Not horrible, but does not live up to the price point and very unfulfilling. 

I am not likely to return unless friends wanted to go."
5,"Bollo makes Delicious Pizza with that smokey flavor of wood is a different taste!! 
Making the pizza special &amp; the place it&apos;s Fabulous"
5,Ordered out from here on Uber Eats because I had been hearing about it for such a long time. It was delicious. Seriously. All of it. The mozzarella sticks were crispy and filling and had the right ratio of breading to cheese. The Caesar salad was a large portion for the eel of us and a good balance. We got the 44 Farms beef pizza and it was great. Just enough onions and jalapeños and plenty of beef. This was a great surprise and based on the reviews everyone was right!
5,"Really great pizzas and mozzarella sticks.

The service is also friendly and fast. The pizzas hit the spot. Must try."
5,"I recently had a great dinner at Bollo on their terrace which was beautifully lit with candles and light music.  

We also started our meal with a bottle of Kim Crawford rose wine, caesar salad and lamb kabobs, all of which were good.  We customized our own pizza toppings with buffalo mozzarella, fresh basil, mushrooms, pepperoni and truffle zest. The pizza came from their wood fired oven perfectly baked and was worth every calorie.  There was plenty to share between 2 people.  Our server, Cesar, was polite and attentive but did not rush us. 

I thoroughly enjoyed my experience at Bollo and will definitely return!"
5,"Can&apos;t go wrong here. The burrata was amazing with the hint of truffle flavor. The pizzas we got were both delicious, albeit they were both topping less pizzas. I&apos;d recommend either for a cheese pizza lover! The restaurant was large and empty on a Monday night."
4,"The Order: (Delivery)
Calamari; Meatballs; Chicago Sausage; and Carne Trio pizza with fresh basil, jalapeños, and black olives added. 

The Great:
When I first opened the small plate Sausage, I said &quot;wow, that&apos;s $7 worth of sausage? I thought we&apos;d at least get two.&quot; Well, I shouldn&apos;t have come at it from such a negative place because one bite made it worth the money. This sausage created a flavor explosion in my mouth akin to the fireworks in the movie Ratatouille! It had the perfect blend of savory and sweet enticed in a rich tomatoey sauce. 

The pizza crust was perfect. You could see the air hole and structure when you bit into it. It wasn&apos;t charred on the bottom, but it was definitely crisp. And the tip remained the perfect chewy consistency. The sauce was balanced and not sweet. The trio had a generous portion of meat. 

The Good:
I love fried calamari. You can tell a lot about a kitchen from their calamari. It&apos;s easy to make. Easier to screw up. And difficult to master. Now, because this was delivered it was contained in a wax lined cardboard box when it arrived. Sadly, the box allowed steam to build so the calamari lost some of its fry. That said, more than enough of its light and crisp texture remained to tell that if we&apos;d dined in this would be a fantastic dish. It also came with two sauces, both were great accompaniments. I recommend the restaurant consider a delivery container that allows some of the steam to escape. 

The Meatballs:
I had high hopes for the meatballs following the Chicago Sausage. I really wanted to like these little guys. They weren&apos;t over worked. They remained light and moist. But, they lacked flavor--obviously I&apos;m a meat lover. But, just a beefy meatball doesn&apos;t do it for me. The only flavor on the plate came from the sauce. 

The Verdict:
Quality food--most of which was rich in flavor and prepared well. I&apos;ll definitely return."
5,"I visited Bollo with friends who have been previously. We sat at the bar. The bartender was very nice and just attentive enough. We had hummus as a starter. It was very good. My friend suggested the pepperoni calzone. It wouldn&apos;t have been my first choice, but when someone emphatically suggests something, I go for it. It did not disappoint! Firstly, it&apos;s huge! You can see the char on the dough from the brick oven. The dough was crispy on the outside, but soft inside. And, THE FILLING!!! That filling was not simply cheese and pepperoni. You can taste the garlic and herbs. I will definitely be back to explore the menu!"
5,"I have been to this place like ten times!!! Every time we come we are never disappointed the food is always fresh and very fast and service is always excellent! David was extremely friendly and helpful with recommendations. I always enjoy sitting outside on the patio with such great music and welcoming feel. Pizza comes out hot and flavorful, the fresh herbs are what keeps me coming back for more."
5,"i had a coupon for a cheap pizza so i used it here.

i got the texas wagyu beef pizza. i dont know man, but i think its a waste to grind a wagyu beef.

the garlic parmesan bread was a miss."
4,We recently discovered that the pizzas here are really good and we love them. They have an excellent variety - quite unique and delicious
4,"We stopped by Bollo during COVID so it was very empty and we were seated right away. They had a great selection of wine and a few beers on tap. 

Service was great and the pizzas came out super quick! We got the Pesto pollo pizze without sun dried tomatoes and it was delicious! Loved the topping of goat cheese. The second pizza we ordered was the pancetta and it was also really good. 

Will definitely be back because this place is close to my office."
5,"This is a great vegetarian spot! The truffle burrata is aamazing. Omg I can&apos;t wait to be back. The best pizza in houston, hands down!!"
5,"We were celebrating a friend&apos;s bday and she picked Bollo, very good choice!  We ordered and shared lots of amazing stuff.  Who knew chicken and a white creamy sauce would make such a great pie, pesto, fresh mozzarella cheese, goat cheese, chicken, red onions and sundried tomatoes....yum.  I got the 44 Farms beef pizza, ground beef, fresh mozzarella, red onions and jalapenos....we loved this one too till it was gone.  The arugula pie disappeared as well, buffalo mozzarella, prosciutto do parma, arugula and truffle oil....there were no losers in this pie contest....more yum!  We actually shared two of the chicken pizzas, known as the pesto pollo pie.  My wife had the chicken parmesan, another clear winner.  We shared a frozen peach bellini and thought about getting another.  Bday girl got a decadent piece of three layer....&quot;death by chocolate&quot; cake...with one candle on it and a sprig of mint leaf on top, she offered to share but the rest of us were indulging in diferent flavors of gelato.  My son asked for affogato and when he found it&apos;s not on the menu, he adapted and ordered a scoop of pistachio gelato and an esperesso.....i recognized a great idea and followed suite....pour the espresso over the gelato....and enjoy."
3,The food was ok. Service was great. Atmosphere was nice and clean. It was pretty pricey for the amount of food. I rated a B-. I will not return.
4,"Always a great place to get your pizza fix for a reasonable price without feeling like you just ate a ton of grease. 
There&apos;s plenty of parking in the lot and there&apos;s hardly ever a wait. It&apos;s a small, family feel with great food. Highly recommend trying if you&apos;re ever in the area."
