5,"Still five stars, just giving an update - COVID edition!

I stopped by my all time favorite poke spot for an early outdoor dinner with a friend. We opted for two orders of the best bowl ever - the Tuna Aioli. I&apos;m so glad that seaside has kept this menu option because it&apos;s my absolute favorite. It tasted almost as good as usual with the delicious shoyu, avocado, tuna (and more), though the sauce was a bit less than usual. My friend went back for extra sauce and they were very accommodating. Nonetheless, something to keep in mind if you order delivery or pickup here!

They are taking a good amount of COVID precautions - there&apos;s a table setup as you enter where you can either place an order or pickup. I saw someone waiting by the table area but I&apos;m not sure if they&apos;re open for indoor dining. An employee took our order through a plastic screen and operated the payment on the iPad, only taking our credit card to swipe. The wait was only several minutes long and we were able to enjoy our delicious meal outside!

There are a few tables overlooking EaDo (and the freeway) and it wasn&apos;t at all crowded when we went. Overall a safe and tasty option for any and all of your poke needs!"
5,"A cute place with fresh ingredients, appropriate take out covid precautions, and friendly employees. I got the truffle yellowtail and it was very unique and not your typical poke bowl. Very well balanced. I&apos;ll definitely stop by again next time I&apos;m in the area!"
2,"OK, Seaside gets a 5/5 in terms of COVID safety... you&apos;re barely allowed to walk past the door and you have to order from the entrance. I respect that in this day and age. But in terms of quantity and quality, I was genuinely disappointed. There were barely any fish or sauce or toppings in my bowl. Plus, my order was incorrect (no seaweed, no crab salad). The fish was quite bland, and the 5-scoop special featured less substance than a 3-fer at Ono Poke or the like. Frankly, not an enjoyable meal at all. Hoping that things run more smoothly during non-pandemic times."
4,"I&apos;m such a fan of this place, even before the pandemic! It&apos;s a great gem to have in EaDo. I remember when it was only 1 of 3 places on this particular block, but businesses have really blossomed in EaDo since then. It&apos;s nice to see this neighborhood growing.  

I like the taste, efficiency, and attention to detail of Seaside Poke.  For a while, it was my go-to Friday lunch.  I always ordered a regular salmon ponzu bowl and the hubs always went for a large truffle yellow-tail.  We didn&apos;t patronize weekly when the pandemic began, because we didn&apos;t know what to expect. After reading about how they were handling orders, we felt comforted enough to patronize.  

It was great and well-organized! There were a couple of people waiting for their orders outside the restaurant as we approached. As we approached (in our masks ofc), an employee came out with a clipboard (and wearing a mask) to take our order. We were able to order, pay, and take our food home in adequate time all the while maintaining physical-distance from employees and other customers.  

We didn&apos;t get to check our order until we were home, but it was not only accurate, but it the names of our orders were written on the lids as well. This was great - taste, efficiency, or attention to details was never compromised all the while following CDC orders. We&apos;re happy to re-add Seaside Poke to our take-out rotation."
2,"The most recent reviews in here are correct. The portion is quite skimpy. While they provide a lot of protein for the regular ($11.37 after tax), they are so light on the toppings (compared to other competitors like PokeWorks) that I was left eating just fish towards the end of my meal. I was left not close to full after my meal which is disappointing for what I paid for. It doesn&apos;t compare to other poke places price wise. 
The flavors were good, nothing uniquely special though."
5,My favorite Poke place I&apos;ve been to ever! I have family in Houston so I visit 2-4 times a year.  Every time I bust I also visit seaside poke! Food is amazing and they allow you to pick as many toppings and sauces as you want free. With the exception of avocado and maybe a couple other premium add ins.  Definitely try Seaside if youre in the area!
4,"This is a review for the location in Understory. 

It&apos;s my first time here and I&apos;m usually not into poke since I don&apos;t eat raw fish but I was so happy they had a cooked option here! I got the Kani Baked for $10 and it was super yummy. You have the option of getting either rice or salad as the base. Service was also pretty fast. 

This would be a go-to place for me if they have more cooked options or if they even had shrimp, but alas."
2,"This place simply was not good. I&apos;m sure for those who&apos;ve never had sashimi or poke before you may not know the difference and you may like this but I&apos;ve had both extensively and the fish here was clearly sub-par. The rice was also dry and not sticky how it should be, and the wakame (seaweed salad) was lacking in flavor. Although the price wasn&apos;t bad ($15), the quality of the bowl was really lackluster and not worth it."
1,"I ordered a regular &apos;build your own&apos; bowl at this location earlier this week on Thursday. I&apos;m always trying out different like places, and I had been to Seaside before in March 2018 and everything was fine. However, this time around I was highly disappointed with my order. The quantity and the quality of the food was very lacking and mediocre. I was expecting the portion to a lot bigger than what is pictured below. I paid almost $12 for the order and that price absolutely does not match the portion and the quality of the food during my visit. This is overall very disappointing and unsatisfying, as it seems there are far better poke restaurants in Houston. Next time, I would rather go to Pok√©works or Ono Poke before even thinking about coming here. Save yourself the time and money.

Side note, I tried using a Visa gift card during my visit on Thursday and their card machines apparently don&apos;t take gift cards. How unprofessional..."
2,"I hate this place and I try to avoid it if possible. These people roll their eyes when you walk in. They all have an attitude. Based on body language It feels like they&apos;re REALLY doinG YOU favor by serving you food. 

They don&apos;t take cash post COVID and I don&apos;t think they took cash beforehand. They&apos;re too cool for that. 

Unfortunately this is the only keto menu offering in walking distance so I will be back. Ideally that new bbq/beer garden place opening up on Leeland and Hutchins will open up soon so I&apos;ll never have to come here and beg for food again."
3,"Went for the build your own bowl so I could sample a little of everything!  You can get rice and salad as a base, though I wish there was a brown rice option.  The toppings and crunches are really good and there&apos;s a selection I haven&apos;t seen at other places.  Fish is ok but hard to taste with all the sauce poured on.  I only picked one sauce but everything was covered.  The rice is cooked pretty well though.
I guess I&apos;m labeling this as average because of the portions.  For the number of toppings I picked, I expected a lot more to the bowl, but I came away still very hungry.  And with the regular being priced around $10, this becomes an expensive snack rather than a meal.
Understory doesn&apos;t have tap water either, so you&apos;ll have to hunt around for a drink.  Otherwise, you can buy bottles from SeaSide.  Maybe next time I&apos;ll have to try one of the bowls on the menu."
2,"First time eating here. I live closer to this place than Pokeworks, so I wanted to give it a chance. I basically paid $15 for and unseasoned bowl of sushi rice and 7 cubes of tuna. There was nothing other than sauce, tuna, crispy onions, and a few cucumbers. What a rip off! If you&apos;re lookin for great poke, I would recommend going to Pokeworks instead. 

I added pics of what was advertised vs what was actually delivered to me."
1,"I have not once written a bad review but my experience at this place was so bad I felt the need to share. 
I walked in and they asked me to take my temp at the machine
 (totally understandable due to the circumstances now) but the machine was not &quot;charged&quot; so I was unable to do so. Automatically the man at the register was extremely rude to me. I was on the phone getting my friend&apos;s order as I was repeating it to the guy. I asked if he got it down, and he responded with a &quot;no&quot;. I repeated my order and he was talking over me so arrogantly. I was so upset, that I told him he was being rude and he started yelling/arguing with me across the restaurant. The guy had no shame and was doing this so in front of customers. 
When I was finally able to get my food and leave the restaurant they called the towing company to put a boot on my car (very vindictive). I was literally there crying because now I had to pay $115.00 dollars to get the boot out of my car. 
It&apos;s unfortunate because the food is delicious but ironically they left such a bad taste in my mouth. I will NEVER go again. I don&apos;t believe in the cancel culture but I would hate if this happened to anyone again. I do not recommend it."
1,"First time here. I am a big fan of poke. 
Terrible experience...
Small portions, customer service is non-existent, and quality is substandard at best. 
Hard to believe this place is still in business. 
Their lack of care for customers is apparent through their actions and poor communication. 
Save your money and go elsewhere. 
So many other poke options within the area."
5,"Close to the Houston Convention Center and had a quick lunch here while attending meetings at the center. Nice decorations on the wall, which were really unique. I had the classic poke in regular size, and chose tuna as the protein. Added cucumbers, onions, corns and etc as sides and sweet shoyu. They offer w wide variety of toppings and oils, and I tried the lemon oil, which went well with the sweet flavor of the shoyu. Nice place to grab something healthy."
5,Very dope and tasty spot! Prime location near Minute Maid park and other bars. Has a great Houston vibe to it and of course the poke is top notch! Very fresh and tasteful!
2,"Not Great. Portions are way smaller then anywhere else and they just sprinkle ingredients into a bowl. The chili oil wasn&apos;t very spicy. I&apos;d have to be forced back. Typical EaDo joint - to-good-to-be-true. 
Traveling I have tried all sorts of Poke Places from DC to San Fransisco and my favorite food has always been found here in Houston. Unfortunately that&apos;s not true for Poke. Try again Houston."
5,"This place has become my cheat meal on Friday night! Seaside Poke has not disappointed me and I can stop eating here. I always get the Aioli Tuna bowl. The tuna here is always fresh, red and tasty! All their ingredients are yummy and bowls are made to order in front of you. One thing I&apos;ve noticed is that the staff is very attentive and always has great recommendations, if you&apos;re not sure which bowl to get. Located in Eado, right off St. Emanuel, parking is right across the street or you can park along the street if its available. Come try this spot if you&apos;re ever in the Eado area, you&apos;re going to love it!

5,"My daughter&apos;s chose Seaside for her choice for lunch.I like the fact here is that you can have custom made
Poke bowls.I went all out with my bowl with the Salmon and every topping offered.I really enjoyed the employees who were very professional addressing me by name and explaining the set up.Daughters new place .We will be back."
4,"First time visiting this restaurant and was very satisfied! I love that they put the sweet shoyu sauce on the rice to give an added kick of flavor. The fish was plenty to fill me up with the regular sized bowl and it went great with one of their BABE Rose (who knew you could get rose in a can?). 

I had salmon and tuna, added crab, and then some basic fillings with the spicy aioli. Great combination. Would recommend."
