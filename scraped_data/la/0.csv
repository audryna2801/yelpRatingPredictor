I have gone when outdoor seating was available during covid and they were able to seat us distanced from other parties in a nice patio area.

For food, I would recommend any of the burgers as that definitely seems to be their best seller along with their award winning bread pudding. (make sure to get it with a scoop of ice-cream)

Overall a location I know I will be back to soon!"
5,"So glad  the Morrison was open during this covid epidemic, 
They&apos;re always so courteous and eager to serve, I was glad to sit outside in the new patio area filled with good vibes, great food, and yummy drinks. It was a well-needed Escape and now I cant wait to come back again."
5,"This lovely restaurant is delivering and providing take out orders during the COVID crisis. Support a local place that deserves to survive the pandemic! I just ordered take out, picked it up with practically no wait, the food was packed nicely and served fresh. One of the best meals I&apos;ve ever had at home. I&apos;ll definitely be coming here again. In person is the best experience but take out is really close! Let&apos;s continue to support the local and small businesses!"
4,"Service went downhill but I still love the food...
 
My daughter and I placed an online order from the Morrison on a Monday night.  We arrived early and waited in the parking lot for approximately 20 minutes until the online status of our food showed &quot;Ready for pickup.&quot;

The restaurant was somewhat busy as outdoor dining was open but it wasn&apos;t super crowded.  My daughter went to pick up our food and was told by Jaime that our order was not placed because they hadn&apos;t checked &quot;the tablet.&quot;  Obviously, after already waiting for 20 minutes in the car, we were not happy to hear the news.  Jaime didn&apos;t make it any easier by not apologizing.  She seemed annoyed that my daughter was upset.  She merely  said that she would place the order.

After waiting an additional 15 minutes in the car, we received our food.  Our food was nicely packaged and in decent portion.  Unfortunately, my order of the Veggie Burger without aioli had aioli smothered in between the bottom bun and the lettuce, and I had to scrape it out.  Other than that, the food was delicious especially the humongous pretzel. 

I will definitely visit again but I won&apos;t order online again."
2,"Meh is the perfect descriptor for the Morrison. 

I&apos;ve been here a couple times and both times I&apos;ve been unimpressed. On my most recently time dining here,  I ordered the &apos;One Burger&apos;. In theory this should be an amazing Burger. It is &apos;The One&apos; after all. In actuality its a disappointing,  underseasoned,  overcooked, mess of a burger.  Super uninspiring toppings on a dry, tough beef patty. 

For $25 dollars I expect something incredible.  Not something that leaves me going &quot;meh&quot;."
5,"Came here after wanting to try it for many years. I was greeted by jaime and I believe Jennifer ( the nixe bartender) . They were such a breathe of fresh air. They greeted me with so much kindness. They love their job and are really good at it. They were very patient and went thru the menu with me.  I placed my order over the phone and it was ready in 15 mins. I asked for condiments on the side was everything was exceptional bagged. 

Definitely check this place out. Everything is delicious, great prices and huge portions."
4,"We phoned a large takeout order and the estimated pick up time was in 15min! When we arrived 15 min later it was ready! No wait. 3 burgers (comes with fries), 1 chili dog and 4 filet tacos. I had the truffle burger which was great. Prepared medium rare just how I like it but the patty needed more salt/pepper seasoning. But altogether with the other condiments, great flavor. The food was still warm when we made it home. Staff were friendly and quick. I had the pleasure of eating indoors before COVID-19 but for now they have outdoor seating. Parking is very small and even tighter now because of the space taken away for outdoor seating. Difficult parking is my only gripe about this place. Hope they can reopen fully soon!"
5,"Such a great place. Our server was Nicholas and he was on top of everything! Prices/happy hour was great, kid friendly, fast service awesome set up, and AMAZING food. We had the chicken sandwich and turkey burger along with the kids hot dog meal. Honestly we will be going back any time we are in the area."
5,"Nice place! 
Kind employees,  good service, great food and yes the bread pudding is amazing with the Jameson glaze yummy! 
We had chicken nachos and truffle burger and bbq ribs and classic burger and truffle fries and onion rings. 
Will definitely come back."
5,"Great food, cocktails  and dessert!! The outdoor setup probably seats more than before. Heat lamps everywhere"
4,Love everything about this place.   They have the best burgers also they have draft beer which is always fun .  I recommend this place to anyone looking for good food . They also have a new patio setup where customers can sit down and eat .  Two thumbs up to Morrison&apos;s .
5,"Not only was the food delicious, the service was outstanding! Everyone was so friendly!! Highly recommend the Cobb salad, Brussels sprouts and, of course,  the piece de resistance, the amazing bread pudding!"
5,"Great food, great service, great vibe! Tonight was our first night out since October. We made a great choice by going to The Morrison. Margaret was our server and she did a fantastic job. The restaurant is truly fortunate to have her representing the company. A true asset. I do have to say everyone there was very friendly and very accommodating, but most of our interaction was with Margaret. We had delicious onion rings for an appetizer, wife had patty melt  and I had a cheeseburger. They both came with the best fries I&apos;ve ever had and both were delicious! We finished with salted caramel cheesecake, which will be my last meal if I&apos;m given a choice. Lol. Anyway can&apos;t wait to go back. Hopefully our inept governor won&apos;t close us down again so this fantastic place will be here for years to come."
4,"I would definitely say delicious but still has room for improvement.  Me and my partner got the two best dishes based off yelp, which was the bacon burger with Mac and cheese &amp; the mignon burger with the side of sweet potato fries. I honestly thought the mignon burger was going to be the better plate but the Bacon burger had the amazing flavor. So if you had to choose don&apos;t let the mignon fool ya, go with the Bacon burger if you don&apos;t like blue cheese like me I subbed for pepper jack. The mignon was just very tough, I couldn&apos;t even bite through the burger. Both of the burgers were missing ingredients like lettuce and tomatoes.    
Despite the let down on the mignon burger, The sides were amazing and I definitely recommend both Mac and cheese and sweet potato fries.  I&apos;m real picky on Sweet potato fries and these were on point!  Tasty and crispy. 
  Prices are a bit high  try happy hour for better prices."
5,I had the best experience for Valentines day here. Best service ever. The food was fucken delicious and our pups thought so too. Always my favorite spot
4,"I have not yet been to The Morrison although it has been on my list forever.  However, due to COVID19, I decided on takeout.  I ordered through UberEats and waited for my food.  The first thing I noticed when I got the food was that everything was sealed including the bag it was in.  Due to the ongoing pandemic, I really did appreciate this detail.  They also provided utensils, plenty of condiments and chocolate mints (love chocolate mints). I ordered a few items from the menu to try:

1. Ribeye Steak and Fries - This was probably my least favorite item.  The steak was overcooked and a little bland.  And, the chimichurri was not as flavorful making the steak a little bland. The fries were really delicious. 
2. Cornbeef sandwich and fries - Enjoyed the cornbeef sandwich (and of course the fries).  It is on the smaller side. 
3. Mac and Cheese - Really enjoyed it.  It was creamy and rich.  They do give a lot, so I had plenty of leftover
4. Bread Pudding - I thought this was a little too sweet, but I had a few bite and it was pretty good (and very moist). 

All in all, I thought that the food was 3.5 (however, I am thinking that had I eaten the food at the restaurant, some of the items might have been a little better).  But, I am bumping my rating up to a 4 because I really did appreciate the small touches that they had (providing sealed bags, condiments, and sealed utensils) that eased my worries about ordering food during the pandemic. I am definitely hoping to go to the restaurant in person sometime soon."
4,Such a cute place it&apos;s a shame it&apos;s only outdoor dining but it was still a nice lunch spot. Great service even during a busy lunch time. Ample parking and great menu. I got the fish and chips and they have a doggy menu! $6 and it&apos;s more for large dogs but my pup enjoyed his plate. The kids plate is $8 and the chicken strips were slightly over fried with jerky like chicken.
4,"Great neighborhood joint close to home, used to go almost weekly pre CoVID and just went again after almost a year. Staff seems new but great, food is pretty much the same and tables distanced as needed. Relaxing environment, miss the bar and hope you guys open again soon!"
4,Went here while on vacation.Really enjoyed this place.Came here after wanting to try it for many years.We started going here the last few years and love it.
4,"Very good food and atmosphere. Safe covid practices which we very much appreciated. The waitress was very nice. Most importantly, they were very friendly to dogs (see pictures attached)! Would recommend."
