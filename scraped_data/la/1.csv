5,"thank god for postmates, thank god for howlin&apos; ray&apos;s. 

i have braved the three hour wait for this hot chicken sandwich on more than one occasion. perhaps the greatest quarantine flex was being able to have it delivered to my door instead! 

yes, the hype is real. yes, it&apos;s well deserved. yes, you should absolutely order it for dinner tonight. you won&apos;t be disappointed."
5,"Yo, what can I say about Howlin&apos; Rays that hasn&apos;t been said already? Besides..... They&apos;re the shit, their sandwiches slay just about everyone in the chicken sando game, and even their fries get love dust sprinkled on them! OH, and their staff is cool. I came on a dry run to Pearl City and  I saw one of their folks delivering goodness to a delivery cat.  I asked what the Hack was? I told them Postmates didn&apos;t deliver Howlin to the west side so he asked for my card and hooked me up! Im so glad he did cuz I been trying to get a sando from them for years! Oh and the hack is to get Postmates to deliver to their  address or a spot nearby-I feel the delivery guys are already up on game. Lol, just about every car in front of the store had a person eating, or waiting for a delivery!"
5,"Shake Fries are back! I have missed the spice powder on these fries, even tried to whip up my own concoction, but it wasn&apos;t the same. We were so excited to see the shake fries back, now we get the crunch AND the kick! We&apos;ve been using Postmates but just set the delivery address to the Howlin Rays building. It&apos;s been working great. We&apos;ve been to a few other hot chicken sandwich spots, but none are on the same level as Howlin Rays! The chicken quality is so good, tender and juicy. No nonsense like fat or gristle. The sandwich was a tad more crispy when we ate it right out of line, but still totally worth it. Super grateful that they are still open."
4,"Howlin&apos; Ray&apos;s currently is only available on Postmates for delivery. 

Before the pandemic, I tried their fried chicken and honestly didn&apos;t get the hype. It was decent-- crispy on the outside and the meat was pretty juicy but the taste was quite one-dimensional for me as I didn&apos;t taste anything but the spicy flavor. Don&apos;t get me wrong, I love spicy food, but I don&apos;t like spicy food that&apos;s just spicy without any other flavors to it.

This time around, I ordered two chicken sandwiches (1 medium and 1 medium plus) with 1 comeback sauce. The chicken sandwich was definitely better than the fried chicken. The bun was just okay-- I&apos;ve had better. 
The chicken itself was more flavorful and not too crunchy (which I liked). The coleslaw and pickles tasted fresh. It also added a different texture to elevate the chicken sandwich.
I had the medium-plus and would recommend getting at least the hot level if you love spicy food; the medium-plus barely got any kick to it. 

Overall, the food itself was good, but it was way overpriced from the delivery.
I ended up paying almost $40 with the taxes, fees, and delivery tips. 
So, was it tasty? Yes. 
But would I pay almost $20 for this chicken sandwich? Definitely no.

I will probably wait until they resume their take-out before ordering from them again."
5,"What can I say about the grandaddy of the LA Hot Chicken Sandwich,  other than absolute perfection?  They were the first and are also the best. 

This is the most tender, juicy,  delicious chicken I&apos;ve ever had.

Get your chicken Hot, if not higher. Yes,  it&apos;s spicy. Yes, you&apos;ll be in pain. Yes, you may cry. But the pain and tears are worth it. If you want it Medium or Mild, do it I guess. It&apos;s still going to the best damn chicken you&apos;ve ever had. But you&apos;ll be missing out. You can tell they put a lot of time and thought into their spice blends and I think Hot is where that really shines.  It&apos;s literally euphoric.  It complements their chicken extremely well and takes you though a spice journey.  You feel it on your lips, in your head, out your ears, and in your stomach. 

I travel to another plane of existence whenever I have this chicken.  A place where everything will be OK.

Chef&apos;s also a real hero. He once snuck a piece of chicken and some cookies into my bag when I went to buy a shirt. Brought a tear to my eye.  He&apos;s a real legend."
4,"My boyfriend and I were in the area, so we wanted to stop by. We were surprised there was no long lines! As we got closer to the door, we realized they only are accepting Postmates order. We were thinking that they probably just allow online order and pickup, but that was not the case. You are only allowed to order online for delivery. 

Before I ordered, we were thinking if we can just order &quot;delivery&quot; and wait for the driver and let them know that it&apos;s our order. We decided to ask the workers if there&apos;s a way to order in person or we just have to flag down the driver. They suggested that we ordered in person and get it deliver to our parking spot. We felt like that was a hassle because Chinatown&apos;s parking is bad. 

We parked at a gas station and ordered. We got the Skinny Jimmy in Medium Plus, The Sando in Medium, and a Macaroni Salad. It was so good! My boyfriend felt like Medium Plus was so spicy and he usually eats very spicy. The difference between The Sando and The Skinny Jimmy was that The Sando is a sandwich that consists of their sauce, cole slaw, and pickles, while the Skinny Jimmy was chicken and toast only."
5,"Amazing customer service. Despite the complications of COVID, this place went above and beyond to make sure my order was taken care of. I didn&apos;t have to brave the usual 2-3 hour long wait, but ordered then picked up and was so happy with how the employees handled my order. Shout out to Luis (sp?) !! Thank you!! 
The Sando was delicious, juicy, and the perfect amount of spice (medium). I would definitely come back for it, but what sold me was the employees/customer service! 10/10 would recommend!"
5,"Heard about this place for a long time, but people always told me that the wait will be 2 hours. I wouldn&apos;t wait 2 hours for anything honestly. I&apos;m in the area and I thought I would try to order it on Postmates. Only takes 30 min to deliver, I timed it so when I arrived at my friend&apos;s placey delivery is also here, which is super awesome :)
I really don&apos;t like chicken breast in general, but this one is super juicy. Both the burger and the wing taste great. and I would definitely come back and eat it again. I need get more before everything open up because I&apos;m just not sure if I would enjoy it as much if I had to wait 2 hours. LOL"
5,"ok ok ok. this review is EXTREMELY LOOONGG overdue. After I moved to LA, I am not ashamed that I have visited this place at least once a month. Whether it to be showing friends around or just plain cravings.... you name it. YES i&apos;ve waited in the god awful 3 hour waiting line.... all forever worth it, I swear. 

shout out to JULIANNN MATT MARIO JAMIEEE (&amp; Johnny ray zone ofc) miss you guys dearly

The HYPE IS REAL. 
- if you havent had it before -- chicken sandwich is the way to go. I usually go with medium, but if you can handle a little more spice, I heard they ventured out with a new level -- medium plus. The jump from medium to hot is pretty big imo. I usually get this because it has all the juicy chicken and the crunchy sweet coleslaw is perrrrfect. 
If youre feeling extra hungry or want a slice of cheese? Go for the LUIS STYLE.  Buttered toasty white bread with a slice of melty cheese. its a little bigger than the regular sando. 
pair this with a wing or two for some crunchy goodness. 
(you can ask for sandwiches cut in half. I usually finish half and eat some fries bc its its FUCKING HUUUGE)

-if you want CHICKEN -- i recommenced the quarter bird (I like thigh/dark meat) OR TENDERS. I usually go down a spice level if I eat only chicken. There isn&apos;t coleslaw to help the burrrrnnn. It also helps me really taste and appreciate how well they cook the chicken without being distracted and overwhelmed by how much my mouth is burning and sweating from the spiceeeee

FRIES
If youre sharing with more than 3 people, I recommend the MARIO FRIES. Its literally a chicken sando on top of their fries. 
I also like the MATT FRIES, but its because I love their collard greens sauce and melty cheese on top. does not come with any chicken, but does come with bacon! 
(sorry julez-- your fries were wayyy too spicy for meee)

tips:
I like mixing the peace ice tea with lemonade because that shit bomb
BANANA PUDDING IS BOMB. THANK MARIO FOR THAT
pickles. im not a pickle fan, but they really cut that spicy shit so its not so intense.
ask for comeback sauce. it&apos;s the holy grail of sauces. 

the lowdown on the HOWLIN (PLUS)
-you have to sign a waiver
-you should/have to wear gloves
-if you eat inside, they might give you milk if youre dying
-maybe they will give you some snack size chocolate if youre still dying
I have tried bits and pieces of the Howlin&apos; but not a full wing or anything like that. HELLA SPICY BOIZ

THINGS I MISS ABOUT INDOOR DINING:
-THE VIBESSS. if you can snag a seat inside, it will literally be the best restaurant experience of your life. Every person working LOVES THEIR JOB. Everyone is extremely nice and amazing, and makes you feel like you&apos;re a friend. every damn time. 
-THE HAND OFF. ask for a hand off if you get a sandwich! best to sit in the bar area right by where they prep and cook the food. (ok now that I typed that, I realize this will prob not happen anytime soon bc of covid) 
-also having the bestttt music blastinggg

parking:
there is usually metered parking around the area. If there is no parking, I usually park at the bank area and pay the $5 flat fee and walk over. 

ok for everyone who has read this far, if they reopen, my secret is to come at 530-6pm."
5,"In all my years of living in LA, I had never been to Howlin&apos; Ray&apos;s because of the crazy line. Weirdly enough, the pandemic made finally trying their famed sandwiches easy. 

My friends and I made the trek over from Orange County on a Saturday morning, parked a block away from the restaurant in Chinatown, and ordered delivery via Postmates to our car. 

I have never scarfed down a sandwich so quickly! Howlin&apos; Ray&apos;s definitely lives up to the hype. The hefty chicken was so juicy and flavorful, the pickles and slaw perfectly offset the spice on the chicken, and the bun was incredible. I got the medium plus, which definitely had a nice kick, but I might even venture to try the next spice level up the next time I go. My friends swear their wings are better than their sandwiches, but I didn&apos;t get a chance to try one. Will 100% be returning!"
4,"The process of getting a hot chicken is not easy! You have to order through Postmates only. (We ordered 12/23/20) 

Menu is super simple, follow their IG for most updated hours. 

2 hot chicken sandwiches ended up being $39. Quite steep of a price... 
+1 pickles are definitely made in house! It was yummy 
+1 coleslaw was pretty good too! 
+1 the breading on the chicken was a bit lighter than I expected, and it was still delicious! 
+1 had a nice spice to it all! Flavoring was good 
+1 thick piece of chicken breast - YUM! 

Overall, I can see why people enjoy this! I don&apos;t know if I&apos;d wait hours for it, but the price is very reasonable for the the quality. The 1 star missing is the process of ordering, otherwise, the chicken sandwich is delicious!"
5,"If you have been dying to try howlin then now is your time! They are currently doing delivery only so you have to order through Postmates. I ordered and had the delivery person bring it to my car around the corner.

It is safe to say that Howlin rays has set my expectation for all chicken sandwiches out there.

My brother and I got the med and the hot sandwich and both were good. We love spicy food so hot was pretty satisfying but if you want to keep tasting your food then stick to medium.

The first bite into the sandwich was so satisfying. The chicken was perfectly juicy with the right amount of seasoning. The slaw and pickles helped with giving it a nice crunch y factor as well as more flavor! The bread was good! I liked that it was not soggy.

This was the best chicken sandwich that I have ever had. If you have not had it yet then you&apos;re definitely missing out! Go and get one nowww.!"
5,"After hearing all of the hype, I finally had the time to venture out here to give Howlin&apos; Ray&apos;s a try. It was so bomb and totally worth it! 

PARKING: I was able to find metered street parking that was good for up to 1.5 hr. There is also a few private paid parking lots nearby. If you come here when they are still doing covid, other reviews mentioned parking at a gas station and having your postmates delivered there to avoid paying for metered spots.

COVID-RELATED: What sucks is they&apos;re ONLY doing postmates. Although my husband and I were physically there, they were not taking any orders. We had to order through postmates. Kind of lame, but I guess this is understandable to limit the contact and risk of exposure for their employees. 

THE SANDO: This iconic sandwich comes with a boneless fried chicken breast, slaw, comeback sauce, pickles, and butter bun. I wasn&apos;t sure if this always comes in pieces or if that&apos;s just how it&apos;s packaged for Covid, but I had to add the pickles, slaw, and sauce into the burger. It was scrumptious! I got it in MILD which was perfect!

TENDERS: This order comes with 4 tenders and I decided to try this in MEDIUM, which is definitely the type of kick where you feel like you need to drink water but manageable. Might stick with mild for my personal preference. This also already comes with a side of the comeback sauce. I didn&apos;t know and accidentally ordered one."
4,"Located in good Ol&apos; Chinatown, Los Angeles. Yes, my old stomping grounds. How time has changed, and gentrification has come into affect. All good though.

Howlin Ray&apos;s makes delicious chicken. A bit on the spicy side, yes you might feel the after affects sitting on the toilet... (totally understand what the other reviewer was pertaining to). LoL.

I always order the dark meats, and their chicken sandwiches. Huge proportions, that&apos;ll spice you up. A drink on the side is a must for me.  I love it. Their white meat chicken breasts are a bit too dry at times. So regardless, it&apos;s probably best to enjoy your meal as soon as it&apos;s delivered. 

Howlin Ray&apos;s has been popular since day one. It&apos;s so amazing how there&apos;s always a line when I go (pre-pandemic). It might take up to two hours waiting to order. I guess it&apos;s worth the wait for some people.

Anyhow, I like the food here, but I&apos;m not too fond of the long wait. It seems more like a social gathering.

3-1/2 Stars, but I&apos;ll it up to 4 its uniqueness!"
5,"I&apos;ve been waiting years to finally try Howlin&apos; Rays! I&apos;ve heard soooo many great things about this place and am so happy we were able to try it.

F O O D
I&apos;ve had my fair share of chicken sandwiches and I can confidently say this is the best chicken sandwich I&apos;ve tried! My bf and I got the medium spice chicken sando. The size of the chicken in my sandwich was huge. It was twice the size of the bun, with half of the chicken hanging out since it couldn&apos;t fit the bun. The chicken is SO juicy and SO flavorful. There is so much seasoning coated on the chicken. Since we got medium, it tasted spicy but had just a litttttleeee hint of sweetness too. Spice levels are relative, so for spice lovers like me and my bf, medium was perfect for us. Not too spicy, but enough spice to have our noses running! I caution those who can&apos;t handle spice to keep it safe and level down. Other than the chicken, the bun, slaw, pickles, and overall sauce was really good. We also got fries on the side and those were crispy and salty.

E X P E R I E N C E
We went through a roller coaster of emotions the day that we ordered. Since all orders go through Postmates, we tried to time it so that we would arrive at our destination with little time to wait for our food. But Postmates showed that Howlin&apos; Rays was &apos;Too Busy&apos; to accept any orders. We kept refreshing and no luck- we were hopeless. However, as we were driving to LA, the orders magically opened up again and we were able to order seamlessly! We got very lucky, and timed it well so that we only waited at our destination for about 5 minutes. Even though with COVID and exclusively Postmates orders we aren&apos;t able to have the full experience of waiting in line and receiving their notorious customer service, it was worth it! 
TLDR: If Postmates shows that Howlin Rays is &apos;Too Busy&apos;, keep checking and refreshing their page!! It will open up for orders when you least expect it."
4,"Finally got a chance to try this place when my coworkers and I decided to get some fried chicken, have heard so many positive feedback about their signature fried chicken from frequent customers, but could never afford over 1 hour wait for a chicken Sando. As long as they&apos;re offering delivery only, we made our decision and all I can do is agree that the hype is real! 

The portion was huge, the chicken was bigger than the bun and was super tender. I ordered the mild and it was just the perfect amount of heat and the comeback sauce was a nice compliment. But be aware I saw people sweating with just the Medium. Fries on the side were good as well.

Overall, after 1/2 hr wait the food was absolutely worth it. Their Sandro was really delicious. Will order from here again!"
5,"This is the golden staple of Nashville hot chicken in Los Angeles. Not only is their food the real deal, but their customer service is legendary. All of the others try to mimic Howlin Rays success but they all fail."
5,"Ordered my sando via Postmates and my lunch was elevated to extraordinary. These guys are still the gold standard in L.A. when it comes to Nashville fried chicken:

Terrific crunch, super savory and spicy, soft bun, tangy slaw on top! Yum, yum, yum!

Bomb!

Totally worth splurging for with the added fees and tip. An acceptable substitute for not waiting an hour or two in line. I hope they adopt Postmates permanently."
5,"Howling&apos; is a quintessential LA experience. The lines are VERY long. Understand this and accept it. Also know that it&apos;s worth it and there are some work around. Follow them on social media for wait times, or arrive really early in the morning (and hour+ before they open) and have a coffee with your friends or a beer.
Do it with friends! It&apos;s so worth!!"
5,"Quite clear that the consensus is that the addicting red seasoning paste here makes this chicken sandwich the hottest in town. The fragrant skin soaked with jaw-wrenching dried peppers batter makes me savor every bite into the Howlin&apos; Hot sandwich. But what led me to finally taste the juicy, huge pieces was an incredible act of philanthropy from the good folks behind Howlin&apos; Ray&apos;s.

Tess from this insanely popular restaurant got in contact with our organization working textphone banks to engage Asian Americans for the recent election. Tess graciously supported our cause, and the Howlin&apos; team donated a feast of addicting chicken sandwiches for all our volunteers!

Even opening a second store in Pasadena in the midst of a pandemic, the top-notch team behind this buzzing kitchen stayed positively passionate about giving back to their community as much as they are obsessed with serving the best quality ingredients that you deserve.  

All this made my first bite ever more delicious!"
