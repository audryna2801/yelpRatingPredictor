4,"4 stars because they have no parking making it an inconvenience and also their sign is in a difficult place on the building . It should be facing ongoing traffic no directly on the front of the building because a person would end up passing it because they don&apos;t see it coming up while their driving. (Happened to me)

 I got the blue velvet cake. It was definitely delicious, I don&apos;t really care for the blueberries in the middle . I would much rather prefer the blue velvet with no blueberries added because they really take away from the cake . 
I got the cake cold so I let it sit out at room temp for a while to soften and it was delicious ! Definitely would try again. 
Next time I would like to taste their ice cream!"
4,"For LA, Milk is surprisingly affordable and delivers delicious, quality ice cream. Dessert places in LA are usually a hit-or-miss, opting to appeal to trends than actual quality. They offer a variety of ice cream flavors, as well as milkshakes, sundaes, ice cream sandwiches, cookies and coffee. Their flavors range from traditional (vanilla bean, Rocky Road, and strawberry) to unique (green tea rose swirl, coconut sorbet, banana dulce de leche). I love the homey, old school vibe and that they opt for quality over fanfare and fleeting trends.

Parking is available on N Poinsettia Street (and adjoining streets too).

We got two cups of three scoops of ice cream: one had two scoops of red velvet and a scoop of tres leches; the second had coffee toffee, banana dulce de leche, and tres leches. Each cup was $7.50. So worth! And for huge scoops and delicious ice cream!

Red Velvet is delicious and not overwhelmingly sweet (unlike Sprinkles). The cake is moist and they mix huge chucks of cake into the ice cream.

Banana Dulce de Leche is fabulous -- indulgent and a great balance of sweet notes between the caramel and banana flavors. The nuts add a nice texture contrast.

Tres Leches is silky and smooth. Love the soft bits of cake in it. Delicious.

Coffee Toffee was my favorite! The coffee flavor is intense and I love the generous toffee bits mixed into it. Adds a nice crunch.

**FYI this has been sitting in my drafts since quarantine started!! I visited this cute ice cream place in February"
5,"First time I tried their Thai Tea ice cream Cookie sandwich I was hooked - that was many years ago.  It became my go-to place for cookie cravings..... I&apos;ve tried pretty much all their cookies by now and my all time favorites have become the classic chocolate chip and oatmeal cookies, but each of their flavors bare yummy.

My favorite thing to order now is a pint of Thai Tea ice cream- so creamy good, it&apos;s better than drinking Thai Tea and then I order a bunch of cookies and binge at home or share with friends.  I have yet to try another ice cream flavor but I am so hooked at the uniqueness of their Thai Tea, it&apos;s hard to move on, though I keep swearing I will!!!

Not to be mistaken with &quot;Milk Bar&quot; on Melrose - Milk is an LA original while I believe Milk Bar is from New York.  Being from LA, I am loyal to Milk even if Milk Bar is within walking distance from my house.

In this time of Covid19, you cannot go in to the store.... they&apos;ve set up an order table on the side entrance by Poinsettia.  You form a line - 6 ft apart, place your order and pay with the server - menu is on the order table - and very quickly he/she comes back with your order.  Easy, quick and makes me so happy"
4,"Not bad of a wait time they are pretty quick and the customer service is good too. However, they informed us that they just took out the Cookies &amp; Cream ice cream from the freezer and it was too cold for it to be scooped and served, so that was kind of disappointing, but hey it is what it is.

Review time!

So we got the Thai Tea ice cream, Vanilla ice cream, a fruity pebbles cookie, and the blue velvet cake (sounded interesting, so why not right?)

Thai Tea - 5/5 - It was truly unique and really good!

Vanilla - 2/5 - If you&apos;re coming here for Vanilla ice cream, then take it from me and save yourself a trip and go to your local grocery store and get HÃ¤agen-Dazs ice cream.

Fruity Pebble Cookie - 0/5 - You know that saying &quot;and that&apos;s the way the cookie crumbles&quot;? Well, this cookie definitely did not crumble or bend for that matter. It was harder than the *Still D.R.E* soundtrack from DR. Dre &amp; Snoop Dogg, and that song goes hard till this day. 5/5 for the song, but not the cookie.

Blue Velvet Cake - 3/5 - It was good and the blueberries tasted really good and fresh, but the cake was a bit too sweet in my opinion. 

Customer Service 5/5 - Thumbs up!


In conclusion, if I&apos;m being honest the average score of would score them 3 stars from my personal experience and review, but I&apos;m generous, so 4 stars! I&apos;ll be going back in the future to hopefully try the Cookies &amp; Cream ice cream and get some more Thai tea ice cream.

Thank you!"
5,"Love this place! I literally drive from the valley at least once a weekend for this place! They have so many options from ice cream to blondies - but my personal favorite is their macron ice cream sandwiches. I think I&apos;ve tried all of their flavors by now... 

My top favorites are the grasshopper which is mint chocolate and the Oreo one. I just love mint chocolate combinations and this one tastes super fresh of mint with rich chocolate. It&apos;s perfect! And the macron is perfectly chewy even with the cold ice cream in the middle. 

The cookies n cream one is my second favorite. It has lots of cookie pieces in the ice cream and you really taste that Oreo flavor! This one has a chocolate macron outside and is delicious! It&apos;s so hard for me to decide which to get every time I come here for a treat! 

10/10! Must try if you love ice cream and sweets."
5,"This cake slice is $8... &apos;BUT Soooo WORTH IT!&quot; First time here I ate 2 pieces, crazzzZzzzy bathroom results the next day... Green... Scared me till I remembered the 2 slices of cake... Lol
But a delicious cake nonetheless"
5,"I do and I will, continue to drive 1.5hrs to get my blue velvet cake. Nothing will stop me!!!"
5,A rare moment that the more bites you take the better it gets. Very addicting and soft and chewy and not too sweet! I was surprised by the girth of these bad boys. Highly recommend and will be ordering more in the future.
5,"Milk has a special place in my heart as the first ice cream establishment I ever visited in LA. If you&apos;re craving sweets, this is definitely the place to go.

Their macaron sandwiches are very popular, and they have a wide variety of flavors to choose from. I personally think their ice cream pops are severely underrated; try one for yourself and get a cookie on the side! Milk isn&apos;t your hipster LA ice cream spot with weird flavors and fancy ingredients; it&apos;s a solid, consistent ice cream establishment with great basic flavors that will satisfy any sweet tooth."
3,"I came here after buying art supplies across the street. I ordered a $11 coffee toffee shake and 5 cookies @ $2.75/each. The shake was good and I ate one red velvet cookie and half a double chocolate cookie. Overall, three stars for taste since it was okay but nothing that would make me crave it again esp. given the high prices. I do appreciate the staff for practicing safety precautions when purchasing and serving their food during this time."
5,"This is a dessert place and you really can&apos;t go wrong with dessert. They have a nice variety of ice cream and cake options that can be customized to any ones desire. However, they also have a bunch of special menu options that are amazing combo of
brownies and ice cream with fugde and fresh whipped cream."
4,So good! We ordered the Thai tea and cookies and cream ice cream and they were so good! They are pricey for ice cream but it was worth the occasion. I also had the chocolate chip cookie but I would just skip the cookie and get more ice cream next time. I had the macaron ice cream sandwich in the past and it was worth a try. Would recommend a try
5,"Wow! My husband and I enjoyed your desserts. If you are in the area or are just looking for something sweet this is the place to go. The red velvet ice cream Sandwich was so damn delicious. The macaron was perfectly made for this. My husband got the coffee toffe ice cream sandwich and he fell in love with it. We also got two brookies (brownie + cookie) for the next day.... because ya treat ya self on date night. We warmed them up in the microwave and OMG!!! I was no disappointed. We will definitely be going back with our kids to try other selections. 
You do have to order through the door at this little table with a plastic partition. The cashier was super friendly, patient and all around cool. Inside looked clean and their street coroner was clean as well. They have a special space for order to pick up if you don&apos;t want to get down or find parking as well."
1,Much to do about nothing.  The food is nothing special .
3,I think it was overhyped by other Yelpers. Maybe i didn&apos;t get the right thing?? My ice cream kinda tasted like frostbite. I&apos;ve had better ice cream at other spots like Ben and jerry&apos;s.
3,"Visual was fantastic! I got the fruity pebbles ice cream. It was really pretty and instagramable. However, it was very sweet for me to enjoy it. After the first bite, i wanted to look for coffee."
4,"Good cookies, fun concept but not like THE best cookies I&apos;ve ever ever had but again nothing here is bad. Like all the cookies are a solid 4 stars  and the variety is excellent so if you bring friends you will all find something you&apos;ll love! Can&apos;t go wrong!"
4,"Got the Thai tea macaron ice cream sandwich and the blue velvet cake. They have a limited menu for COVID and they take your order at the door. There are markers to stand six ish feet apart. 

The Thai tea had a nice strong flavor and the macaron was thin and good for biting into. It&apos;s also a bit large but it&apos;s $7

I don&apos;t get the hype over the blue velvet cake however. It is just like red velvet cake except it&apos;s blue and has blueberries in it. The blueberries do add a nice crisp crunch in between bites 

Overall this place is too pricey for me to come back, but worth trying and it&apos;s instagrammable"
5,Best ice cream sandwiches on the planet. And the gorgeous blue velvet cake! They also make great coffee.
5,"My ALL TIME favorite ice cream joint. Nothing compares to Milk. I&apos;ve been coming here since 2016. From their Blue Velvet cake, cookie ice cream sandwiches, drumsticks, milkshakes, oh man.. everything is good here. 

By far, the macaron ice cream sandwiches are the star item here. SO MANY FLAVORS! Thai Tea.. Cookies N Cream.. Lucky Charms.. Watermelon.. mouthwatering! My go-to is usually the Red Velvet! 

Of their ice cream flavors, my favorite is their Watermelon Chip! It&apos;s a seasonal flavor that they only have during the summer, but when they have it, I ALWAYS stock up! Its a creamy watermelon base with chocolate chips inside.. sounds like a strange combo.. but oddly addicting.

Expect long lines here! The Yelp hype is well-deserving, but lots of tourists love to come here! So expect a line out the door."
