5,"The fact that I haven&apos;t left a review for Dave&apos;s is a dam shame. I live like .2 seconds away walking!! Haha I&apos;ve eaten here so many times my orders known.

I stick to my usual Combo #3 NO spice at all...we know this I&apos;m not good with spice. The pickles are so so so crunch it&apos;s ridiculous. The chicken! Omg so juicy and always fried to perfection. The fries 10/10 sorry but Dave&apos;s has never let me down. The staff are always so nice!!! Now that I&apos;m writing this review I&apos;m thinking about placing an order"
5,"UHM YUM.  If you&apos;ve never hopped on this chicken eating trend let me tell you, you need to! Speaking from first hand experience. 

Food - amazing. I got a Mild Chicken Slider and Tender. The mild isn&apos;t spicy, I have a low spice tolerance. But I&apos;m ok it wasn&apos;t spicy. The flavors are good, salty spicy. The chicken is super crispy and juicy. On the sliders it comes with pickles and coleslaw on it and a dipping sauce. I don&apos;t care for the dipping sauce it doesn&apos;t add anything but the coleslaw is heaven. 

Service - good, friendly staff who knows their food. I asked what spice level I should get since it was my first time and I have a low spice tolerance and they said mild would be good to start and it was I&apos;m very please. 

Ordering - I placed a walk in pick up order during COVID. The restaurant has marks outside the restaurant to stand social distance and there&apos;s only room for about 3-4 people inside just to place your order. After you order you wait outside they fenced off part of the parking lot(YES THERE IS A PARKING LOT!). Once your order is ready the staff will bring it out to you. Was very quick."
5,"THIS PLACE IS BOOOMB. I had ordered food at a different restaurant and stumbled across this place while walking and waiting for my food to be ready. I just couldnt resist and bought some chicken tenders to go. Mild has a nice kick to it and the coating on the chicken was amazing. It was so crispy, juicy and tender. I&apos;m so glad that I decided to stop and try their chicken. Its a game changer."
5,"We&apos;ve been eating here since it opened and I can&apos;t believe a review hasn&apos;t been posted! 

If you want something delicious for lunch, dinner or a late night, this is a must. All the combos are amazing and my top is #2, save a slider for later. All the chicken levels from lite mild to hot are yummy, really depends on how hot you want the chicken. The slaw is everything and the pickles, ask for extras!!

Parking can definitely be a little chaotic and there&apos;s usually a line, so be prepared for that."
1,"I&apos;ve never heard of this place. My friend saw a location opened near us so we gave it a try. 
This was hands down the nastiest food I&apos;ve ever put in my mouth. The chicken is gross, the seasoning is gross, the medium and hot sauces are gross. The french fries weren&apos;t gross but were really bad. 
I love chicken, and I LOVE french fries, but I couldn&apos;t force myself to eat this stuff. So disappointing. My friend ate about half of hers then gave up. She took my order and hers home to her kids. We&apos;ll see what they have to say. 
I can&apos;t believe this place gets such good reviews. It boggles the mind! 
This is a ZERO star review."
5,"Dave knows how to do it! My chicken is consistently crispy and amazing! The sauce is sweet and creamy  perfect for hot hot hot chicken! The people there always hook it up with the sauce and honey oooooooh yes the honey on the chicken is top notch!

I get hot or medium tenders and I find the medium to be perfect! It&apos;s hot but not too hot and has really really really good flavor! The hot is siracha level or a little less I would say!"
5,"Love this place! Every time I&apos;m in Los Angeles I have to stop by! The staff is helpful and quick! I always get a sandwich and an extra tender with a super hot flavor, their dipping sauce is GOOD and the fries are a hit! This a great lunch"
5,"Didnt think I&apos;d say this but I like this place a lot better than howlin rays.. 
reasons why:

1. There&apos;s no wait 
2. There&apos;s fries and you have the option of getting free seasoning on them if you ask
3. You can get a chicken sandwich and a tender if you can&apos;t decide 

The only con is that though parking is free, the lot can get a bit hectic."
5,"This place actually really does live up to the hype. The chicken was so good and crispy and whoa actually pretty spicy.
I got a medium (I&apos;m not GREAT with spice) but I had to stop a couple times and do that stupid heeeeeee  huuuuuuu breathing thing to cool my mouth off. 
Very fn good. Will forsure be coming back but will probably bump it down to mild because I&apos;m a pansy."
4,"The chicken here is absolutely delicious! I have tried all spice levels and enjoy it somewhere in the middle. Not a huge fan of the fries, but the rest is fantastic. The staff is very friendly and efficient, food is ready within minutes. Order ahead if you don&apos;t feel like waiting, but the turnaround time is fast. Worth checking out!"
3,"We finally stopped by this place. We wanted to taste and see what the fus was about. We drove from Woodland Hills, about 40 minutes away on a Sunday.

There was no parking. The place is located in a small and cramped shopping center. The inside was clean and they followed social distancing and employees had masks on at all times. Not a lot of people allowed inside to order. After ordering your food you need to wait outside. The employees were nice, but did seem to be in a rush. The line to wait to order food was not long; we waited for about 10 minutes. Our order was for 4 people and it took about 10 minutes to get our food.

We ordered the chicken tenders. It comes with two tenders, two slice of bread (regular sandwich bread), secret sauce, five pickles and fries. Honestly the chicken was not as I expected. It needed more flavor. The secret sauce was good. The fries were delicious. We also ordered the combo 3 which came with one chicken slider, one chicken tender, five pickles, one slice of bread (regular sandwich bread) and their secret sauce. The chicken slider was ok. Not super delicious, just ok. 

Personally the food was pricey for the amount of food you get and not to mention they use regular sandwich bread. 

I prefer the chicken at Raising Cane&apos;s Chicken. It&apos;s similar type of food, but their is much flavorable. Sorry.  Just being honest.

I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll eat here again."
4,"I love chicken sandwiches and I stopped by for the first time on a Sunday to check out the hype. I always noticed a long line so I went during the quarantine to take advantage of lesser people. 

The wait:
I waited in line for about 15 mins to order then it was another 15-20 mins to get the food around 5 pm on a Sunday. There were about 5 people ahead of me when I got in line. I have this magic power where I always arrive at a time when others are waiting too but then magically the line disappears after I order. So if you came after me, there was no wait...
I picked up combo 1 which has two tenders and fries and combo 2 which comes with 2 sliders and fries. I have read about their mac and cheese so I wanted to order that too but it was sold out. This is where the minus star comes in. I would think a popular item that keeps getting sold out should call for some adjustments by the owners. 

The food: If I had a choice, I would order combo 1 with the tenders. 
Reason 1: The tender pieces are bigger than the ones in the sliders. 
Reason 2: Tenders are $2 cheaper than the sliders.
Reason 3. It comes with bread and pickles as well, just missing the coleslaw. 

The sauce: I was pretty disappointed with the sauce because I have read it was so good. Now there is nothing wrong with their sauce.  It&apos;s pretty similar to all other chicken joints. What would make it better would be to have more choices for sauce. I prefer a more sweet and spicy sauce in my chicken sandwich. 

The heat: I agree with others that the heat is not that noticeable. I ordered both meals hot  but it is barely noticeable. What would be epic would be to somehow have the availability to control the heat level through various sauces. 

Overall it is a very solid place but I still prefer the Original Chicken sandwich at Rockbird. Their sauce is on point!"
4,"What is there to say? It&apos;s Dave&apos;s. Consistently delicious and crispy chicken sandos. I&apos;m a fan of spice and always enjoy the level below the waiver one (I believe it&apos;s Extra Hot). Might be time to graduate to the top one. Good portion of fries too. You basically get two meals in one, tbh, I always easily save half for the next day. Their side sauce is bae.

Getting take out since Covid is amazing bc there&apos;s no long ass line outside to stand in. Ordered online and was ready in 20/30 mins. By the time we drove there it was ready. This location (EaHo) does have a parking lot, too.

Only thing I will say is they don&apos;t always give you the slaw side, which I think is supposed to be included (at least, it has been thrown in before). I don&apos;t really care because I don&apos;t ever finish the slaw anyway, but it&apos;s worth noting if you really go ham for slaw, make sure you tell them you want it."
5,"Hands down the best &quot;Halal Chicken&quot;!  Worth the drive from South OC. Tenders and Sliders, everything just comes together so well! They use kale slaw with their signature sauce and give you packs of honey on the side! Make sure you use that honey, it&apos;s so fire! Give them a try it is worth your drive."
3,Pretty delicious. Fries were still crispy when delivered. But Where&apos;s my Mac &amp; cheese
5,"Great place! Customer service is amazing and their food is amazing as well! We were running late so I called and spoke with Omar (I believe that&apos;s his name) but he was super friendly and helpful. He went above and beyond for costumers, very professional. Their portions are big for a good price so you can share with somebody else. My wife got the combo #3 which comes with sliders, tenders, and bread. I got the combo #2 which consists of well I&apos;ll let the pictures speak for me lol The tenders were juicy and not dry and their breading on the chicken was perfect it did not come off as soon as you took a bite from it. Like I said an overall great place. Come try Dave&apos;s you won&apos;t regret it!"
5,"Dave&apos;s Hot Chicken offers a wide variety for all spicy flavor savers. You can custom each piece of HOT chicken from No Spice to Reaper. Be sure to check out their sides too; I personally like the cheese fries and kale slaw. 

Dave&apos;s started as a pop-up in a parking lot and has developed a food cult following. Now, they have several locations and are growing.

5,"I don&apos;t know why it took me so long to finally try Dave&apos;s but so happy I was finally able to! 

Food Ordered: 

Combo 1:  2 Tenders w/ Fries -  5/5 
I don&apos;t have a very high tolerance to spicy food, but we ordered this as a medium spice level and surprisingly it was very spicy at all. It was perfect. The chicken was so tender and so crispy, the seasoning on the fries were so good. 

Combo 2:  2 Sliders w/fries - 5/5
For some reason I was under the impression that the sliders were going to be small, since they usually are from other places I&apos;ve been. Please don&apos;t be mistaken, but these are regular sized chicken sandwiches! You can definitely share this with someone else. Basically it&apos;s a meal for 2. I really enjoyed the sandwich more than the tenders alone. We paid extra for cheese but slaw and pickles came with it. All the flavors meshed well together and there was a good chicken to bread ratio. Lol Also we got this medium spicy as well and it was perfect! 

Enjoy!"
5,"For hot chicken tenders, Dave&apos;s is hard to beat. Fried chicken, topped with flavored oil and spices, served with an amazing sauce and some fries? What&apos;s not to like?

There is a big jump from medium to hot. For first timers wanting to burn their mouth but not destroy their stomach, I&apos;d recommend ordering a medium meal and getting one extra tender Hot on the side.

Not the biggest fan of their sides, but I&apos;m there for the chicken anyway. Happy this place is always here whenever I have a craving!!"
4,"Probably the top dog in the red-hot hot chicken trend in LA!

The food is tremendous. I usually get a mild chicken slider, because I&apos;m a weenie and can&apos;t handle spice levels above that without tearing up and accusing other people of crying in my presence. The chicken itself is high quality: juicy, and crisped nicely by the breading. The dipping sauce plays really well with the chicken, I just always want there to be another 4 or 5 ramekins of it. The side slaw is also fantastic.

Where it loses a star is on the ordering side. I placed a pickup order online during COVID. After waiting for 10 minutes, my phone indicated that my order could not be completed (with no reason as to why), so I had to wait in the mob of people who were ordering in person to place a food order. The staff was kind and courteous, but didn&apos;t offer a reason why the online order could not be completed, instead just saying that this happens sometimes. If they can work out this ordering bug, they&apos;ll be in the pantheon of LA establishments. Until then, I&apos;m still loving my food every time I come here!"
