5,"For some reason I ALWAYS crave ice cream when it is cold outside. There&apos;s just something about eating ice cream in my warm car with the heaters on...never gets old. Anyways, I had just finished my dinner the other night when I was craving something sweet and I thought of Saffron &amp; Rose. I&apos;ve visited one time before but wanted to check them out again.

When we arrived, they were pretty empty and the gentleman that was working told us about their most popular flavors. Unfortunately due to COVID, they are not offering samples - but fear not, all of their flavors are bomb diggity! 

I ordered a small cup (can pick 2 flavors) with ube/taro and strawberry. My friend ordered a small cup with passionfruit and cookies &amp; creme. They top your ice cream with a small wafer that is light and airy. Their ice cream is very creamy and tastes amazing but it does melt fairly quickly. It&apos;s not hard and icy like some ice creams can be. It probably would have melted by the time I got home so I enjoyed it right away. The small cup was the perfect serving size for me! 

I&apos;ll definitely be back next time when I am craving something sweet! They have seating outdoors where you can enjoy your ice cream. Saffron &amp; Rose is located in the same plaza as Albertson&apos;s near UTC."

5,"I&apos;m so glad I was introduced to this place, because I absolutely love the consistency of this ice cream and their flavor offerings. It&apos;s more icy than creamy, so it&apos;s easier to eat more of!

I&apos;ve tried the white rose, saffron with pistachios, and the fig &amp; cranberry. Of the three, I liked the white rose the most because it wasn&apos;t overwhelmingly sweet or rich. It was light and refreshing. 

The employees here are helpful and pleasant. Prior to COVID you could try samples of whatever flavors you wanted. I did feel a bit rushed but they were trying to serve many customers.

They have some outdoor seating available currently, but it&apos;s a popular spot and there are only a few tables. Be ready to wait in line and prepared to take your ice cream elsewhere.

I can&apos;t wait to come back to try the faloodeh and pink rose!"
5,"Completely astounded. Absolutely one of my favorite ice cream shops of all time. Nailed flavor, variety, &amp; consistency. In LA with new pop ups occurring all the time, it&apos;s hard to justify revisiting the same shop more than once. Yet, I&apos;ve gone here more than I can remember and I&apos;ve introduced this mom &amp; pop shop to countless of friends and family. You can&apos;t get this type of balanced but deep floral flavor anywhere else. Mashti &apos;s Persian Ice Cream doesn&apos;t come close in comparison.

I&apos;m the type to always try to pick something new but I have admit I find myself confidently picking these two favorites time after time:
* Saffron (can be vegan)
* White Rose

Other Great Picks in order:
* Lavender
* Jasmine (note: it&apos;s not the same as East Asia&apos;s jasmine tea flavor but a much more sweet jasmine flower flavor. Floral tint is much stronger than white rose). 
* pink rose
* ube (seasonal)
* green tea 
* Thai tea (seasonal)
* green pistachio 
* caramel crunch 
* strawberry
* passion fruit (seasonal)
* mango
* cantaloupe (seasonal)
* apple cinnamon (seasonal)

Accepts credit card.

5,"Such a charming Persian ice cream shop! 

They were taking your orders at a table outside their shop when I visited in November 2020. Staff were very polite and helpful. I just wanted to try the traditional Persian ice cream flavors. They had saffron, pistachio and rose ice cream and they also had faloodeh ice cream (rose water, sugar and vermicelli noodles). I bought one of each. The ice cream was super refreshing and cooling in the LA heat and it was just a perfect treat. 

Everything was great! I hope to visit again one day!"
5,"Bottom-line: Damn. 

Ice-cream done right, with a Persian twist.

Saffron is a spice associated with fine mediterranean cuisine. Can be found in the kabobs or is most commonly used in the rice.

But does Saffron have other culinary applications beyond savory foods?

The answer is yes.

And I&apos;d definitely recommend Saffron and Rose&apos;s Saffron pistachio ice-cream. It&apos;s a unique experience.

Filed under &apos;floral ice-creams&apos; their hand-scooped semi-gelato like saffron pistachio ice-cream is a must-have for first-timers.

Known as &apos;Bastani sonnati, or simply bastani, is an Iranian ice cream made from milk, eggs, sugar, rose water, saffron, vanilla, and pistachios.&apos;

And the taste can be described as sorbet-like, pistachio, but rich and creamier than most sorbet or gelato counterparts. The pistachios give it a semi-nuttier flavor, but you wouldn&apos;t know from the texture because it&apos;s to like a chunky garnish like lets say a cookie and cream like ice-cream.

Definitely a winner in my book; maybe even an ice-cream &apos; LA&apos;s best-of&apos; .


Try it!"
5,"Oh my lord. Where have you been all my life. 

Okay... catch this... date ice cream. Yes. Dates. Not the ones on your calendar but in the ice cream. Let me tell you... it was amazing. The saffron pistachio is definitely a must try as well. 

Waited in a little bit of a line and got to know the really nice couple behind us. We are no stranger to Persian food so knew exactly what to order and had a nice time explaining the flavors to our new friends. 

Overall amazing experience."
5,"The best place for floral, light, and creamier than sorbet Persian ice cream in west LA!

Of all the many flavors to choose from, my favorites are their saffron and pistachio, rose, and passion fruit flavors. Persian ice cream shops love focusing on floral and fruity flavors which I am a sucker for. The saffron and pistachio flavor is so unique that I don&apos;t know how to best describe it other than to trust me that you&apos;ll love it!

Parking: there&apos;s street parking on the adjacent side streets nearby the shop

Would I come back: yes! This shop is affordable and has refreshing floral flavors"
4,"Saffron &amp; Rose Ice Cream has my favorite flavor of ice cream, COFFEE. It is almost as smooth as Talenti Gelato&apos;s &quot;Coffee.&quot;"
5,"The texture and the light flavors of this ice cream place are absolutely perfect. The floral flavors are this ice cream shop&apos;s specialty. Although I didn&apos;t get it this time, I can sense that their chocolate flavors will complement their main floral flavors really well.

Knowing the strength of saffron, I was fearful that the flavor was going to be too overpowering. I was pleasantly surprised that I was able to taste both the saffron and the pistachio flavors in a harmonic manner. I realized that I like crunch in my ice cream so the incorporation of actual pistachios really paired well with the saffron. My friend who got the white rose said the rose flavor was super light but in a good non overpowering way."
5,"Wanted something quick and sweet after dinner and Saffron was nearby. I was pleasantly surprised that they had delicious sounding vegan options that didn&apos;t seem like an afterthought. We ended up getting the vegan Saffron &amp; Pistachio and the Pomegranate. The consistency is more like a cross between soft serve and taffy. Delicious!
Service was also friendly and prompt. All were wearing masks. Super thumbs up!"
4,"Been missing this authentic Persian style ice cream ever since I had it months ago, and I&apos;m blown away every time. I got the small ($4.50 for 2 scoops), with flavors white rose and dark chocolate. Their white rose is the second most popular, and my favorite by far. It has a strong floral &amp; elegant taste to it. The dark chocolate was also really good, with brownie and walnut/almond bits and it did NOT disappoint :&apos;)"
5,"Yooooo honestly, I ate this several months ago and I still think about that cucumber flavored one. How the heck do you make cucumber ice cream and make it taste so good? 

Got the passion fruit and cucumber flavors and the passion fruit was good too but damn, the cucumber one.  

The wafer is a free add-on so don&apos;t shy away from a free wafer. You can make an ice cream sandwich!"
5,"Their ice creams are so good!!!!! Unfortunately, I moved so I won&apos;t be able to eat their ice cream that often anymore. Very unique flavors and I love all of them, especially guava, passion fruit, green tea, jasmine, lavender, orange blossom, faloodeh, white rose, saffron, pistachio, saffron pistachio. Their service is always nice and lovely. I&apos;m gonna miss this place a lot!"
4,"First time trying Persian ice cream! 
Bf &amp; each got a small cup: 
Almond &amp; pistachio - almond was the winner it was decadent and the crunchy bits gave great contrast to the fluffy texture 
Watermelon &amp; passion fruit - both yummy but I prefer the tartness of the passion fruit. The watermelon tasted super light but if you like light refreshing flavors give it a go! I really enjoyed how each flavor has crunchy chocolate/like pieces for texture. 
Overall I liked the flavors but the texture is very fluffy...a little too fluffy for me. 

Service is great - the workers are kind/energetic and just have happy energy that I love."
1,"Imagine finding a hair in your ice cream, and then not even getting offered a full refund. My last review was 8 years ago - that&apos;s how long I have been a customer of theirs. The way they responded when I notified the employees of this, they acted like it was normal and not a big deal. Would they pay for this ice cream and eat it?

Really loved this place from before, but as you can see from the picture...never again. Just gross. Never coming back again. Beware of this."
5,"My favorite ice cream ever! Always craving this. Flavors so refreshing and unique! 

Get the saffron &amp; pistachio with fallodeh, and if you had to choose a third flavor to mix with these - Jasmin or lavender, pink rose or white rose.

Parking on side streets behind or on the side with meters"
5,"If you like ice cream, you definitely need to try out this place! I&apos;m so glad i got to try this place, they have flavors you can&apos;t really find in other places. I tried Saffron with Pistachio, Orange blossom, Jasmin, passion fruit, dark chocolate, mint chip, and pomegranate. I can&apos;t wait to try the rest of the flavors. 

I really liked passion fruit, jasmin, and pomegranate flavors! They were just the right amount of sweetness and scent. If you are new to this place, i recommend the passion fruit!"
5,"Rating: 4.5/5

Saffron &amp; Rose started my love for Persian ice cream. If you haven&apos;t had Persian ice cream yet, it doesn&apos;t taste much different than normal ice cream, but it offers a unique texture between that of soft serve and hand-scooped ice cream. My favorite flavors so far are the Banana and Taro &amp; Ube (but I need to try more!). I&apos;ve also had the signature saffron ice cream, but I&apos;m not huge on floral flavors in general. I usually get a small serving, which includes two scoops or flavors for $4.50, which is a steal compared to most artisanal creameries nowadays. You can also order a pint to go, which I&apos;ve done before, but I recommend just ordering a scoop to eat right away, because sometimes the ice cream crystallizes when in the freezer too long. There was some iciness in my banana ice cream, which isn&apos;t a dealbreaker but hence the -star.

Currently in light of COVID-19, you can&apos;t go in the store but have to order at the door. They have Apple Pay for no contact payment. There&apos;s also a couple of tables outside their store to sit and enjoy your ice cream. Parking might be a little hard to find--there&apos;s metered parking along Westwood, or you can park in the neighborhood behind the store for a short walk. If you&apos;re ever in Westwood (or Irvine for their other location), please check Saffron &amp; Rose out! I"
5,"Best irooni ice cream in LA! The faloodeh and saffron flavors are a must try!!! Don&apos;t forget to ask for lime juice :) All the staff was wearing masks and keeping COVID safe. You can&apos;t go into the store these days, but you order up front. There isn&apos;t outdoor seating, but if you walk a bit there is a park and lots of benches to sit at and enjoy your ice cream! Metered parking is available in front of the store but you can also drive 1 block behind it and there is plenty of free street parking!"
