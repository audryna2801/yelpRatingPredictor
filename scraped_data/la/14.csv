5,"BCD TOFU house serves the most reliable &quot;soon tofu stew&quot;. Best in town. 

There are multiple BCD locations throughout So Cal. This one is my favorite BCD location due to them being open 24hrs/7days (pre-C19). Great for night owls like myself. Since their specialty is TOFU stew/soup that&apos;s what I recommend... and a side of beef short ribs never hurts. 

If tofu is not your thing, no worries the menu has other tasty food options that&apos;s very good. Everybody that comes here knows their &quot;house kimchi&quot; is outstanding! What&apos;s their secret ingredient? Raw Oysters. Genius! Aside from their excellent kimchi, the side dishes (banchan) are a hit or miss at times.

This BCD location does get super crowded that&apos;s the only downside. Sometimes I go to the other location on Western Ave instead. Currently the restaurant is following CDC guidelines and keeping it safe as can be for takeout. I appreciate it."
5,"I used to work right across the street, so I came through here A LOT on that duration. Sadly, our office moved before I became active on Yelp, so I never got the chance to write a review. 

And then an opportunity: I had family who happen to be tourists with me, and coming to the end of our joyride tour, I suggested they grub here. The only setback was we had my fur baby with us, so the plan was to just drop them off and puppy and I will find somewhere else to eat. 

One of them asked me to wait and insisted on asking the restaurant if they might allow us to bring the pup, &quot;he&apos;s pretty tame, we got nothing to lose, plus if it&apos;s outdoor seating... they might, maybe?&quot; 

And that they did and made an exception for us and that&apos;s just WAY. TOO. COOL. 

It was an off-peak odd afternoon hour, so we were seated right away. I knew what I wanted without having to look at the menu: seafood soon (mild) tofu with egg! 

VERDICT: it&apos;s EXACTLY as I remember it: savory, delicious and HOT! The banchan are just as pleasant and great sidekicks as palate cleansers. I also LOVE that they still include that beautifully seasoned and fried fish! (I can probably eat 20 of those!) 

FOOD: 5 (What do I always say? Consistency is KEY!)
SERVICE: 5. They deserve nothing less - they allowed the pup when they didn&apos;t have to. Oh, did I mention staff was friendly and efficient? Yeah... 
VALUE: 5. Price has gone up but it&apos;s commensurate to the times. (It&apos;s still a bargain considering the pandemic!) 
PARKING: Private lot. Not gonna be an issue. 
OVERALL: 5. 

Minor changes: because of the pandemic, they will do temperature checks up front. They now add the egg in your soon tofu in the kitchen instead of at your table. They also leave the hot tea (to pour in your almost emptied rice bowl) on the table. They found every which way to minimize contact with each other. This, of course, we appreciate.

Now, I must warn my other fellow Yelpers: they normally do NOT allow dogs, they just made an exception this one time, so please don&apos;t think that&apos;s a normal thing for them. Your best bet is to call and ask first. 

I was unbelievably happy and beyond satisfied at this rediscovery. Great food with great service with great people and the bonus of the pup?! The experience couldn&apos;t have been better! Highly recommending and great chance I&apos;m returning!"
5,"Last night I had BCD for the first time in 3 years. The food was good and tasted the same as I remembered it. I ordered the bulgogi and tofu soup combo. The bulgogi wasn&apos;t too sweet or too salty and tasted pretty good. The tofu soup was my favorite thing on the table last night. Their banchan tasted pretty fresh too. 

In regards to Covid-19 and the precautions they were taking, they did an incredible job and probably one of the best jobs I&apos;ve seen. They took our temperatures, disinfected our seats in front of us, explained the rules to using the bathroom, etc...

The outdoor eating area was really pretty too. They had nice lights strung around the large tented area. The parking is free and right next to the eating area which makes it convenient. Overall, my party and I had a great experience."
5,"The classic tofu house, the best one being the korea town one, love coming here on cold days. It&apos;s always soul warming. It&apos;s been around for a long time and expanded for a reason. 

Love the seafood combo tofu, it&apos;s the one my friends introduced me to and my go-to. Soup is more on the watery side but plenty of tofu and seafood. 

The sides are well packaged in a very cool container that keeps them all separated, haven&apos;t seen something like it before."
5,"MY FAVORITE SPOT! CONSISTENTLY YUMMY. NEVER LETS ME DOWN. 

I bring all my friends that are visiting LA here. I recommend it to everyone. You can never go wrong with their stew and rice combo. I always order the S9 which is all veggies. For my plant based peeps, this a great restaurant for you. You can choose to have a water based or meat based broth. 

Try their Hamjeul! The seafood pancake. It&apos;s delicious. 

Their banchan is the best. I love BCD. The only bummer is that prices are steadily rising... but hey, besides that.. never a complaint."
4,"This place is delicious! This is a pre-COVID review btw!

My friends and I were looking for a place to eat at closeby to a bar we were at, and we found this spot on Yelp. We came here on a Saturday night/Sunday morning at 3AM! It was surprisingly crowded here at the time we came. I ordered the Original Soon Tofu soup with beef ($13.49) and it came with a side of rice. It was yummy! I would probably get a spicier level next time though so it would have more flavor.

Service was good, our server was funny. This is a good spot to eat at especially for late nights!"
2,"I&apos;ve been to BCD Many times and this was by far the worst experience.  In this time of COVID, all restaurants should welcome each and every customer that comes through their doors. Everyone is trying to survive and how do you do this?  Great Service and Great Food!

This time around the service was not good at all.  Too many missed steps:

Incorrect drink order 
No smiling service like before
Food was lack luster 
Slow service
No &quot;thank you&quot; for coming in

It was like they treated us and others as if we were to go orders...Here is your food, now hurry up and leave.

I don&apos;t know what it is, but everyone working looked so pissed off because they had to walk outside and serve everyone in the outside tents.

When other restaurants go over the top now because they are open and appreciate your business, BCD forgot about that...I&apos;m not saying that they need to jump through hoops for the customers, but at least show some appreciation that they choose to eat there when they could have gone to hundreds of other struggling restaurants.

The next time I want soon tofu, I&apos;ll take my business to a smaller &quot;mom and pop&quot; restaurant."
4,I have no had BCD in over a decade so decided to check this spot out since I was running errands across the street. They take your temperature before sitting you down and offer sanitizer. Decent outdoor setup with spaced out tables. The banchan and the food were solid.
3,"Came here during COVID -19 period of 2020.

On select days, the restaurant has converted their parking lot into a drive-in/dine-in theater. On Christmas Day they were playing home alone, so that&apos;s cool!

I ordered the bbq short-rib , spicy beef soup (medium level).

29.99 you get a lot of sides -- rice included-- but I was craving a little more meat.

Right away, the bbq beef is nested stop of a lot of onions. And I mean a lot! I mean they practically gave me the whole bulb. The onions were raw. Would have been nice had they saut√©ed them or something. It was overkill ans I hardly ate any of it. 

The bbq beef was okay. A few pieces were I marinated and dry, but the ones that were properly sauced and spiced really had excellent flavor !

The soup (medium spicy) is a bit on the the spicier side. Any more than that and it wouldn&apos;t be so fun to eat IMO.

All of this for 29.99 is just an okay deal, but not a knockout. Quality dips in places like this always on carry out, so I&apos;m a little more understanding!"
4,"Waited 15 mins to be seated. Not bad for a busy Sunday afternoon. Two large outdoor tents with heaters, much needed  on a cold windy day. Took our temps and gave us two pumps of hand sanitizer before we sat down.

Banchan was excellent! Got the assorted soon du bu and galbi combo. Delish! Note that it&apos;s the full price, not lunch price on weekends. Wish the soon du bu had more spice though. As I write this, realized we forgot the egg! Don&apos;t forget the best part!

$3 extra for the stone pot of rice was well worth it. Add the hot barley tea to the crispy rice for some yumminess.

Service was prompt. Finally got my craving satisfied during Covid times. Thanks, BCD!"
3,"BCD is a very popular Tofu House in K Town that is open 24/7. For the COVID situation, they have opened outdoor dining with a nice tent and tables. They ended up closing some of the parking lot for this. 

Parking here is very easy, they have a private parking lot that is right next to the place. Very convenient and also easy to find a parking spot because the parking lot is huge.

The food itself is mediocre to be honest, I wasn&apos;t a fan of their kits and not a fan of their restaurant quality stuff. I ordered a plain tofu soup, and I would have to say that I regret getting plain. It&apos;s not salty and it&apos;s literally like the word itself &quot;Plain Tofu Soup&quot;. 

The ban chan were okay, the Kim chi is more on the sour end and it has some slimy stuff in it, I think it&apos;s octopus or something but I didn&apos;t like it. 

The Bulgogi that I got came out okay, usually at other tofu houses, it comes out sizzling, unfortunately here it just comes out on a plate. Not sure if they took too long to deliver it to my table, but it was okay. Not great, but not bad either.

Service here is not bad, servers respond quickly but the food itself is just &quot;meh&quot; to me.

Overall, 3/5."
4,"You can never go wrong with BCD! Pre-covid, they were open 24/7, which was perfect after a late-night of studying for finals or after a night out from drinking. They were within walking distance of LINE hotel and uber distance from TerraCotta so it was the place to be after the night ended.

The tofu soup is pretty flavorful but the spice level can be a hit or miss sometimes. Make sure to add the egg to make the soup more creamy! One thing I like about BCD is that they give you fish for the Banchan (side dish) which is pretty nice since not all Korean restaurants do that. They also have really good rice-tea that&apos;s complimentary! 

4/5 for the food and service (they&apos;re usually really quick in getting you what you need)!"
4,"They have very spacious patio dining in the parking lot as well as a small area adj to main restaurant area / space.

Service was solid.

We got several lunch combos.
- Spicy chicken (it has a smokiness that is delish) + tofu soup (pork n kimchi)
- Bulgogi (perfection) + tofu soup (pork n kimchi)
- Deep fried Yellow Corvina Fish + tofu soup (oyster was good)
- Galbi with soybean cold noodles, very refreshing
- Came with three special pot rices (enough to feed 4 and then some)

The banchan sets were amazing.
- Japchae
- Stir fry fish cake
- The most amazing traditional kimchi
- Korean sliced pickled cucumbers
- Mini fried fishes

Ask for the iced barley tea. 
DELISH.

There was plenty to take home.
Portions were generous.

#FOOD COMA"
4,"This place has been here for years and is the original location. I have also been to the one on Western. The tofu soups are served very hot and I love the egg that is given when the soups are dropped off at the table. Reminds me of ramen that I make at home! Anyway, love the spice and the levels that are available,  I get med. usually and it is pretty hot/spicy. They have clam, beef, and kimchi combos. You can get it with bulgogi or Kalbi (bbq beef)."
5,"First of all, RIP to the founder of BCD, Ms. Hee Sook Lee, who passed away a few weeks ago from cancer at the young age of 61. I still remember eating at the original Koreatown location of BCD that was located at 7th and Vermont next to where Kobawoo restaurant is in the late 1990s and thinking THIS IS FREAKING AWESOME. 

Apparently I was not the only one since she really turned BCD into a small business success that currently includes 13 restaurants from Los Angeles to Texas to New York with ready-to-eat tofu packages and side dishes sold at Asian supermarkets. 

Look, BCD didn&apos;t invent the wheel. They just added some chrome rims and made it all-terrain and bulletproof. I mean there were other tofu soup restaurants in Koreatown before BCD, but Ms. Lee just made it Better, Cooler, and Deliciouser? 

For those of you that don&apos;t know the meaning of BCD and wondered what happened to the letter A and thought that this Korean restaurant was an average student, BCD is an acronym for a neighborhood in Seoul (Buk-Chang-Dong) where her mother-in-law had operated a restaurant. 

Others have already said what there is to say. So I will focus on how the the Wilshire location is handling the pandemic. BCD converted what used to be a Copper Penny coffee shop that later became a short-lived Max&apos;s of Manila Filipino Restaurant into the current tofu house that opened in the early 2000s. In 2012 they even expanded the original building to accommodate more guests. Now, there was this nice patio that was used as a waiting area for people to dine inside. However, it was never used for outdoor dining because you see, Koreans are like vampires and hate the sun.  
 
Well, with the governor&apos;s orders not to dine in, BCD originally did takeout only before converting the patio waiting area to an outdoor dining patio with shade canopies. A pleasant surprise is that because you are dining outside, they allow you to dine with your dog so long as your dog is friendly. During before times, I would have never in a million years thought I would be able to eat at BCD with my furchild, Charlie!
 
Unfortunately, the only problem I see for eating hot tofu soup outside with no A/C or fans due to COVID-19 is that when the weather gets hotter, it&apos;s going to be a mofo. I mean when we went, it was 85 degrees and I was getting sweaty.

Still, I am all for supporting businesses that are trying to stay alive during these uncertain times. The dine-in patio is open from 11 AM to 2 AM daily so maybe you should stop by when the weather cools off and the sun goes down.

* Literally just called to confirm that they are still dog-friendly. Woof woof!

* Please open a location in NorCal. How can Texas get a BCD before SF? The soon tofu up here is Bad, Crappy, Deplorable."
5,"I feel like visiting BCD Tofu House is a rite of passage for when you live in Ktown! 

I am impressed by the very efficient service and process they have going on here from the moment you step on the turf to speak to the hostess to the end of the meal.

The food is very authentic and flavorful. I love how they have several options for combos with bbq meat and soups. I was happily surprised by how much seafood was stuffed in the korean pancake. All of the banchan will make you feel like you could eat to your hearts desire. I would be surprised if you leave without left overs. Definitely hits the spots when you are in need of some korean comfort food. 

The people watching is great!  Overall, a really fun dining experience."
4,"Pretty standard BCD tofu soup. The thing I love about BCD is they are open whenever I crave some tofu soup, they are pretty consistent across all their locations and the prices are reasonable. Reason for 4 stars is really that there are some amazing tofu soup spots I k-town that just have more complexity flavor to their broth than BCD.

As for BCD delivery, they do a great job at packing the food, however I prefer to order and pick-up, just so that they broth is hot when I get it versus Luke warm but the time the delivery person arrives Also, prior to the safer at home orders were put back into effect they had some substantial seating outside."
4,"BCD is always a classic korean restaurant that I can find myself always coming back for more. It just tastes better when dining in cause of the hot pot. With Covid, they do offer take out still and also patio seating. Before being seated, they take your temperature and wipe and sanitize everything. The tables are also pretty spaced out as well. They also put the egg in for you already if you want it and limit all contacts with you as much as possible, such as scooping your own rice and pouring the tea in. 

Beef soon tofu - I always get medium, as it&apos;s just the good amount of spicy for me. Tofu to beef to soup ratio is always on point. I&apos;m sad that they didn&apos;t add in any green onions :(

I&apos;m not sure if they&apos;re still open 24/7, but this is great after a night of going out :)

Pros :
- always a classic spot for soon tofu
- has own parking lot"
4,"Good for late night food! 

The patio is open for dine in now. I felt like the amount of food that I get here is well worth the price."
5,"Placed an order for takeout and it was ready right on time.  I ordered the pork soon with kalbi. It was just what I needed on a cold day. The fish. sides, and rice were fresh as well. 

Parking:
There is a large parking lot in front of the restaurant. 

Pickup:
The pickup was really easy. When I arrived the employee asked for my name and brought out the order for me. The employees made sure the customer were socially distant. 

Thank you for making the pick up so easy and the order ready so fast."
