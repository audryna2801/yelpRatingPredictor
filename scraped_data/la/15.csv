5,"Hands down the best Indian food in LA. In fact, I&apos;ve been back to other Indian restaurants I used to go to and thought were good, but since discovering India&apos;s Restaurant it&apos;s ruined them all!

Their lunch buffet is bomb but also ordering delivery is great as well, which I get at least once a month."
5,"Not to be confused with the India Restaurant or lots of other restaurants with similar names, India&apos;s Restaurant has quickly become my go-to for Indian food available for delivery. I have to say, the first time I tried India&apos;s Restaurant, I was extremely surprised with how delicious the food was. Even with the stellar reviews, I figured it couldn&apos;t be that good, and having it delivered usually takes a little bit away from the dishes versus eating it right from the kitchen in person. But not the case here! 

The chicken tikka masala is fantastic, the chicken is super tender and the sauce is to die for. I order it each time. I&apos;ve tried numerous other dishes such as the saag paneer, aloo gobi, daal makhni, and many others and they are all super tasty and I haven&apos;t been disappointed. Also highly recommend the onion kulcha bread which is like a fluffy yet crispy naan stuffed with onions. 

This place is awesome and I&apos;m looking forward to the day when we can eat there in person!"
5,"Wow, I unexpectedly landed into one of my favorite Indian restaurants in LA. Everything was delicious. 

Assorted Appetizers - Came out piping hot and delicious 
Fish Tikka Masala - Perfection
Bengan Bhartha (Vegan) * New dish that I have never tried before. Really good if you&apos;re an eggplant fan. 
Garlic Basil Naan- They adding basil to Naah now?! Say whaaaaa
Chai with like three packets of sugar- Treat yo self.

I can be super picky when it comes to Indian food. And since I moved to LA I was determined to go on an Indian food journey to find the best of the best, but how could anything top this place??

Fine Print: There is outdoor seating. It feels socially distanced. I felt super comfortable eating here."
5,"Service is sweet and great!
Dishes are seasoned well and great proportions! 
I love coming here when I&apos;m feeling homesick for my mom&apos;s dishes."
5,"February 19 outdoor dining. Food was phenomenal, service was fantastic. Our server bubbli was great, awesome sense of humor too. She gave me homework to do!!!

Complimentary dessert, lip smacking."
5,"Great dinner at India&apos;s! Picked off the map what was closest and was not disappointed. Had a Shahi Paneer and Chicken Tikka Masala with Saffron rice and the requisite chai tea and mango lassi. 
Bubbly was an excellent server, wonderfully bubbly and kind! Will be back"
4,"Yum! Ordered delivery. Curries were flavorful. 

Orders:
- Chicken Tikka Masala: what you expect. Decent portion and gives a good taste.
- Saag Paneer: a little different than what I expected because I&apos;ve only had this once at another Indian restaurant and I loved it there. Might not get it again here because I don&apos;t care for it too much personally. Family enjoyed it though!
- Mulgatani Soup: yummy soup. Relatively small portion. Kinda had it as a side snack.
- Alu Samosa: enjoyed this a lot! Goes well with some other spice sauces I added from home myself.
- Garlic Naan: decent and what you expect!

Overall, not a bad restaurant! Might get it again to try other items on the menu."
4,"India&apos;s Restaurant is highly popular and well known for their LUNCH Buffet (precovid). Hence, the 2800 plus reviews.
 
They been around since 1986. This location is just one of five restaurants throughout So. Cal with same ownership and same food. Their other locations is listed as &quot;India&apos;s Tandoori&quot;. See website for locations/address.

Overall the food here is pretty good and consistent. The spices in their various dishes is subtle - not bland. Nothing over the top. Also, when you order SPICY they make it SPICY not mild (important for me). Food also comes out freakishly FAST for takeout, so you won&apos;t be standing around. Portions aren&apos;t big, so order accordingly if your hungry or feeding the family. 

**Parking is tight in this mimi mall (read: sucks)."
3,"Ordered via UberEats and we decided to get a bunch of different things:

Chicken tikka: comes with rice and a few greens. I think it was average and could have been more flavorful. Definitely wish they sent the green chutney that it usually is eaten with.

Paneer tikka: comes with rice and was good. I liked it.

Lamb Biryani: it was good, the rice as well as the lamb was flavorful. Comes with riata (yogurt on the side). 

Benghan bharta: if you like eggplant, you will love this. I really liked it and got medium spice- wish I got the mild because medium was a little spicy for me.

Rasmalai: think of it as bread pudding in syrup. I liked it as it was perfectly balanced and not too sweet.

Overall, the food was 3.5 stars and I didn&apos;t think anything was extraordinary. 

I would definitely give it another go and dine in at the restaurant instead of ordering."
4,"The spot is good!! I have been trying to find a good Indian place and this places somewhat satisfies me. Still not the best place as I had better Indian foods in other states. However, this place is good enough to return for more indian craving. 

I ordered chicken tikka masala, lamb saag, chicken tandoori, garlic naan, and mango lassi. Although we ordered mild for the spicy level but it was VERY spicy! If you cannot tolerate spicy food, it&apos;s best to order non- spicy! 

If you check in on Yelp, you will also get 15% off. Parking lot is small so depending on the time you get there, you might have a hard time finding parking!"
3,"Had ordered Paneer Tikka masala, Garlic basil naan, Alu Vindaloo and Alu Naan.

Food was just okay. None of the items stood out exceptionally. Only the chutneys were nice. That&apos;s it! 
Lot of food coloring used. Both in the curries and in the green chutney as if to hide the ingredients and to make the customers feel that they look nice, lol !

This place is certainly not going to be my to-go places for sure. Not ordering mediocre food from here again when there are 100s of better options out there."
2,"After all the rave reviews, I was especially disappointed with my order.
I got Postmates last night as a treat, because I was really craving paneer and cheese naan. I ordered the matar paneer and a side of cheese naan. Both items were unfortunately the worst indian food I&apos;ve ordered in LA.
The cheese naan was not cooked enough. It was like eating dough, I couldn&apos;t handle eating it so tried heating it up in my oven but it&apos;s not the same, so ended up throwing away most of it.
The matar paneer was incredibly disappointing. There were ginger pieces so large that it was a crunchy dish! It was also somehow incredibly salty, something I&apos;ve never experienced before with matar paneer. The paneer was tough, and I don&apos;t think any tomato paste included because the dish was bright yellow. Also could not finish this meal. Overall, very disappointing!"
5,"Babli was our server and she was amazing! She was super helpful with dinner recommendations (dinner express combo) and patient with all our questions. 

Service was quick even when they were busy. They gave us new plates and cleared our table to make more room for all our dishes. The food was tasty and full of flavor. The chicken tandoori can be dry at some places but it was nice and juicy here. 

I really enjoyed the chicken and vegetable soup (I got it without rice). I got it medium spicy and it wasn&apos;t too spicy at all :)

Can&apos;t wait to come back and try their other dishes!"
4,"Ordered postmates for lunch and was so excited to try their chicken curry. For my taste it was watery and I was slightly disappointed. It was lacking a flavor and usually Indian food is known for flavorful dishes, not in this case. However chicken and veggies were cooked perfectly, naan was delicious and slightly crispy. 
Wouldn&apos;t recommend tomato curry, other than that delish!"
3,"I want to commend for their service and hospitality. I also recognize that it&apos;s hard to find solid Indian food that is available during the late evening hours. Their portions are fairly sized but I found the taste lacking. The chicken tikka and samosas were dry, the saag paneer was decent...but the alo gobo was solid. I liked the garlic naan and the chai tea but otherwise unsure about their really high ratings. Would prefer Chadini in Santa Monica albeit they are only vegetarian."
5,"Great food and great service. Can&apos;t wait for the lunch buffet to come back! 
Had the tandoori Chicken and garlic naan. Was sooo good!"
4,"Outdoor seating was good but our host Bubbly was Amazing!!!!! Feb13,2021



Recommendation: more out door heat laps"
5,"I&apos;ve ordered food from here a couple of times and I must say I am very impressed. Consistently very good Indian food. Their prices and portions are also good. 

Whenever I&apos;m in the mood for a curry this is my new spot !!

Excellent customer service."
4,"The chicken Tikki Masala was Actual really good with flavor as well! The only reason I did not give 5 star was the way some of the chicken were too chewy. 
But overall really good spot! Definitely will order from there again. 
The Garlic Naann thoughhh! Sheeeshh! FIRE!"
5,"This is my absolute favorite go-to! I&apos;ve yet to get something that wasn&apos;t delivered fresh and delicious. At least once a month I come down with a mad craving for their Saag Paneer and the Coconut Chicken (which is a to-die-for green curry), and with a side of Basmati, I&apos;m in heaven for at least three days afterward--each dish is definitely enough for 2 if not 3 servings. 
Word to the wise: don&apos;t be over-confident about how spicy you like things. If you like a kick, but not a flame, go mild, which is on the hotter end of a Western medium level."
