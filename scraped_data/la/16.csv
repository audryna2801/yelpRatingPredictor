5,"DINE-IN REVIEW

Clap your hands for this Hand Roll Bar!

They have a lot next door to the restaurant that you can pay for, but the restaurant only validates if you&apos;re picking up the food to-go, not if you&apos;re staying. I want to say it&apos;s about $5-$10 for parking if you&apos;re going to stay and eat.

Food: My girlfriend and I got the set menus and she had opted for the 4-roll menu, I got the 5-roll menu and we had shared. My favorite of all the rolls we had was the crab, surprisingly. Hers was the NZ Sea Bream. The fish tasted absolutely fresh, the rice cooked to perfection, and the portion sizing was great. We definitely got full despite the rolls being egg roll sized.
Big shoutouts to their iced green tea - normally at restaurants they serve you just some tea bag green tea. Here, they give you actual unsweetened matcha, which is my absolute favorite.

Service: Service was great. Our first time dine-in (and definitely not our last) was a great experience, especially during this weird time of uncertainty. The host checked us in, asked us if we had any symptoms and wrote our name down for COVID tracking. We were then &quot;seated&quot; at their outdoor bar, three parties standing staggered (say that five-times fast). The servers brought out our rolls one roll at a time, kind of like a multiple course meal. It definitely felt like it - and it was a great idea. Made it seem like each roll has its own part to play in the full course meal.

Overall, my girlfriend and I loved this place. We came during Valentine&apos;s Day and the wait wasn&apos;t too bad. Only about 40-45 minute wait with 3 couples in front of us. Was definitely worth the wait, will definitely come back in the future to try a to-go order."
5,"I&apos;ve been to Kazunori for dine in for a few time and this is the first time I ordered delivery. Unlike dine in, there&apos;s no handroll option and only have rolls. Once again Kazunori never disappoints! 

Takeaway:
- Very well packed 
- Great quality rolls"
5,"KazuNori always hits the spot! When I don&apos;t feel like paying the full price of Sugarfish, Kazunori is a quick and easy alternative. Their fish is always really fresh and their salmon is to die for. It&apos;s not too fatty and has just the right amount of melt in your mouth feel. Their set boxes are not too expensive and will definitely make you full. Keep in mind that even if it is take out only, they will still charge the 16% fee. Give it a try!"
4,"Pre-Covid Review

Summary:
Great small, casual restaurant for a light lunch or quick dinner. Not for big groups.

Location:
Downtown LA

Experience:
Busy, fast paced, eat-and-go. No tables, just intimate bar seating that encloses the sushi chefs. Fill out a menu form, hand it to the chef, and your handrolls will be handed to you as they are finished. Take your menu form to the register, pay and leave.

Food:
Fresh and minimal. No frills. Simply fish, sushi rice, and nori."
5,"I LOVE KazuNori so much! Amazing design for a restaurant. You are served the hand rolls as they are made, and the seating circles the sushi chefs so you can watch them make your food, and they place it in front of you when it&apos;s ready. This makes for a delightful eating experience with small breaks between each dish to give you time to converse with your party, sip on some Sake, and watch the chefs do their work. 
Perfect location for a Nice Date, as its a little pricey. If share one of the dinner specials and get a bottle to drink it&apos;ll come to about $90 - $130 
But if you want to treat yourself I&apos;d recommend this place in a heart beat!"
3,"I have been wanting to try this Uber popular sushi joint for a while now and finally decided to order some takeout. The various combos we ordered came in nice boxes with dividers to separate the various items inside. 

The sushi I thought was just ok; not sure what the fuss was all about. Perhaps it was because we got takeouts instead of eating in."
4,"Randomly chose KazuNori as my take-out lunch for the week. Online ordering should have been a breeze, but I didn&apos;t have a ChowNow account and had some issues signing up. No matter, it worked out in the end. I suppose I could&apos;ve called in and placed an order, that way my money goes directly to supporting them. Got an estimated pickup time, and my order was ready early. 

No hand rolls on the go, just cut rolls. I kind of understand, but still would&apos;ve wanted to order hand rolls as well. The menu is pretty basic, there are a variety of 16-piece sets to choose from, and you can also pick from a long list if you want a la carte. If you really really want hand rolls, you have to make it yourself. Kits are $95, and serve 4-5. 

The seaweed held up pretty well, it wasn&apos;t a soggy mess. The rice was good too. Everything was fresh; I got to try Lobster, Crab, Toro, and Cucumber. They pack the rolls neatly in a nice to-go box with small containers of soy sauce, ginger, and wasabi on the side. 

I wasn&apos;t full afterwards. But my heart was pretty content."
3,"Solid option for take out! My only complaint is that they cut the rolls. What&apos;s the point if this is a hand roll joint? We even asked if they could not cut them aka less work and they said no. Odd.

Overall, my favorite is the blue crab and scallop. Do not sleep on the scallop, it is buttery deliciousness.

Browse the menu because the split roll orders are a solid deal and give you variety. 

The Kazu Nori sake is also delicious. Definitely worth stocking up on during quarantino season part two.

We had a really easy order and pick up process via Postmates."
4,"After hearing my cousin rave about this place, I had to try it. Everytime he talks about it, his eyes roll to the back of his head, and I could see the drool come out of his mouth. It&apos;s been on my list for awhile, so the hype was definitely there.

I ordered the set of 4 handrolls for $15, which came with toro, yellowtail, salmon, and crab. The fishes were all okay. I thought it lacked in flavor. I wasn&apos;t impressed at all and won&apos;t be ordering them again. The crab, though, was THE BEST. My cousin recommended the scallops roll and a friend recommended the lobster roll, so I&apos;ll definitely have to be back to try those! For now, I&apos;m giving 4 stars for the crab roll.

I also really liked that they had UNSCENTED soap in the bathroom for use BEFORE eating and scented soap for AFTER eating, ahah! I&apos;ve never seen that before. It&apos;s a thoughtful touch. I have sensitive skin, so I definitely appreciate a place that has unscented soap!"
5,"KazuNori has always been my go to spot since stumbling upon it in 2016. With the stay-at-home orders it&apos;s not the same, but they do have the perfect family sized Handroll roll kit. 

For $95 dollars, before taxes and fees, you get all the ingredients to make 20 rolls, and a little extra. It seems like a big price, but actually is worth all the value.  Each filling was estimated 5 rolls, but it definitely goes beyond. There was two extra seaweed, depending on how much rice you out there is extra too. 

I always crave the crab  roll because I don&apos;t find many places that have real crab and not the fake krab. The salmon was a favorite with my family and the toro. 

The instructions for the rolls was visual and easy to understand. The font was just small to realize the Japanese chives go on the hamachi and sesame seeds on salmon. 

Wish it was possible to get smaller handroll kits at home for a smaller party and less of a price tag. Also that there was a way or instructions on how to reheat the rice. Going from sierra madre to LA and running some errands make it cool before eating. Would definitely try this experience again!"
3,"Kazunori had always been a favorite restaurant of mine but their to-go menu is a bit lacking. Really sad that they couldn&apos;t figure out how to make hand rolls to-go work out. They now serve cut rolls instead and while their cuts rolls are delicious, it&apos;s not worth the price point and did leave me still feeling hungry. 

They have a mandatory 16% fee in lieu of tipping. They have the option to order online or by phone. I had ordered by phone. I ordered the 16 pieces &amp; sashimi set which had its hit and misses. The box overall is not filling but it did have different options so I got to try different rolls. Learn from my experience and try ordering a la carte instead. The best was the yellowtail. Hands down the most savory and flavorful. Cucumber can be skipped. It is exactly what you would expect. The box comes with salmon sashimi but I struggle with calling it sashimi. I expected evenly cut pieces but it&apos;s more like chunks of salmon? Unfortunately more like scraps of salmon. Tasty but sashimi is not the right description. 

Overall the box is good but not worth the price. Get individual rolls if you&apos;re craving their flavors."
4,"**This review was from a pre-pandemic visit back in February**Glad I finally paid a visit to KazuNori! For newbies like myself, do not let the long line out the door scare you away. The simplicity of the menu and flow of the experience at KazuNori allows most groups to be in and out within 30 minutes. I waited about 30 minutes on a Saturday around 2pm. I would not recommend visiting KazuNori with a group larger than four. It is all bar seating. 

I would describe the menu and service as &quot;no-frills&quot;. There are a handful of handroll options. The best deal is going with the set menu. They are very accommodating with dietary needs when it comes to switching hand rolls out from the set menu. Although the service is fast, KazuNori has a very conveyor belt/fast food feel in terms of their service. No smiles. No warm small talk. No one is special. Get in. Get fed. Get out. 

The iced green tea is delicious with the hand rolls! Great flavor with a beautiful dark green color and slightly nutty flavor. I really enjoyed all the hand rolls in the 4-Hand Roll set. My favorite was the Toro and Crab. All rolls had a good ratio between rice and fish/crab. I am glab the crab was not smothered in mayo and the fresh crab taste was still there. To wrap it all up warm more vinegar forward rice and the quality of nori were on point! Looking forward to my next visit to KazuNori!!"
5,"Came here with a friend as we were both hungry and wasn&apos;t to grab something quick.  We both ordered the six hand roll and a couple extra. Boy, we were stuffed. 

The hand rolls comes out once the chef has it ready so that the seaweed doesn&apos;t get soggy and loses its crunch by the time you eat it. My favorites were the lobster and sea bream, delightful. 

I will come back again once LA County lifts its guidelines to reinforce outdoor dining."
5,"KazuNori is a great, lighter option when you want sushi. They do a fantastic job with togo, making this a great meal for when you&apos;re in the office (and can splurge ;)). I like to order their box that comes with salmon sashimi. Thankfully when you order from here you always know there&apos;s a standard of freshness they will always meet. 
Can&apos;t help but think about KazuNori when it&apos;s half the price of SugarFish!"
5,"TYPE: pickup
SERVICE (ONLINE): online menu is fully functional. Annoying that you have to create a &quot;Chownow&quot; account to place an order. Supports Apple Pay. 
SERVICE (HUMAN): extremely brief, quick pickup. Be warned: parking is brutal. 
PRESENTATION: give whoever designed this packaging an award. Custom cardboard box fits *perfectly* in the custom designed bag. High-quality chopsticks wrapped in a thick napkin. Little dipping tray. Soy sauce is even labeled, to prevent... confusion? 
TASTE: although I miss the feel of their hand rolls, the cut rolls provide a delicious, filling and healthy meal. Wasabi is delightfully sharp, nori is crisp. Salmon was notably outstanding today; toro and crab pretty decent; slightly disappointed in the yellowtail, but not in any dramatic way. 
RECOMMENDED FOR: sushi snobs, healthy/fresh food, first dates, won&apos;t get your hands messy. 
FINAL SCORE: 7/10"
5,"I think understand the hype of Sugarfish as this place is similar to it. So good!  I was able to get their to-go Dine LA menu. If you want handrolls, you have to eat in but if you do togo prepare to get maki rolls. 

My top was the crab and that is because I love real crab. The sauce they give for the sashimi was so good. The togo Dine LA menus was very much worth it to get a good sampler.

I did not find any free parking but there is a decent garage that was not too pricey. So yummy and worth it! I want more and I wish there was a place like this in the Bay area."
1,Worst place to go out to eat I came all the way from inland empire because I heard great things about this place well let me tell you they where wrong. I asked for ponzu sauce and the waitress insisted that they would not give me a drop of there so called liquid gold I even told here I would pay for it and still said no ponzu is water down soy sauce very simple to make this was the worst experience I&apos;ve had in a while congratulations waitress on messing up a very simple task even a cave man can do buy it&apos;s your loss not mine I&apos;m in little Tokyo down the street which is better anyways
5,This place has the best hand rolls and freshest fish. I love their to go packaging and menu. I look forward to indoor dining again to re experience this place from chef to plate without the take out. I highly recommend. (Not kid friendly)
5,"ive heard soo many good things about kazu nori so i had to try them out when i was in santa monica.

i was honestly in love with how fresh the fish was. it definitely hit the spot. the rolls had the perfect amount of rice and made sure to not overwhelm the taste of the fish. the rice vinegar cut through perfectly and made this roll super refreshing. i felt like i could eat forever and not be full haha. 

the set we ordered came with sea bream, salmon, crab, and toro. my personal favorite had to be the crab because they use real crab meat! i definitely need to come back and try the lobster hand roll. they also have a slew of other fishes to choose from like yellowtail! it was a little pricey for four hand rolls but you do get some really good quality.

because of covid theyre takeout only. i suggest your order ahead online which takes about 10-15 mins to prepare. its definitely not as busy as they used to be when dine in was an option so take advantage of that while you can. theyre a short 5 minute walk to the beach/pier so its a wonderful grab and go picnic item. theres also free 90 minute parking in the lots nearby!"
5,"Fresh fishes coming through. Love this place. I actually have this place in my wish list since 2 years ago but now I had a chance to try it.
Expensive food but worth it. My boyfriend and me went pick it up after ordering through their website. Kinda hard to find parkings but seriously...a must try place if you guys love sushi.
They don&apos;t serve handrolls during the pandemic.
Nice boxes and everything. :))))"
