5,"If you love matcha, this is the spot for you for a super delicious treat! The soft  serve here is simple; not too sweet, rich in flavor and topped with a dusting of matcha powder. The texture is nice and creamy, and thick enough that it doesn&apos;t melt too quickly. I can attest to this because I cam on a day that was 90 degrees outside! There is a little outdoor area with benches and tables socially distanced apart so you can enjoy your treat before going about your day.

The little shop is located in a plaza with a decent amount of parking (and currently free because of COVID). I recommend going and leaving before 5pm. There are several restaurants in the plaza so the parking lot gets crowded fast for the dinner pick-ups."
5,"The matcha soft serve has a lot of flavor. It&apos;s a decent size for the quality, enough to feel satisfied. Ice cream has a very smooth mouthfeel devoid of ice crystals but doesn&apos;t melt too quickly, yet not overly heavy - doesn&apos;t seem to be high fat content. Consistency is fairly dense for soft serve. Dusted matcha powder, so be careful as it might get on your clothes while eating. There isn&apos;t a lot of outdoor seating (which is closed now), but some parking so you&apos;ll likely have to eat it in the car - sad but such is COVID times. Tea Master sets the bar high for matcha ice cream."
5,"Small shop in little Tokyo but the best matcha soft served ice cream. Very smooth, velvety and melt in your mouth. They only let 4 people at a time in their little shop, people observe social distancing. Love the matcha soft serve and cold matcha latte. They don&apos;t skimp on matcha like other stores and their price is very reasonable. Free parking too! I definitely recommend this place. Would definitely come back when I have matcha cravings!"
4,"Dope spot to get your Green Tea fix!  They have everything here from pastries, drinks to ice cream all with, you guessed it, Matcha Green Tea!  

The staff here are super friendly and the food and drinks here are great.  My personal favorite is the soft serve ice cream, it&apos;s creamy and delicious.  

Although it&apos;s kind of a niche food and drink, I really hope this place survives after all this covid business is over, as it was always a must to visit here when I&apos;m in Little Tokyo!"

+Parking:
Small lot, but limited spaces. 

+Atmosphere:
The plaza has a shared small outdoor eating area. There were a variety of matcha and green teas, chasen&apos;s, matcha sets, etc. to choose if you want to pick up something for at-home practices. They also have an online shop and free shipping over $45+!

+ Ordered: (Mobile Order on the site or in person)
The menu is different in person, but I think the only difference were the teas available to-go aside from the normal matcha soft serve, matcha latte, green tea, and sencha. May be hot or cold.

+I ordered two items online: 
1. Matcha Latte: I&apos;m not really into milk items, but somedays you want something more rich in flavor. This item is your item! Matcha, oat milk, and honey syrup sweetener; Cold. Blended well together and this is the fad to reduce the bitterness of the matcha. 
2. Matcha Green Tea:  Matcha GT &amp; sencha GT sweetened with beet syrup; Hot. This item had a balanced flavor all throughout and the beet syrup induced a more earthy flavor profile fitting the matcha/sencha GT mix. Would definitely get this item again!

I was wanting to grab a soft serve to-go, since it is popular, but I will come back to try the matcha soft-serve when it&apos;s warmer! Also, they have upgraded matcha and sencha items to choose from, but only available at the store. Therefore, ask for those items upon arrival. Looks like it was $5.50/$7.50 for premium grade and $6.50/$9.50 for Ceremonial Grade in Dec 2020."
4,"Super disliked the cardboard cups and wood spoons. My final bites were actually a little bit annoying. Spooning out the last few bites makes a really annoying scrapping sound that I would like to get out of my head. I actually didn&apos;t finish a scoop or two.

I think the matcha powder is what makes this ice cream taste good.

Although, the flavors are really balanced and the milk and creaminess stands out, I probably won&apos;t go back.  

There isn&apos;t anything off putting about the ice cream, but I can&apos;t say I found it super delicious. Overall you&apos;ll get a traditional matcha ice cream.

There are only two tables in the front for seating."
5,"I agree with the majority statement: this is the best matcha soft serve I&apos;ve ever had. 

The matcha soft serve has the perfect blend of creaminess with matcha flavor. You get a good amount and I&apos;m pleased every time I come here. 

I&apos;ve also tried the matcha smoothie. I was told it would have an earthy flavor and wouldn&apos;t be sweet. I was kind of worried that it would be bitter, but it wasn&apos;t bitter at all. It was pretty good and really filling."
5,Service is very friendly and the matcha soft serve is perfect! It&apos;s not overly sweet and very light in texture (kind of like whip cream).
5,"Got the matcha green tea iced cream and it was amazing!! Definitely taste the matcha and love the matcha powder on the ice cream. The cup is kind of small but it is filling! 

Definitely worth the try!! GET IT!!"
5,"Tea Master is located in the Honda Plaza in the Little Tokyo neighborhood of DTLA. There&apos;s usually free parking in the plaza which is such a rarity in LA and a huge perk! 

Best. Matcha. Soft serve. Ever. I would make the trek from OC to LA strictly for this or even go out of my way to stop by for some matcha ice cream because it&apos;s just that good. The service is always super friendly and the ice cream is the creamiest I&apos;ve ever had. I don&apos;t even know if I need to try anything else on the menu because the matcha ice cream is honestly all I need. The matcha flavor is distinct and they even sprinkle some matcha powder on top :-)"
4,"I came here with my friend from out of town and I&apos;m finally glad that after a whole year I was able to try the Matcha soft serve! The soft serve is a perfect treat for any matcha lover - especially on a hot day. The reason why I am knocking down one store is due in part to the parking, as well as the Matcha cold brew which I was able to taste as my friend got it and we both mutually agreed that we thought it was a bit watered down"
5,"WOW. Their soft serve is one of the best and the matcha is top-notch! 
Never had a soft serve that was as perfect as this one.  The texture is smooth and silky, and surprisingly does not melt instantly!  You have all the time to take those perfect IG photos before it melts or you take a bite.  Well not all the time, but you know...more than usual.

Can&apos;t wait to go again! So addicting.

During COVID, parking has been free and available in the plaza with a small, cute dining area outside."
5,"The best Matcha soft serve in LA. Period. Its got the right amount of earthiness and sweetness. Perfect texture too. Also like the dusting of the matcha on it. Parking is ok on the street, and I think if you time it right you can park in the plaza.  If you intend to spend a afternoon or evening in Little Tokyo, and want a perfect palate cleanser-not too heavy dessert, go here. They also have matcha tea drinks and pastries too. Highly recommended."
5,"Had a matcha craving last night and a friend recommended this place. Omg! The matcha soft serve was soooo good. It was super smooth and yummy and matcha-y. Inhaled the powder and choked for a second, but totally worth it haha matcha fix satisfied! Also, the staff are the nicest people and super welcoming. Will definitely be back."
4,"Mid Covid-19 review.
Descent matcha soft serve, the matcha flavor is sublte. They have other green tea themed items. I posted the menu. There is no sitting inside, just outside and there is practically no shade. Although all of this, I would come back if in this part of little Tokyo. The service was prompt."
5,"This particular place has been on my bookmarks list for about two years. I&apos;m not usually in Little Tokyo but I finally made the time to go on a dinner and dessert hunt with the boyfriend and dragged him to Tea Master before they closed! 

I was expecting to find a very mainstream trendy place because of all the reviews on Yelp, making me assume thatBut was frequented by many people of my generation who were active on Yelp, but I was surprised to find that that spot was a very dainty, lowkey family-owned shop. We were warmly greeted by what seemed like a couple and found a limited menu specializing in drinks and their famous matcha green tea soft serve. In the side of the store was also a section to purchase adorable tea sets and other trinkets, adding more of a homey vibe. 

Because this was dessert #1 before dinner, we decided to share one soft serve which was a great idea in hindsight. The soft serve was generously given in a cup and nicely covered in matcha green tea powder. We loved it. Very rich and creamy and enjoyable. I absolutely loved the neon sign of the green tea soft serve! What&apos;s also nice is that there were some tables and chairs set out outdoors for people to enjoy the drinks and soft serve. Definitely give this place a visit and support local businesses like this wonderful spot. 

PARKING
We parked in the structured lot by SomiSomi but there&apos;s limited parking in this plaza as well."
5,"tl;dr - If you like/love matcha, and you haven&apos;t been to Tea Master - you&apos;re doing your taste buds and yourself a HUGE disservice. Full review below.

Before COVID-19, I had my go-to spot for all things matcha. Now, as the Rona timeline rages on, I&apos;ve began to actively seek out new adventures - enter, Tea Master Matcha Cafe &amp; Green Tea.

I was craving a matcha dessert during the recent temperature surge in L.A. when we hit the low 90s, and given how my go-to spot was closed, Yelp was able to produce a new place for me to venture out to! 5 stars? Over 1,400 reviews?! Ok, NOW you perked my interest!

I ordered all the favorites (and included the food porn because this is Yelp and ya know): matcha soft serve ice cream, matcha latte, matcha smoothie, and their smoothie of the day (pineapple soft serve, no sugar added)... and guess how it tasted? Hint: look at the number of stars I gave it.

I have not had this level of earthy, rich, raw, and real matcha since my visit to Japan. The quality and authenticity of the product was surreal, and definitely something I was not expecting. The drinks were delectable, and as many Yelpers have already stated - once you try their soft serve, you ain&apos;t goin&apos; back (to other places because this one is WOWWWW)! I can&apos;t wait to come back and have a few more bowls!"
5,"Matcha latte from the master. Lightly sweetened with that clean, green matcha flavor coming through. Love that they use oat milk by default! It doesn&apos;t overwhelm the matcha flavor. 

During Covid, they limit the number of people in the store and have the line wait outside - it&apos;s a small shop. They also offer limited outdoor seating. 

I&apos;ve also had the soft serve and it is so delicious!"
5,"What a delicious treat! Super simple matcha soft serve. Everybody&apos;s raving about it so had to see what&apos;s up! Definitely satiated, happy, and dreaming of the next time I&apos;ll get to have some again. Located in a plaza with a decent amount of parking, which is manageable during these times but probably hectic pre-pandemic. Treat yo&apos;self!"
4,"Loved how cute this place was and they had good covid regulations in place for our safety, which was a plus.

Strong matcha flavor in both the latte and soft serve. Thought the oat milk wasn&apos;t as nice as the normal whole milk but it was the only option they had. Cute tea cups and accessories inside and nice staff members! 

Def would recommend if you are in the area!"
