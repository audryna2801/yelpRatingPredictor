5,"This was during COVID in December. Take out only. They make great beef bone broth soup rice.

I asked for mixed meat (without weird stuff like blood sausage or glands/offal).

I also asked for no reg kimchi, just double of the radish kimchi and they delivered / supplied.

Note to self, ask for more green onions!

Super tasty. Super comforting. Super healing."
5,"Hands down the best Korean dish I&apos;ve ever had. Seriously. Despite COVID, the restaurant was still lively. The owners were so personable and friendly. I truly enjoyed the experience. Great amount of food will be served. And I can&apos;t stress it enough, but the owners really put in the love in each bowl. The price of the meals was very reasonable for the homemade meal you&apos;re about to embark on. I live in San Diego and I drive up for their food. 
Thanks to COVID, we had to eat our meals on the hood of my car. But let me tell you, for the 20 or so minutes it took to eat, my friends and I forgot there was a pandemic. The meal really just reminded us how good a phenomenal meal can make you feel."
5,"This soup was sooooo good!! I ordered the Sul Lung Tang -Salgogi (beef brisket oxtail soup) it was $14.50 and worth every bite!!

My friend who is from Korea, had taken me to Sun Nong Dan and I was SO skeptical getting soup or any form of food from a dingy looking Korean strip mall. It was good but then I saw this place which had about 1k more reviews and thought- &quot;I have to try this too&quot;! 

The staff was so nice in trying to accommodate me to take my cc # over the phone so I can remain contactless upon arrival. She had a great sense of humor and totally got me paid up and ready to go. When I got there we both shared giggles over how we were trying to figure out how to get me paid up previously over the phone. Really great service again!! 

There&apos;s parking in the back just FYI. Make sure to wear a mask too! 

The meal came with the soup and it was big enough for 2 servings for me. Kkakdugi kimchi (radish) and yangbaechu kimchi (cabbage) is included as sides. My favorite surprisingly was the radish one. I ate it all!! And you get salt, green onions, chili paste, and a nice big to-go container of white rice. 

The soup itself had tons of beef brisket and glass noodles. The broth was milky too and soooo yummy! I&apos;d say the difference between Sun Nong Dan and here is there&apos;s more fat and flavor in the one that they serve here. You can clearly see it in the meat as well. 

The reviews were SO accurate about how tasty and simple this comfort food really is.

The outside looks insane like a total bad idea but I promise you it&apos;s not!!! Just try it. And get ready for a nap after. I hope you enjoy!!"
5,"i used to dislike this restaurant back in the days, i legit have no idea why, even until right now.  but there was one day that i suddenly wanted this and ever since i been coming here pretty often.

i am surprised that i havent given them a review yet, despite my frequent visits here.

this place serves a very simple meal, soup with meat and guts. and you kinda create your own flavor to your liking. there are salt, pepper, green onion, sesame oil, soy sauce, spicy paste, etc etc.

i always get the mixed with no intestine, and it is always excellent.
NGL, their kimchi is DA BEST. always ask for extra. you&apos;ll thank me later.

call in your order and it should be ready within 15.

just make sure to double check your order because there are quite a few combination of meat and guts that you can order so sometimes they might get it wrong. thats the only downside about this place.

would i come back? thats not even a question. see you soon."
4,"If Han Bat ever goes bankrupt, they can thrive on selling their kimchi alone. Compared to all other side dishes (ban chan), I clean out their plates and I ALWAYS ask for more. As much as I wish Han Bat was a kimchi store they are not, so let&apos;s talk about soups. Ever since moving into the neighborhood, Han Bat has been the comfort food that never fails to comfort. They are known for their ox bone soup (sullungtang) and I favor the naejang (intestines, tripe, spleen, tongue). The sullungtangs come non-spicy with a bowl of rice and glass noodles on the side. Customize to taste by adding in-house condiments: green onion, coarse salt, and chili paste. 

Tip: Kimchi is NOT for sale! 

Parking: Entrance to small private lot behind the restaurant on 5th St., with metered parking out front. Be careful not to miss as the lot entrance is a side alley with no signs. DO NOT enter off Western Ave. 

Payment: Credit/Debit accepted 

Price: $ has gone up since 2019 but still worth every penny"
5,"I will make this review simple and straight to the point.  If you want a bowl of sullungtang and perfect kimchi(Kacktoogi). This is the place.  This is korean soul food. The korean comfort food. The hangover food.  Price is decent for the portion. I usually get two bowls for my family of 5. 

Mucho love!"
3,"I made a 6-hour drive out here because the &apos;Worth It&apos; guys had huge positive remarks about this place. I am a huge sucker for anything highly rated by them so here I was ordering the Sul Lung Tang - Beef brisket. I read from a few reviews her eon Yelp that the prices are a bit high, but honestly, this is Los Angles, and with all the freebies that are accompanied by the soup, what do you expect?

I had to order this to go due to Covid. When I opened the bag, I was shocked to see a small live bug roaming around in the bag. No matter, I freed the little guy and worked my way to the soup. I&apos;ve never had Sul Lung Tang before so I had no idea what to expect. It is a refreshing and mildly salty soup but the meat flavors I was expecting was not there. I presume that I am simply comparing this to Pho broth or something. The brisket was an insanely lean cut so it was an incredibly tough bite.

The food itself was just alright. It does not warrant a repeat from me. The &apos;Worth It&apos; guys definitely overhyped the place but it was not like I felt disappointed that I wasted one of my meals here. It was definitely an experience I needed, but next time I need a fix of nicely done meat broth, I&apos;ll stick to pho."
1,"What happened to good customer service? Nonexistent here.  I&apos;ve tried calling to order takeout and was approached by a rude person on the other end.  Our call ended short and not being able to order anything.  So I called again and tried to order..as i was ordering he hung up on me.  Then i called a 3rd time and he picked up and hung up.  
I used to love coming here, as this is across the street from my parents but after today&apos;s experience i definitely will not be back.  There are other sullungtang jips in ktown that have good service and soup."
4,"I was visiting my friends after not seeing them for a long time and requested for Han Bat Sul Lung. My friend said it tastes really good and was happy to pick up the food. Everything was nicely packed.

I ordered the brisket soup and it came with rice and sides. Unfortunately, they did not have purple rice, which is what I usually prefer. Broth was rich and creamy on its own, but I had to add more salt and green onion to enhance the flavor. There&apos;s a lot of brisket and it is very tender. I also like adding rice into the broth to convert it to congee towards the end. 

Definitely a very hearty and satisfying meal. Reminds me of the times when my friends are out in ktown after a night of drinking."
5,"Super authentic and delicious.   It&apos;s definitely one of my favorite go-to in K Town.  Their service is super fast, too, even during the pandemic."
5,"I never knew shul lung tang could ever taste this good.

I ordered the mixed meats with brisket, liver, and all the intestinal varieties. Everything was so tender and flavorful, and the guts were cleaned extremely well. And the broth, twas beyond my expectations. I&apos;ve had this soup many times in Chicago, but this is some next level !

The soup comes with the napa and radish kimchi, which of course stood out clearly. You know a Korean restaurant is good just by tasting the kimchi!

Honestly, if you&apos;re skeptical about trying this place, just bring a Korean friend who never had Han Bat and they will swear this place is legit. A must visit for comfort k-food in k-town!"
5,"YUM! YUMMMMM! YUMMMMMMMY in my TUMMMMY!

If you&apos;re looking for a protein-packed, belly-warming, Korean-soul-food type meal, this is the place. This is the spot.

Sul Lung Tang is the result of boiling ox bone for hours, hours, hours, and more hours to draw out the goodness into a nice, milky, goodness-filled broth. 

The staff here are friendly and will make sure that you get exactly what you need. Sometimes they&apos;re curt when they&apos;re busy, but they don&apos;t mean anything bad by it."
5,"The best sul lung tang I&apos;ve tasted!! My friend and I were inspired to try out Han Bat from a popular Youtuber&apos;s suggestion and we were not disappointed. The soup is very rich and clean, and compared to other sul lung tangs I&apos;ve had, it&apos;s not as salty. The meat is tender and soft. The glass noodles do not swell too much in the soup, which I prefer. The rice is sfot enough that when you dip it in the soup, it doesn&apos;t get too soggy. The kimchi and radishes were also very fresh and flavorful; adding them to the soup elevates the flavors so much! If you&apos;re looking for a hearty meal that isn&apos;t too heavy, this is the best choice."
5,"I came here twice before COVID and this is hands down the best place I go to for sullangtang. I always order the beef brisket and it is super filling. They give you kimchi and radish kimchi along with green onions, salt, and chili pepper paste for you to add into your soup for more flavor because the soup itself is pretty bland. You could adjust the flavor of the soup to your liking. They also include rice on the side soup as well! 

They always have great customer service and always try to make sure that you&apos;re doing okay and if you need anything else. If they&apos;re too busy based on the shortness of staff then please be patient with them as well because the place is pretty small and they&apos;re always  moving around to help everyone. 

Definitely recommend trying this place on cold weather days because it&apos;s the perfect soup to warm you up. Also recommend this as a hangover soup because it&apos;s not as oily and heavy when you want some comfort food!"
5,"Delicious!! I ordered the tongue but also enjoy the brisket. When you order to go, it is nicely packaged with salt, green onions, sides, and rice separated. It was still hot after getting delivered and the portion size is great. Amazing soup!!"
4,"This place has good sul lung tang but I believe its a bit expensive. The broth is nice and flavorful after adding the green onion and salt it comes with but that is my own personal preference. I usually get the intestine, tripe, and spleen option and it is sooo good!!! It comes with kimchi, radish, and rice. It is definitely filling and a decent portion. I usually have a little bit of leftovers that I save for another meal. It tastes just as good heated up later.

I usually order to-go as there was usually a wait there pre-COVID. It is super easy to pick up, they help you quickly and get you out fast which is nice since parking is usually a problem."
5,Hands down the best Beef brisket soup! The prices have gone up a bit but well worth it. Not a fancy place just a mom &amp; pop spot serving good food. Must try if you haven&apos;t!
4,"I love sul lung tang and I think Han bat has one of the best in LA. I purposely drove to Ktown to get Han Bat the other day and made my day when I came home. I ate it the next day which I recommend taking out the meat and and noodles out when you put it in the fridge. In my mind, I feel like the noodles will soak up all the delicious broth so I took out and added them back in when I was boiling everything. It was ask good as I remember. I called 5 mins before picking up and everything was ready to go when I got to the location.

During pandemic-
No sit down but take out is available
Still no credit card and cash only
Parking lot available. (I didn&apos;t see the valet guy when I went)"
3,"I&apos;ve enjoyed coming to this place, and this place only, whenever I craved sul lung tang. But now I feel like I need to find a new spot. 

Their prices have gone up, but quality has gone down. That&apos;s what urks me. If the quality was at least consistent, my rating would&apos;ve been a 4. It just tastes so much more watery...and the kimchi and radish kimchi aren&apos;t as good either. The long waits used to be worth it, but not really anymore."
5,"After eating a lot of greasy/fried/unhealthy food, definitely was craving something more &quot;homey&quot;. 

My friends and I came for breakfast on a weekday and it was pretty empty. We ordered the beef brisket sul lung tang (brisket ox bone soup) and it tasted sooo good and hit the spot. It felt like all the greasy food we were eating were getting washed down and our stomachs were basically resetting (if that makes any sense). Their kimchi radish was probably the best one I&apos;ve ever had and it went so well with the soup. The beef in the soup was soft and tender too. 

Loved it and highly recommend!"
