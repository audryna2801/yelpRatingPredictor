5,"There&apos;s a reason why this place has over 4K reviews. This restaurant really warms my heart, from the service, to the perfect wine recommendation, to mouth watering anchovies, to the crispy pizza crust and more. There&apos;s never a moment that I&apos;m not craving their mushroom pizza!  
Plus, how stinking cute is their outdoor dining during COVID-19?!"
5,"I&apos;m glad I was able to come here before the most recent outdoor dining shutdown. Pizzeria Mozza was one of the LA classics that I&apos;ve wanted to try since I first learned of Nancy Silverton! The outdoor dining setup was great here. They had a back patio that they built with a real floor and two levels. The patio was nicely lit and had a ton of heaters and felt really cozy.

I&apos;m glad to report that the honours are well deserved as the excellent food here has continued to thrive since the opening of Osteria Mozza since 2007. Everything was delicious starting with the chopped salad, that was nicely setup with the acid to cut through some of the fattiness of the main courses. 

The margherita pizza was the best by far and probably some of the best pizza I&apos;ve ever had. Something about the freshness of the basil combined with the flavorful but not too chewy mozzarella and the incredibly crispy dough. The oxtail ragu was also delicious. The sauce was really flavorful and paired well with some homemade pasta. Come visit for some awesome Italian food!"
5,"Best takeout experience I&apos;ve had to date. Pickup time took about 20 min and everything was packaged to keep the food fresh. There were even instructions on if items got cold.

We ordered: 
1. Margherita pizza - Honestly wow. For a simply pizza this was delicious. 
2. Salame pizza - I loved this pizza. The pepperoni was incredible and the sauce had the perfect amount of spice. 
The crust - after living in NYC and being a self-described pizza critic, this dough is the perfect amount of fluffy and thin. Nothing fell apart or off my slices and the doughy crust was so satisfyingly charred. 
3. Butterscotch pudding - Treat yourself. You can thank me later. 

I want to eat everything from here. Like now. I thought I was full but I still want more. Nancy, you are a queen."
5,"Wonderful food and service here. I love the foods. I think they really deserve the Bid Gourmand Michelin rating.  We have been coming here for several years, but never had the chance to do a review. 

This is one of the best LA restaurants and it was featured in one of the Netflix Chef&apos;s table. After watching the show, I had much more appreciation of what&apos;s going on in making their food at the restaurant. They make their food with love here. It really shows in the taste and flavors of the dishes. 

We came here to celebrate our son&apos;s birthday last night and had an amazing experience. We ordered a few appetizers that included a meat ball al Forno, Burratina Pugliese, and a salad to start the evening. The meatballs were amazing. The flavor was right on for me. The Burratina was even better with their in house made cheese, soft, chewy and tasty. 

For main, we ordered a mushroom pizza and two pasta dishes. They were fantastic. I had one of the best pizza experience last night. The pizza was chewy and crunchy. The flavor of the mushroom elevated the pizza taste to another level. 

For the two pastas, we love the work they put into preparing this dish. The Raviolo had an egg inside and when we cut into it, the egg yolk flowed out from the ravioli to create a wonderful dinning experience. 

For dessert, we had the Butterscotch Budino. This was my first time had this delicious dessert. The taste was just amazing. I wondered why I&apos;ve  never ordered  this before. This Butterscotch Budino was a total showstopper in both taste and presentation. It gave a perfecting ending to our evening."
2,"I&apos;m just so disappointed. 

I loved this restaurant for the past 10 years and I probably won&apos;t return. COVID is just not an excuse for anything anymore. If you are going to be open for business and charge the same amount or more for food + drink than I want my experience to be just as good as if it were not Covid. Because... I&apos;d go elsewhere,

The menus from all 3 restaurants are combined eliminating about 100 items from each place. 
Unfortunately my chicken livers were not on menu and neither was the tricolor salad. My 2 fav&apos;s...gone for now. I&apos;m not going to complain about food because it was delicious, but I will certainly complain about the service. 

Our waiter sucked! We ordered drinks* Martinis 
And an app... app came first about 10 minutes before our drinks came. When the bartender delivered our drinks , we said nicely - what happened? He rudely said it was only 7 minutes since he saw the ticket and so... no apology.... just excuses. No acknowledgement... it was weird,
Then we ordered our dinner... got the salad, then pizza.... no meatballs. Waiter never came over to check on us- he never knew we didn&apos;t get part of our dinner. He then brings the dessert menus and we tell him we never got the meatballs and he admitted it was his fault and he didn&apos;t know we wanted them. This was after a whole discussion about us getting the meatballs. Ok... misunderstanding.... he never made up for it...
Cut to receiving bill- Mozza adding an extra $9. Charge for a martini pour? Huh? 
We asked waiter what this was and he went into a whole thing about it. Ridiculous! It would have been better if they just added the 3. To each drink.
He was rude about it and made us feel bad about it saying never once has anyone complained and abruptly walked away.

So we spoke to the manager... no help. We didn&apos;t want anything we just wanted to be heard and understood. He blamed understaffing and Covid !!!
Stop!!

Oh and waiter says yea you have a 90 min time limit so you need to order! We responded ...
Our drinks just came out 15 minutes into sitting down."
5,"Super down to earth

Fair warning, if you&apos;re looking for the same kind of experience as Mozza Newport, this aint it

That said, its a dope spot to drop in for a couple pizzas done to absolute perfection. 

My friends dropped in an hour before the kitchen closed and we stayed until close. I would definitely recommend dropping in and out quickly since most of LA will be waiting outside to try nancy&apos;s expertly made za

One of my fav pizza places and the vibe is just right"
5,"Amazing pizza...and I love pizza!

What a fun place, can&apos;t wait for the &apos;vid to end so I can return to dine in at this awesome spot.

5 stars!"
5,"i remember eating at pizzeria mozza years ago and being absolutely obsessed with the food, atmosphere, and service. after returning again this friday, i can say it lived up to my memory of it and then some. the pizza is perfectly crafted and between the bianca and the spicy salami, i couldn&apos;t tell you which i enjoyed more. all i can say is i won&apos;t wait nearly as long before making my way back again!"
3,"Always have been a fan of Mozza, but this review is just for Mozza2Go...I ordered the Meat Lover and Funghi Misti pizzas for pick-up today, and although they were good pizzas, I was not very impressed. I truly love and support the business, but the pizzas were fairly expensive ($20+), relatively greasy (was very sad about this part), and not very filling. 

I had high hopes as I ate at Mozza before COVID about a year ago, and I loved the pizzas (remembered them being larger than just the four sliced personal pizzas for some reason). I especially loved the egg and bacon pizza - FYI you can&apos;t order this to-go as it is difficult for travel (understandable), but since you can&apos;t order one of their pizzas that I consider to be top notch, I wouldn&apos;t rate Mozza2Go very highly. Maybe I just didn&apos;t try the right pizza - would be happy to hear suggestions about others. 

Still a fan of Mozza in general and love their food, but was slightly let down by their pick-up options in comparison to others I have tried. 

Solid pizza, but I believe just not worth the price at the moment"
5,"All orders are now online only! QR code available at the window but no in person ordering unless &quot;dining in&quot; on the patio at the restaurant. 

Pickup was ready after half hour with a cold bottle of Prosecco. Love the fact that the store is still &quot;open&quot; and I can still pair my fave bottle with a pie. Will definitely be back and hopefully snag some merch. They&apos;re second to none!"
5,"Ordered takeout and I was super pleased with the pizza! Even though we ate the pizza probably about an hour after it was out of the oven, it was still yummy and totally fulfilled my pizza craving! 

We ordered two pizzas: the Bianca and the Meat Lover

The Bianca was my favorite out of the two. I loved the crust to cheese ratio that the pizza had. The sage was a huge plus and really rounded out the flavors of the pizza. I don&apos;t know what else was on here besides the cheese, but these ingredients were oh so yummy and I will definitely order this pizza next time. 

The Meat Lover pizza was also very good. Watch out for the spiciness level because that was a kick that I did not expect! If you are one that loves meat AND loves spice, you&apos;ll love this pizza. 

I would be back to experience their pizza fresh. I saw that they have outdoor seating, so I will be back to try more pizzas!"
5,"This pizza is amazing!! We ordered takeout from online, and it was ready in 30 minutes. The pickup spot is on Melrose Ave, and there is street parking available. 

The pizza itself was fantastic! The crust was crunchy/ chewy and light, but the sauce was the real winner. The tomato sauce was very light and felt very fresh. 

Would definitely go back to try other pizzas!"
5,"Deliberately a multisensory experience with each dish corresponding to a line on the poetically written tasting menu. The ingredients are not necessarily unusual, but their preparation and presentation decidedly are. Nestled on a corner street, inside dining is closed at the moment and reservations are a must for outdoor seating. 

Dining on the patio can be rather hot outside, so make sure to stay hydrated while you eat. Attentiveness of the staff was perfect. With the temperatures were so hot outside, it was easy to get refills, as the staff made sure all drink needs were met. During these times, that&apos;s important.

The food here is visually striking, beautifully executed and remarkably flavorful. Every bite was delicious!"
5,"Great meal, even during COVID. 

Nice menu. Strong wine list. 

Just the usual from Nancy and her team."
3,"After much hype, I finally tried Mozza2go takeout during covid-era...

I ordered the Margherita and the Bianca pizzas.

Good: Pizza didn&apos;t blow me away, but it was good. The flavors were fresh and on point. I liked how the bottom of the pizza still held structure under sauce and cheese without becoming overly soggy or disintegrating.

Bad: For food itself, my chief complaint is the pizza crust. It is too chewy. The pizza was flavorful, yes, but I couldn&apos;t focus on the flavor with all the soreness from my jaw (seriously).

Non-food criticism: My takeout order was 10 min late. Not a huge deal, it happens, but a &quot;hey, it&apos;s going to be a bit longer, sorry for the wait,&quot; would have been nice after waiting for 40 min for 2 pizzas. I ordered through Toast and there wasn&apos;t even a range of times my order would be available. It was just &quot;will be ready at 12:11pm,&quot; like a declaration.

The takeout was also lacking in packaging. The Bianca pizza was drowned in oil--so much so that a significant amount of oil was leaking and dripping through the Bianca pizza box (see photos attached), forming a puddle on the Margherita pizza box below it. The restaurant did not provide napkins or a bag with my order. As luck would have it, the oil also dripped onto my clothes.

Overall: Good flavors in pizza, but literally painful to eat due to the extreme chewiness of the crust. Poor takeout experience.

*edit*--it has been over 24 hours and my jaw is still sore..."
5,"My bf took me here for a low-key birthday celebration. In the midst of a pandemic, the place was packed. I looked around and saw the age range were mostly mid-30&apos;s to early 40&apos;s. Looks like the young and healthy are still out and about, and they chose to come here. Thank goodness we had reservations! 

We ordered the meatballs to share as appetizers, and each ordered our own pizzas. Mine came with  smoked cheese, leeks, nduja (sausage) and egg. It was also the only pizza on the menu that comes in a smaller size so I decided on that. Babe&apos;s pizza came with Prosciutto, Rucola, Tomato &amp; Mozzarella di Bufala. Both were very good! Fresh and flavorful ingredients, but what stood out was the dough and the crust of the pizza. It had that gummy, spongy texture (in a good way) that I really liked! I also noticed the same texture in the bread that came with the meatballs. 

I hadn&apos;t known why he picked this place, but afterwards he had me watch Chef&apos;s Table that features Nancy Silverton who is co-owner of Osteria Mozza, Spacca, Pizzeria Mozza &amp; also founded the La Brea bakery. It made sense why that pizza dough was so unique in taste and texture. I was truly happy I got the experience of dining here. It will probably be one of the last outings in a while, but I&apos;m glad it&apos;s here!"

2020 Yelp 100 Challenge (24/100)
OTM Club 02/09/20-02/15/20

I&apos;m excited for this week&apos;s OTM Club curated pizzas, especially coming back to Pizzeria Mozza... Chef Nancy Silverton &amp; Chef Eric Black (Ugly Drum) teams up for #20 (Ugly Drum pastrami, caraway onion cream, caciocavallo, sauerkraut, pickled mustard seed).

My foodie buddy &amp; I first visited the restaurant over 12+ years ago. The restaurant was soooooo hot that I was calling daily for a fruitless reservation until one of the hostesses took pity on me with a tip: arrive around 5-ish PM &amp; you may be able to grab a seat at the bar. Done! Ivan &amp; I barely waited 10-mins. to be seated &amp; Chef Silverton was at helm that night as we watched her create our pizzas (Bacon, Salame, Fennel Sausage, Guanciale, Tomato, Mozzarella Pizza &amp; Squash Blossoms, Tomato, Burrata Pizza). I tried not to fan-girl over this, but couldn&apos;t help myself. ;-)

Fast forward 12 years later for my 3rd trip, while valet is an option, I decided to find street parking since I came during linner (3-ish PM). There&apos;s supposedly 2 parking lots about a block or two away, but I managed to find a space further down Highland Ave. :-) The restaurant was about 1/2 full, &amp; I asked to sit at the counter so I can watch the action. Once seated, it took about 15-mins. before my order was taken. :-| I redeemed the #20 &amp; added a glass of LIMONATA.

My order came quickly, &amp; it was a thing of beauty... glistening strips of pastrami covering most of the pie. I immediately dug right in... Mmm... Mmm... Mmm... it&apos;s like eating a pastrami sandwich in the form of a pizza. And the Ugly Drum pastrami is tender &amp; flavorful! it was a beautiful marriage of flavors that I can taste each element, the sweet licorice taste of the caraway onion cream, the cheesy sharpness of the caciocavallo, the acidic &amp; sourness of the sauerkraut, &amp; robust spiciness from the pickled mustard seeds. La Brea Bakery is well-known for their amazing breads, so it&apos;s no wonder that the pizza crust is f-a-n-t-a-s-t-i-c! Yum! I would have enjoyed more of the Limonata if it weren&apos;t half full of ice. Still, it was a refreshing drink... just wished I had more than a glass of ice. Bonus: I saw Chef Silverton doing her rounds. That&apos;s 3 for 3!!! :-O How lucky am I? =)

Price points may be considered high for a personal size pizza; however, it might be one of best pizzas that you ever had so it&apos;s worthwhile. Service was better during my 1st 2 trips than this one. There was another guy who sat to my left at the counter &amp; waited forever to put in his order. I shared my water, even though he wanted a drink. When he was finally approached, there was no wine menu so the server ran down a few wines &amp; made a couple of suggestions. Just give the man a menu! In any event, I didn&apos;t want to be delayed &amp; asked for my check while he was leaving to put in the order. It was yet another wait because he forgot about my request &amp; remembered when I hand-signaled him for the check. :-|

I&apos;m a huge fan of Chef Silverton but it&apos;s a considerable trek out here. Still, highly recommended for the delish pizzas &amp; desserts!

Highly Recommended: #20, Bacon, Salame, Fennel Sausage, Guanciale, Tomato, Mozzarella Pizza, &amp; Squash Blossoms, Tomato, Burrata Pizza, Limonata."
5,"Someone say brunch?  ok, they are open, but limited seating during covid.  Reservations recommended.  I liked the balcony seating overlook. 
 I&apos;ve heard they&apos;re sticklers for being prompt (though I can&apos;t confirm).  Let&apos;s begin with a peach champagne....or two.   Excellent.  on to the first pizza:  Ugly Drum Pastrami.  It wasn&apos;t &quot;ugly.&quot;  That&apos;s just what it&apos;s called.  consists of: caraway onion cream, caciocavallo &amp; egg.  Pastrami was unbelievably tender and flavorful, and when grabbing a slice, letting some egg run amok onto it, fantastic!  next, Gravlax pizza:  horesradish creme fraiche, red onions, caperberry relish &amp; dill.  The dill may be the star here, combined with the texture of the lax, it all works.   The crust on their pizza is nothing short of flavor art.  How do they make it both flaky, thin, and firm, all at the same time??!  Nancy&apos;s egg salad on bagna cauda toast was also excellent.  Nancy&apos;s Ceaser salad (deconstructed), yum, yum yum.  Until next time..."
5,"No wonder this joint is so popular.  Food, atmosphere, staff and the pizza and beer special all an AAA+.  My daughters always want to eat there when they come into town.  When my youngest went off to college in Vermont it was the last place she ate before leaving for school."
3,"Came here on a Saturday night with some friends and we had high expectations for the pizza, especially because of the prices. We got 3 pizzas, (each were $22-$28 per pizza) which came in 4 slices, and though they were good, they weren&apos;t mind blowing and we just could not justify the price for the size of the pizza (10&quot;). The fennel sausage was the best one, then the Meyer lemon/parsley, then the anchovy pizza. 

The pizzas are cooked in a wood-fire oven which gave it a nice charred texture, and we also got the sparkling white wine which was just OK, the sommelier talked it up but we felt it didn&apos;t live up. Our server though was great and was very hospitable! The dessert was what really stood out for us and if we would come back for anything, it would be the dessert. We got the olive oil, peanut butter, and passion fruit lime gelato and every flavor was to die for and so decadent. We loved it! That was what really saved the night. Overall, I think you can get better gourmet pizza for the right price elsewhere, so sad to say, this was a miss for us. 

Very rustic and charming restaurant though, we enjoyed the ambiance very much."
