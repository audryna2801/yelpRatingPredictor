5,"Checked Yelp for a new spot close To where I was at and came across the Dirt Dog.  Not the most appealing name but it did catch my eye so I gave it a try.  Busy spot in a busy parking lot. Enforcing the mask rules etc.  I waited in line outside and a young lady came out and took our orders which made things move along a little more efficiently. Once people inside left, they would let people from the line come in and wait. 

I decided on the chili dog on a pretzel bun with some garlic fries. When I went to pay, the churro was just too appealing so I had to add one for desert.  Got my food in a reasonable amount of time considering the current situation and the amount of people here so no complaining from me on that. 

I decided the proper was to enjoy a Dirt Dog was to set up my table for one, the trunk of my car, in the shadows of the downtown LA skyscrapers.   Unwrapped everything and was pleased with the looks and portion size. 

The food was great. The fries were really crispy and not overpowered with garlic. The bacon wrapped dog, chili, cheese, and mustard went well on the pretzel bun and the churro was fantastic. Hard to f up a churro but the horchata dip really made it. 

All in all, definitely want to go back and try some more. Maybe the pastrami dog"
5,"The best hot dogs I&apos;ve ever eaten that&apos;s for sure! My fianc√© went to USC so we went to check out this place. It&apos;s located in a shopping center with VERY limited parking (and it&apos;s always so busy even during COVID). Literally anything on the menu is tasty. I got the hot Cheeto version and it was then that I realized why it was called Dirty Dog lol it was all over me. The elote fries were almost as good as the corn from the elote man that be coming through in the hood so they get props for that. If you were looking for a place where you can take family from out of town this is definitely a good spot for that. The location, atmosphere and food is LA in a nutshell."
5,"Great food, pick up was fast, can&apos;t wait to go back, you can tell they are proud of what they serve! Keep up the great work guys, really appreciated! I would have given 6 stars if I could"
5,"Recommend: The Elote Dog and Dirty Chili Dog

I still can&apos;t believe myself for never trying this place before! I&apos;ve completely underestimated this place and thought - how good can a hot dog be? I&apos;ve had Dog Haus before and wasn&apos;t too impressed with it besides their Hawaiian bread. But Dirt Dog is a literal GAME. CHANGER. Came here on a Friday night, and there was a line outside the door. Inside is spacious for ordering and waiting - not crowded at all, and there is a man who comes in and out to let the next party in. 

I ordered the Elote Dog, my partner the Dirty Chili Dog, and we shared the filthy fries. We devoured everything by the time we settled back into the car - everything was just incredible. My Elote dog was juicy and smokey, pairing perfectly well with the soft lobster bread, sweet corn, and parmesan cheese. So. good. I had a bite of the dirty chili dog and loved it as well - but the Elote is just a little better! Filthy fries come topped with guac, chipotle aioli, cheese, and bacon - which made a perfect end to our meal! You&apos;ll DEFINITELY have a food coma after this, but it&apos;s so worth it! Can&apos;t wait to come back again soon!"
5,"Couple days ago I was dropping off a friend nearby and saw this place called &quot;Dirt Dog&quot; and I had to check it out, staff was really friendly, loved that. 
The food was delicious , especially the garlic fries, the flavor in them were soooooo good.
Definitely  will come back for a 2nd time and a 3rd etc etc.."

 Stay hungry and eat delicious, foodie friends!!"
5,"Let me tell you something, Dirt Dog @ 11pm when you loaded HIT DIFFERENT! I got a bacon wrapped hotdog on a butter toast! LORD, delicious. The fries were really good as well! There were SOOO MANY menu options, I just had to keep it simple. Next time ima venture out &amp; try something a bit crazier! Also the decor is so cool! Dollar bills w/ handwritten notes &amp; stickers EVERYWHERE! So if you got a business/Stickers bring it to display w/ ALL the others! Customer service was cool, staff really were peppy &amp; helpful! Definitely Recommend! ENJOY."
4,"Ok why am I the last one to know about this place?! This is a trendy hot dog place but more messier and bigger portions! Sooo what&apos;s not to love?! 

I did order a few items from every category. And I wasn&apos;t disappointed at all! From hot Cheetos on the hot dog and corn on a stick, to pastrami and chili cheese on the fries and hot dog. It is all amazing! Even the hot dog itself wasn&apos;t gross, and I didn&apos;t have that after feeling of nausea. On the hot dogs itself, you can even pick between three different types of bread! 

I love this place so much that I told my best friend about this place! And she told me that she already knew about it. Thanks friend lol. To go, dine in, it all doesn&apos;t matter. It&apos;s all great and I can&apos;t wait to go back and try the entire menu!"
4,"Came here a few weeks ago to see what the hype was about, and I was not disappointed! Tried the snoop&apos;s dog, dirty chili dog, DUI fries, horchata ice cream and fried Oreos. Dirty chili dog was better than the snoop&apos;s as it had more flavor. Horchata ice cream was amazing, with all those toppings/crunch, and the fried Oreo, . It is pricy though- will definitely come back when I&apos;m near the area again."
5,"Was pretty hesitant to come back, but it was worth going on a weekday opposed to a busy weekend. The staff were happy to look into my complaints and tried their best to accommodate. I suggest trying the lobster bread for a taste of toast! The food portions were a lot more with the different bread. The garlic fries were really good as well, they gave us their own spicy ketchup that tasted pretty tangy. Would like to come back to try their other fries. 

But the best thing to get is the horchata ice cream. Super creamy. The toppings complimented the ice cream. It was the surprise of the night. 

Also want to thank Stephanie and Jose for their friendly service. Really appreciated how instead of shoving everyone in the store, they keep everyone socially distant from each other with a capacity number. 

Great visit! 5/5 service"
4,"This place is SOLID, I just wish it wasn&apos;t so far away. Parking lot is small and line can get long, but lots of great things to try.  The bf and I shared a Dirty Esquite and Dirty Fries and both ordered Pastrami Dogs.

* With such a meat heavy meal, the Dirty Esquite was some welcome sweetness. Be sure to squeeze lime on top of it and mix it up before digging in!

* Dirty Fries were fine. The seasoning didn&apos;t have the kick I was expecting it to, but it was served with spicy ketchup, which helped fill out its profile.

* Pastrami Dogs were LOADED. It&apos;s a LOT of meat. I wish this thing had more pickles to balance it out, but it was def delicious. Could not breathe afterwards hahah.

Probably the only reason I have this at 4 stars versus 5 is that I&apos;m not a hot dog person haha but that said, these were pretty good. And if anyone would ask, I&apos;d definitely recommend!

p.s. here&apos;s a little YouTube vid we made of our visit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhzbuBBPVug"
4,"I&apos;ve been wanting to try this place for awhile and finally had a chance to go... This places has really good reviews and is pretty popular in LA, the reason I hadn&apos;t tried it sooner is because I&apos;m not a huge fan of hotdogs... But let me tell you, I was definitely please by Dirt Dog&apos;s .... They have a good variety of hot dogs, and you can choose from different types of breads as well... 

Since it was my first time going I asked the worker for some recommendations and he was very helpful. I ordered the  Pastrami Dog, Mutt dog, carne asada fries, and fried Oreos... I don&apos;t like pastrami so I didn&apos;t taste that hot dog, but they said it was delicious. I tasted the Mutt dog which is half green sauce and half red sauce, I was expecting it to be kinda spicy but it wasn&apos;t... It was pretty flavorful and had a good combination of ingredients... The carne asada fries were good the meat was a little to dry and flavorless for me but the French fries with cheese and guc were good... My favorite part was the deep fried Oreo, I couldn&apos;t wait to get home and taste it so I ate it on the car ride... Lol.. It was still hot so it melted in my mouth and taste like heaven... 

Overall I give this place 4 stars, the food is good it&apos;s just over priced.. I ended up spending almost $50 for 2 hotdogs, carne asada fries and the deep fried Oreos... The location is close to the freeway but the area can be a bit scary at night... They are open during COVID for to go orders and taking safety precautions... 

If I&apos;m ever in the area I would go back for more deep fired Oreos and to try some of the other treats they offer."
5,"I&apos;ve never heard of this place until my friend offered me to get some snack here and we stopped by. Since than I never miss out on a chance to get some delicious hot dogs or corn when I end up in the area. Of course sometimes the line and wait is long and parking gets tough, so I have to plan my trip in advance, but my biggest issue when I come here is to choose whether it&apos;s gonna be a hot dog or corn and usually I end up ordering both. Joking. ALWAYS I take them both. Each time I hope something will go wrong and I will say good bye to this dirty dog, but no way, sorry dude, here is your delicious food and see you soon. 
I would recommend to try everything here, as every single item is to drool for! My favs are Elote dog and Flaming corn. Filthy fries are also amazing.
You Must try it if you haven&apos;t."
5,"I want to say off that bat that if you love LA, you will love the feel and look of this place. I personally was blown away with the dogs themselves, but I love the look and dedication this place puts in to making this a local sight. I think that alone should put this place higher than most. That being said, I did enjoy the food. I got a couple items and I think they had some great loaded fries and esquite options. I appreciate that they are doing their own thing and mix of combinations. I&apos;m adding this to my must go to spots for people who come to visit and I think this place should be on more recognitive grounds. I will definitely come back and bring others. Thank you, dirt dog."
5,"My mom had been pushing this restaurant recommendation on me for how long, and I&apos;m personally not one to seek out hot dogs. But my mom is trusted foodie, so I tagged along.

The hot dogs here are of another level. We got a Mutt Dog and a House Dog, but there are so many options for different tastes. It was hard for me to decide, but I opted for what seemed to be the house specialty.

I remembered having a sweet, helpful cashier who took my order. Emotional labor is hard work, but she made me feel right at home. I also remembered having a really kind and busy waiter.

Grab a table if you&apos;re lucky. This place was packed when we got here, the line out the door. We were fortunate enough to witness people emptying their table, allowing us to swoop in and claim it.

I also wanted to try deep fried Oreos because I&apos;ve never had them, and they serve them here. The Oreos are absolutely delicious, but when are Oreos not delicious?"
5,"Was craving a hot dog and came across Dirt Dog on Yelp, so I decided to give it a try. The parking lot was a bit cramped since the Popeyes is in the same plaza and the line starts building up traffic in the parking lot, which is already small. The parking lot was pretty littered but parking wasn&apos;t hard to find since most of the traffic was for the Popeyes. 

The aesthetics of Dirt Dog is pretty cool - they have a mural on the back wall and the side wall was filled with dollar bills, various art, and lots of personality too! We ordered the Elote Fries (~$7), House Dog (~$7), and Pastrami Dog (~$8-9). Within 15 minutes, our order was ready! If you&apos;ve seen my pictures, it&apos;s needless to say how good the food was! The Elote fries were on point! Both hot dogs were filling and satisfying to eat. Definitely want to come back to try the other items on the menu!"
5,Coming back for the second time was soo much better and the management clearly cares about customer service. Thank you Stephanie! Will be back again!
4,"Me and my boyfriend hit up this poplar spot and decided to try it out for dinner. My boyfriend order the Snoop Dogg with Pretzel bread. I order the House Dog with Lobster bread, Fries - Sea Salt and Pepper, Two Churo and two Fountain drink&apos;s. When the cashier said your total was $35.68 I was shock and just wanted to get out of there. 
After dinner I take look at my receipt and notice they charge .25 cent for the pretzel bread and lobster bread was .50 cent more! I knew the price when I order but didn&apos;t expect them to charge me an extra fee for a hot dog bun?! C&apos;mon now? Really Was it worth buying? Yes Would I come back? Umm  I don&apos;t know maybe for the churos  than again they over price 2.50 for one order"
