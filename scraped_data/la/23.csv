5,"I think this is the best Ramen i&apos;ve ever had so far. I even have visited Tokyo one time in my life. I only tasted the classic this time, i am looking forward to visiting more often now.

- the classic :$13.99 the broth is very deep, I believe it boiled for a long time to make this. Though it&apos;s pork broth, it&apos;s not oily or greesy at all. I didn&apos;t add any additional toppings but it was so good as served 
- I went to 11:20am sunday morning. They open at 11:30am so i was the first one. They have long two table. Party of 2, 2 group can sit each side. They use the divider which makes me felt more comfortable from others. As this place is popular, expect to wait in line unless you go before open time.
- there are up to 10 cars parking spots but it share s with other store in the plaza, i was lucky to find one spot left. You may have to stroll the neighborhood to find a parking spot.
- the server was very kind! 
- they also have togo only store nearby if you are gonna to-go.

Writing this, my mouth is getting watery. I will definitely go back for this classic ramen!"
5,"I stopped by here on a Thursday morning, hoping to beat the lunch crowd. Pre-Covid, the line was always too long. I ordered takeout as they were setting up to open the outdoor dining area. The Tsukemen with melt in your mouth pork was so delicious! The crispy chicken karaage, shrimp tempura and California rolls were also extra tasty. Sorry here are no photos as the food was gone in 60 seconds!"
5,"I&apos;ve heard of this place several times and I&apos;ve seen their new location in K-town but last night was my first time trying it and I was very impressed. For Japanese style ramen my usual go to spot is Daikokuya however I was in the area and Little Tokyo was a bit far for me so I decided to try this place out since the weather was a bit chilly and ramen sounded like it would hit the spot..anddd it did. 

Location: This place is in a sort of plaza on a busy street and the store isn&apos;t that big so you gotta keep an eye out for it or you&apos;ll miss it. 

Parking: Parking here is VERY limited to begin with and now with all the other shops including silverlake ramen using part of the parking lot as their outdoor dining it is even more limited so I suggest coming early or be prepared to wait for a parking spot. 

Covid precautions: From what I can tell this venue follows all the CDC guidelines. The tables were nicely spread apart and the staff all wore face masks and gloves. 

Venue: So their outdoor seating is also very limited. There were 4 tables which seats 2 people each and there is also the high-top bar seating area which seat about 4 people. When I got there there wasn&apos;t too many people waiting to dine in, mostly pick ups so we got lucky, but as we were leaving there was a line waiting for a table. 

Food: The food was very good for a spot thats not as popular or well known as Daikokuya and the price isn&apos;t that expensive either. We got 2 Shoyu ramen and a crispy rice with spicy tuna. The crispy rice with spicy tuna is only 2 pieces but they are BIG pieces, about like 2 bites worth. the crispy rice wasn&apos;t too hard, just the right amount of crunch to it. Now to the main part, the ramen. The ramen here was very delicious for a place thats not too expensive. Broth was very filling but not too heavy, the pork was sooo tender you could break it apart with your chopsticks just by grabbing on them. The quantity is just the right amount of broth and noodles and meat. There is always the option to add more noodles or meat if it isn&apos;t enough for you. 

Overall: I would definitely come here again and I would recommend it to anyone to is looking for an affordable ramen place with the same quality as the other more popular and more expensive places."
5,"Yes. Yummy. Glad I ventured here again. It&apos;s been years since I&apos;ve been here and I&apos;m so glad I was in the mood for ramen. Got the dipping ramen and *drool*. The pork was beyond tender. The broth was flavorful and I&apos;m very proud of myself for remembering to order extra noodles so I could use my extra broth to eat dinner #2 tonight. Yay. #BallinOnABudget

While I upgraded my meal to do the chicken bowl/salad addition I didn&apos;t need it. The bowl was... fine. Won&apos;t order it again but glad I got it. Also the salad definitely has onions in it so if you&apos;re onion averse like my sister avoid it!"
5,"Believe the hype. One of my go-to for Japanese-style ramen, and been visiting here multiple times over the past few years. Everyone who I took here agrees the pork belly is so AMAZING: crispy, juicy, tasty, and most importantly, satisfying. My favorite dish to order is pork broth ramen plus extra pork on the side and an extra serving of noodles. 

For ambiance, I love the bar setup, so I get to watch the chef cook my dish that is served quickly. I suggest going earlier to beat the long lines as you already know I wouldn&apos;t say I like to wait. 

Also, I tried to go Silverlake ramen down the street, but I like this one better. Customer service here is solid.

There is a small parking lot as well as street meter parking. What are you waiting for go right now!"
3,"It was not too bad. In fact, overall it could have been very good. But I ordered - as one would expect - online, was given an earliest time when things would be ready. It should be noted that it was a comparably big order. When I came even a bit early, unfortunately, everything must have been ready for quite some time as all the stuff was cold. Sure, microwave can fix it, but that&apos;s really not the idea as I could otherwise buy a frozen dinner somewhere to the same effect. 
Anyway, cold as it was, it was overall good, balanced, lacking a bit pepp and spirit. ... and the cucumber crab salad was cucumbers with at most two microstrips of imitation crab meat - seriously?"
5,"I have been to all three silverlake ramen locations all of them are good! the parking may be hard to find but love love the food here and the service is great!
You need to try their chicken karaage it&apos;s super crispy! It has a sweet teriyaki sauce drizzled on top and I asked for the spicy mayo on the side but the sauces go really well with the chicken. They really know how to used their fryer cause their gyoza is also good it&apos;s super crispy."
4,"I&apos;ve driven past this place a hundred times and am always shocked by how there&apos;s a huge line at all times of the day. I was curious by all this hype, but definitely not wanting to wait in a line that long for ramen.

Enter the pandemic and a ramen craving.  Silverlake Ramen was on doordash, so here was my chance to try it without a line.  A bit pricey after all the delivery fees

Now, I know having it delivered is not the same as having it hot and fresh, so I am taking that into account.  I was not disappointed. The broth was flavorful and thick and the noodles the perfect consistency. I would have like a bit more &quot;stuff&quot; in the broth as it felt like it was mostly ramen and broth and it&apos;s not something that I would wait in a long line for, but it was very good."
5,"When you&apos;re willing to wait over an hour plus for even take out you know it&apos;s good!  My faves- chicken karage and the spicy tuna crunch 
All the ramens have been good I usually go with spicy"
5,"The ramen was pretty good, although I wish it was spicy. It did have a spice level but the spicy was not spicy enough. The ghost pepper kimchi was not spicy. The pork in the ramen was good and the egg was creamy. Overall a good portion for a late lunch and your recommend!"
3,"Wait time was about 30 mins for our party of 2 on a Saturday evening around 6. 

Seating is pretty tight and can feel uncomfortable with the close proximity of the table next to you. You can hear every word of your neighbors. Not ideal for a dine in restaurant for me. 

I&apos;m big on Tsukemen and that was exactly what I ordered with pork and with bamboo shoots.  This ramen was hard to eat. The broth was brought out in a small bowl while the noodles and toppings were heaped highly on a plate.  I couldn&apos;t finish my meal because my hands were getting tired of lifting the noodles and dipping it in the broth. This could of have been a better experience if the noodles and toppings were served in a bowl. Taste wise the broth was thick and flavorful but had more of a fishy taste than pork. There could have been a better balance of the two. 

My fianc√© however enjoyed his Blaze Ramen quite a bit. I had a few sips and it was pretty tasty it with a nice kick."
5,This place is amazing. I never knew Ramen could be so good. The noodles and the broth is incredible. I&apos;ve tried a few other ramen places and this is by far the best. I&apos;m addicted. I take all my friends and family here and they all love it as well
1,Why do you fucking always forget the drinks we order and pay for?!?!? What the fuck!!!! Youre taking money from customers but not giving them what they ordered!!!!
5,"Lucky for me the wait wasn&apos;t outrageous so I finally tried this place. Definitely lived up to my expectations. Got there just in time for the lunch deal. 13$ for starter, soup, and rice bowl-score! 
The portions are smaller of course, but so fulfilling. 
To start I got the edemame, soup I got the spicy tonkatsu, and chicken rice bowl.
Chicken rice bowl came out before the soup so I was already somewhat stuffed. It was soo flavorful! 
The soup was also very flavorful and the pork belly was nice and soft, better than what I&apos;ve had at other ramen places. 
Will come back for more"
4,"I am a big fan of the ramen and Soboro bowl especially, the only reason that I am not giving a full five stars is because I tried the mabo tofu bowl recently and it was underwhelming to say the least.  Wrong ingredients, bland flavors, I wouldn&apos;t recommend it to anyone honestly.  I still love their other menu items but to anyone reading this I would firmly recommend you to steer clear of the mabo tofu bowl."
5,"This bowl is my favorite, it&apos;s a must try. You won&apos;t regret it! It&apos;s always fresh and super flavorful, the best!!"
5,"I love this place! The broth is great &amp; the pork is super crispy/yummy, and I don&apos;t really eat meat! I always add a side of tofu and it&apos;s the perfect meal. 
Service is fast, friendly, and they always have my order ready when they say they will. 
Order the pork! You won&apos;t regret it."
4,"Came on a perfect light rainy night for trying out Silverlake Ramen for the first time! I highly recommend using Yelp&apos;s waitlist program to help make the wait a little more tolerable. This side of Sunset Blvd is challenging when it comes to finding parking so we like to place our names through Yelp once we are on the street. 

I didn&apos;t get a chance to read any reviews or recommendations so for my first time, I ordered spicy tonkatsu ramen which is not too spicy. The creamy broth goes well with the generous slice of pork belly and dig in, because there is half a hard boiled egg. It&apos;s a good serving of a classic style ramen.

Crispy rice topped with spicy salmon is also one of my favorite dishes and this place has it as well. I can come here, order just two servings of those and will be content.

Service was quick, efficient and friendly. The place is small and popular so try not to sit around and socialize for too long. 

For my first visit, 4 stars."
3,The food is so good the only thing they got to be careful went they are making the food today I almost eat a piece of metal that came in my soup ramen
3,"&quot;Oh.&quot;

That was my first thought when I had the first bite of my ramen. 

Despite the awesome raving reviews, I can&apos;t help but think that it&apos;s just overhyped.

I got The Blaze which is the spicy tonkatsu ramen with pork belly. I may have went on a bad day? The broth was rich but tasteless. The chashu/pork belly meat was pretty good, soft, and flavorful. The noodles were nothing impressive. A plus is that the portions were pretty big. It could definitely fill up people who&apos;ve waited almost 2 hours ;) 

Speaking of wait times...their yelp waitlist system is a little inaccurate. The wait was up to 70 minutes when I signed up for a party of 2 &amp; estimated time to be seated was between about 6:15-6:30pm on a Friday night, but we weren&apos;t seated until around 7pm. Not a big deal because I expected to wait a while anyways. 

Service was good! The host and servers were all super friendly.

The parking situation is annoying. It&apos;s valet only which is $5. After 90 minutes, they charge you $7. So you definitely have to pay the $7 because the wait itself is 90 minutes. I heard they only do this when the plaza is poppin&apos; (so likely on nights and weekends). Also it&apos;s not even technically &quot;valet&quot; because they had me park my own car lol. So you&apos;re just paying for a space to park. I just hate LA parking situations.

Overall, it&apos;s worth a try if you&apos;re in the area but it&apos;s personally not my bowl of ramen!"
