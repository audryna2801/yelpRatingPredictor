5,"Man, where do I start

I&apos;ve heard about this spot from a friend who is originally from Philly and this was his go to &quot;cheesesteak&quot; spot. Then I saw the owner on &quot;Fxck that&apos;s delicious!&quot; 

This is one of the few spots I&apos;ve been to since the pandemic and they certainly do their best to make sure you&apos;re distances and served efficiently. Gotta love that about good service

My order was the beef dip with Swiss and the pork dip with Swiss. I really wish I had doubled my order because those two sandwiches were gone faster than I could name the place two times fast. 

My buddies got the beef and pastrami dip with Swiss and they also loved these masterpieces

Overall one of my favorite experiences with grab and go greatness

4,"Been here a handful of times, but this past weekend was the first in a long while. Missing the old / cheaper prices, it&apos;s still pretty good quality for an historical restaurant that has been in business for over 100 years!

Got the pork dipped once, but next time I&apos;m doing double (or wet) so I can get both sides. A little on the smaller side, but they put ample meat inside and it was tasty, simple and satisfying. There are PLENTY of choices of sides. Tried the pickled beets and they were really good. There&apos;s also a different soup for every day. They&apos;re doing outdoor dining for covid but it&apos;s still not too safe in LA so got take away instead (and the food was still warm and yummy 20 minutes later). There was a line but it went fairly quickly and staff were nice and in good spirits.

Right across the street from Olvera St. and walking distance from Chinatown / Union Station / Little Tokyo (they do have their own lot across, but if you&apos;re exploring town then it&apos;s probably best to find a general parking lot nearby). A solid choice when you want french dips / American food in this area."
4,"I&apos;ve now made several visits to Philippe the Original, which legend has it is known for originating the &quot;French Dip&quot; sandwich in 1908.  Despite the fact that I&apos;ve eaten a number of different French Dip sandwiches, I&apos;ve never had one quite like this. 

For starters, Philippe the Original is inside Chinatown.  It looks and seems a lot like a tourist trap.  Don&apos;t be discouraged by appearances though - PTO actually serves a completely legit French Dip sandwich.

-------------------------------------------------
THE COVID-19 EXPERIENCE:

Prior to COVID-19, no matter when you came here it would be crowded, but the line usually moved pretty quickly.  There wasn&apos;t any table service - you went up to the counter to order and pay, then you ate your food at large communal tables.

During COVID-19, Philippe&apos;s is no longer able to offer outdoor or indoor dining due to city restrictions.  The only options available are delivery (via one of the 3rd party services) or takeout.
-------------------------------------------------

There are many different choices for meat.  Pork is the default; other options include pastrami, turkey, ham, beef, and lamb.  You can also choose any one of the many different types of bread.  I went with the default &quot;French&quot; role.  Prices range between seven and ten dollars, with cheese costing extra.  The sandwich is served pre-dipped; when you order you can request the number of times you&apos;d like the dipping to be done.

Tip: At Philippe&apos;s, cash is King.  Yes, you can pay with your credit card but if you do, they&apos;ll charge a $2 fee.  Cash tips are also strongly encouraged.

What does the French Dip taste like?  The meat tastes amazing!  The flavor profile made by the dip and the seasoning was like a symphony coming to a crescendo in my mouth :-)

On the down side, I wasn&apos;t at all impressed with the bread.  Next time I come to Philippe the Original, I&apos;m going to experiment with some of the other bread options available.

Parking Tip: Next to the restaurant there&apos;s a free parking lot.  There&apos;s another across the street."
2,"This is a nostalgia spot.  This is not the best beef dip in 2021.  Long story short buy the mustard, a tshirt,  and make your own sandwich at home.  The mustard is the bestest of spicy mustards and i dont really like them.

Long story:
The bread is mass produced Sysco stuff doesn&apos;t matter which bread you get.  The au jus is flavorless hot salty water and meat was simply texture.  Pickled egg was flavorless and rubbery. Everything was bland, macaroni salad and potato salad.  The lemonade is Minute Made powder stuff.  I was not impressed.  Maybe this is just a reflection of having to adjust to serving during covid times, I might give them another try when operations are back to normal.

The best thing about the food is Phillipe&apos;s mustard.  THAT had some flavor and a nice clear your sinus kick!  But it was the ONLY thing with flavor!

It is a cute place, old phone booths that don&apos;t work, kitsch, historical news clippings, photos, lots of old skool dine in charm... they even have a candy counter, some of that inventory is starting to get stale.  We got cherry life savers that were soft, which happens when they sit on the shelf too long.

Service is nice, efficient, but there is always a line.  Our queue position was at the front door, with social distancing, and it took 40 mins to get to the counter.  Once there ordering and food prep were quick.  They sanitize the counter between customers and everyone is wearing masks.   They currently 2/2021 have a large spacious outdoor dining set up under a tent with sanitation between customers. 

Parking is still plentiful. You can also order ahead and skip the line."
5,"Philippe&apos;s! The name should be enough for this review but Yelp mandates I write more. 

An LA staple and icon of comfort food and delis in the LA area. Philippe&apos;s has been serving it up the same way since my grandfather&apos;s time. From their sandwiches, to their chili, to their famous pickled eggs- it all hits the spot. 

My go to favorite is a Beef Dip w/Swiss double dipped, a cup of chili w/ beans, a pickle, and a side of pickled eggs."
5,"Been coming here since I was much younger.  So glad they have not changed their recipe.  A beef sandwich double dipped is melt in your mouth scrumptious for $9.25. A cup of their chili and will be $3.50.  And don&apos;t get me started on the cole slaw, so good, $1.80.  Don&apos;t forget a kosher dill pickle at $1.70. Lemonade is .90 and iced tea $1.20.
Now for the service. Cristina was cheerful, courteous, and very professional when it comes to preparing the meal to go.  It is so nice to deal with someone with such a positive attitude.  More people should be like her.
Highly recommend this establishment for your French Dip cravings!!!"
4,"I love me a good roast beef sandwich. I heard about this place recently and apparently it is a staple for dip sandwiches in LA. They had very good customer service, speedy and socially distanced lines. I like that they prepare your order at the counter while you wait so there&apos;s no awkward waiting next to people while you try and keep your distance. 

The sandwich itself was good but it wasn&apos;t amazing but it was better than a chain sandwich place. The macaroni salad was a little bland. The customer service is amazing though, everyone was so nice and speedy."
4,"Some people may not agree with this review, but that&apos;s ok...

I get that Philippe&apos;s has been around since 1908 and it&apos;s a Los Angeles icon but the food is good...not great.  I would say it&apos;s in line with Pink&apos;s Hot Dog; they aren&apos;t great but to say you ate at the original just makes it a little better.

We went all out with two double-dipped sandwiches - pork and lamb.  Got a side of pickled beets, a pickled egg and a slice of carrot cake...That&apos;s not all...A cup of cream of broccoli soup and a bowl of beef stew!

That&apos;s a lot of food for two people.  Unfortunately with COVID we had to bring it home, which wasn&apos;t too far away.  Everything was still warm after our 12 minute drive home. The lamb was &quot;lamby&quot; tasting and I knew that going in so I got it with Swiss cheese.  It wasn&apos;t as tender as I imagined. I guess not a lot of people order the lamb. The pork was still juicy and fatty and good!  The pickled stuff was ok and nothing to write home about.  Eating a purple egg was kinda fun!  The cream of broccoli tasted like cream of broccoli and the beef stew tasted like vegetable soup with chunks of beef in it.  I was expecting more of a gravy type consistency.

We ate all of this with a side of truffle chips to add to the cornucopia of flavors.  Lastly...the carrot cake...Very small piece and ehhhh...

Good for Instagram and Facebook check in but not going to eat here too often...

Will I Return? Maybe when the Dodgers start up again!"
5,"I am an absolute sucker for places like Philippe.

It really reminds me of Katz Deli in New York where you go up to a counter and then can order some delicious sandwiches with amazing sides--and don&apos;t forget the pickles. Absolutely necessary.

Philippe has amazing french dip; I love getting the bread nice and soggy with two dips and a swirl then taking a big bite followed up with a crunch of a pickle and a spoonful of potato salad all downed shortly after with a swig of lemonade. Man, I miss it.

I&apos;ve been here after a Dodgers game and there really is nothing like the vibe of the place. Obviously now you can&apos;t dine in, but I still would recommend takeout because the food is actually good.

Parking is easy since they have an overflow lot, by the way. 

I hope this LA establishment never leaves."
1,"I called ahead of time before placing an order to confirm that their meats are fully cooked and not pink. I was told they weren&apos;t. I said, okay, because I&apos;m pregnant, so I&apos;m not allowed to have undercooked meat. They said it wasn&apos;t an issue, that all their meats are fully cooked and not pink.

Great! So I ordered a dry sandwich with Jack cheese. I get home (to the valley) and this meat is guess what color... PINK! See pics for proof.

I called and spoke with the manager, this is how the conversation went:
Me- &quot;Hi, I just placed an order with you for curbside pickup. Before I placed the order I called to make sure that your meats are fully cooked and are not pink.&quot;
Him- &quot;Our meats are fully cooked.&quot; 
Me- &quot;Well, I&apos;m looking at a sandwich with pink meat, and I can&apos;t eat that.&quot;
Him- &quot;If you called us ahead of time we&apos;d be happy to make modifications.&quot;
(Mind you - their menu on their site days that they decline modifications)
Me- &quot;I did call ahead of time and I was told that your meats are fully cooked. I called because I&apos;m pregnant and not allowed to eat undercooked meat. That it could potentially kill the baby inside me.&quot;
Him- &quot;I&apos;m not a doctor, but I work with a lot of kids. Our sandwiches are safe to eat.&quot;

..... for real?! This conversation looped like this for five minutes. I ended up getting off the phone.

I will never come back here after an experience like this."
5,"THE ORIGINAL. 

This spot is an LA staple, a legend, and a destination in itself. My husband loves French dip sandwiches, so we&apos;ve been a number of times. A Philippe sandwich never disappoints. There&apos;s a reason it&apos;s been around for more than 100 years - they&apos;re consistent, and consistently good. 

I&apos;m not much of a sandwich person, but I&apos;m obsessed with their pickles. So good, so well-balanced, and so crunchy! Perfect."
4,"Let me start by saying, I am not originally from Los Angeles. Therefore, please base my review on that note. 
It is my first time trying Philippe&apos;s after living here in LA for several years. Hey, it&apos;s better late than ever, right? 
I must say, I don&apos;t understand what the big deal is about the sandwich. It is definitely overrated and I understand it may be because it&apos;s an LA staple. 
So here is my honest review: The place is very well organized as far as COVID safety goes. They have a good system in place when ordering. 
I ordered the beef dip sandwich and I asked for cheddar cheese. I didn&apos;t know what to expect. I thought the cheese would be melted but it&apos;s just a slice of cold cheese inside the sandwich. My friend who is an LA native said that usually you shouldn&apos;t ask for cheese! Haha My bad! I was also expecting a side of dill pickles, but it didn&apos;t come with it. I guess it&apos;s something you have to order as well. 
My friend had a side of chili cheese and she swears it&apos;s the best she&apos;s had, so give it a try as well! 
They did have some tables outside where you can sit and enjoy your sandwich at. I am not sure how often they are disinfecting the area, so sit there at your own risk. 
All in all, it was a great first experience. I guess you&apos;re suppose to try everything at least once! 
Will I have it again? Probably not. I think it&apos;s good for a one time thing only. Maybe LA natives will want to fight me on this! Haha but this is my opinion. Again, don&apos;t knock it, till you try it! Let me know if you liked it or if you agree with me!"
4,"Today we got 4 &quot;wet&quot; beef French dipped sandwiches along with 2 whole pickles and potato salad.  I always ask for some extra au jus sauce because I like my sandwich with lots of juices.

The lines are always long especially at peak hours but it moves quickly.  The servers making the sandwiches are super friendly and work quickly to get your order to you.  

It&apos;s nothing fancy but has a nice relaxed vibe. Long tables seat 8 people (pre-COVID) on low stools and booths are also available with wood chips on the floor.  There&apos;s additional seating upstairs.

The best dipped sandwiches around!"
5,"If you love pastrami, you should definitely try one wet with some cheddar and a side of macaroni salad. Pour some of their signature Phillipe mustard they give you as a side... and you&apos;re eating right 

I think I could eat two of them. 

It&apos;s a restaurant that is throwback to a by gone era.

During these times of covid, they have a tent set up in their parking lot. You can bring your food there and sit on a picnic table. They still staff the parking lot with waiters and bus boys, which are super courteous and very friendly.

This ain&apos;t the place to go to have your raspberry jam ham sandwich. Delicious sandwiches that have stood the test of time is all you&apos;ll get here."
5,"This place really lives up to its hype!

French dips FTW! I really enjoy the beef and the pastrami French dip. The meat is soo tender. Staff is also very friendly which is always a plus :-)

Will def return when I&apos;m in the area"
5,"Its weird. Before COVID, I never would have had the opportunity to try out Philippe&apos;s. EVERY single time I passed by this corner, the line was always out to the street and the place was always packed to the gills with people. Since that time, Philippe&apos;s has been doing take out only which has finally given me the chance to try out the world-famous french dip.

Oh my lord, I never thought I&apos;d be writing such a huge review for what is essentially just a lunch sandwich--but the lamb double dip is a strong contender for 8th wonder of the world. The cuts of lamb on the sandwich are huge and chunky with not too much fat. The lamb is deep cooked and beautifully tender without the stigma of having being tasting too &quot;gamey&quot;. The texture of the lamb also very nicely complimented the au jus with the dip. 

My significant other and I started off with a shared bowl of the chili, which too was pretty amazing and came with humongous cuts of fresh cheddar on it. Honestly, the chili itself could have worked as a meal--but you would be doing yourself a disservice if you left without a sandwich. 

There is a very nice and clean dining area outside. There is staff on hand to help assist in clean up and make sure that every single table is promptly cleaned off before the next party. Parking is across the street and plentiful.

Philippe&apos;s certainly lives up to its unique taste and its deep Angelino heritage."
4,"You won&apos;t find this place in your history books. 

But then again, the Denny&apos;s restaurant chain did a damn good copy cat recipe of this &apos;dipped&apos; ensemble years ago. 

As for the French Dip Sandwich, nothin&apos; much has changed. Too much bread, not enough &apos;au jus&apos; and some perfectly sliced Roast Beef."
2,"I know this place has raving reviews but I was honestly not impressed.
I wanted to be, oh I really did...but truly I was not.

Icon Phillippes was not so iconic for me.. don&apos;t even care to give it another go.. but who knows.  It was just... Boring for me."
5,"The sandwiches are delicious! They&apos;re not that big. Perfect size. Maybe 9 inches. Similar to the size of 6 inch subway sandwich size. Tried the beef and NY pastrami beef, double dipped, with some cheese. Potato salad tastes sweet like they put relish in it. 

There&apos;s a cute outside area to eat during covid-19 times."
4,"How have I not reviewed this place before?? Yelper fail.

I have frequented this landmark spot for years now, and even though we are all in COVID mode, I had a craving for a classic. Ordering ahead is definitely the way to go so you can avoid the lines. Just order, walk in and pick up a bag from the shelves on the left. Then take this sandwich home and enjoy!

I prefer the double dipped beef with Swiss and a side of spicy mustard and a pickle, but there&apos;s no such thing as a bad Philippe&apos;s sandwich. The potato salad is pickle heavy but still good, and there are many other options you can add to your order to enhance the flavor of one of the simplest and best sandwiches around."
