5,"Worth the hype! There is now expanded seating in the back outdoor area and plenty of distance between the tables. The wait staff also cleans and sanitizes each table between guests. 

1) Bruschetta - for me, this is a must try appetizer at any Italian restaurant. This was tasty for me and the unique twist was the addition of the cucumber which not all restaurants do. I thought it provided a nice balance to cut the other flavors. 

2) Bianchi and Neri Pasta - delicious pasta that was creamy, with the right balance of shrimp and mushroom. The sauce has a hint of fried shrimp, which was unique. One of the highlights of the night. 

3) Lasagna - the tomato sauce had a nice balance of sweetness and acidity. I don&apos;t like lasagna with too much cheese, and this provided just the right amount. 

4) Pistachio Panna Cotta - delicious. If you are a pistachio fan, highly recommended to complete your meal."
5,"Excellent spot for lunch or dinner! The spinach and ricotta tortellini and pumpkin ravioli were absolutely delicious. 
The outdoor seating is really cute and quiet.
Outstanding service. I&apos;m 100% convinced that Christian is the single best person on this planet?? So funny and friendly. 5 stars for him. 
Christian, you&apos;re my new bff sorry"
5,"This review is based on a lovely dining experience with several friends pre-Covid, when it was safe to dine in restaurants. The food was incredible, and the only reason I haven&apos;t returned since is because the location - while convenient for work - is not convenient based on where I live.

Let&apos;s start with the food. I went with six girlfriends and we all ordered something different and passed around the plates (nothing else quite screams &quot;before times&quot; like this, amirite?). When I say each one was outstanding and most of us struggled to choose a favorite, I mean it. Not only did we love what we all got, but we loved everything everyone else got, too. And if you thought this would mean that, as waiters passed by with dishes for other tables, we didn&apos;t want some of those dishes, you&apos;d be wrong. I ordered the special of the day, which was ravioli with a wild boar ragu. WOW. It was definitely special. I got an extra one to go so my family could try it, too.

Service was terrific. Polite and unintrusive, but attentive. Location is bustling and we loved feeling the energy of the city while simultaneously feeling calm and not rushed, despite the line of guests waiting to be seated. 

Will definitely return. No question."
1,"I was very patient and I hate writing bad reviews but I have to because our food was just not edible to eat. 3 out 4 of our dishes were bad. The sauce was over salted as If the bottle of salt fell in and I tried to reach out to th restaurant and never heard back. Worse part it was suppose to be a special dinner for my Mother in laws birthday and we couldn&apos;t eat our food. This experience made not want to ever order again. 

All I expected was an apology for the food quality. Sadly I never heard back."
4,"Despite a sign out front, they are ONLY offering takeout as of 2/1/21! After a quick 10 minute wait (no line at 5pm), my friend and me took our food across the street to Grand Central Market&apos;s outdoor dining tables. Each pasta came with a side of 2 baguette slices which were fine but not warm/toasty.

- Rigatoni Pom&apos;Amore: $13.95: Rigatoni with a creamy tomato sauce topped with burrata - a classic! I loved the great bite to the handmade pasta as well as the pleasingly rich, almost meaty-tasting sauce. Each bite was creamy, savory, and just sweet enough, although I didn&apos;t really taste the burrata. The portion was also perfect, not heavy at all! 

- Agnolotti di Ossobuco: $16.95: Tortelloni filled with osso bucco meat &amp; marrow in a salsa verde - amazingly vibrant green color! My friend was a bit disappointed with this dish since she said it was largely bland and she couldn&apos;t taste the meat. However, the sauce was very good.

I can&apos;t attest to my friend&apos;s dish but I found the overall taste and presentation (even with takeout containers) delightful! Would love to go back and dine in once it&apos;s safe to do so."
5,"Hands down, one of the best Italian places I have ever had! So so delicious &amp; well priced. They make their own fresh pasta and that in itself makes it taste decadent and worth it. They have a great amount of pastas to choose from and they all sound super tasty! 

My friend and I got the Bianchi &amp; Neri w/ chicken instead of shrimp. It was super creamy yet light. I definitely recommend that one or the gnocchi!"
4,"I&apos;ve always wanted to try this place and heard a lot about it. Finally got to try it and I have to say that it didn&apos;t disappoint. 

The place is quite hard to find because it&apos;s located in an alleyway, and you can easily miss it so pay close attention. We sat out in the patio in a private tent which was nice. Food was overall very good. For appetizers, we ordered calamari and fried shrimp patties with saut√©ed onions, which were very tasty. Both dishes were crunchy and flavorful. For my entree, I ordered my usual seafood linguini or fruti de mare, which was really good. The seafood tasted fresh and good quality. 

Service was nice as well. Our waiter was cracking jokes and making us laugh, giving us recommendations for our orders. He was attentive. It&apos;s a $$ restaurant so price and portions were very adequate. I will come back again next time I&apos;m in the downtown area."
5,"Get the Bianchi and Neri! It is so creamy, and the noodles are soft and chewy. It didn&apos;t taste overly rich -- just right. It&apos;s one of the best Italian dishes I have ever had in my life. There&apos;s a lot of sauce, but it doesn&apos;t drown out the taste of the noodles.

I got the beef Gnocchi. You&apos;ll be sad if you expect a lot of beef because there&apos;s not. It&apos;s mainly the Gnocchi, which was fantastic! Very soft and creamy texture. A dash of cheesiness."
5,Freely made pasta.  If you happen to be downtown near Broadway this is a must visit restaurant.  I took a friend from Italy to this restaurant and she has been raving about the place for years.  It&apos;s as authentic as an Italian restaurant can get.  The food is always fresh and exquisitely made.
4,"I&apos;ve had this bookmarked for so long and finally we were able to try it! We came here to get takeout for my birthday (since I&apos;m not comfortable with dining out yet in these current times).

1) Bianchi &amp; Neri: their popular signature pasta dish, which comes with black and white pasta thin vermicelli, shrimp, mushroom, and roasted pancetta in a creamy bisque. For some reason ours didn&apos;t come with roasted pancetta, but it didn&apos;t &quot;make or break it,&quot; the creamy sauce is very delicious with the pasta. This is my favorite one (5/5)

2) Agnolotti Di Osso Bucco: tortelloni filled with osso bucco meat and marrow in a salsa verde. This is a very heavy and savory option. It&apos;s pretty good, though I thought the filling was a bit slightly sweet for me. I was able to eat a few tortelloni before it got too &quot;richly sweet&quot; for me (4/5)

3) Ravioli Di Zucca: pumpkin ravioli with butter cream truffle cheese sauce. The sauce is perfectly yummy. You can dip their bread in it. The ravioli is very good, though some people might find the pumpkin to be a bit sweet. The flavors are paired well together with the pumpkin and the butter cream truffle sauce. I highly recommend this one (5/5)

4) Violetta Di Melanzane: baked eggplant rolls, stuffed with mozarella and pomodoro sauce. It&apos;s a nice appetizer but this is very heavily salty. It goes well paired with the bread (4/5)

Overall, the food is great. I would totally go here again and try their other pastas! Credit cards are accepted and there&apos;s street parking available."
4,First time coming to this business can say it was an experience. The only thing I didn&apos;t like was the caned margaritas. Was expecting home made cocktails. Food I give it a 4 star drinks a 3 star..
4,"We went there on Friday night, there was a waiting list for the table and it was like about 1.30 hours before we got seated. 
Finally we got seated and we had Bianchi &amp; Neru &amp; Rigatoni with a red wine.
Bianchi &amp; Neru was really good satisfying but Rigatoni was just okay, nothing especial, like some noodle and cheese. 
Red wine was not good, unfortunately, but overall we liked their signature dish, so it&apos;s good to try :)"
5,"decided to get Maccheroni Republic for my birthday lunch and I was 1000% satisfied. It was my first time coming here (for takeout) and even the pick up experience was very welcoming, safe, and rewarding. The staff is incredibly nice and made sure you were good to go to enjoy a one of a kind meal. The textures of the noodles + the sauces are next level. Seriously. For the price point for this high level of food in unmatched. Highly recommended if you are in the area! Much love!! I&apos;ll definitely be returning to try out more of the menu. Thank you ~"
5,Ordered during COVID-19 quarantine period for pickup. It was super easy and ready in a timely manner. Pickup was easy and ready. Food didn&apos;t disappoint. Abundance of seafood and pasta was fresh! Yum!
4,"Love love love this place! One of the best pasta places I ever been to. Fresh pasta, homemade, so what else can you ask for?! 

- fritto do calamari: it is very lightly breaded calamari which is how it should be! And they come with this sauce on the side which is the typical marinara or tarter sauce. I&apos;m not sure what it is made of but it does help with all the fried on the Calamari. It is light and delicious.

- insalata con salmon fresco: basically it is salmon salad. This is a hit or miss for us. So I had it at times where the salmon smelled fishy to me so not fresh? Either way, pass. 

- gnocchi con ragu: love this dish!!! The best gnocchi I ever had! If I can have 5 plates of this then I&apos;m happy! It is light and doughy...love! 

- lasagna di carne: typical lasagna with tons of cheese which is great. Fresh pasta so what can be better

- linguine ai frutti di mare: this is basically seafood pasta with a mixture of different kind of seafood. They have a great version of it and you will lick every sauce and bite of this! 

- bianchi &amp; neri: this is a weird but fun looking dish. Because the pasta is black and white and it comes in a cream shrimp sauce. It is great but kind of heavy. 

- zuppa di pesce del lido with pasta: so basically this is served in a large bowl like a soup with tons of pasta and seafood. It reminds me of the korean Chinese dish jangbong but obviously it is in a tomato based sauce instead. This is a big hit for us everytime 

- pumpkin ravioli: so I got this dish during the virus pandemic, I think it was a limited edition thing. Honestly it is a hard pass unless you love pumpkin. It has a spice taste  to it that I didn&apos;t like and it was served in a cream sauce. The whole thing wasn&apos;t for me. 

The only down side to this place is two things: one is parking because even with validation- it is too much. And the second is the portions! I&apos;m sorry I need to always order two dishes every time! Either way I love this place and everyone should try it. It is one of the best hidden gem of Los Angeles"
5,"Another long overdue review, but I came by Maccheroni Republic with a large group of coworkers for DineLA back in January (pre-COVID). I think the entire set menu was $20, which was still a ridiculously good deal even though it used to be $15. For the appetizer, I went with the Burrata, which was served with tomato and pesto. Glad they could sub out the olive. The burrata was incredibly creamy and complemented by the stronger flavor of the pesto. For my entree, I decided to go with the Beet Gnocchi Bolognese. I&apos;m a sucker for gnocchi typically, and these did not disappoint! The gnocchi was a really pretty red color from the beets but I couldn&apos;t taste any beet flavor. I was already stuffed at this point, and got the Lemon Olive Oil Cake to go. Such a great restaurant in DTLA!"
5,"I cannot find an Italian place in LA that beats this. Their menu is always changing, adding wonderful dishes, and bringing wonderful, seasonal dishes back. The pasta is fresh, their flavors are amazing - and that&apos;s speaking from the girl who orders their simple, star shaped pasta and spicy red sauce. Like it&apos;s THAT GOOD. (*also that&apos;s if I don&apos;t overdo it on their soft, fresh out of the oven, bread ... first*)

I revisit this restaurant multiple times in a year, for about 5 years - including ordering take out in this pandemic. Because that&apos;s how much I love it. 

Do yourself a favor, give it a go. When the world returns to normal, do yourself another favor, and go in person for the ambiance. It&apos;s a wonderful experience, with wonderful staff, and unbelievably tasty cuisine."
5,"Maccheroni Republic is one of my comfort go-tos! The pricing is fantastic, and the service (when they are operating normally) is great. I highly recommend the salsa verde osso bucco dish (seriously) or the black &amp; white pasta dish. Please note that the parking is kind of a disaster so allot for extra time!"
5,"Maccheroni republic
I&apos;ve ordered from Maccheroni Republic a couple of times so far and my experiences have all been great. I&apos;ve ordered several different pastas to share (BOCCOLETTI AL PESTO E RICOTTA  , RIGATONI POM&apos;MORE  , MACCHERONI A STELLA &amp; PERLINE MOZZARELLA ). I really appreciate that they have so many vegetarian options."
5,"Delivery Order Review (6/7/20) 

Did a take out order for Maccheroni Republic through UberEats. Called in first to confirm an egg allergy and the woman who answered the phone around dinner time was lovely! Really appreciated her taking the time to recommend certain dishes and thankful the menu was quite allergy friendly (most pastas, aside from the stuffed ones were egg-free!) 

We ordered Bianchi and Neri &amp; Rigatoni Pom&apos;Amore and both dishes were delicious. 

Some food highlights: 
* Great quantity size, the right amount of sauce to pasta ratio 
* Both pasta dishes were full of flavour and an enjoyable creamy texture 
* Bianchi and Neri: Great choice if you&apos;re in the mood for a creamy pasta but not something too heavy, had the perfect balance of shrimp and some mushroom, pancetta pieces in between each bite 
* Rigatoni Pom&apos;Amore: A classic pasta choice, creamy tomato sauce flavour and fresh burata (soft cheese on top, similar to mozzarella but a bit creamier) 

Service highlights 
* Very friendly and informative, appreciated the recommendations provided on the phone
* Preparation and delivery time was quite fast DTLA 
* Thankful for the complimentary bread provided along with olive oil &amp; balsamic vinegar (my favorite!) 

Overall, will definitely be order again the next time I&apos;m in the mood for a good bowl of pasta. Looking forward to the day I&apos;m able to enjoy pasta in the restaurant again as well."
