5,"Unfortunately we couldn&apos;t dine in their outdoor dining because it had been banned due to alleged rises in COVID cases, putting LA County back into the Red Zone that happened right before Thanksgiving day. But I digress on that. 

We ordered Combo B to cook at home. We were given plenty of Banchan, 4 cups of steamed rice, a plethora of sauces (sesame oil w salt, brisket sauce, salted bean paste). The packaging overall was awesome. The banchan were in 4-cup styled compartments in a container. The meats were packed individually and labeled in a disposable ice bag. Korean businesses really nail packaging and food safety down to a T. Steamed egg dish was pretty bland. I don&apos;t think we&apos;ll be ordering it again. 

They have a sticker that says Michelin 2019 on their door. I can see why. The meats were high quality and delicious. I can&apos;t speak for the pork belly because I don&apos;t eat pork. But all the beef items were high quality cuts of meat. The Banchan were great as well. Cucumber kimchi was crunchy and fresh. Kimchi was good, not too sweet at all.

Once we&apos;re able to dine in again, I&apos;m excited to come back."
5,"Was originally planning on going to KangHoDong but the 2 hr wait turned us away and looking for other options. Found this place and was a short walking distance away. We walked up and got seated outside immediately!  I think everyone wanted to sit inside, but during these times, I am happy with outdoor seating especially with no wait time. The food came out fast and they cooked everything to perfection for us. Sooooooo goooooood!  All the banchans were really fresh and delicious as well. You know you can&apos;t have kbbq without some soju and beer to wash that down. Good times! 

KHD texted me to come back and claim our table when we were leaving Soowan  2 hrs later.. crazy"
5,"THE BEST I&apos;VE EVER HAD. Soowon Galbi is SO WORTH IT and SO DELICIOUS EVERY SINGLE TIME. I literally can&apos;t have galbi anywhere else now because I just compare it to Soowon and nothing compares. I&apos;ve actually only had it as take-out since the pandemic started but that doesn&apos;t affect anything about the quality or taste of the meat at all. The meat is tender and juicy EVERY TIME and very well seasoned so if you&apos;re worried about it not being as good as cooked take-out, DON&apos;T YOU WORRY because it&apos;s still amazing. 
Soowon wows me every time with their galbi and I can&apos;t nor do I want KBBQ from anywhere else."
5,"My kids and I tried it because of this Yelp rating. We ordered two orders of the Soowan Galbi to go. Although it was packaged very nicely we decided to eat it there at a table outside while it was hot. 

The outdoor dining setup was nice. There were about eight tables or so and they each had a grill!! But since our food was already cooked we took a small table without a grill. 

The galbi was easily the best galbi my son and I have ever had. We have a few standard places on the Westside but this was so awesome that it made venturing to Ktown totally worth it. The meat is so tender and flavorful that it practically melt in your mouth. Also, there were two large bone pieces but the rest was pure meat, so it was nice to not have to tear a bite from the bone and have the cartilage that goes with it. My daughter, who hates all things protein except salmon sushi, really liked it and that was HUGE for me. The banchan was also very good and packaged nicely to go. You get two containers, each with four sections of banchan. You get steamed rice and a salad too. It isn&apos;t cheap: the galbi dinner was $50, but fabulous food is worth it."
5,"Best Korean BBQ ever!!! All food if fully cooked. So many sides, costumer service treats you like family."
5,"My favorite kbbq during covid.  They really upped their bbq by doing a hybrid gas and charcoal and built in kbbq grills on the table. Most places only have those mini gas stove top on top of the table and it&apos;s so high up that its hard to cook the meal.  Meat quality is overall great, but having tried the unmarinated short ribs 3x now, it&apos;s not worth it and always a bit chewy from the fats.  Best to stick to brisket, pork belly, and other cuts of meat.  They also have the kindest and most attentive servers. One of the servers (we never got his name, he&apos;s bald) is our favorite server in all of LA. They&apos;re that good."
5,"Parking is available in the plaza, but limited

Workers have PPE on. Lots of space between seating of customers.
We didn&apos;t go for any combination courses - we ordered individual beef/pork dishes instead.

We got: soowon wang galbi, beef tongue, and pork belly.

I remember the soowon wang galbi was a damn standout, really fucking flavorful with their signature house marinade. It&apos;s what their restaurant is named after - a city in south korea. 

Beef tongue and pork belly were both above average. Which was surprising to me.

I would highly recommend these 3 choices of meat as enough for 2 people.
The side dishes were on point as well. Great kimchi is always a sign of a great restaurant! This place lives up to the hype and positive reviews."
3,"Ahhh it breaks my heart to update my review for this place from a 5 star to 3... 

First, I want to say that doing business during COVID is definitely not easy! And I really appreciate every waiter/waitress that risks themselves to serve us. But with that said, I don&apos;t think COVID is an excuse to be sloppy with your food - especially the meat quality for kbbq.

The beef brisket was EXTREMELY dry, nowhere near juicy. Not sure if it&apos;s due to the cookware or the meat itself - I&apos;m leaning more towards the meat. It was very thick cut and looks like it&apos;s been in the freezer - that usually means dry &amp; overcooked meat. 

Then the manager was very nice to swap out the briskets for a new plate - and while the new meat cooks, even the waitress could tell the difference - juice was coming out along with the aroma, which is what it should be like. This time around the meat was more juicy - though still not like what it used to be.

This also goes to prove that the first plate was not good-quality meat....

Second, beef tongue were cut very thick (like extremely thick...) I personally prefer thin slices of beef tongue, as they taste more juicy and less fatting.

Third, bulgogi tasted very very average.

Other than that, we got a fly on our bulgogi (not the restaurant&apos;s fault, just a part of dining out), and they didn&apos;t hesitate to bring out a new plate - good job on that.

Well... I was really excited to come back to one of my all-time fav bbq places. But I&apos;m very sad to say that this was a terrible experience, and though staff were very nice, I lost my appetite and just left with a bad taste in my mouth in the end... not sure if this has to do with not having the traditional bbq pit, or a different meat supplier? but needless to say that I&apos;m disappointed, especially given the $70/person price."
5,"We tried going to a Korean BBQ for lunch. Most places were closed for lunch but open for dinner. This place faces north and is ideal for eating out at noon.
It is a simple menu. Salad, banchan, dumpling, steamed egg and a few bbq plates. Very tasty after a long lock down."
5,"Came here once for dine-in before COVID; it&apos;s not AYCE, but this is one of those few places where it&apos;s really worth it.

After COVID, I ordered the &quot;bento box&quot; style galbi. I definitely missed the whole experience of cooking the meat, but the wide spread of sides I got definitely made up for it. I wish there was more galbi in the box because it was bomb."
5,"COVID / Social distancing ready! They set up tents and tables outdoors, spaced out, and plastic &quot;walls&quot; around. 

They even have the individual grills outside so you can still cook for yourself. The food was great - we ordered Course B for 3 people and we all left SO FULL. The stuff was super friendly and attentive as well."
5,"We&apos;ve been wanting to try different KBBQ places in town and heard great things about Soowon, so thought we&apos;d give it a try. We knew that this place would have a long wait after reopening post COVID, so I called to make a reservation. I called right at 11am and they were able to take a reservation at 7pm the same day. We arrived 30 minutes earlier than our reservation and they were able to seat us promptly. We did have to wear masks into the establishment and they also took our temperatures and made us write down our names before we were seated. There was also a large plastic barrier between us and the table next to us! All of the servers wore masks, plus a face guard and gloves.

The difference between this place and other places like KHB and TK92 are the side dishes. The evolving side dishes tasted so fresh and looked so beautiful. Can bonchon look beautiful? Yes, it can. I appreciated the thoughtful presentation of the bonchon and that we each got our own set. 

We ended up getting the Combo C + a la carte unseasoned ribs, one bottle of soju, two beers and the total came out to $270. I would say it&apos;s a bit pricey compared to other establishments, but the quality was absolutely AMAZING. I would 100% come back for the quality of the meats, bonchon, and service."
5,"Small parking lot. They used to use valet, but with the pandemic, it&apos;s self parking.

There are 8 tables for outdoor seating and under shading. They&apos;ve decorated it with some bistro lighting so it&apos;s cute &amp; welcoming. 
There are 4 tables w/ table grills while the rest are portable table grills. We have had both and the flavor/cooking of the food tastes just as great.
They serve each person their own banchan, which they said is freshly made in house. We love their house made fresh kimchi, spinach, tofu, potato salad,  marinated cucumbers. 
We always get their house soowon Kalbi, marinated in their secret recipe. This is my favorite dish to order. 
The chadol guy is a great cut of meat, but we&apos;ve noticed a smaller portion since the pandemic. Probably half the amount that was usually given for the order. The sesame oil salt for dipping is amazing.

We have ordered from here to-go when outdoor seating wasn&apos;t available, and I wouldn&apos;t recommend it. The portions were way smaller and everything just looked sad when we tried to eat it at home. I recommend coming to the location and eating the food fresh when it&apos;s cooked for you."
5,Great service and great vibe! They make sure you are fed and accommodate to every need. Check them out!
4,"Great quality meats. Short rib and pork belly are my favorite. The sides are all great too and loved the bean paste soup at the end. But I will say, the prices are higher than your average KBBQ spots. It is not all you can eat. You will still be full at the end of the meal and very satisfied. Parking is easy. They have valet. Which is only $3."
5,"Amazing KBBQ place! The marinated beef short rib is super delicious. The pancakes are like 10-12&quot;, which is larger than I expected. I really love most of the side dishes as well! Would love to order again. Highly recommended!"
5,"One of the best KBBQ I&apos;ve ever had!

We came here for a late lunch (around 3pm) on MLK and parked right in front. We were greeted as we walked in and was promptly seated at a booth.  

We were started off with a delightful array of banchan. We ordered Combo Course B ($130, portion good for 2 ppl, expensive but totally worth it) which includes house special marinated premium black angus bone-in short rib, prime boneless short rib, sliced prime black angus short rib (seasoned with sesame oil, salt and pepper), choice of premium port jowl or pork belly, prime brisket, house salad, soup and rice. 

They cooked and cut the meat on the grill for us. Everything from the banchan and salad to the rice paper and radish soup was fresh and amazing. Every bite of the meat was high quality and delectable. They started us off with prime brisket and ended with the house special marinated premium black angus bone-in short rib. I think they wanted to save the best for last. It was quite exceptional. 

Service was friendly, attentive, and quick. When it got busy about an hour later, service fell a little behind as there were only two servers who had to answer phones, take down orders and serve tables. But, they managed to do their best to attend to the tables as soon as they could. They refilled our waters, banchans, salads and got us chili, bean paste, garlic and chili as requested. I later asked for hot water and the server came back with a hot tea that tasted like barley. Thank you and I loved it :)

My husband and I did finish the meal :P. Our kiddo enjoyed the rice, meat and loved the radish soup. It was simple, subtle and quite good.

This place totally hit the spot and left quite a lasting impression!"
5,"After all these years. Still good and I felt it got better. The service was very attentive even though they said we had to handle cooking the meat, we barely had a hand in it. The food and bbq was exceptional and the servers could answer our questions with a smile. Ample tables outside and very covid safe. Definitely an upmarket Krn bbq during the pandemic and I hope they survive this current shutdown of outdoor dining."
4,"The quality of the food is amazing however the price is just as amazingly high. Don&apos;t go here if you can&apos;t afford a $$$ on yelp. 
THE MEAT IS SO JUICY, and CHEWY. Def recommend the short ribs, they&apos;re soooo good. 

Parking is hard to find, of course downtown k town, however they have valet with $3 only if you do go and tell them you&apos;re doing kbbq at soowon. 

The wait is the main thing -- usually is 2-3 hours wait. So go early or go at a odd day people doesn&apos;t go or else be prepare to wait. 

This is classy people kbbq as in, you aren&apos;t the one in charge. You don&apos;t get a tong, because the servers are cooking your food, and they&apos;re the one who are serving you drinks. So don&apos;t look stupid or they&apos;ll yell at you.

However they have reasonable price for soju and other stuffs, and also if you do the course, make sure to ask for rice and soup because it isn&apos;t provided otherwise."
5,"I consider this place to be the best in Ktown.  I was a little hesitant to try the take out BBQ since, let&apos;s face it, it&apos;s just not the same at home.  BUT... the craving was real and we decided to give it a go.  What better place to try take out Korean BBQ than your favorite place SooWon Galbi?!!  

We got the BBQ set #2 for $80.  It is very thoughtfully and well packaged.  The raw meats come packed in tight plastic containers (so the juice doesn&apos;t spill) in a cooler bag and the BanChan comes in  a tight spill proof  partitioned containers.  At first glance, I was worried it wouldn&apos;t be enough food for the two of us. But, I&apos;m always worried there isn&apos;t enough food, even at a buffet.  We ate every last morsel and it was more than enough.  We didn&apos;t leave the table with meat sweats and the feeling of throwing yourself off a flight of stairs, like you normally do when you gorge on Korean BBQ and soju.  

Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by their execution of the take away BBQ.  The taste is their usual high end quality.  Their packaging is on point.  All you need is a table top burner and you&apos;re ready to go.  The only thing missing is a Korean waiter cooking your food for you... 

Bravo SooWon!!!!!"
