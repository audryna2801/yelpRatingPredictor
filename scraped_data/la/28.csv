5,Ample amount of meat and the cozy little outdoor seating is spacious! Love to come here again!! Try their Signature Combo
5,"We ordered their beef combo.
They were all delicious.
Especially Beef short rib was so juicy and fresh.
Also Black sesame dressing salad was perfect.
Packing was clean and looked good !
I definitely will order again I&apos;d take out or dine in."
5,"After the purchase of my new ride, I wanted to celebrate with KBBQ and this was the spot!

Server checked every customers temperature to make sure everyone is safe and we had social distancing when sat on table.  Hood ventilation made me feel even safer because airborne virus can be vented out instead of trapped inside for people to breed in.

Ordered small combo $69 and it was perfect for 2 of us.  Small portions of many meat kinds and side dishes was very tasty and enjoyable.  Considering that we had lockdown for a while, this was great way to end a wonderful day of adding a beautiful horse to my family."
5,"This spot is fantastic. Now open for outdoor dining in a nice tent protected from the elements like a cold wind. 

I ordered their Magal Signature combo for two people. My partner is vegetarian, so all meat is for me! He&apos;s able to enjoy these delicious, assorted fresh banchans! Their standards on the banchans and meat are on another level in the Korean bbq scene. 

We received meritorious service as well! 

This Korean bbq restaurant is easily one of my favorite outdoor Korean bbq in LA!"
3,"So, there&apos;s definitely a big asterisk next to my experience here. Ordinarily, the cooking would be done at your table but with indoor dining no longer being an option they&apos;ve converted part of their parking lot into outdoor seating; which isn&apos;t that unusual, every place in LA has pretty much transitioned to outdoor if they&apos;re going to do dine-in service. 

They try to keep that cook at your table experience but everything is par-cooked and then brought to your little stovetop cooker to be reheated. In attempting to replicate the tableside cooking experience they&apos;ve overlooked the real benefit of tableside cooking, which is that the meat is fresh and juicy.

Having the meat pre-coooked and then basically reheated in front of you is like a car with no engine, looks good but kind of defeats the purpose. The meat was dry and lacked a lot of the flavor. I think I&apos;m off KBBQ for a while in general after this, unless there are options where it&apos;s a little more live, is the best word I can think of."
4,"My first COVID kbbq experience! I was a little sad because kbbq is just not the same anymore. My friend and I shared the small signature combo which includes a variety of beef cuts as well as pork belly. The marinated meats were juicy and tasted great, although portions of everything were on the smaller side. There were plenty of banchan and steamed egg and soup to complement the meat, and I thought the black sesame salad dressing was especially interesting (never seen it before at kbbq). 

The outdoor seating in the slightly cool night was actually quite nice; however, I don&apos;t think we were actually six feet away from the next table."
2,"This used to be my favorite Korean bbq. Always left this place full, satisfied and happy.
But after the pandemic hit, things are deteriorating greatly:
- while seated, be prepared to wait at least 30min for the meat to arrive
- understaffed, you need to ask multiple times for refill
- the main combo dish went from $67.99 in 2019, to $69.99 in 2020, and now $71.99. Why?
- the combo used to come with hot pepper squid and short rib sushi, but not anymore.

I understand covid took a toll on everybody, but why should the end user suffer the consequences? We are impacted at work, at home, when buying groceries etc, why should we also suffer during the few moments left where we can enjoy our lives?"
4,"My friend and I came here for lunch on a weekend and ordered the signature combo for two. The parking situation is not ideal, but we were able to find street parking right in front of the restaurant. 

This was the first KBBQ place I went to after moving to LA, and it was such an eye-opener. So this is how a legit Koreatown KBBQ place does it. I was surprised there were more than 3 side dishes (banchan) and that I didn&apos;t have to hold the tongs once during the meal--the server cooked our meat for us from start to finish, and way better than how I would&apos;ve cooked it too. The quality and quantity of the meat were great. It was a solid KBBQ meal, and I left full and happy."
4,"1. $90 for two people - including tip
2. Outdoor seating is set-up well. Tables are separated and there is hand sanitizer on each table. 
3. Restroom is clean and they only allow 1 person inside.
4. Meat is cooked inside and served on a hot plate.

Staff are masked. Very respectful of keeping distanced and also really good about asking whether or not we wanted the meat to come out faster or slower.

Meat quality was excellent. Super tender, melt in our mouths, barely needed any sort of sauce for dipping. We were SO full after the Magal combo that we had leftovers. Really loved the selection of banchan too.

Pricey, but worth it."
4,"I&apos;ve tried a lot of Korean barbecue places in K town, and this is definitely one of the better ones! Lots of places use frozen meat but not Magal. 

My friends and I ordered the beef combo ($114.99 for 3-4 people) which comes with brisket, short rib or ribeye (definitely choose the short rib), finger rib and marinated short rib. The combos come with hot pepper squid, grilled mushrooms and pineapple, boneless short ribs sushi (which they torch in front of you) and soy bean paste soup. We also got a dish of pork jowl ($26.99).

The banchan selection is just decent. They have the grills with the outer ring moat thing for the egg and corn cheese which is nice, but the egg takes forever to cook lol. 

Come here for the meat quality and the KIMCHEE FRIED RICE VOLCANO (around $20) at the end. It&apos;s really good! The service is pretty good here too, with the people helping to cook our meat being pretty attentive.

Cheap valet in the back (like $2)."
3,"$35 person is VERY overpriced for what you get. There were maybe four banchan - no kimchi (I know). No stews/jjigaes included, just soup of the day that is served in a small styrofoam bowl. The meat was good but not fantastic or anything."
4,"Magal is a more intimate space then other giant Korean bbq restaurants therefore I would suggest keeping groups to no more than 6 with the way the tables and stools are set up. They have beef, pork, and combination combo options for 1-2 people ($69) and 3-4 people ($116).

We tried the beef/pork combo for 2 people and it was definitely enough food for 2. You get 5 different types of meat starting with hand torched boneless short rib sushi (so good) plus all the usually banchan, salad and soybean soup. If you are a cheese corn fan I would definitely suggest getting the extra side option. It comes with its own sterno and you can watch it melt and eat all the cheesy goodness. 

Service is quick and attentive and with a parking lot/valet ($3) in the back it makes this place easy to get to."
5,"Our waiter was very friendly and the food here is awesome! Each combo comes with steamed egg already! The only down side is there were alot of sold out items, but everything else was awesome. Will definitely come back again!"
5,"Wow...even 1 year later Magal doesn&apos;t fail to disappoint! 

Come for lunch during opening 11:30am for no lines and a chill experience. 

I love how they cook your meat to perfection, I highly recommend the signature meat platter. 

The oriental raisin tea is also an amazing winner and they serve it all you can drink with your kbbq: we once asked them if we could buy a pitcher to go but they said no 

Be sure to also ask for deals during lunch: sometimes they offer a free clam dish with your bbq order: be sure to check the menu for their specials"
4,"Everything cooked quick and adequately, aside from the thicker things like the chicken and short ribs. The administration was predictable when we arrived around 3:00 pm. Nonetheless, when the ideal opportunity arrived around it was difficult for us to discover a server. Justifiable"
4,"Summary:
Quality meats and a good selection of banchan.

Food:
Got the signature Magal combo (beef+pork). The meat seemed to be high quality cuts. The marbling was excellent. One negative was for the short-rib, they included one with bone and very very little meat, which I felt they might as well not even include it, or at least substitute it with an another piece of meat. A good variety of banchan: napa, cucumber, bean sprouts, salad with black sesame dressing, (what appeared to be radish), daenjang jjigae (soybean paste stew). While the meat cooks, part of the grill area also included a cream corn-like side and an egg mixture that would cook up. I would say the oriental raisin tea they serve here is more watery than those served at other Korean restaurants.

Service:
I came a little early and they were nice enough to let me grab a table while I waited for others. Tables seemed to turn fairly quick. The servers were pretty good at cooking the food and managing everything. For most of the meat, once it was done, they moved it off to the side, signalling when we should dig in. For the last selection of meat, I think they forgot so it got more cooked than intended. Servers were polite and very quickly refilled any banchan we wanted.

Ambiance: 
Good mix of young Koreans and 1-2 tables of older Koreans.

Parking:
Would not recommend looking for parking the surrounding area, that was my big mistake. They have (valet) parking for $3.

Details:
Sunday at 7pm, 2 people"
5,"We were brought here by friends who often eat in K town. This was a first for us, and quite spectacular.

The kimchi and other bowls of veggies and salads were fantastic. Great flavors and crunch.

They actually do the cooking for you. We especially enjoyed the calamari and short rib beef--perfectly cooked.

We enjoyed their barley tea water and their Korean beer. 

Servers were very efficient at keeping the dinner going through its various grilled dishes.

Guess a place with thousands of reviews and restaurants in locations around the world knows how to do its BBQ to satisfy. 

Delicious."
4,"The restaurant is conveniently located at the corner with valet parking available for $3.00. They use yelp waitlist system so you know what you are dealing with - this is only for group of 6 and under. My party had 7 so I had to call. Told them we can make it in 20 mins and they took our party number down. When arrived we waited for 15 mins which was much shorter than the waitlist time. Saturday night was as busy as it can get. 

Got the beef and pork combos to share between two grills and the server did a great job sorting out the portion between two groups (3 vs.4). The quality of the meat is solid. Favorite cut was the ribeye.  

Just FYI if you want to take advantage of the yelp check in or writing a review on the spot for a free plate of mushrooms, pineapple, or pork skins, you are only allowed to pick either check in or review per party. But they give you a generous amount - pretty satisfied."
5,"Wow Magal really spoiled my Korean dining experience. Coming from SF when we go to Korean bbq we cook everything on our own. Here at Magal they do all the work for you! And they cook it so perfectly to.

As busy as they were there was never a moment I had to pick up the things and flip the food which is mind blowing to me. Different servers would sing my the table silently flip everything and disappear.

The food was great! My family of 3 (my daughter is 9 and doesn&apos;t eat much) shared the all beef meal set for 2 and we were stuffed. 

I will definitely return when I in the area."
4,"Every time my boyfriend and I are able to make a trip back down to Socal, he always wants KBBQ. It&apos;s something we just can&apos;t resist - the juicy, flavorful meat and plentiful side dishes, the sizzling sounds coming from the grill, mmmmmhmm! And it makes us nostalgic for our college days. Given that it&apos;s been a while since college, we don&apos;t really have the stomach for AYCE kbbq anymore. Our tastes have also become a bit more elevated so we&apos;re more willing to pay more for better quality meat.

We got here and there was no wait. We ordered the beef combo ($69.99 for 2-3 people). It comes with four plates of meat: sliced prime brisket, prime beef boneless short rib (or the prime beef rib eye), beef finger rib, and the marinated prime short rib. I didn&apos;t like the beef finger rib as much because it was a bit tough for me, but everything else was flavorful and delicious. The side of the grill also included the corn cheese and egg.

One of my favorite things was the heotkkae tea, which comes complimentary with your meal. On the pitcher, there is a label that explains what it is. The tea is supposed to help detox the liver and improve digestion, which is important in KBBQ places amiriteeeeee. Anyway, it is just slightly sweet, and a nice break from all the meaty flavors.

I&apos;m still unaccustomed to having someone cook the food in front of me, but the servers were so attentive and friendly. Overall, a solid KBBQ place and one that we will very likely revisit when we travel to Socal again!"
