5,"After a nearby hike I wanted to continue my day with a healthier option for my lunch. Joe&apos;s Falafel was nearby and I must say, it fulfilled the need.
Parking in these covid times was pretty easy and would be my dining location. 
Inside the restaurant I was greeting with a warm and friendly reception by the owner, I suspect. I was even gifted two small dessert bites with a Rose Water flavor for the New Year which were delicious. My order included a Lemon Chicken Wrap and a large Chicken Shawarma Salad. Both items were impressive. The Lemon sauce is definitely a stand out flavor. I would have preferred that sauce as dressing on the Salad. The Salad had a generous portion of meat on top. Prices seem reasonable. I would definitely come back."
5,"Low key upset that I&apos;m just now finding out that Joe&apos;s Falafel is 8 minutes away from my house. It happened to pop up on my yelp today and I&apos;m so glad it did! I got a parking spot right in front of the door and walked in to friendly hellos behind masked faces. The owner, Joe, gave my daughter a piece of rosewater cake while I looked over the menu. I decided to try a small shwarma bowl which turned out to be delicious. Like surprisingly delicious. There is plenty of covered outdoor seating. Joe brought us a complimentary piece of falafel while we waited on our food. Definitely gotta come back to try a full order of the falafel. We will definitely make this a regular in our Mediterranean food rotation. My leftovers tonight were still great and the pieces of meat still tender.  I may go back tomorrow lol"
5,"A small family-owned business with plenty of parking &amp; an outdoor patio. The staff was very friendly &amp; helpful. One of the workers was named Joe just like the restaurant. Bizarre.

The falafel is one of the best in town! Crispy on the outside, soft &amp; fluffy on the inside, &amp; properly seasoned. The serving included 6 pieces which was plenty.

The humus with tahini is pretty good, but make sure to ask for extra pita cuz they only gave us 1. The wraps are made with soft &amp; tasty bread. The lemon chicken wrap was delicious, moist, &amp; tangy. The beef kabob was ok, but it&apos;s large chunks. We liked the char flavor, but it would be better chopped up; get the beef kabob plate instead.

The fries were done right, too. The baklava was great as well.

This is a great place for a tasty, filling lunch."
5,"Love this place !

Thankyou for the sweet dessert"
5,"Best Mediterranean food! 
Beef kafta - juicy, fresh and flavorful...
Falafel - crispy skin and moist inside...
Beans - real interesting flavor...
They are very generous with their food, which is nice!"
4,"Stopped by on Friday night with the fam and my lady bear. Greek food is our normal go too. 

Joe&apos;s popped up on my weekly roundup and we were convinced. The pictures and reviews were great so we hopped in my beat up Audi and hit the road. 

The vegetarian combo was an absolute smash!! Comes with 6 pieces of falafel, hummus, and side salad. THE PITA BREAD IS FIRE. Everything tasted fresh and flavorful. 

On top of the good food the customer service was very hospitable. The owner or manager approached our table and dropped off a desert as a welcoming gesture because it was our first time being here. Anytime you get a welcome from the owner it&apos;s highly appreciated.

Would definitely recommend and will be back.
Thank you guys for the good food and experience."
5,"This place is so good. The food is full of juicy flavors, is always priced right, and the owners are so friendly that they come offer free samples of falafel and a sweet dessert. I have been here twice now and haven&apos;t been disappointed at all"
5,"Amazing Greek food. It&apos;s a great place to stop for lunch or get take out. Beef kabobs cooked medium rare and the gyros are always a favorite of mine. They make everything in house. The owner is such a nice guy and brought me some falafel to my car as I was waiting for my food order. It was the most delicious falafel ever! Fresh, moist, and flavorful-- literally home made"
5,Easily the BEST FALAFEL in LA. The beef kefta is juicy and delicious. The chicken shawarma is bright and fresh. Joe&apos;s uses spices and legit quality ingredients and it&apos;s so so good!!!
5,"I drive over 45 minutes to pick up food from Joe&apos;s. Absolutely worth the effort.

My husband is from Israel and he says this place is the closest to the falafel and shawarma that he used to have in Israel.  Their laffa bread alone is worth the 45 minute drive.  My personal favorite is the kafta plate. Try everything on the menu, they are all delicious.

The owner is a super sweet, kind man. He always gives me a piece of pineapple cake while I wait. I picked up food last night while it was pouring rain, and he personally brought my food out to my car . The guys at the counter and the kitchen staff are also super friendly, and very accommodating.  It&apos;s nice getting service from real people with people skills, and not the usual robots. Great food, great service! 



Spread the word."
5,Best falafel best humus love this place always clean best service  u can tell owner cares  about food quality and service love this place
5,"Falafel after a hike 
Went on a hike at Griffith Park, after the hike we found this gem and stopped by.
We got the Falafel plate, fried Cauliflower and a basket of fries. The staff was very friendly, and helpful. The food was amazing. The falafel was some of the best I&apos;ve had, it was very flavorful with great texture, and they give you plenty as part of the plate. The Hummus that comes as a side also very flavorful, perfectly seasoned and complimented the falafel quite well.
Overall I wish I lived closer so I could come by more often."
5,"Hands down the best falafels and shawarma in LA!

Joe&apos;s became my wife an I favorite place to eat when we went to college near by 5 years ago. 

We always get the chicken shawarma wrap and make sure to visit this family own business when we are in Hollywood.

Foods amazing, owner and staff are super nice. 

Can&apos;t go wrong with this place"
5,I got the falafel plate the flavor of the falafel were so tasty  along with the rice and hummus. The customer service was excellent he even gave us an extra falafel to try also gave us a sample of some very delicious cake. I will be going again so far one of the best falafels I have tried!!!
5,"I don&apos;t have one complaint about this spot, not one whatsoever. Let me start by saying driving 14 miles to Studio City is well worth it for us coming all the way  from East LA. I have been searching all over LA for thee best falafels, and let me tell you: your search ends here. Each piece is crunchy, crumbly, and packed with fresh herbs, so fresh it&apos;s still green when you bite into it. To me, THAT is the ideal falafel. It&apos;s beautifully spiced and the sides are *chefs kiss* excellent, I mean consistently excellent. Fresh, fresh, fresh. DELICIOUS! Literal perfection. The rice is nice and fluffy, lightly and perfectly seasoned. The salad is sour, herby and AGAIN fresh lol. It&apos;s just so yummy, I truly can&apos;t put into words! They&apos;re very generous with servings too!"
5,"Amazing legit gyro meat, fresh vegetables in the greek salad, love the pita chips, Joe made them fresh! I swing by when I&apos;m in the area, highly recommend this hidden gem!"
5,"I have been eating at Joe&apos;s for several years now. His restaurant is a very important part of our neighborhood! I cannot express enough about my love for the food here. His falafel has won best falafel in Los Angeles according to the L.A. Weekly for good cause and also won Best 100 restaurants in America in 2015 and 2016. I usually get the lemon chicken shawarma sandwich with a few falafels on the side and lots of GARLIC SAUCE!  Thanks for remaining open during Covid Joe. Great seeing you today, always brightens my day!

5,"Does bigger necessarily mean better???  

Nope, but it doesn&apos;t hurt, if the food itself, actually falls into the &apos;better&apos; category, which Joe&apos;s Falafel 100% does...

The word &apos;better&apos;, is also in reference to the service I always get here... In the times of COVID, Joe, himself works the counter and makes sure that the customer gets what they want...  For example, if I&apos;m not feeling like devouring a mountain of fries, Joe will fully accommodate, if I ask for half rice and half salad when buying a combo meal...

Heck...  If you&apos;re really nice, sometime he&apos;ll offer you a piece of cake...  You gotta be nice though, or no cake for you....

The prices are more than reasonable considering the portions, as mentioned earlier....

I come here because Joe&apos;s Falafel wrap is one of the best on the Blvd.  It&apos;s about 25% bigger than the average Mediterranean food joint, but most importantly, it doesn&apos;t fall all over the place when taking a bite because of the wrap, is moist, fluffy and delicious...

There is also always the perfect amount of tahini and hummus, inside the wrap, to bind all of the filling together without dripping out of the pita wrap...

Trust me, it&apos;s delicious...

When I was working with the studios in the area, as a Production Coordinator, would often cater with Joe&apos;s because of the superior options and quality, for every one, including Mediterranean vegetarian/vegan options....

If you are looking to cater from office events to the Super Bowl, I highly recommend this place!!?"
5,"Joe&apos;s is my favorite go-to place for Mediterranean food!
I&apos;ve been coming here for years and I&apos;m always extremely happy with the quality of the food. Our neighborhood is lucky to have Joes!!"
5,The food was amazing I&apos;m not good at this. Just know the FOOD was to die for! Better than panini #facts
