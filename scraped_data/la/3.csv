5,"LOVED this ramen! Quick delivery during COVID via DoorDash. 

I got the smaller sized ramen and found it was more than enough. So awesome they let you customize your add-ins. I like my ramen spicy (but not too spicy) and I found a level above mild to be perfect. I was a little nervous!

The gyoza was also so delicious. We got the vegetarian and the beef. 

Garlic edamame was 12/10. 

Can&apos;t recommend this place enough!"
5,"Covid delivery review:
Oooooooof this hit the spot! It&apos;s pretty cold out here in LA today so what&apos;s better than a brothy ramen soup?! I got their regular slurpin&apos; ramen and let me tell you. It&apos;s delicious, flavorful and everything you&apos;ll expect and more. Some ramen soup are way too creamy to the point where it&apos;s too thick and not slurpable but not this one! The fried rice with cha siew is a must as well! All I have to say is you won&apos;t be disappointed!!"
5,"I&apos;m pretty particular about my japanese ramens and spot does NOT disappoint! 

Honestly I loveeeeee their broth, it has the perfect kick with a clean broth. I always get the tonkatsu ramen with level 3 spice with chashu pork, add bean sprouts. So good! Highlight of the dish is the broth, I never leave a drop behind! 

I&apos;ve been togoing it due to Covid and it always holds up well. I warm up the broth and its delicious in the comforts of my mom! 

-takoyaki is also pretty good side dish that i love 

Would definitely be back!"
4,"Wow. I have soo much to say. First of all, thank you Slurpin Angels for making such delicious Ramen, and all the other stuff. :) America!! America, I was such a fatty! Wait till I share with y&apos;all! 

After a long day of essential work  I decided to have a late night super charged cheat meal!  I obviously searched up &quot; Ramen&quot; on Yelp,  decided on the first few options, filtered highest reviews. 

Slurping&apos; Ramen! - winner winner 

My least favorite= the bulgogi roll.... I was just not into the cheese and jalapeños ... It was not what I expected. 

Fatty pork= WOW!! 

Shishito shishito = Double Wow! Not spicy at all, perfectly made for me. 

Ramen= WOW.  My dearest Slurpin Ramen, you made my heart smile. I&apos;m sure I will regret it tomorrow during my jog but let&apos;s not worry about that right now! YOLO right!  

I didn&apos;t see the seaweed, I also asked for no green onions but It&apos;s okay, I forgive you. My love for Ramen is once again burning. I was afraid my sophisticated taste buds weren&apos;t into Ramen, but you SLURPIN RAMEN brought back my love for such delicious heavy dish. My belly and heart, are satisfied. 

Thank you Slurpin&apos; Ramen ‍ 

Hasta next time."
3,"This is only for the veggie ramen, FYI. 

First, the customer service was great and friendly!

The veggie ramen was okay. The broth wasn&apos;t unflavorful, but not super interesting. Comes with sliced grape tomatoes, bean sprouts, spinach, red cabbage, and white mushroom. I got 2 additional toppings with the Yelp check-in: sliced shiitake mushroom and green onion. Also, it KINDA tasted like a couple ingredients had been sliced by someone wearing lotion? Could&apos;ve just been my imagination, but... eeeh.

(Yelpers, where is your must-eat veggie ramen in LA?)"
5,"This ramen restaurant is on S. Serrano Avenue between 8th Street and James M. Wood Blvd. You should be able to find your parking without any difficulties as there is a medium-sized parking lot available in the shopping center. If you are unable to find your parking spot, you can also try to park in the nearby residential area.

Unlike a typical ramen place, they offer only one type of broth (tonkotsu).
Consequently, ordering is easy as you would only need to choose a size, type of meat, spice level, and any additional toppings. Tsukemen, Chashu Bowl, appetizers &amp; sides are also available, and for those health-conscious ones, this place does offer the vegetarian ramen noodles.

There is plenty of seating at this place with friendly service. I generally do not prefer the Tonkotsu flavor; however, I like their Tonkotsu because of its rich, thick, and creamy broth. And I hope you will try this place if you have not yet done so as this place currently seems to be the best ramen place in the Korea Town area in Los Angeles!"
4,"Pretty bomb ramen, definitely one of my favorites.
Love all the ads-in options, pretty nice ambiance (love the window bar stool seats) and decently priced. Lines can build up but we&apos;ve been lucky so far and never waited more than 5 minutes the 3 times we&apos;ve gone.

We got the Slurpin Ramen - comes with green onions, dried seaweed (can live without this), black garlic oil, and your choice of meat. Got one with chicken and one with tofu with a spicy level 3 (&quot;super spicy&quot; not really that spicy we added extra hot sauce lol). Add-In Toppings: bean sprouts, egg, shiitake mushrooms, garlic and crunchy garlic and onion.

Would definitely recommend it to others and would go back."
4,"The ramen was good and the broth was tasty -- very creamy and smooth with juicy meat. I ordered the fatty pork which was a great choice.

Only downsides was they overcharged us and it was a bit pricey. 

Decent option for if you&apos;re craving ramen."
5,"We were in town for a vacation and were craving ramen so we jumped on Yelp, found Slurpin&apos; Ramen Bar and decided to give it a try since the place has so many good reviews. We do not have a lot of good ramen where we are from and we&apos;re excited to try something in LA, I am so glad we picked Slurpin&apos;. We joined the waitlist on Yelp since it showed a 30 min wait, to my surprise we were seated immediately as soon as we arrived.

My husband and I shared the Takoyaki and Soft Shell crab appetizers. The Takoyaki was delicious, probably the best we had so far. The creamy filling and octopus tasted great. The soft shell crab was pretty good as well.

We both got the Tonkotsu Ramen with chachu. For toppings I picked a seasoned egg, bamboo shoots, and shiitake mushrooms. The broth was delicious, creamy, full of flavor and enough spice ( I got #2, spicy level.) The service was friendly and very fast. The restaurant is somewhat small but cozy and nicely decorated.

This is definitely a must try if you love Ramen!"
5,"Slurpin ramen is the best ramen in LA, hands down. There&apos;s no competition, their broth is the best broth I&apos;ve ever had in my life. Perfect for a cold or rainy night when you&apos;re too tired to cook and feeling cold or down. I always get my soup with an egg. Highly recommend!"
5,If you&apos;re craving good sushi this is the spot. Took a while for the food to come out but was well worth the wait.
5,"If you like creamy base ramen, this is your spot! As a ramen fanatic, I totally approve this place! Things to note:
- the chashu and the fatty pork tasted very similar
- level 3 super spicy is not THAT spicy
- fried squid leg also very delicious
Will definitely be coming back for more!"
1,"Asked why they wouldn&apos;t take Apple Pay while giving them my second payment method, credit card. But this guys thinks i&apos;m disrespecting him asking that question. Yelp doesn&apos;t take video so i couldn&apos;t post the whole video; I&apos;m just posting a screenshot from it. 
So much attitude and ego. Can&apos;t employ people like these and make them face of your business."
5,The broth here is so yummy. Keeps me coming back for more. Sesame chicken is also super tasty. Friendly staff and quick service
5,"Delicious. I came in for lunch and got their lunch special. I got a slurpin ramen with fatty pork, soft shelled crab for an appetizer and the side salad. Everything was cooked to absolute perfection and seasoned beautifully. The broth is light and fresh and the crab was perfectly fried and crispy. The staff was kind, helpful and safe. I really enjoyed my experience and plan to become a regular customer. I&apos;d be happy to show picture but I ate it too fast!"
4,"Came here with a girlfriend during covid and there was outdoor seating for dine-in which was great and refreshing. great service. I ordered the spicy chicken ramen which was the perfect amount of spice I might&apos;ve added a little more spice, lol. flavor was there loved the soft gooey egg, although I like my noodles a tad thinner. 
my friend ordered the vegetarian ramen. She says that there was a good amount of vegetables and broth had good flavor."
5,"Slurpin&apos; is one of my favorite ramen spots in LA! Their prices are the best in the city-- you can&apos;t find this high of quality ramen for this low of a price anywhere else. I love that they offer small and large portion options. Although they don&apos;t offer a wide range of different types of ramen, their Tonkatsu is very delicious. I love all of their toppings options. Great broth and noodles. When I lived in Koreatown, this was my go-to. Now that I live in Hollywood, my new favorite is Kai Ramen, but Slurpin&apos; will always be one of my faves. Highly recommend for anyone in the area!!! I&apos;ve tried multiple other ramen spots in Koreatown, but always found myself coming back here."
1,"I&apos;m surprised this place is still open. Their ramen is the worst I&apos;ve had, there is no flavor or richness to the soup."
5,"Food here is amazing, the best Ramen ever. I highly recommend getting in your Ramen thank you"
3,Felt cheated tonight unfortunately. This place is always a 5 star quality and service  and it&apos;s always amazing but we ordered 2 regular ramens and were given 2 small ones. I can&apos;t even finish my serving usually and save it for the morning and tonight I had no choice but to stay hungry and I finished it all because they ripped us off in the portion size. I&apos;ll change my rating back to 5 stars if this doesn&apos;t happen again for a while but today it was so obvious it was kind of insulting to be honest and this place is always on top of it.
