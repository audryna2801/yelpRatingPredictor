5,"This was absolutely the best Korean BBQ take-out I&apos;ve ever had. \

The Bento box lunch special is discounted at bargain bin prices, a whole lotta food, and is simply scrumptious.


To the cashier&apos;s recommendation, I ordered the Bento Box pork sweet and spicy.

Now, I usually go with the short rib Kalbi or beef brisket.

Venturing out of my comfort zone, I must order this dish moving forward for future Korean bbq spots.

Absolutely everything in the Bento box was perfect. No stone was left unturned. Uneaten.

The white sticky rice with the red, radish  pepper sauce.

The cool, soba noodle salad

The Korean bbq potato salad.

The side salad.

And the spicy, sweet bbq.

Truly amazing. Sharp marinating flavors. Kick of spice, but the dish has a remarkable coolant aftertaste, and that&apos;s when the spice turns to sweet.

14 dollars for a whole days worth of food. Would absolutely return.

5/5"
5,"My favorite place to get my Korean food/Korean bbq fix !
My bf and I get this place for dinner all the time.
We usually alternate between the brisket and the Bulgogi
 bento box.

As you can see in the photo, the bento box comes with salad, macaroni salad, fish cake, japchae noodles, rice, and your meat on a pile of grilled onions. The salad comes with a dressing and the meat will come with a dressing as well. 

The quality and flavor of everything is delicious!
It has yet to fail us in anyway.
They offer outdoor seating if you&apos;re comfortable.

*recommended to try their other restaurant-- CHICKEN HUT ! Their chicken is pretty bomb as well."
5,"My family had been craving Korean BBQ and so they decided to order from bulgogi hut. I had never had it and I have to admit it was really good and the amount of food you get for the price is good. We ordered the family pack which comes with miso soup, salad, macaroni salad, and other sides as well as 1 choice of meat. Any other additional meat is $14. 

We ordered delivery and the food arrived hot and it came with utensils and everything you might need to enjoy your dinner.

I can&apos;t wait to go try Bulgogi Hut after Covid is over. Nothing beats sitting down and eating Korean bbq with friends or family."
3,"Hello America.  Okay so let&apos;s get down to business.. I found bulgogi hut on a random day that I was driving down Wiltshire blvd. The smell is what caught my attention obviously.  Who doesn&apos;t enjoy Korean bbq, especially with a good group and some good chisme!! 
 
Pros: 

* COVID19 safety rules followed.
*Good for groups, each little group is separated and clear plastic wall between each table. 
*Service is fast, which is great because I&apos;m usually ready to eat. If not I can get hangry. 

It&apos;s good place, meat taste good, nothing extra ordinary. The restaurant is clean and you get great service. 

I feel like it&apos;s a little overpriced, the menu doesn&apos;t have a huge selection as other places. Depends on which package you want, premium or deluxe I think... would I come back, maybe. 

Is it on my top list, not really. The employees are great, super nice, super safe during the pandemic. 

If I try to take all my kids, I definitely wouldn&apos;t be able to afford it, but on a date it&apos;s okay. 

Hasta next time"
5,"Such a great way to end our short trip in SoCal. My boyfriend wanted kbbq for lunch and found Bulgogi Hut through Yelp. We saw they had a happy hour for lunch which was definitely a nice plus but we opted for the deluxe option instead to have more variety and I&apos;m so glad we did! We ended up LOVING the cheese dip, cheese corn, rib finger, flab meat, and sesame beef options that came with the deluxe.

Was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the rib finger and flab meat. The marinade tastes similar to the marinated meats at quarters/kang ho imo. Tip: ask for jalapeños and let it cook in the cheese dip. The jalapeño, cheese, and marinated meats are an amazing combo to have in a single bite.. yum!

This may be our new favorite AYCE kbbq spot in LA. Great price, great quality, and great service.

ALSO HUGE PLUS - they have their own lot you can park for free. Just make sure to validate your parking ticket at the restaurant. Sometimes we avoid getting kbbq in LA bc of the parking madness but bulgogi hut makes it SO easy!"
5,"Super yummy cook-it-yourself, ayce Korean bbq at a very affordable price! Also free parking in the back by bank of hope (don&apos;t forget to get your ticket validated)! Otherwise it is street parking. There was no wait when I went at 5pm ish, but there was a line around the time I left. You can join the waitlist on yelp. Service was also great, ask staff for meat reccomendations if you&apos;d like. My personal favorite was the marinated rib finger and beef tongue from the deluxe menu."
5,"I had a beautiful night with my friend at your restaurant for dinner last night! Our server Paul was so amazing and accommodating to us. He gave us all the positive energy we needed. The food was amazing and our server made sure we had the juiciest meat in our mouths all night. We will definitely be back thanks to how good the food was and Paul&apos;s beautiful energy.

P.S. please let Paul know that my Instagram handle is @phoenixbloood ‍"
4,"Open for outdoor seating as of 2/8. They require you to check in, but you can put your name ahead on the Yelp checklist!

We did the deluxe $37 all you can eat. I like the variety of Banchan here and the meats are good enough for this price range."
5,"Today is March 8, 2021 the service at this place only gets better and better today our server was Sandra what a beautiful women with her tag team making sure we are always set with different types of meet look for Sandra she&apos;s the best :-) happy birthday Sandra wishing you the best thanks for an awesome service"
5,"I ordered through Postmates for the first time. Best 2020 decision I&apos;ve ever made!! Authentic, fresh and delicious Korean food!

The quality was incredible and the portion sizes were perfect for a group of 4.

My favorite Korean food restaurant is Soot Bull Jeep, Yellow House Cafe, and, now, Bulgogi hut!"
5,"Excellent service, excellent meats. Our servers were Judy and Paul, they were both fantastic. We always do Kbbq, and this place is definitely one of the best."
5,"Bulgogi Hut has always been my favorite kbbq joint in Koreatown. It&apos;s the place I find myself going to when I only have about $25 to my name but am craving some good bulgogi and kimchi. No, you won&apos;t find all the fancy frills here like some of their local competitors *cough* Quarters *cough*, but you&apos;ll find a price that is hard to beat and a flavor that is undeniably good. I&apos;m a simple kind of guy, and Bulgogi hut has always been good at fulfilling my spur of the moment cravings and for that, I am forever grateful.

To be honest, I was wary about going post COVID-19 measures since I know A LOT of places have gone down in both quality and service, but I was pleasantly surprised that it was still on par with how they normally operate! You&apos;ll still find their free parking lot (honestly 5 stars for this alone), an affordable price for standard AYCE at $25, and excellent service! And although they&apos;re probably well known for their bulgogi, I could survive off of their brisket alone - it&apos;s very meaty and has barely any fat. The servings that they bring out are also pretty hefty which is nice compared to other places that skimp out on you *cough* Quarters *cough*.

Overall, if you&apos;re looking to get the best bang for your buck and leave a happy camper then give this place a shot! 

Tips
+ I recommend reserving a spot on Yelp before arriving - it can get pretty busy on weeknights and weekends
+ Parking lot provides free 2 hour parking
+ They have plenty of outdoor dining and I felt relatively safe eating there
+ Walking distance to a lot of K-town landmarks, i.e. The Wiltern, Line Hotel, etc."
5,"This spot is always busy so do expect to wait for a good 30 minutes. If Yelp waitlist is open, you&apos;re lucky! The portable grill is kinda small for such a big table but it does it job so I&apos;m still happy. 
Our server was Anna and she was amazing &amp; sweet! She was constantly checking on our table and making sure we got what we ordered. There was also another waiter who I believe was solely in charge of delivering meat who was also amazing. He was running here and there to serve food, which I truly appreciate the fast service! I&apos;ll give 8/10 for the food, but 15/10 for the servers!"
5,"Lani (sorry if it&apos;s misspelled) was great!  We had a great experience and the food here is so good! Good service, well priced, and a wonderful spicy dipping sauce! Covid friendly with a nice patio. 
Really glad this place is able to provide such an enjoyable experience during these times."
5,"I ordered through Grub Hub! The food was delicious. I purchased the Bento Box with Bulgogi! It was very filling. I didn&apos;t know the box would offer so many options! It came with a a side of rice with egg, salad with dressing, macaroni salad, noodles and a miso soup. Everything was so delicious! 

Highly recommend either the Bulgogi which has a sweet taste to it or the chicken which has a bourbon taste to it."
3,"I found Bulgogi hut when I was waiting in line for BCD since it&apos;s across the street and I noticed that it was very popular with very long lines so I decided to try it.

First off, the wait is atrocious. I had to wait 1.5 hours at 5 PM! Use the Yelp Waitlist App before you start heading out. This will cut your wait time or else you will need to drive there, physically add your name to the wait list, and wait over an hour.

To be honest, during my wait, there were empty tables that had like 6 or 4 seats. More people could have been served and less waiting. 

Service here is okay, the meat request is fast, however requesting other things take much longer like a refill or additional items like rice paper, etc. The ban chan here is good but there isn&apos;t much. You get kimchi, radish, and potato salad. Kimchi is a bit on the sour side. 

The meat quality is okay. Some things are better than others. I recommend the beef belly over the brisket, skip the pork belly and rib finger, and order the bulgogi and marinated flap meat.

The beef belly here is great and is a nice cut, bulgogi is good and is not too sweet, the marinated flap meat tastes like bulgogi but it takes longer to cook.

Would skip the marinated rib fingers because there&apos;s a lot of cartilage which make it hard to cook. 

The main issue with my experience is actually the cooking. The grill doesn&apos;t get hot enough which ends up tasting like pan fried meat. Also they took away steamed egg so that was also a huge disappointment. 

Overall, 3/5. Would try once and see if you like it, for me it&apos;s not worth the wait and the cost of the limited selection of meat plus no steamed egg."
5,"Bulgogi Hut never disappoints. Really good food, good service, and all at an  amazing price. Since COVID hit, the bento box has been our go-to take out meal. Its perfect, meat, 3 sides, salad, rice w/ a fried egg on top. Highly recommend to everyone. Literally any meat choice is bomb."
4,"Ok I love this place but my reason for 4 stars is this spicy soup? I usually get ssambap and it comes with a small soup, I used to love their soybean paste soup but I don&apos;t know if they have a new cook or what but their new soup taste too salty and spicy so I decided to get tofu soup instead, never in my life have I ever seen a fire red tofu soup? I should&apos;ve ordered a miso soup, I&apos;m pretty sure my friend got a tofu soup the other day and it did not look like this. What is this?? This looks like kimchi soup. I can not eat spicy food so I&apos;m just gonna have to throw this away smh at least they should say it&apos;s spicy even tho I don&apos;t think tofu soup it&apos;s supposed to be spicy unless u getting the type of soup u get at bcd... Besides that I love their ssambap."
4,"Came on Wednesday night around 7:30ish with a group of 7 and while it was relatively busy, we only waited about 10 minutes before we got seated! The server was very attentive and communicated with us the whole time about our tables being cleaned for us. 
As soon as we sat that a waiter came and immediately took our order, and our food came out not even a minute later! The service was prompt and everyone was very helpful and extremely friendly. 
The food was so, so good! It&apos;s been about a year since I had kbbq and I&apos;m so happy Bulgogi Hut was my first choice for kbbq. The brisket, finger meat, and beef tongue were my absolute favorite! And it doesn&apos;t even break the bank whether you get deluxe or premium for the amount of food you get, ON TOP of the amazing service being provided! 
Bulgogi Hut is obviously well equipped and ready to handle this pandemic as all the tables are socially distanced, and further protected with covered walls in between, but see through so you can still engage with your friends if you come in a group! Overall a really amazing night, and I can&apos;t wait to come back!"
5,"First off, shout out to Sandra for the awesome service. It was our first time here and every time we were having trouble choosing what to order  she would offer recommendations. The service was super efficient. Sandra was very punctual and made it a thing to always ask if we needed anything. I highly recommend!!"
