5,"Do you want to know where to enjoy the best dan dan noodle in America?  You&apos;re reading about it now.

It&apos;s subjective what&apos;s the &quot;best&quot; dan dan noodle, but I&apos;ve tried a lot of dan dan noodles in this country (and in Taiwan), and the award goes to Pine &amp; Crane.

How can I convince you that they have the best noodle?  The secret lies in the balance of ingredients and flavors.  Anyone can toss the basic condiments together and call it dan dan noodle.  After all, the components of the traditional recipe aren&apos;t sophisticated, but it takes a discerning chef to understand the perfect ratio.

The peanut sauce offers an earthy undertone to the noodles, and the sliced cucumbers lends a refreshing crispness.  The cilantro isn&apos;t overwhelming, and the chili oil doesn&apos;t fry your taste buds.  Everything swims around in your mouth in perfect harmony.

The noodle tastes hand-made.  It&apos;s tender and springy, and it has just enough chewiness to slow down your attempt at devouring the whole concoction.

Their beef rolls are also satisfying, but I am not quite as impressed by them as their noodles.  I also had the interesting experience of eating a taro milk tea with chopsticks.  The high caliber recyclable straw provided is sufficient to allow the passage of boba balls, but not large enough to draw up the large chunks of sweetened taro pieces in the drink.  This is not a bad thing at all.  I love the generous pieces of taro, as they never come so large in the other taro milk teas.  Since I am lactose intolerant like 80% of humans, I requested oat milk as the base, and it&apos;s perfect with the taro flavor.  I didn&apos;t have to finick with the sweetness level either.  The default is already perfect.

Service was friendly.  I arrived ten minutes before they opened, but Amy took my order anyway.  My drink was ready within minutes, and I waited for a bit longer for the noodle and beef rolls.

The only downside is the lack of parking.  I don&apos;t know where the other patrons parked, but I parked temporarily at the stop sign to wait for my order.  Perhaps the green surface covers an existing parking lot during the pandemic to expand outdoor dining space."
5,"To begin with, their customer service is phenomenal. Door dash had messed up our take out pick up order time and had it made an hour earlier than it was supposed to be. I was not able to pick up my order an hour earlier because I had work. I called the restaurant to let them know of our situation and they were so nice enough to make the order for our original time. I thank them so much for being so caring of customer needs.

Now to the food...phenomenal as well!!! We ordered minced pork bowls, beef rolls, pork buns, and wood eared mushrooms. Everything was finger licking good. We ate this delicious meal while we watched WandaVision at home. Perfect way to end the weekday. Definitely will order again from this gem of a restaurant."
5,"No matter what you get here, you can&apos;t go wrong! Prior to COVID, this place was popping with a constant line to order. Nowadays, takeout is a smooth process. I definitely miss the lively atmosphere of dining in, but the food here travels well and is a great takeout option.

Honestly, all of the food is delicious. You can&apos;t go wrong with your order. However, if you want some guidance on what to get, I&apos;d recommend getting 2-3 small plates (at least one of them a cold item) and 2 noodle/rice dishes for two people. You&apos;ll definitely still have leftovers, but trust me-- you&apos;re gonna have enough trouble whittling down your choices to 5!

While I rotate through the menu, a couple of items I get more often than not are the woodear mushrooms (gotta love the texture) and dandan noodles (missing the Sichuan numbing obviously, but the peanut flavor is on point).

Also don&apos;t sleep on getting a drink-- the tea and beer selection is lovely and if you can&apos;t choose between the two, make a shandy ;)"
2,"Food is just okay! It&apos;s not as great as other reviewers said. We ordered online and it took over an hour to get our food. Not authentic enough for me. Parking sucks! 

I ordered pork over rice and it was just average! The five cups chicken was also very average!!! 

I would not recommend this place."
5,"I learned about Pine and crane from Today Start here, a sister restaurant who sells taiwanese breakfast. They told me I can buy spicy oil here. 

I casually ordered beef rolls, buns and spicy dumplings. They are authentic and great! But I forgot to order the spicy oil lol oh my god"
3,"I must say, this spot is just average. I&apos;ve had better spicy shrimp wontons and definitely had better pork Mapo tofu. There wasn&apos;t enough spice and was missing some ooooofphm in it (if you know what I mean). Overall everything was mediocre but the passionfruit tea helped with hangover."
3,"Beef noodle soup was terrible. The broth was one of the worst I&apos;ve tasted. Very disappointed, but the pork dumplings were fantastic. Along with the three cup jidori chicken. A small dash of salt and it was perfection. The portion was enough for two meals. But tht May be subjective bcx I was pretty satisfied by the dumplings and amazing aea salt  milk tea that almost brought tears of joy lol"
4,"I have to admit, I had my hesitation for another expensive hipster Asian restaurant, but the food is definitely on the good side. I got the beef noodle soup and the pork buns. The pork buns is definitely delicious, the beef noodle soup was a bit bland to me, but it tasted better with the spicy sauce. The noodles and buns together costed $21, so this place is more on the pricey end. But food is also good.

I would bring my friends here if I&apos;m around the area, but COME EARLY. We showed up around 6:30pm and didn&apos;t get in until 8pm. It is a looong wait, so come early to avoid the crowds"
5,"For a nice casual meal, this place is perfect. My go to is the Dan Dan noodles.  I first tried these noodles at pine and crane about 6 months ago and was blown away. I tried Dan Dan noodles at other restaurants and wasn&apos;t impressed. This place does them much better.

No dine in now but there is a nice little park area next door and you can sit there and enjoy the meal. There are stores next door where you can get a nice beverage if you don&apos;t like what pine and crane offers."
5,"I actually LOVE this place. I feel like their food is amazing, made with clearly superior ingredients, and the atmosphere is so chill. We&apos;ve gone here before and during covid and have been really happy with the service and food quality every time.  We&apos;ve tried about ten of their plates and none of them are ever disappointing. 

Their new online ordering for pick-up is extremely fast and easy to use.  Refreshing after so many businesses don&apos;t have great websites/ways to order easily.  Also very fast; our food was ready 20 min after online ordering, even during the dinner rush. 
They also have tons of menu options for vegans/vegetarians and restrictive diets.  Super diverse menu.  
Definitely will be back many more times."
4,"We picked up some food from here yesterday. I realized that I never wrote a review for this great restaurant. First time we`ve been to this place beginning this year when &quot;inside dining&quot; was still available. We really enjoyed the Dan Dan Noodles, Minced Pork on Rice, Pan Fried Pork Buns and Spicy Shrimp Wontons. We ordered 2x Dan Dan Noodles and Spicy Shrimp Wontons yesterday. The taste is so good and fresh! I love the sesame-peanut sauce mixed with the chili oil, which has the perfect amount of flavor and spice level, if you stir everything well.
Very affordable for this location. Unfortunately we don`t live close to this place, but will definitely be back. Thank you!"
5,"This is the best restaurant in LA 

The vibe from the moment you walk up to the place is different, you get a simple, welcoming atmosphere from the overall aesthetic from the dining room to the sneak peak into the kitchen while you&apos;re ordering

Our go to order is the Beef Roll, the Panfried Pork Buns, Scallion Pancake, Dan Dan Noodles, Wonton Soup and Passion Boba tea and Green Boba tea.

The quality of food that you get here is unmatched, the DanDan noodles will change your life from the first bite to the empty bowl. The comfort from the beef roll sections might leave you fighting for the last piece of incredible goodness and the pancake along with the pork buns will make sure you&apos;re full even if you didn&apos;t get the last bite of beef roll

I especially love their chili oil that is provided on the side which granted, is not needed since the bursts of flavor are tucked into every corner of this menu

The service you get here whether its takeout only or a dine in experience is second to none, there is a casual welcoming nature to the overall experience that makes you want to come back on a weekly basis, which admittedly, we try to do any chance we get

Top tier for sure"
5,"Pine &amp; Crane is the #1 best spot for lunch in Los Angeles!  The Dan Dan noodles and Sea Salt Cream Black Tea with boba are outstanding!  Do yourself a favor and follow my steps below for an EPIC Saturday afternoon:

1. Go on a Saturday morning.  Maybe grab some coffee at the Silverlake Farmers Market and walk around the different booths which include vintage clothing/jewelry, fresh produce, and beautiful flowers.  Around 10:30am a line will slowly start to form outside the restaurant.  Make sure you get in that line early after your nice morning stroll.  Pine &amp; Crane opens promptly at 11am and it will get busy!
2.  When it is your turn to order, these are my recommendations (in order from &quot;must-have&quot; to good): Dan Dan Noodles, Sea Salt Cream Black Tea with boba (my favorite boba I have ever had), Shrimp Wontons, Minced Pork on Rice, Scallion Pancake, and the Beef Roll.  It is very easy to share a few items because there are sharing plates and bowls to the right of where you placed your order.  This is also where the water is located.
3. Typically right after you order you will receive a number to place on your table.  A kind staff member will usually let you know the best table for you to take (especially when it is super busy).
4. Enjoy the best lunch ever!

The Silverlake Farmers Market closes around 1:30pm, so if you wanted to see something again, I would make sure you are aware of the time.

Note: During Covid, they are doing takeout and it is still just as delicious!  

Enjoy your Saturday afternoon!"
5,"BEST restaurant in Silverlake, and one of my FAVORITE restaurants in LA. If you&apos;ve never been, Pine &amp; Crane&apos;s a Michelin guide restaurant with very affordable options and authentic Taiwanese food. A MUST TRY

I&apos;ve gone to Pine &amp; Crane probably 7+ times, and I finally took pictures of the meal before immediately vacuuming the dishes into my mouth. There are multiple items you must try (below in order of my favorite):
- Dan Dan noodles
- pork bao buns
- mapo tofu (pork)
- beef roll
- spicy shrimp wontons
- jidori chicken

The pork bao are not always available as they sell out quickly, but I&apos;ve usually been able to order the noodles, mapo tofu, and the beef roll every time I went. Either types of the mapo tofu are incredible. Pour it over a side of rice, and you&apos;ll be in for a treat. 

Parking is super tough, so I&apos;d definitely call for a pick-up order. You have to park the street down from the restaurant if you want to dine in on the converted patio. 

I&apos;ll be back soon, and hope to see you there!"
4,"Pine &amp; Crane is always pretty dependably bomb, even when it&apos;s take out. Hands down my favorite is the spicy shrimp dumplings, but to date I haven&apos;t tried any of their dishes and not liked them."
3,"I would love to try the food in-person. This review is based on my take-out experience during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I felt like the restaurant could have used better takeout containers to preserve the food. Unfortunately, by the time we received the food everything was soggy and cold. I would not recommend the Dan Dan Noodles for take out. 

In regard to their flavors, overall salty. 

My favorite items were: bamboo appetizer, beef roll, and chicken thigh entree.

Pork buns lacked flavor and the pork belly appetizer had a funny taste."
5,"Tasty food for a decent price point! They also have an outdoor area now, very spacious and COVID compliant. 

We ordered:
- shrimp wonton - yum. it was both sweet and a lil spicy
- beef roll - loved the wrap, reminded me of roti
- minced pork over rice - this was good but I&apos;d try something else over this the next time
- passion fruit black tea w/ boba - refreshing"
4,"Love Taiwanese food and in LA what?!? There&apos;s plenty of Taiwanese food in 626 but rarely is there a good one in LA. It&apos;s a bit pricey compared to 626 but if you don&apos;t want to drive so far for Taiwanese food then this is the spot for you. 

This is a COVID take out review, I ordered beef rolls and dan dan noodles. I really liked their dan dan noodles it had a good mixture of sesame and peanut flavor and there was cucumbers for that crunch and some veggies.  The noodles were perfect and chewy and ugh I am dreaming about these noodles while typing my review. 
The beef rolls were good but I had better I think I need to try it fresh and on the spot since I had mines togo. I see a lot of people hyping up the Jidori chicken so probably will try that next time. 

With covid going on you can order ahead on their website and pick up was super easy. Glad to have been able to visit this Taiwanese restaurant in LA will be coming back to try different things."
5,"We ordered delivery from Pine &amp; Crane and were BLOWN AWAY. We got the minced pork over rice, panfried pork buns, Dan Dan noodles, and the beef roll, based on what seemed popular. The food kept very well during delivery- can&apos;t imagine how good it would be dine-in! 

All dishes were great. The pork buns were soft and airy with juicy pork and cabbage inside. They come with 6 buns. The Dan Dan noodles were AMAZING- great noodle consistency with a delicious peanut-based sauce. The beef roll was equally as delicious- a crispy roll with flavorful beef and veggies inside. The pork over rice was very good, but didn&apos;t quite blow us away like the other dishes.

All in all, we had a wonderful experience and will certainly be ordering from here again!!"
5,"Wow was not expecting this to be so delicious and authentic! Lives up to the hype in my opinion!

Came here for a late Sunday afternoon lunch with a friend and there was no wait. We had the minced pork with rice and the pan fried pork buns. Both were so so tasty and reasonably priced! The tea egg that comes with the rice was so good and overall the pickled radish (? I think?) went well with the meat and rice.

And the pork buns...they retained the fluffiness of a bao but managed to be crispy enough on the bottom and slightly juicy inside. The meat was flavorful but not overpowering, and it complements the slightly sweet vinegar at your table.

Would definitely recommend coming here for comfort Taiwanese dishes at great prices. The ingredients here are a lot fresher than at other Taiwanese places, and retains the authentic flavor in a hip environment. Will return!"
