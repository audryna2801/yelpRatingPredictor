5,"Pre covid review:

Been here twice when I have visited LA in the past and let me tell you, these do not disappoint! I have had quite a few tacos over the course of my life so take my word for it when I say these truly are some of the best tacos out there! Guisados specializes in stewed meat and vegetarian tacos, and all of their meat tacos were so juicy and full of flavor on a fresh and warm corn tortilla. The best part was that despite the juicyness of the taco, the tortilla held well the entire time! Tried the fish, chicken, and pork tacos (from what I remember) and they were all delicious! 

Parking in the area is a bit difficult since it is located on a main street, so if you are going to pick up just be aware that this is the case."
5,"This taco place is absolutely incredible. You know that you are eating legit Mexican street tacos when you watch them make the tortillas in the front window! They have an amazing variety of fillings including steaks, chicken, tinga, chorizo, Chile verde, and mole. All were amazing and had a very authentic taste. I would have to say the favorite was the mole and chorizo was the second favorite. The chorizo is very spicy though so be aware if that isn&apos;t your thing.

They are doing a great job with COVID. You order inside and go out the back for outdoor seating. There aren&apos;t many people in the building at the same time. You must where a mask!

Enjoy! You won&apos;t regret getting street tacos here!!"
5,"I&apos;ve never had tacos quite like Guisados tacos, &amp; wish I had them sooner, they are amazing!
Truly stewy deliciousness !
The tortillas are soft you can clearly tell homemade.
Each taco we tried had a unique flavor. Everything from the juice that dropped onto to the plate, to the meat &amp; topping were fresh and tasty. Definitely coming back here or one of their many other locations.
I specifically loved their outdoor seating in the back, great for these social distance times.
All the staff was wearing masks and I saw them sanitizing the tables after people left."
5,"The owner Armando is such a cool person, I highly recommend this establishment to anyone that&apos;s in the area of Echo Park and wants some love &amp; flavor to their taste buds! All the meats are a must try! I always stop by this place at least 20 times a year! 

Thanks Armando... your such a chill cool dude, don&apos;t ever let the world change you!"
5,"Just another Legendary LA Taco spot where they make fresh tortillas in front of you and some authentic Mexican stuff that you won&apos;t usually see! 

After having this spot on my list for almost two years, I finally came by when I was in the area! I love this place and I love the incredible vibe, delicious tacos and simplicity of their concept. 

I tried their chicken mole and it was something outstanding flavors and I also got one of their flank steak tacos and it was insanely good, the flavors were bell peppers with some tomatoes and spices. Simple yet sophisticated taste. Moreover, I wanted to try as much stuff as possible so I also got one fish taco and I was shocked with the tremendous goodness and deliciousness I didn&apos;t think they would have such an amazing fish tacos!"
3,"Pre-COVID review
While in LA meeting a buddy we tried this taco place that came out I believe on some tv show.
It was definitely a different take from the tacos that I&apos;m used to eating from a taco truck or Mexican diner. 
The tacos are on the smaller size and there is a robust of flavors particularly if you get the taco sampler. Yes, tortillas are made in front of you...but they do the same at El Torito on Sunday brunch so not as big of a deal?
The tacos here are not cheap but I know rent is expensive out in the West LA area. 
Still, my preference is a good ol&apos; taco truck like El Chato in LA or Jose&apos;s in Whittier. I actually prefer more the chaotic ambience of El Taurino that people don&apos;t like. Perhaps it&apos;s nostalgia but if you get past the language barrier and confusing ordering system it&apos;s great. Different strokes for different folks."
5,"So good - I tend to go a few times a month. I&apos;ve never tried a taco there I didn&apos;t love, especially their weekend breakfast tacos. Pretty good taco prices, I haven&apos;t strayed and tried anything else on the menu yet. Honestly, I probably won&apos;t. The tacos are too good to abandon. The best I&apos;ve had in the area."
4,"I had some friends from out of town and took them to Guisados to initiate them into the taco scene in LA. 

We all got the sampler plate, which was fun, cheap, and tasty. They have an outdoor patio, which is a great place to spend a warm summer night eating tacos and chatting with friends. 

PS: They aren&apos;t joking when they say the Chiles Toreados taco is spicy! We all felt our tongues burning for awhile."
5,This is a solid place to get something to eat - during the pandemic have them pack every thing separate and assemble at home
5,"We love Guisados!!!!

Usually I go to the cesar Chavez location, but today we chose to come here since they offered outdoor dining. 

The taste, quality and service is consistent at each location. The tacos don&apos;t need anything else, they are great the way they come.

4,"I first tried Guisados several years ago, and I remain a fan of this place! I&apos;ve visited a few times during the COVID-19 pandemic, and it&apos;s been a snap to call in orders by phone for pickup. 

Most recently, I&apos;ve ordered the chorizo tacos, and I thought they were excellent. They are stuffed with sausage, and they have a spicy kick from the green Serrano pepper and the Chile de Ã¡rbol. They also come with red onion and black beans, and the entire combination is a juicy and fulfilling couple of bites. The tortillas are made fresh, and overall, I&apos;m impressed with the quality of tacos here.

I&apos;ve also tried their agua frescas, and the limon is tart and refreshing. I&apos;m fairly confident that another Guisados meal is in my future!"
5,A rose in the middle of the concrete jungle of echo park. A quick walk from blue heaven Dodgers stadium. Guisados is my favorite place to get chicken tinga and chorizo quesadillas made on handmade tortillas. The agua fresca isn&apos;t super sweet either which I really really appreciate and enjoy. Staff is friendly and the ambience is my vibe. The sounds from the waterfall fountain splashing in the backdrop of the dining area while you devour tacos is such a vibe! Also while trying not to spill tinga sauce on yourself as well as remembering to breathe in-between bites is what I enjoy most about Guisados. It&apos;s such a delicioso experience everytime I visit!
4,"The taco sampler is one of the coolest, hippest ideas I&apos;ve ever seen. I wish I enjoyed all of them as much as I enjoyed the mole poblano. I think that was a highlight for me, but the other meats (cochinita, chorizo, etc) weren&apos;t as flavorful or good."
5,"I am obsessed with food shows, especially the ones that feature regional culture and food history. I watch so many that I&apos;m not sure which show I watched that featured Guisados. I live in OC but due to COV I haven&apos;t traveled much to LA. 
Thai weekend I did and the #1 place to visit in my list was Guisados. Wow!!! The handmade tortillas are everything!!! I had the sampler platter which is incredibly priced at under $9. I really wanted to try the cochinito pibil, it was Delicious!!! The mole is a must!! They have many vegetarian options as well. 
I will definitely return again!!"
5,"These folks have it down: quality ingredients, flavors, healthful recipes, seriously damn good tacos. And everything else. I go to the Sunset location but their Pasadena spot is great too. It&apos;s a tightly run well oiled machine, never keep you waiting, their pickup service always has a fast-moving line on the sidewalk. Get over there and get you some."
3,"I wanted to like this place, as there were so many good reviews. However, the food was just not for me. All the tacos were not salted enough, and bordered on bland. But the one thing I couldn&apos;t have an appreciation for was how wet/stray/sloppy the stuff was in each taco--it was like one note across all tacos. The restaurant is obviously doing well, so as one reviewer put it... it&apos;s just different strokes for different folks. If I&apos;m in the area again, I&apos;d probably try out the Mexican food stand on the road. Will not be coming back to this restaurant unfortunately."
5,"Ok 1st I am a bit of a weenie when it comes to sauces and condiments so i did get the salsas on the side BUT despite that these tacos were still AMAZING. 

The meat was all tender, juicy and full of flavor. I got one taco with pork, one with chicken and the other with steak and they were all suuuuuper yummy. The tortillas were fresh, tasty and held together really well. 

I got the Armando Palmero which is a mix of the lemon lime agua fresca with the jamaica and it was soo good!!

The cashier was very helpful and patient (it was my first time here). The service was quick, the food came out fast. Everyone was wearing masks, there is outdoor seating..bar style in the front and actual tables in the back (with space heaters now that it&apos;s finally cold). There&apos;s also hand sanitizer available outside too!"
5,Everyone is so friendly and the tacos taste like home! Very authentic Mexican flavors. I am definitely coming back. Excellent service!
5,Absolutely not over-hyped. One of many incredible taquerias in LA :)
4,"Ok the good: the tacos are tasty AF!!! And so many choices that you can go nuts, try everything, and pick out your faves for next time. They are all really flavorful, the ingredients are fresh, and they don&apos;t skimp on the toppings! The bad: the portions are REALLY freakin small for the price! I understand street tacos are small but 3-5 dollars for ONE taco (depending on which ones you get) is really a lot. My whole order of like 12 tacos came out to like 70 something dollars and that didn&apos;t include the postmates fee or tip. That&apos;s gonna be a no from me dawg"
