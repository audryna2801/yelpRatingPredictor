5,"On a whim I decided to grab up a meal from Anarkali after work. Curbside pickup was as smooth as can be and the service went above and beyond what I was expecting for such a brief stopover. 

I&apos;m pleased to say the food matched my initial impressions (I ordered a butter chicken, rice and garlic naan) and I look forward to trying more off the menu next time I visit."
5,"Anarkali is our absolute favorite Indian restaurant in LA, hands down! We&apos;ve had such an overwhelmingly positive experience with them every time we&apos;ve ordered - I couldn&apos;t recommend them highly enough! The food is beyond delicious, the service is outstanding, and we always get our order right on time! I&apos;d recommend a specific dish but I honestly can&apos;t imagine any of their dishes being anything less than superb (although I have to say their saag paneer is insanely good). I really love these guys and I can&apos;t wait till we can go eat there in person - I&apos;m sure it will be even better!"
5,"Haven&apos;t found a good Indian place to eat here ever since I moved from San Francisco. This was the first place I tried! I ordered for pickup &amp; got the chicken vindaloo (hot), garlic naan, &amp; rice. When I came to pick up, the man was so nice he gave me a free ice cream and a mango lassi for choosing them. The chicken vindaloo was perfect spicy &amp; every bite was perfect with the naan. I can&apos;t wait to go back to try the butter chicken!"
2,"Wow, okay im not sure what i just ate but it was not what i have come to expect in my 15 years of eating indian food. 

Beware, the Tikka Masala is extremely creamy and had almost no spice or acid and -worse- was sweet. Almost like it had maple syrup in it. Very strange.

Maybe some people like it but this is not your typical indian food. Ours went straight to the trash."
1,"I am literally only putting a star because it&apos;s the only way to leave a review. My husband has been wanting to try this place for THE longest time. We LOVE Indian food and was impressed at how this place has a 4.5 stars and over 3k in review. I should have read ALL the reviews because this place is AWFUL!! AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL BLAND FOOD! They should be ashamed, I mean Indian food is all about SPICES!!!!! But apparently this place have never heard of such a thing because EVERY SINGLE THING we got was so freaking bland I almost got scared thinking I got COVID and lost my sense of taste. So I immediately got some Tabasco just to make sure. 

We got the chicken tikka masala: bland and tasted like someone dabbed a hint of sugar in it.  And mind you we got it medium spice. Not to mention the chicken was so dry and hard I feel like I was going to need my husband to do a Heimlich maneuver on me every time I took a bite. Then there was the beef vindaloo.. again, I don&apos;t know if they are aware that there is a thing called salt?? Tasteless, potatoes could have been French fries they were so hard, and the beef, well- maybe they were in the process of drying it for beef jerky. Tough, dry and TASTELESS. We also got the samosas: my goodness, I don&apos;t know if that was a left over from two weeks ago that they decided to heat up and sell, but even their sauces couldn&apos;t get me to finish it. Stale stale stale! The naan... seriously!!! It was brunt, chewy like a gum, and honestly probably from a month ago too. Then there was the sag paneer -- they should call it SAD PANEER! Again tasteless, the tofu was dry and hard! Seriously!!!! I am beyond disappointed. I hate leaving bad reviews but people need to be aware and WARNED! We have had plenty of Indian food to know what a good Indian food- no- what a 4.5 stars Indian food SHOULD be. I can&apos;t even say that their basmati rice was good. It had that dirty after taste to it like they didn&apos;t wash the rice before cooking it. I&apos;m Asian--- trust me it leaves that disgusting after taste! 

$70 later and all we have to be thankful for is that they gave my husband free beer. Thanks, I&apos;ll be checking to make sure it&apos;s not expired first before drinking it."
4,"So this is the second time I have had take out from this place.  I vaguely remember the first time and kind of forgot I had been there.  I even searched through my emails to see if I had a receipt before ordering.

Anyways, I recall now that the first time the food was pleasant enough but didn&apos;t have that wow factor that makes a place your go-to favorite.

Here&apos;s my review based on tonight&apos;s experience.

I ordered takeout on their site.  The prices were about in line with what you would expect for an Indian restaurant.  The order was going to take 35 mins and was ready in about 25.  When I got there, someone in the kitchen yelled across the restaurant and ask what I needed - I yelled back my name and that I had ordered online, then he yelled back 10 mins...  Not the best start and the restaurant looked kind of depressing inside (maybe it is just the lack of spark that covid has drained out of everything.)  I ordered the Lamb Vindaloo with rice and naan by the way.

Here&apos;s some pro&apos;s and con&apos;s:
Pros:
1. Big portions
2. Decent flavor
3. Everything stayed hot! Including the Naan!
4. friendly service when my food was delivered.

Cons:
1. Naan was kind of boring... maybe needs some salt, butter and a bit thinner.
2. The lamb didn&apos;t have the best texture, it was like mystery cut with lots of fat, and different parts and kind of chewy.  I prefer more of a uniform fork tender cubed lamb. 

Anyways, it&apos;s a decent place and I am sure it is more charming to eat there when things are hopping on a weekend during normal times.  The food seemed legit, but I wasn&apos;t impressed enough to make it a regular place.  I wouldn&apos;t say no if a group of friends wanted to meet up there though."
1,"Pls find another restaurant if you are reading this ! 

I was attracted because of the high ratings . I was visiting LA for a weekend trip while returning from beverly hills we planned to eat some good indian food &amp; chose this place based on the high ratings which soon proved to be only disappointment. 

We ordered Chicken tikka masala combo(Dinner) , Choley(Dinner). The combo also had soup Which was not at all good. Never had such a weird soup. Both of these entre( chicken, Choley)were very disappointing. We did choose very spicy during the order but the food was only Hot  and not spicy.

Packaging was okay, Quantity was good, Boiled Rice was good ( see i am not discounting on what they did well) 

They also gave me mango icecream as i checked in through yelp! which was good"
5,"I had to place a large order for a number of coworkers with different needs and tastes. Anarkali rose to the occasion. Once the order was placed, Mohammed checked in so the order would be exactly what everyone wanted--and it was. Several people went out of their way to praise the meal. 

Thank you!"
3,I&apos;ve been here a number of times and always enjoy their food and service. I understand it&apos;s COVID times but my pickup order was excessively delayed despite the lack of orders going out of the restaurant. There was no apology or checking in so I stood at the front of this hollow and empty restaurant hoping for my food. After it being delayed by almost 30 minutes.
4,"Pretty solid spot in the area.  We ordered 2 curries and 2 garlic naans.  My curry was good for the colder evenings and my roommate enjoyed hers as well.  The flavors weren&apos;t too overpowering.  I would say I&apos;ve had better naan elsewhere, but Anarkali&apos;s was decently sized and went well with the curry.

The gentleman at the front was super friendly and threw in a free thing of rice, which was much appreciated bc I forgot to make rice at home.  The interior looked nice, and I look forward to dining in once things open up!"
5,Always delicious and great service! Highly recommend.
1,"I ordered chicken biryani and it is no where close to a biryani, it&apos;s pulao with chicken pieces"
5,"One can sense the Bengali influence to the cuisine here.  We were extremely fortunate to nab the one table outside for lunch and were treated to incredible display of service and care for our meal.  Our three dishes were each so delicious that it would be hard to choose one as the best.  Having traveled extensively in India and spent a considerable amount of time Kolkata (Calcutta), I can say that we are very lucky to have a restaurant of this caliber in LA.  This was my first visit, but certainly will not be my last."
1,"Do not believe all of the good reviews. I was drawn to this restaurant because of the nearly 3,000 reviews and 4.5 stars, but my food was horrible. The naan looked old and stale, the vegetable curry was way too thick and too sweet! The samosas were dry and had too much bread. I was not satisfied with ONE dish and I ordered the family meal. The paneer tasted like fried tofu and was extremely bland. Overall, I felt like there were no Indian spices in any of the dishes. Maybe this was just one bad night for the restaurant, but I would not risk ordering from here again."
5,"Best Indian food in town!!


I&apos;m super glad Anarkali is open during these times! I&apos;ve been coming to them for over a year now and the food never disappoints. I&apos;ve always had great service from them when I used to dine in.


Now that we are ordering takeout, the food is still awesome and their service and friendliness is still amazing!"
5,Amazing food and great delivery! We couldn&apos;t stop eating the food even though we were stuffed. They even gave us samosas and a coupon to come back! We will be ordering from here again.
5,"Our favorite Indian restaurant for takeout!! I wish I could could give them 10 stars. Great customer service!! I love that since we&apos;re regulars, they have our preferences already noted for repeat ordering or for the times they sweetly surprise us with our favorite apps like the veggie samosas or naan bread. If you&apos;re ordering for the first time, try one of their dishes made with their yummy tikka masala or a tandoori dish. You also have the option to make it a &quot;dinner&quot; which will come with rice and soup which are also tasty. Another reason to love this restaurant is all the options for dietary preferences which will satisfy everyone in your household!"
5,"This is my first time having Indian food and I enjoyed myself very much. I got curious about it watching @chimichingasisters on YouTube. They made it look so good!!!!! I tried the samosas, chicken tandoori, naan, a lot of different kinds of naan, that crispy thing that I can remember the name of, saag paneer, and much more. My family approved!!!! 
Will be going back for more flavor adventure!!! 
Definitely gonna try the Mango lassi and the mango dessert they have next time :) 

The host was very nice and the food was ready so quickly! 

See you next time Anarkali restaurant."
5,"Anarkali has been our go-to spot for fantastic Indian food for years. The tarka dal, saag paneer and yes, the chicken tikka masala are all incredible. The garlic naan and samosa&apos;s are super good as well. The staff are all really great and everything has seriously always been fast, hot and delicious. Love love love this place."
5,"I wanted to have a spontaneous takeout night with my girlfriend and me, so the first place I thought of to treat ourselves was Anarkali. I&apos;ve been going here for years, and the consistency has been spot on. Not having their dishes during the pandemic was a bummer, but they deliver with ease, and it came so fast. Dishes I highly recommend are the potato samosas, Chicken Tikka Masala (a no-brainer), and if you want to switch it up, definitely get the Lamb Coconut Curry. You won&apos;t be disappointed, guys! They go out of their way to make you feel at home and enjoy their comforting dishes."
