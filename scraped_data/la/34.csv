5,"*****Epic Shrimp Plate!*****

The Shrimp Plate was so tasty it &quot;Broke my Mouth!&quot; It broke all our mouths! A very unique place, epic food and amazing customer service. This is take-out only. It was well worth our trek from Orange County just to eat the food pulled over on the side of skid row. Amazingly unique! Hawaain style food with a Korean twist is the best way I can describe the food.

~The Shrimp Plate-5 Stars!
The shrimp comes shell-on and tail-on with excellent seasoning. The shell keeps the shrimp super juicy and allows the shrimp to soak up the seasoning. We ate some shrimp with the shell on. We also ate some by sucking out the shrimp and juices (similar to how you eat crawfish heads). This is some of the best shrimp I have had outside of The South and outside of Kahuku.
The kids loved the shell on. 

Musubi is also very good!!

The owner is a super nice guy who cares about his customers and the quality and taste of his food. Again, a very unique treat that every foodie must try!

Thanks Yelper Joseph A for the post, pictures and finding this spot. Mahalo and Salamat!

I am a fan!"
5,"Disclaimer: I tipped over the food in my car--it was originally much more presentable. My bad! 

Local plate (5/5)
Avocado toast (5/5)
Spam musubi (5/5)
Potato Mac (5/5)

Small, local comfort food at its best. Girlfriend and I have gotten takeout from Lee&apos;s Brokenmouth on several occasions and we are always impressed. This was our first time doing brunch, however, and it lived up to the rest of the menu. I absolutely love the purple rice--such a great texture and taste. The spam musubi is straight fire. One of my favorite menu items is the potato Mac--the mixture of potato salad and macaroni salad is pure bliss. Takeout is really fast and easy. Parking can be tough but there&apos;s usually at least a few spots around the corner if you can&apos;t find a parking space right in front. The owner is so nice, he&apos;s always willing to chat with customers and very friendly. This time he threw in free Hawaiian Punch with our order! Really fantastic customer service experience and terrific food."
5,"Ok ok this place is good. I can see why this place has 5 stars and almost 1000 reviews. A big factor is the care and customer service they provide. The food is also really good! A definite 5 stars in my book.

I got the shrimp, beef dipped in egg plate, and an order of the spam musubi. Everything was delicious and my favorite was the beef dipped in egg. The sauce it comes with is tangy and the flavors of the dish remind me of some good Asian style home cooking that I would get at an auntie&apos;s house. The shrimp was very flavorful and to be honest, better than giovannis on the island. I&apos;m not a huge fan of the shells on the shrimp but they were pretty easy to take off once you suck off all the flavor. Also, that Mac/potato salad was the best thing I&apos;ve ever had. It&apos;s the best of both worlds and I couldn&apos;t be any happier with the side dish.

Spam musubi was good as well. They use purple rice so it has more of a texture to it compared to regular white rice. All in all, I would recommend this place and am looking forward to coming back to dine in once covid is over."
5,"Wow. Just wow. I have been wanting to come here for months and I finally did. I ordered the shrimp lunch combo which comes with macaroni salad and rice. It was the most flavorful, perfectly cooked shrimp. The purple rice with the furikake (I think!) was soooo delicious. It looked like a small portion but it was just right and hit the spot. 

They gave me a free drink, how nice! Overall 11/10. Absolutely must try!"
4,"I ordered the garlic shrimp lunch plate which came with purple rice and potato mac salad. The shrimp was breaded with shell on, and was in a mildly spicy red sauce. The flavors were pretty darn good, and although could be more garlicky, is still one of the better garlic shrimps I&apos;ve had in Cali. Unfortunately, it does not live up to the high bar that Giovanni&apos;s has set. The mac salad was decently delicious, a bit on the heavier/creamier side.

The bf ordered: Locale plate which came with grilled portuguese sausage, sunny side up eggs &amp; purple rice. I had a few bites and the sausage was very well flavored and the eggs were quite perfect  

Pretty delicious food!! Would revisit if I was craving some Hawaiian eats."
5,"**Tori&apos;s Takeout Thoughts (#TTT) - quarantine edition**

Breaking in a new year of Yelp reviews, with a review of Broken Mouth My rooommates had talked up their spam musubi and plates so I was pretty excited to try it. And let me tell you...the hype was real.

I don&apos;t know what magic sauce they marinate their spam in, but it was delicious. My only regret is that I only ordered one musubi. Note to self - order at least 2 next time because yes, there is going to be a next time.

I also ordered the garlic shrimp plate and loved how much garlic was in it - not in an overwhelming way, but definitely enough that you should brush your teeth after. I&apos;m not a big rice person, but I devoured the purple rice and mac salad - both good complements.

Definitely one of the best takeout meals I&apos;ve had this pandemic season and a place I will be returning to order some more of their delicious musubis!"
5,"Broken Mouth is a delicious Hawaiian eatery, owned and operated by Chef Lee.  Their menu offers brunch options, various lunch plates, sides, desserts, and drinks.

We came here for an early lunch, and we were able to score a seat at the counter - yay!

We ordered: the Beef Plate Lunch (egg-battered ribeye beef slices with purple rice and potato-mac salad), a Shrimp Plate Lunch (Kahuku-style garlic butter shrimp with purple rice and potato-mac salad), and a Spam Musubi (seaweed wrapped Spam on purple rice).  Honestly, the purple rice was a little too &apos;healthy&apos; for us, but it definitely absorbed any of the juices/flavorings of the main protein.  I really enjoyed the beef, as it&apos;s like Korean juhn, but slightly sweeter; we both really enjoyed the garlic shrimp, shell and all! No need to peel, as the &apos;skin&apos; just added a layer of crispiness.  The flavors were SO GOOD!

There seemed to be a lot of carry-out orders when we were there, so it was awesome to see the locals supporting a local eatery as this!

Would love to return on our next trip!

4,"Tiny corner restaurant with nice staff.

Was looking for a place with simple ordering and quick pick up and after reading some of the reviews decided to go here. Despite being in DTLA parking for quick pick up surprisingly wasn&apos;t hard and luckily the food was ready by the time of arrival as promised, exactly what I was looking for.

As for the food, it was good. Ordere a shrimp plate and would definitely recommend this over the other options I&apos;ve tried. The shrimp was perfectly seasoned and cooked. The shell was crunchy and loved the garlic sauce for sure.

Will definitely be back for shrimps and will probably try more options."
5,"I freaking love this place !!!!!!

The food is amazing and the service is great!

I&apos;ve come here three times and the owner is always super friendly. My favorite thing to get is the garlic butter shrimp plate, priced at about $13. It&apos;s definitely worth it - you get 4 or 5 big &amp; juicy pieces of shrimp that are well seasoned and perfectly cooked, macaroni salad, purple rice, and some lemon. The dish is tasty, but definitely heavy! 

I&apos;ve also tried their spam musubi and it&apos;s good, but I think I prefer spam musubi with white rice instead of purple. Plus, the shrimp plate is just so good and filling that I don&apos;t need more food. 

I&apos;ve only been here during the pandemic, but I can imagine that this place is pretty packed in normal times. You place your order outside of the restaurant and wait for them to put your takeout on the table, so everything is contactless."
5,"I was craving some Meat Jun!!! And I finally found it here in LA yayyy.I order the Meat Jin with a Purple Rice and Potato Mac. Don&apos;t forget that Hawaiian Sun to make it just like Hawaii.

Takeout:
You can either order for pickup via chow now or square. If you rather have it delivered you can order via Postmates. I ordered it via chow now and it was so easy. The order was ready right on time.

Quality of Food:
Finding Meat Jun is always difficult outside of Hawaii. The Meat Jun here remind me of home. The Meat Jun sauce had the perfect amount of sweet and tangy. EVERYTHING you order here is always good! I definitely want to try more on my
next visit. 

If you&apos;re craving local Hawaiian food this is the place to go!!! (: enjoy."
4,"I&apos;ve been wanting to try out this place for a while, but I don&apos;t find myself in the area often, and it&apos;s a big hassle trying to find parking here. However, I had to make a drive to the area and finally got the opportunity to try them out for lunch.

We&apos;re in a pandemic and they have adapted to the situation by having a pick up station right in front of the restaurant. So make sure to order on their website before heading over. I pulled by the corner of the restaurant and walked up to grab my order, really easy and convenient.

I ordered the Garlic Shrimp plate, which comes with purple rice and mac salad. The flavors really packed a punch, each shrimp were strong in flavors throughout my meal. The purple rice was also delicious - especially with all that furikake on top. The mac salad was a great addition as well, adding a different food texture to the plate.

Overall - really great spot for lunch and I would think the represented Hawaiian food well. My only issue is that the portions were a bit small for the price, you might need to order a side for an optimal lunch meal. Still, I wouldn&apos;t mind coming back to give their other food a try and definitely recommend them if you like Hawaiian food."
4,"After seeing this place on yelp every time I&apos;m in LA, I decided to give it a try. I decided to get the garlic shrimp platter, because I love both shrimp and garlic. 

Ordering was simple. I just ordered through their website and went to pick it up. It&apos;s located in DTLA, but when I went, parking wasn&apos;t too difficult for a quick pickup. They were ready in about 20-30 minutes after we placed our order. 

For the food, I really loved the flavor of the shrimp. Their sauce is amazing and full of garlicy wonderfulness. The rice that comes on the side - also amazing. I liked the mac salad too, but it wasn&apos;t my favorite part of the dish. 

The only reason why I&apos;m giving this 4 instead of 5 stars was because of a few things. When I was finally able to eat the dish, the shrimp was not crunchy but definitely on the softer side. It may have been because it was steaming in the to-go box for a while. Also, for the mac salad, I think some of the noodles were a bit undercooked and on the harder side. 

If it wasn&apos;t for those 2 things, I would have given 5 stars. I&apos;d like to hopefully come back and try it for dine-in so that it&apos;s fresh and would like to try some of their other dishes."
5,"Whoa! Talk about elevated Hawaiian plate food! Broken Mouth is the bomb! 

My first time trying out and I was thoroughly impressed! I ordered the KAHUKU-STYLE GARLIC BUTTER SHRIMP with purple rice and potato-mac salad plate with a side of CUCUMBER KIMCHI, and PICKLED CARROTS. I&apos;m glad the owner asked if this was my first time. I said yes. He told me to eat the shrimp along with the shells/skin. I was unsure about that. I&apos;m glad he told me because all that flavor and crunch was spot on! 

I inhaled that whole plate in like 5 minutes! It was very satisfying and didn&apos;t give me that heavy gut-bomb feeling. They also gave me a complimentary Hawaiian soda which was nice and reminded of that &quot;ohana&quot; feeling. 

There&apos;s metered parking on the corner where they are located. 

Whenever you&apos;re in the downtown area, you should definitely give them a try!"
5,"This review is for pre-COVID.

Broken Mouth was our first stop in LA from NY. We were ready for a hearty meal and boy did they deliver. Two of us shared the Shrimp Plate, Beef Plate, and Spam Misubi. Everything was phenomenal including the service. The owner explained all the dishes to us and how they are meant to be eaten. It was wonderful listening to him talk about how each dish is special to him. 

The shrimp they prepared is meant to be eaten with the shell on - the first time I&apos;ve ever tried it like that and it won&apos;t be the last. The garlic butter it&apos;s cooked in is full of flavor. The beef was also cooked in a sweet and salty sauce. 

Parking was very difficult for this area, but there are spots just a few blocks away.

The restaurant is small and there was a 20 minute wait on a Saturday afternoon but it was well worth it! I&apos;ll be back every time I&apos;m back in LA for some homestyle Hawaiian food."
4,"A great find in downtown LA! Immediately drawn to this place because of the stellar 5 star reviews. 

F O O D
We ordered a beef plate and garlic shrimp plate. Both included purple rice and mac potato salad. Both dishes were very tasty! The garlic shrimp does have the shells still on which I&apos;m not a big fan of, but all the seasoning is on the shells. The beef had some kind of sweet coating (taro maybe?) and it was very unique and flavorful with the sauce. The food was good, but not mind blowing. 
We also received complimentary bread pudding, which was amazing by the way! It was so warm and had granola and cranberries which gave the dessert some extra jazz. 

S E R V I C E
I believe we received a complimentary dessert because it was our first time eating here. Thank you so much! That&apos;s a great way to value your customers and ensure they have a great experience."
4,"I love Broken Mouth. I always seem to wanna call out &quot;broke da mouth&quot; because it&apos;s that ono/yummy! Yes, Chef Lee cooks your &quot;local grinds&quot;, your faves: Portuguese sausage, garlic shrimp, spam musubi but I honestly think that their specialty here is their &quot;meat jun&quot;. I don&apos;t know where else to get it in the city but for sure, you can get it here and it hits the spot. 

It&apos;s a tiny space but they make due with what they got. Parking can also be a bit tricky but there are plenty structures and metered street parking nearby. If you don&apos;t wanna fuss with parking, I recommend ordering takeout or delivery. 

I hope this place survives the pandemic. It&apos;s rare to find REAL &quot;local&quot; Hawaii gems like these that can transport you back to the islands right when you walk through the door."
5,"It took us far too long to get back here, but I&apos;m happy to report that it is every bit as tasty and satisfying as it was before the pandemic! 

To-go experience: Everything was made fresh and they were just finishing up as we arrived. It was packed carefully and stayed hot all the way home (about a 20 minute drive). I felt the same welcoming hospitality in picking up my to-go order that I previously did while dining in, too.

Covid: We ordered online but I also saw them take orders at the door, which is propped open and blocked by a table to make sure nobody enters except the owner and staff. Everyone wore masks and the person who ordered ahead of me even waited in her car. I felt like they are taking safety very seriously and it makes me respect and appreciate them even more!

Parking: This was the biggest challenge. The street  has a lot of painted curbs and driveways and there aren&apos;t that many proper spots. I got out while my husband circled the block a few times. We made it work, and you will, too. 

This is a local place that deserves your love!"
5,"The food here is bomb! It is definitely Hawaii style food but with korean influence.
The owner came out and spoke with us and gave exceptional customer service.
They use quality ingredients like the ribeye steak in the meat jun. their sauces were delicious as well.
I ordered the beef plate lunch with their house spicy sauce on the side. Although the portions look smaller in the pictures, it was extremely filling and I even had a lot to take home.
They make everything to order which was amazing since it&apos;s hard to find a spam musubi that is not pre made.
I just wish they had free parking for customers so that I can come all the time.
I had an awesome experience at Broken Mouth."
5,"Well, first time my review was super redundant!  This place is killing it on the stars.  And if you don&apos;t know why, you need to order and visit once Covid allows us!  I got something different this time!  Before I always got the buttery awesome shrimp plate!!   This time I went for the chicken sandwich.  The brioche bun complements the tangy, sweet, peppery sauce that is generously on the chicken!  The chicken was crispy and larger than the bun!  The lightly pickled carrots add another texture and coolness to the sauce, I appreciated!  Loved it! Totally ate the whole thing!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to try this place for awhile &amp; finally got a chance to check it out! It was pretty busy when I got there which is expected during lunch hours on a weekend. I highly recommend placing your order online so you don&apos;t have to wait too long when you go pick it up! There were only 2 people working and I believe the person handling the orders and managing the customers was the owner. He was super nice &amp; chill. He even apologized for the long wait because it just got super busy!

I had the beef plate, shrimp plate, and a spam musubi. I loved everything!!! Like seriously devoured it all with my friend LOL. Out of the 2 plates, I liked the shrimp plate more. The shrimp literally melted &amp; had an amazing flavor. I also love that they use purple rice. 

Overall, totally worth the wait &amp; definitely will be back again!"
