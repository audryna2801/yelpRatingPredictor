5,"Great food and excellent service from a steakhouse synonymous with quality.

Quality:  M Grill is much more than a steakhouse. It is an institution. With a long list of accolades throughout its storied history,  a pandemic was undoubtedly not going to interrupt the quality of their food.  When you bite into it, you can tell the difference. Even in the Single Steak,  the tenderness is what sticks out. But the best bites are where you get to enjoy the marbleization and the fat.
Quantity: Big portions of everything. You can trust the recommendation sizes for steak and sides.

Service: Experienced and knowledgeable servers. We were given detailed descriptions of each item, recommendations, and instructions on how to maximize flavor."
5,"It&apos;s been a minute since we&apos;ve been here but noticed that I never wrote a review.  The review is based on the experience before the pandemic, but I would assume that it would be the same if not better due to safety regulations and what not. 

**EXPERIENCE BEFORE PANDEMIC**

Always get a reservation.. it&apos;s just easier. Granted they have tables, and alloted time for dining, they&apos;re able to handle the amount of people salivating over their AYCE brazilian bbq. If you&apos;ve never been to a B-bbq, you&apos;re in for a treat, and even bigger treat if you&apos;re at M-Grill. Out of all the B-bbq&apos;s in LA, M-Grill happens to be one of my favorite. The service is amazing, food and salad bars are always fresh and tasty. I love their salad, grilled pineapples, sirloin, chicken - pretty much everything is good. Believe the hype.

Valet parking for dinner, but free during lunch. There may be street free and metered parking. 

They have a full bar. I prefer lunch for cost savings, but dinner has a few more options. They&apos;re on DineLA&apos;s restaurant week, and they serve their dinner options during lunch. Just a suggestion :D"
5,"***DINING DURING THE PANDEMIC***

Been here twice since they&apos;ve reopened and the staff is totally equipped and geared for the safety of guests to enjoy their meals. They have an outdoor  area and tent. We opted to sit in the tent because it was way too hot on our previous visit and way too cold last night to sit out.

After checking in, your temperature will be taken at your wrist and you&apos;ll be given a little pouch to put your mask in while you&apos;re eating to keep them clean. 

All the meats were delicious like it&apos;s always been. Grilled pineapple is still a favorite for my boyfriend and I. 

My only complaint is that I wish the tables were staggered. The first visit, there was a large group that sat next to us, they were a bit lout and oddly enough, they had a COVID kit with them and were trying to test themselves right then and there. And yesterday was better, but since the salad bar is mobile, I felt like the space was a bit cramped as they wheeled between the tables."
4,"His review is a bit over do since I last went there in the middle of August 2020.

And that time, they were offering outdoor dining with the tent which I thought was really great. I have been missing M  grill And we made reservations as soon as we heard that they were open.

As usual the meet was excellent, the best in my opinion will always be the Picanha. Get it as rare as you can and you will not be disappointed. Another thing to request would be their chicken hearts. It&apos;s not for everyone, but they make it really well. For dessert, although I&apos;m not a big dessert guy, they do have very good caramelized pineapples.

I think that the staff should be commended for the effort they had to do by bringing in the meat and the appetizers from the second floor down to the dining area."
5,"Pre-Covid:
I have been here a few times. My experience here has been better and better. Lunch is $35 per person. Server was very attentive and constantly checking in with us to see if we had any request on certain types of meat. My favorite were top sirloin and bottom sirloin. They were very lean, flavorful, and tender. My mouth watered by just thinking about this! 

There was buffet style salad bar that included grilled vegetables, pasta, and rice. 

It is also highly recommended on their house bread that it has cheese fillings. It was not oily or made you feel stuffed!

Environment is very nice and romantic that it is good for celebration! 

Will come back again for sure!"
5,"My boyfriend wanted to have a date night and perfect timing because Dina LA just started. We reserved that day and went to dinner at night. Seeing that it is covid I was super impressed with the tent they built. It was absolutely beautiful. When you walk in you walk the red carpet and you are greeted. They gave us bags to put our masks in for when we sit down. Each table was 6 feet apart and all the staff had masks on a plastic face cover. There was lights across the tent to give it an elegant look. 

The food carts came around with all types of food. The beef stroganoff, corn, fried plantains were delicious. There was also a side bread that had just the right amount of cheese, it was just a hint of cheese and very light. There was many sides to pick from but those are just a few that stood out. 

All the meats come around and are sliced for you if you decide you would like some. All the meats were great and I&apos;m not the type of person that eats a lot of meat in one sitting. The pineapple slices are bomb and warm! 

The staff was super friendly and the atmosphere almost made me feel like things were normal again. 

Since we did Dine LA we spent about $134 for 2 people and a alcoholic beverage. Not bad for all you can eat."
5,"They made it really gorgeous for an outdoor experience!
I actually like the experience outside better than their indoor dining.
The only downside was that you couldn&apos;t go to the salad bar and pick your own portion of sides. 
Everything is by request. 
You can request the meat you want if none of the servers bring out the meat you particularly like.
The customer service was 10/10.
They are on top of their game with refilling your drink or asking to replace plates.
I love it here! 
Always a great experience even during this time."
4,"Came here with boyfriend during covid, we made a reservation for 4:30 PM on a Saturday and it was pretty empty, which was nice. Social distancing is taken seriously and you are given a plastic bag to safely keep your mask in. 

Service is amazing, meat is hit or miss (some are too salty and fatty). Buffet is no longer self serve, they bring it to you a la dim sum carts. If you ask them for a specific cut of meat or side, they will get someone to give it to you!

Current pricing as of 11/14/2020: $64 per person 

Price for a Moscow Mule: $17 lol"
3,"I was pumped to finally try M Grill yesterday. M Grill has such a good reputation and the reviews to back it, so I was pretty excited to eat here.

But onto the main subject: the BBQ.

M Grill&apos;s specialty meat is their picanha. I&apos;ve never had it, I&apos;ve seen it cooked on YouTube and never cared to try it because it always looked kinda dry. So while it wasn&apos;t as tender as a ribeye, it was still definitely juicy and cooked and seasoned very well.

Some other meats that were good were the ribs, the ribeye, skirt steak, and my gf and our friend both seemed to really enjoy the chicken heart. The sliced sausage was good too. Oh, and the filet mignon was actually pretty good for being a leaner piece of meat.

The other meats I could&apos;ve skipped were the chicken and sausage which were both dry, the garlic picanha which sounded great actually ended up being a disappointment.

Despite being dry or disappointing or delicious, the good news was that all the meat came out SUPER hot which is a plus obviously.

So, how do the sides match up?

Salads:

The Caesar salad was pretty much a standard caesar salad, but well-dressed at least.

The best salad was the kale with some sort of raspberry vinaigrette with quinoa.

Sauces:

Their chimichurri was great! Acidic, fresh, herbaceous, and vibrant. Definitely something you want to keep going back to.

There was this red spicy sauce which, according to my googling, is molho apimentado? Anyway, it was like a spicy paste that was a little acidic which is great for cutting through the fats from the meats.

My friend and I both agreed that their pico de gallo was REALLY good. It didn&apos;t taste like your average pico, there was another element to it which really made it pop. I found myself eating it by itself a little haha.

Anyway, onto service:

Soon after we were seated, the guy pushing the salad cart bar stopped by. We got a little bit every type of salad to start off our meal.

Aside from the salad bar cart, service was really really really slow. It took forever to get our drinks ordered, but after that the improved significantly and was great throughout the rest of the meal.

Did M Grill live up to its reputation in my book? No, not at all. Was it bad? No, but there wasn&apos;t anything memorable. I felt like the meat rotation was repetitive. We finally got offered something different like ribeye and parmesean picanha, but we were all full already at this point. The salad/hot sides cart is pretty cool (first time doing AYCE dining during the pandemic) and they came around often. Service was lackluster initially, but improved after we got our drinks.

Glad I was able to scratch off another place on my places-to-eat list, but this is one place I won&apos;t be coming back to."
1,"I&apos;m so disappointed!!! The experience was ok until after we left the restaurant. We were a party of 13. 3 different tables, upon leaving we all had separate table tickets. Total it was about a little over $900. I flew from Oklahoma to attend my dads 65th birthday. Upon getting back to my room my dad called me, some guy from the restaurant called him and said we didn&apos;t tip enough...


Wait... what!!!!!! Who are y&apos;all to call someone on their birthday and tell us my table didn&apos;t til enough. That&apos;s beyond disrespectful, that&apos;s beyond bold, that&apos;s just unprofessional in my opinion. Every table left a tip! A tip is a personal choice, you can&apos;t guilt trip someone into leaving more money.. 

Some of the dishes listed, we had to ask for them to be brought out. Everything seemed rushed, really fast paced.. the meats could have had just a bit more of seasoning. The bread was the absolute best part. I&apos;ve never in my life had a business call me about a tip EVER! This is why a 1 star is given"
5,"You would honestly think that this establishment has always been set up as an outdoor dining restaurant! From the second we arrived, we were attended with drinks, a menu, and were greeted by an employee pushing a salad bar and hot bar on wheels! Not even two minutes later, the meat started coming out and I couldn&apos;t say no to all the delicious cuts of meats! My favorite was the picanha, smoked sausage, and the rib eye! 
I came here to celebrate my boyfriend&apos;s birthday and right as our dinner was over, a server came out with a delicious mini flan that was sprinkled with coconut flakes! We also tried the whiskey sour and Cadillac margarita and it is so worth the price! The drinks actually have ALCOHOL in them!!! 
Overall, a memorable experience and so worth the money spent here!"
5,"The staff of M Grill is the reason why I&apos;m giving this place 5 stars. They are super nice, friendly and very attentive. We got there right when they opened and was kind of hesitant to go in since it seemed that no one was around. They&apos;ll check your temp before going in and they made sure the atmosphere of their outside seating is that of a restaurant and not just a tent in the parking lot. I will suggest this place as a good date night. Since we were early and the only people there we expected some things on their menu to not be ready yet but we were wrong. They were very much prepared as if the restaurant was at full capacity. And even when people started to roll in they never forgot about us and still checked up on us. Never did we once had to flag someone down if we needed anything.

Foodwise I would recommend getting the Garlic picanha and also a glass of their sangria (which was HUGE). Also make sure to try their grilled pineapple."
4,"Every time I come here, the experience has been borderline magical. Come here and come hungry is my motto. Sadly, the pandemic has lead to outdoor dining. You don&apos;t get to have the high ceilings, the dark ambience, and a lit candle, but the food is just as good. Imagine butlers rushing over to serve you high quality meat. M Grill&apos;s got it all. What makes this place shine isn&apos;t even the nice cuts of steak. Go for the pineapple. I almost told the butler to bring me a whole one because it was that amazing."
5,"This has to be my favorite spot if you&apos;re looking for the perfect bang-for-buck impress your date + get your AYCE food on. Fortunately I came during DineLA pricing to make it truly a steal in value.

I didn&apos;t take many pictures because I was too hungry/happy gobbling up everything!

I&apos;m craving/dreaming of returning ASAP!

Covid rating: A+ due to great protocols including temp check."
1,"Be careful with their dishes. I found a long black hair in the salad, and it grossed me out so much when I pulled the hair out of my mouth. Be mindful of what you consume. I shouldn&apos;t watch Netflix and eat at the same time carelessly, especially in this Covid time. I have an urge to throw up just imagining what has happened"
5,"Okay y&apos;all back to the step by step review! Start to finish. 
(First timers) 

Reservations only(at the moment) 
For our very first time the experience was perfect.


As we drove in at 7:45pm we were greeted by a Valet($4) and guided to our entrance. We were then greeted by the host who took our temperatures, gave us a mask bag to keep our masks clean, and seated us right away even though our reservations at 8:00pm. 

The dining experience: 
A waiter explained how our experience would layout and accommodated us very well. 
I&apos;m sorry I couldn&apos;t post any of the meat, it was all so tasty and delicious it did not last long on my plate.  
Various cuts of meat were served by men walking around going up to you and cutting right on the spot. 

OVERALL RATING 
10/10 dining experience 

The meat was excellent, they had a wide variety of cuts all cooked to medium rare or even medium if you&apos;re feeling wild."
5,"M grill was very missed during this pandemic, but luckily they were able to open up again with precautions. It was fairly easy to book an appointment &amp; when we arrived we checked in and sat in our car until we were alerted that our table was ready. Temperature checks are required and you must wear a mask when you leave your table. 
It was decorated beautifully, it doesn&apos;t feel like you&apos;re dining out in a parking lot lol. The buffet items were pushed around on a covered cart &amp; only served by the waiter, but don&apos;t worry they don&apos;t limit you, you can still get as much as you want! The meats come out searing hot &amp; delicious. I definitely felt safe eating here and would recommend others to check it out !"
4,"I&apos;m familiar with M Grill already and have always wondered how they are. The place they built is amazing. Out of all the dine in patio places that opened, they put in the best effort. They have a very good run down for safety and even gives a little bag for your mask! 

The meat is amazing and very filling. They come to you for sides and everything and always try to give you new plates as much as they can. The only reason why I gave four stars is because in the beginning we waited almost 15 to 20 minutes for meat while everyone around us was getting served. But once we got the meat, they were already on a roll. The service is great as well. They were soooo friendly! I would definitely come back and would recommend to a friend :) 

Parking is super easy! They have valet but cash only for $4. Make sure to make reservation before coming in. They get really packed!"
4,"I never thought I would review M Grill but just wanted to let people know how my covid outdoor dining experience was.  Everything is served table side.  The salad bar and sides are definitely limited than buffet style as opposed to what we thought upon arrival.  Salad cart had like 4 different types of salads which is still good enough.  You have to ask for everything you want, otherwise it will never come.  So save yourself the frustration and request everything you m want up front bc some of my friends were really upset about that.  They may serve the next table over and completely skip yours.  But please note they have to go back to the grill to reheat the next meat pieces - but even something like salad may get skipped.  Just make sure to request your must haves and you will not be disappointed.  You may be frustrated if you expect them to bring you everything on their own.  Food quality was tasty as I remember. 

With that being said, it&apos;s a beautidul space outdoors which is also tented for shade.  We went on a hot summer day and it was a very nice dinner. No complaints at all. Loved the string lights - it was a very nice touch. 

We had a group for a company outing and they sat us 4 on each table due to covid. Think the max is 6 ppl per table.  They temperature check everyone before seating."
4,"Came here for a private event: My friend&apos;s baby&apos;s 1st birthday! Great space for parties. Plenty of parking in the lot. 

M Grill is a terrific Brazilian steakhouse. Nicely designed interiors with trendy decor, but the building itself (exterior) looks really dated. For dining, there is a cool self-serve salad bar with refreshing and delicious fruits, seafood, soup, cold cuts, and veggies. For the main courses, the waiters serve the variety of different meats to your table. It is all you can eat, so enjoy and devour to your heart&apos;s content. The meat selections of pork, beef, lamb, chicken, etc. are brought to the table and some are sliced from the hand held skewers. The quality and taste of the meats are excellent. Perfectly cooked to my liking, as well. Filet mignon, parmesan chicken, rack of lamb, top sirloin, smoked sausage, boneless leg of lamb, wagyu beef, beef ribs, &amp; ribeye are just a number of meats I&apos;ve had from their extensive menu!!

The servers are both friendly and accommodating here!! No complaints!!"
