5,"Alcove is a great date spot if you want to grab a bite to eat, have a drink or enjoy some coffee &amp; dessert!

They really have it all here and and the majority of their seating has always been outdoors, so not much has changed here during the pandemic. Of course they&apos;re limited capacity and spacing tables, but that&apos;s the &quot;new norm&quot; these days.

I actually love coming here to enjoy their delicious desserts! They always have the best selections of baked goods. I personally am a huge fan of cheesecake and their selection is out of this world! Even though I&apos;m usually here for dessert, last time I enjoyed some of their Blackened Salmon Tacos and they did not disappoint.

Seems like this place has it down, whatever you decide! Stop by and give &apos;em a try!"
4,"One of the great outdoor spots in Los Feliz. What we love about this locale is their plentiful patio dining that gives diners a view of street life activity making for great casual ambiance.

The food is great and while it&apos;s nothing over the top, it&apos;s unbeatable for LA cafes especially given the location. Definitely a great spot to have a casual date with someone or bring visitors just to dine and enjoy the street life simultaneously."
4,"Adored this little gem, Super cute ambiance. Very busy, I wait in line which they do strictly enforce social distancing. Order first and then a host will seat you. That&apos;s where they could use more organization Bc at some points the host was nowhere to be found and some people were just poaching tables and seating themselves. The blueberry lemon cake was absolutely divine. Meter parking and/or valet (I believe). Def will be returning."
5,"what can i even say about this spot? everything from breakfast, dinner, dessert, and cocktails is right in front of you. this place is perfect for any celebration, whether you&apos;re on a date, family brunch, birthday, etc.

my bf took me here for the first time a few years ago, and now we keep coming back here. the ambiance provides a very homey and comfortable space. there&apos;s a line to order whether you&apos;re taking it to-go or eating there, but it usually goes by quick.

everything&apos;s delicious, but my go-to order is the smoked salmon breakfast stack. it&apos;s so flavorful, and it has the right amount of smokiness from the salmon. the dessert--don&apos;t even get me started on the dessert--is the best thing out of it all. a slice of cake will satisfy two people. make sure to try the godiva cake if you&apos;re a chocolate lover!"
5,"Due to Covid, it is always best to call the Café to see if they changed their times and menu. 

Alcove Café &amp; Bakery is one of my favorite places in LA. I love the outdoor seating, the food, and I just feel at home. They have a simple menu and everything has been delicious. 

I do, however, have a few must orders. 

Brioche French Toast ($14): Mixed berry compote, creme fraiche, and maple syrup. This French toast hits the spot every time. 

Chilaquiles Rojo $15): Eggs, tortilla chips, spicy salsa rojo, cobija, cilantro, onions, sour cream, and black beans. I love this. I know chilaquiles always taste different in every place, but this one was delicious. I also ask for a side of avocado. 

As far as bakery, they offer a few items. They have cakes but have not tried any, surprisingly. 

CHOCOLATE CHIP BREAD PUDDING: buttery croissants, chunks of chocolate, toped with powdered sugar. This is a must order for me. I order it every time. 

LITTLE YELPERS CLUB:

They offer a kids menu. Cheeseburger, fried chicken, grilled cheese, quesadilla, pancakes, etc."
5,"I had come here a handful of times a few years back and just made it back here for brunch with girlfriends and it was just as lovely as I remembered. Plenty of outdoor seating and heat lamps, strong cocktails, attentive service and generous portions. Plus their baked goods - yummmm! Parking is street or valet ($10 cash). If you don&apos;t need cocktails , their sister location Aroma Cafe in Studio City is pretty bomb too. Great for quick business lunches (in non-covid times) or a late night date spot."
5,"Had a great experience here. You order at the counter inside the restaurant, if you&apos;re there on the weekend like I was there will likely be a socially distanced line being coordinated by one of the employees. 
The food was extremely well done breakfast food. The sauce in the chilaquiles was flavorful &amp; the chips were still crunchy. The eggs were cooked exactly as asked which I really appreciate, you know I want that soft yolk for my chilaquiles. 

The lemon ricotta pancakes were honestly some of the best I&apos;ve had. They were fluffy and flavorful. You could actually taste the lemon and ricotta but neither were overwhelming. 

The line was a bit long but once we ordered everything was fast and as expected can&apos;t wait to come back."
4,"Its a very nice, cute brunch spot. I came here around 9am and it was already getting busy with a small wait, so get here early. Was able to snag a parking spot in the neighborhood streets behind the restaurant, like on Franklin. Valet is operating, but it shouldn&apos;t be hard to find a free parking spot around the block if you get here early enough.

Staff was very nice and was patient with us since it was our first time. Both our breakfast burrito and salmon breakfast stack was delicious and savory (and a great gram too). Although I wish the potato hash underneath the salmon stack wasn&apos;t so burnt... I would personally prefer a golden color for my hash and would make for a prettier shot too! The iced latte was the right balance too.

My friend couldn&apos;t stop raving about the strawberry cake we got as dessert. It&apos;s got nice layers of frosting, cake, and jam. I personally don&apos;t have as much of a sweet tooth, but can see people who love dessert really being a fan of their cakes. 

Finally, they do have bathrooms as well, and very well maintained/clean. Overall, it&apos;s a cute brunch experience, but make sure to get here early so you don&apos;t wait too long for service and seating!"
4,"I feel like this place was meant for Pandemic Outdoor dining!  Plenty of outdoor seating in the front and sides of the restaurant.  When you arrive, you wait in line to place your order.  Only at that time will you be given a table number can grab a table.  Breakfast/Brunch items are pretty much served all day!  Sadly, their most popular item, Crab Cake Benedicts were off the menu due to the pandemic.  I went with Avocado Toast with Poached Eggs which I thought was just ok.  One toast, no sides, pretty lacking.  Husband got the Carnitas Omelette which was overflowing with potatoes and beans and topped with flour tortillas.  The best part of the meal was out shared short stack of Lemon Ricotta Pancakes!  This literally melted in my mouth!  The ricotta cheese just make the pancakes light and fluffy! This dish pushed my rating to a 4 when I originally wanted to give it a 3."
5,"What a find!  During outdoor dining only so not the full experience, but delicious food, beautiful decorations, enjoyable patio and well marked social distancing protocols in place.  

I think I will be venturing more this direction as places open back up.  The menu was wonderful with unique options.  Can&apos;t wait to go back and try some other items.

Street parking is ok.  We found a spot a short walk away."
5,Anna was very friendly And made my day by finding me the last slice of birthday cake thank you Anna
5,"Delicious place for breakfast in the popular &amp; hip strip of Los Feliz.

Alcove is interesting because you order everything first &amp; pay, then it&apos;s brought out to your table for you. This includes beer with brunch - don&apos;t judge me! They had some bottled beer but also two beers on draft. That made the HungryBeerChick a happy camper.

I had the Smoked Salmon breakfast stack. Just look at that thing. It was joyous and scrumptious in my mouth. Two potato pancakes topped with salmon, two poached eggs, creme fraiche and dill. Absolutely loved this and sorry y&apos;all, but it went great with my beer. hehe.

My friend also very much enjoyed his meal.

We waited about 30 minutes to get seated, but in the end the wait was worth it. We were seated in an adorable side patio, full of greenery and more private that in the front of the restaurant.

I&apos;m a fan and will always request to sit in that side area."
3,"This place looked good on the page so I decided to give it a try. I order the breakfast burrito and it was alright. The place itself was nice and they were practicing safe precautions. Not sure it is my jam, but the brunch mimosa was pretty good."
4,"My stars are mainly for the ambience and staff. This place is SUPER cute. Due to COVID everything is only outside estiI got the Cobb salad. My downfalls were the tomatoes were cut really big I had to have had like 3 whole tomatoes on my plate and the chicken was seasoned well but dry. 

I got some lemonade and it was good. My partner got a breakfast burrito, I tried the potatoes and they were really good just required some ketchup for my liking. 

All the staff were really nice and attentive when needing mor wearer or condiments they came out quickly. I will definitely return and maybe try something different. They did have GF bread I believe she told me so maybe trying a sandwich next time."
5,Great spot in Los Feliz! Went during their happy hour on a weekday and there was plenty of outdoor seating available. Would highly recommend the turkey chili with cornbread.
5,"This place has amazing service, food and outdoor seating. My first time here and definitely not my last. 

Service - Marco is always nearby and is there to get you anything you need whether it&apos;s to wipe down the table or get a cup of ice. While I was waiting for the women&apos;s restroom an employee whom I assume works in the kitchen based on his attire - apron and hair net, he opened the men&apos;s restroom and checked then told me it&apos;s clean and that I can use it. Like awe! 

Food - First of all the pancakes are great! It&apos;s gluten free with a hint of lemon! The maple syrup is sweet but not too sweet. The truffle fries is seasoned with truffle. The ketchup is yummy - it is home made. 

Only problem is the straw lol as you can see by the picture."
5,It is amazing they remained providing the best cakes for LA during the pandemic. The restaurant&apos;s quality and sweetness made us forget for a bit of the difficult times we are living.
5,"I had a wonderful experience here late last Saturday! It was a close friend&apos;s birthday and we were looking for somewhere quick with drinks and when we called ahead Alcove was so hospitable and let us know they would love to have my group of 7. The price points were affordable, drinks were lovely, and portion sizes were large. The atmosphere was very calm with little globe lights hung around, and they even brought out a little pie for my friend as a surprise for her birthday! It was so thoughtful and the staff really seemed appreciative of our patronage. I never find myself in east LA but Alcove really left a positive impact and I can&apos;t thank you guys enough for the hospitality and good food. :)"
4,"I came here last year and had an enjoyable meal. The staff were great - fun and friendly. I was impressed with their creative cocktail list. I was also thrilled that their martini was served with a blue cheese olive, which is my preference. The Pan Roasted Salmon Salad was delicious, and the salmon was cooked perfectly. The truffle fries were yummy. Their desert case looked tempting, but I was too full.
They recently opened for take out during quarantine so I took this opportunity to try one of their deserts. I ordered the apple Pie and a cocktail - Spicy but Nicey (a margarita with a kick.) The apple pie was amazing! OMG! One of the best so far. The cocktail was tasty and perfect for the warm day. 
In the past, they&apos;ve held lots of fun events during the year like movie nights. I hope they are able to resume that once quarantine is lifted. Alcove is a cute little place with lots of charm."
1,"Not sure what the hype is here, so I&apos;ll explain the experience I had today. 

Firstly, their outdoor dining is open, which is spacious and nice. The couple behind me refused to social distance properly which I had to kindly tell them to back up onto the social distancing.

Secondly, food came about 30 minutes after we ordered and we came around ~1130am. When the food finally came, my friend, who got a Tuna Melt said it was offputting and gross. Just bland. My turkey pesto panini had bread that was way too thick and the bread was barely toasted like a panini. The ketchup, mayo, and ranch dipping sauces were terrible. The ketchup had a very strong tomato flavor since it was made from scratch. The mayo was literally just house-made mayo with no flavor. You could at least add some garlic or something to make it an aioli. The ranch sauce tasted like sour cream and onion lays potato chips, which was very offputting nonetheless. 

Now onto the worst part--The fries. The fries were overly salty. Their truffle fries are coated with truffle salt instead of truffle oil (a complete disappointment to fries all together) and we had to ask for remake fries since they were inedible and the remake fries were equally as salty and inedible as the truffle salted fries counterpart. 

My only plus of this review was that the Shirley Temple that I ordered was actually the best-tasting thing here. 

With all the hype and positive reviews, I was surprised to get such low-quality food. Would not eat here again, unfortunately. I hope this will help those who want good truffle fries to avoid coming here."
