5,"In my opinion you can&apos;t go wrong here!

I live very close by this place so I&apos;ve ordered breakfast here a handful of times. Everything tastes clean, fresh, and delicious! Some of my favorite items on the menu would have to be the Grain Bowl, the Strawberry Ricotta Toast, and the Black Bean Avocado Wrap. I&apos;ve eaten in person and ordered takeout and both are great options. The only downside is that in person you might have to wait a bit for a table because this place is typically fairly crowded around brunch time.

Highly recommend if you want a fun brunch with great food!"
5,"Another amazing trip to met her at a bar,. The food is nothing short of amazing! I was a little underwhelmed with the chicken pesto panini this time around only for the simple fact that pesto seemed like it was just all Mayo and a little dry. But everything else we had was spot on the matcha waffles were something new we tried and wow they were the show stopped of our trip! My boyfriend got a breakfast burrito and said it was delicious.

We were taken care of by Jake and when I tell you that man was the sweetest, most upbeat server I&apos;ve had in a while I&apos;m not lying. Anything we asked from him he got it with no hesitation and you can tell he was smiling under his mask. We will Ofcourse be back very soon and hopefully Jake will be there!"
5,"My wife wanted me to meet her at a bar and here I am writing this review. Are y&apos;all ready for the Mihr Report? 

Covid Precautions 5/5: All staff were properly masked and tables were spread out and they were very clean. 

Customer Service 5/5: We checked in on the tablet inside and as we were waiting outside Emily, the hostess, made sure we had checked in. We had to run a quick errand while waiting for our table and were kicked off the wait list. When we came back Emily recognized us and remembered my name even while being masked! I don&apos;t even recognize my wife when she is walking straight towards me. All the servers were super nice and checked on us frequently. This is my long winded way of saying they take good care of you. 

Ambiance 4/5: Tables are setup along the sidewalk. Not the nicest views but very nice colorful seating. 

Drinks 4/5: I had the drip coffee and my wife had the latte and both were good. The mugs are a nice touch! 

Food 5/5: Very delicious and unique food options. We had the fried chicken and waffle, which was delicious and the waffle benedict. It was sweet and savory just how we like it! 

Parking 3/5: Street parking can be tricky but during COVID you should be able to find a spot. 

What are you waiting for? Go meet her at a bar."
5,"This was one of the best brunches I&apos;ve had in quiet some time! Came here on a Sunday around 11am. It was super busy at the actual resto, wait time was 30 mins. However that day, staff told us we could also go across to the blue restaurant who was also serving the same menu (might have been a partnership or both places owned by same owner?) for a potential shorter wait time. We ended up getting seated immediately for a party of 2, which was awesome. 

My friend and I ordered two plates and shared. Both dishes were absolutely delicious! The Breakfast Sandwich has a chipotle aioli on it that makes the sandwich super favorable and the Crispy French Toast has a nice crunch to it (lives up to its name lol) - I preferred not to add the syrup as it was sweet enough on its own. 

Customer service was friendly and they were attentive! The waiter who helped us out answered our questions thoroughly and was polite. Tables are separated and there&apos;s also a plastic see through separation from people waking by, so I felt comfortable dining outdoors. 

Would definitely go back again!"
4,"Every time I drive down La Brea, I see a line of people wrapped around the building. But don&apos;t let that turn you off, the food is definitely worth the wait!
 
- FOOD: There are so many options to choose from--so many that my friend and I decided to order three entrees to share so we could try a little of everything. We ordered the You Make Me Wake Up Happy, the Peaches and Cream Waffle, and the Oh Wow Crispy French Toast. The You Make Me Wake Up Happy consists of a waffle, scrambled eggs, bacon, and sausage. The entire dish was quite filling. No need to order additional sides. The star of the show was definitely the waffles. Whether you order a plain waffle or one with toppings, it was flavorful and cooked to perfection. Let&apos;s not forget about the French Toast. The French Toast was out of this world too! My only criticism would be that I would&apos;ve preferred a little more Nutella on the French Toast.
- CUSTOMER SERVICE: The customer service was on point. Although I don&apos;t remember what our server&apos;s name was, he was friendly, attentive, and quick. He would check up on our table often and refilled our drinks without having to ask.
- PARKING: Street parking is available. However, depending on when you go, parking can be hectic. Be sure to plan accordingly.

Overall, I would recommend dining here. The food is delicious! I can&apos;t wait to come back and try other items on the menu."
4,"Let me start off by saying I love the food! Great service as well.

However, one thing I hate the most is getting charged for things I am not made aware of. When it came to paying I was given a receipt with an additional 4 dollars for donation for healthcare. Keep in mind I was never asked if I wanted to donate....and when I was asked what that charge was for I was explained it was for donation but If I wanted they could remove it....I left it ..... but, then I also got charged automatically $20 for service tip. Again never told I would be charged this. (4 adults and 1 kid)"
5,"Tried this place for the first time and loved it. 

Wasn&apos;t expecting the Chicken &amp; waffles to be that different than what I am used to ordering at restaurants that have them as well, but they were really good! 

They are prepared Thai style with peppers and the Thai sauce. It tasted really good and unique.

I will define you be coming back! Just make sure you get there early on the weekends because it can get busy!"
5,"I&apos;m EMBARRASSED! I&apos;ve been to Met Her At A Bar over a handful of times and I&apos;ve never written a review. So here I am finally. 

This place is absolute fire and lives up to the hype. 
My normal go too would be a mimosa and some French toast but my life is different these days lol.

This time around I got the breakfast burrito with some chipotle aioli. An absolute smash. Also light on the stomach... I subbed out the meat for some avocado. Fresh, flavorful, and a bit of basic. In the best way possible. 

Customer service is always super hospitable. The vibe and ambience is hip/trendy. Our server today Jon, hit us with great energy off the bat. Was extremely attentive and helpful.

I recommend this place to everybody, especially friends and family looking for a lunch/ brunch to eat at while visiting LA."
5,"Great brunch/breakfast spot and worth a visit! 

~COVID 19~ 
Outdoor dining only with socially distanced tables. 

~FOOD~
1) Avocado toast, 5/5- This avocado toast is everything avo toast should be! Delicious avocado spread over a toasted sourdough, with tomatoes and a sprinkling of soft and cheesy parmesan and  added two fried eggs on top. It was magical. 

2) Waffletella, 5/5- SO YUM. Idk about you but anytime I go for brunch I need a sweet entree in addition to my savory dish so I opted for the nutella waffle. Fluffy, chocolatey, fruity and amazing. Sprinkled with a dusting of powdered sugar, no syrup is even needed. 

** 5/5 on food presentation**

~Service~
5/5, service was great! Meals were brought out in a timely fashion and I was never left waiting for anything. 

Overall, I would definitely come here again and recommend it to anyone looking for a great brunch spot in LA. The restaurant also has such a cute story on their name and you can read about it on their menu *insert heart eyes*"
4,"A big fan of their lattes! This time I got it with oat milk that gives my latte some body. Delicious!

Their matcha waffles are crack! Great to share between two! 

Customer service is excellent, very attentive and they take orders outside during covid.

I&apos;d like to try their other restaurant across the street, Italian!"
5,"&quot;What was that place called?
 &apos;Met my Husband&apos; or something? 
 They had BOMB chicken and waffles.&quot;

An actual conversation between my mom and I that led us here. Luckily we remembered the name so we can pickup nice brunch. 

And they DO have amazing Chicken &amp; Waffles!! [$19]
It&apos;s Thai-inspired so it&apos;s slightly spicy with more hot sauce if you wish. Their waffles are buttery and delicious. It&apos;s not as good after a 30 min drive back home vs eating it there.. But still good as we can get! 

Tried something new -- White Truffle Toast. [$15.5]
Great truffle taste and their scrambled eggs really good. Simple but executed well. 
We got it so I could be inspired to elevate my brunch game haha.

Honestly it was the fluffy grated cheese on top (from the photos) that sold it for me. Wish it had more cheese. I kinda missed in-house dining bc then I could get endless parmesan cheese...nonstop...! 

Honestly I wonder if someone did meet their husband or wife at Met Her at a Bar! Love to hear it."
5,"I ordered two things that I am not really a big fan of when I went to this brunch location - chicken and waffle and French toast. 

I never find chicken and waffle to go that well together and usually I only get basic chicken tenders and waffles. However, this chicken and waffle really blew me out of the park! It comes with a sweet n spicy sauce that also complemented the flavor of the chicken. The chicken and waffle are 5/5!!

Regarding the French toast, it was not too sweet and crispy on the edges just like I like it. The only complaint I have about it is that I wish it came with more berries. I feel like I was rationing the berries too much because of the amount.

I should also mention since I had to do a pickup order I wasn&apos;t eating all this food super fresh (30 minutes or so), but both the dishes tasted amazing. I made my order through Yelp and the food was ready much before the estimated time, which I was thankful for but I wish the Yelp app was a bit more accurate."
5,"The ABSOLUTE BEST brunch in LA. It&apos;s such a cute place. I love it so much and bring anyone that comes in town to visit me. Everyone that i have brought has been amazed by the food. The food is great, the staff is nice, and the owner is sooo friendly and accommodating! My favorites on the menu are the Thai chicken and waffles , the truffle waffle fries , and the smoked salmon  which I order as a side. The iced latte is also really good which they let me choose flavors and the kind of milk I wanted. Definitely make the time to come here!"
5,"The hype is real. That doesn&apos;t happen too often but it has here at MHAB. They&apos;re featured in every youtube foodie&apos;s channel and they deserve every bit of recognition. I agree with many other yelpers that this is definitely a spot to hit up if you&apos;re in LA only for a few days. We got take-out and it took roughly 20 mins to get our food even though they were extremely busy on a Saturday afternoon. Parking is street parking but there&apos;s plenty if you&apos;re willing to walk a couple of blocks. We got the egg benedicts on waffles and it was sublime. I would have liked to dine-in on the outdoor patio but we were short on time so the waffles got a little soggy by the time we ate but it was still delicious. The rosemary potatoes were also perfect, a little crunch on the outside and soft in the middle. We will be back for the fried chicken thai style on waffles, can&apos;t wait!"
4,"Pretty good chicken and waffles!

Service was okay. The host won&apos;t let you sit until your whole party is there but she says &quot;there are  plenty of tables.&quot; So not exactly the most hospitable. 

Parking is okay, not bad at all. I found metered street parking nearby and there&apos;s also other neighboring side streets to park at. 

Food again was great. My friend and I weren&apos;t too hungry so we had a few drinks and bites of food to share. 

Cute little corner spot that I always wanted to check out."
5,Tried this for the 1st time with a group of friends. California was closed so we pretty it to go. Ordered the chicken and the waffle. I knew it be delicious. Love thai fried chicken and the spices. The butter that came with the waffle was good too. Really like sweet and savory tastes. The next time I&apos;m in California I will be sure to check out this restaurant again.
4,"The avocado toast is delicious! I added an egg on top of mines and it was perfect. The bread edges are a little rough though and hard to chew, but besides that it&apos;s something I would order again. The chicken and waffles were solid too."
5,Perfect cozy spot for brunch or breakfast. We were really looking for a causal breakfast in our neighborhood and we&apos;re so glad we finally found it. I&apos;m a harsh coffee critic and their coffee was great. We got the waffle with fresh berries and it was perfect. Service was awesome and the covid precautions were top notch with table spacing and mobile menus. Will be back soon!
4,"Yummy Iced lattes , very friendly tall guy took our order out front for a to go order . We just got the iced lattes and the matcha waffle  .

The man who took our order was patient and gave us several suggestions without making us feel rushed or that we were of burden to him ( even though the restaurant is considerably busy )

Met Him at a Bar is just across the street and you can take your food to the La Brea Tarpits and Museum just down the road if you are still feeling iffy about outdoor dining like us .

Minus a star just because my latte seemed a little off on the coffee to milk ratio ratio this time , but still good and have had better coffee here before . Matcha Waffle"
5,"Awh I love this place so much and I&apos;m so sad I moved but can&apos;t wait to visit when I come to LA! 

Food - I went for brunch. Got the pancakes, coffee, and mimosa. All delicious! Well made the food and coffee was hot! Mimosa was crisp and fresh. 

Service - super super friendly! I cannot remember the name of the gentlemen who helped me but he was the best. We had a nice conversation and he definitely knows what he&apos;s talking about when it comes to the food recs. 

Decor - I sat inside at the window bar. It was perfect for people watching outside and still inclusive of the interior. The have this beautiful wall mural to the right of in. The entire inside is bright, vibrant blues and yellow. Great place for daytime dining. Much more spacious and an appetizing space than the sister location across the street. 

I actually stumbled here because I was on line at Met Her At A Bar across the street(same owner I believe) but the wait was over an hour so I came to this spot. I went just three weeks after they opens so it wasn&apos;t crowded, it&apos;s so good I&apos;m sure it gets more crowded nowadays."
