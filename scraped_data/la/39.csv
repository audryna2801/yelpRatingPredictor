5,"We went to Quarters for my mom&apos;s birthday! They have great outdoor seating with heaters. Parking is so hard to find but they have a small valet right next to the plaza. They will not seat you unless your entire party has arrived. 

Quarters is not all you can eat. We ordered small Combo #2 and a japchae for 3 people. None of us are huge eaters so the small combo was enough for 3 people. We took home most of the Japchae. I liked the pork jowl and the boneless short ribs. Ribs so tender &amp; soft with great seasoning. The jowl has crunchy texture &amp; tastes fatty. They give you a small cheese bowl on the grill so you can dip your meat in cheese! 

This place lives up to the hype. Servers are so nice. They no longer cook for you during covid-era. But sometimes the servers will help cut your meat to speed things along :-)"
5,"Ahhhh I love this place forever. We came to try it out  during covid times and I was very pleased with how clean everything was! The bathrooms especially! 

They gave us a free kimchi pancake which was so yummy. 

The meat here is quality and well worth the wait. 

Pro-tip: come on a week night and you only have to wait like 30 minutes!"
5,"Oh, KBBQ how I&apos;ve missed you!  

I didn&apos;t get a chance to go to KBBQ prior to pandemic and not when restaurants were open for a short time.  Now that outdoor dining has resumed in LA I am so happy to have it again.  

It isn&apos;t AYCE here, but still really good quality meat and service.  The wait was about 1.5 - 2 hours.  I came with a group of 5 people and we ordered the Large Combo.  It comes with a selections of meats, kimchi soup, egg souffl√© along with the banchan.  There is no rice paper and serve rice if requested.  They also have a bowl of shredded cheese (I&apos;ve never seen this in any restaurant I&apos;m where I&apos;ve had KBBQ).

My favorite meat was the marinated pork.  So full of flavor and the meat isn&apos;t to tough to chew.   I loved the shredded beef and the kimchi fried rice was also really good. Really though, they had top quality meats and I really enjoyed my experience here."
4,"This area in K-town is always lit and ready to party! 

We checked in at 6pm on a Saturday night and they told us the wait was going to be 2 hours. This was expected (Thank you Yelp reviews!). We left our number and they said they would text us when our table was ready. It took 1hr 50mins so a little bit less than the expected time. 

We got seated outdoors and there were plenty of outdoor heaters. Not cold at all around 8pm. 

Quarters is not AYCE so but they do have set combo menus. We decided to do a la carte since we were not a fan of bulgogi. Highly recommend their boneless short rib if you&apos;re a fan of marbling and the fatty texture. 

They did not tell us this in advance but if you order 5 items from the a la carte menu, it comes with a kimchi soup, steamed egg, and veggie skewers. I wish we knew about this so we didn&apos;t end up over ordering."
3,"Had a big celebration here last weekend and was pretty disappointed with this place.  If this was open anywhere else, it&apos;d be a 4 stars, but in the context of LA and Koreatown, this place is just a 3 stars.  The next time I&apos;m in LA, I would make an effort to visit another iconic Korean restaurant to be honest as this one was not impressed. The disclaimer I would throw in is that because this was during COVID, they don&apos;t cook the meats for you. I have a feeling if they did cook the meat for you, the quality of the output would be much better.

First off, the furniture here is absolutely horrible  - designed only to be serviceable but not comfortable over time. This is likely a different story  in a non-COVID environment where we can actually sit in booths, but the chairs are super uncomfortable, the tables are TINY, and everyone is crammed  in a party.

We ordered one of the fixed menu sets for 4-5 people and added some more additions from the meat menu that weren&apos;t represented in the fixed menu.  The portions were pretty small and all the meats were generally OK, like the bulgogi or steak.   But none that was eye-popping good. Paid sides were absolutely tiny in comparison, with the steamed egg the size of three fingers and the salad being pretty meh. The drinks were a super great experience, the mango yakult was a winner in my book especially with the entire cider upturned inside the drink.  

- Japchae was completely forgettable. Kimchi was boring, none of the flavors were special, everything kind of mixed together.  All the side dishes were flat and one dimensional, except for &quot;spicy!&quot;.
- Free kimchi pancake was good.  Adds good mix into the overall meal that is texturely and taste-wise noticeably different.
- Marinated kalbi was really good, but the brisket and pork belly were all meh.  For the price, I can forgive small/moderate portions for high quality, but there were some cuts that were just...eh.  The NY steak in particular is one that stands out to me that was actually pretty shit for what it cost - on par with a USDA Choice from Safeway."
4,"I&apos;m a fan of Quarters! I haven&apos;t been during COVID outdoor dining times so I can&apos;t say if it&apos;s still as good as it was before, but my most recent visit was delicious! For the 2 of us, we split the Beef Combo, which serves 2-3 people.  The combo platter came with Beef Belly, Seasoned Boneless Short Rib, Grilled Bulgogi, and Pork Jowl. I thought the Bulgogi would be my fave but I actually really enjoyed the Short Rib! Super tender and marinated well without being too salty. All of the sides were delicious too, like the soup and veggies. The highlight for me is definitely the cheese! Dipping the meat in the cheese and coating every inch of it....flavor explosion in your mouth."
5,"PRE-COVID REVIEW

MY NEW ALL TIME FAVORITE KBBQ SPOT! With some of the best Korean food LA has to offer in this small plaza, you&apos;ve probably seen large crowds of people waiting in line next door for Kang Ho-dong Baekjeong (KHB). With over 4000 reviews, that&apos;s no surprise; but Quarters certainly should not be overlooked.

Although KHB looks more IG worthy with their unique grill setup, Quarters makes up for it with the food and shorter wait time. Don&apos;t get me wrong, the quality of the food at KHB is probably the best, but I feel like the quality at Quarters is nearly the same and you get waaaaay more bang for your buck!

I came with a group of 6 and luckily was seated within 30 minutes. Considering this was on Fri at around 7:30pm, that was pretty quick. Inside it is quite spacious and looks pretty modern. We ended up sharing the Jumbo Combo with extra Marinated Beef Short Rib. Once the meat arrives, you can clearly see how amazing the marbling is. (Pictures are worth a thousand words and there&apos;s no way you can claim that the quality at KHB is significantly better than Quarters because it&apos;s not!) The marinades are spot on and made everything taste delicious! Everything was sooo juicy and tender, it&apos;s unreal! Some of our favorites were the Marinated Beef Short Rib, Seasoned Short Rib, and Pork Jowl. With a larger order like this, it came with veggies, egg stew, kimchi stew, and cheese fondue! YASSS! Scoop some of the cheese with the meat....Game Changer!

For a little over $200 this was truly a lot of meat for 6 guys! I recently went to KHB and spent the same amount for 3 girls and 3 guys and some of us were definitely still hungry even after getting multiple refills of the egg and cheese. There&apos;s obviously a lot of well deserved hype at KHB, but now that I&apos;ve had it, I know that I would skip those long lines in a heart beat and eat my fill at Quarters while saving money at the same time."
5,"So so happy that they are open again. The staff wears gloves, masks, and face shields. They also make sure to keep tables at least 6&apos; away from other tables. The servers are nice and helpful. When we went for lunch, there was no wait time for 4 people. We ordered the large, which was plenty of food! I can&apos;t wait to come back!"
5,"Mmmmm quarters is so good!! They&apos;re customer service is great too!! Their meat quality is amazing!! I love coming here to eat their bulgogi and beef belly! Yum yum!! 
Ya gotta try this place one day if you can ! 

Parking can be tricky but it&apos;s worth the wait!"
5,"Amazing for dine in and also great take out during Covid! Combo 2 was a generous portion for two (normal appetite people). The to go combo had pork jowl, beef belly, marinated boneless short rib and seasoned bulgogi (sweet and sesame flavored) meats. The kimchi soup was also &quot;souper&quot; tasty and I would even consider ordering a la carte! The banchan was individually portioned  and a refreshing foil to the rich meats. The kimchi pancake was a bit underwhelming but welcomed. Sauces and salad are an excellent accompaniment to the rest of the meal. They even had the cheese fondue on the side for dipping that was great coming out of the microwave.

It took less than their quoted 45 min wait on a weekday. Definitely on the pricier end of take out but the sides made it worth it. I would order again for sure if I am in LA and craving kbbq!"
5,"This is my spot in LA for Korean BBQ, everything is delicious. The meat is so tender and perfectly seasoned. Every single one of the side dishes was delicious and you can ask for more. The bulgogi was marinated so good and you have to try dipping your brisket in the cheese. TRY it, it&apos;s amazing. I can&apos;t wait for my next visit. The place is fire!"
4,"When nothing else goes your way, you can always count on some Quarters KBBQ. 

My friends and I ate here this past January and it was fantastic. Quarters is awesome. This is great especially if you are impatient to wait so you can grab a drink and hang out at their lounge area.

If that doesn&apos;t satisfy you, I recommend you put your name and phone number down, and then go shopping at the plazas across the street or walk around the plazas nearby. Trust me, you&apos;ll find something to do at Ktown.

The service was quick and excellent. When we were seated, the Banchans were already placed on our table. Our server was quick on grilling the meats and the unlimited banchans were quickly replaced by her assistant. She grilled all the meats for us and it took her a little less than 30 mins to finish everything.

I wish Quarters the best of luck especially during this pandemic. I look forward on coming back eating here in person once everything cools down."
5,"I had a great experience at Quarters Korean BBQ when they were open for outdoor dine in during the pandemic. There is a parking lot attached, but it&apos;s all valet, so you need to pay via your phone and show the valet attendant.

The outside dining area is pretty spaced out. This isn&apos;t your typical &quot;all you can eat KBBQ&quot; place. You order dishes when you get seated, and the meat comes out cooked in portions. I enjoyed the side dishes and the kimchee pancake. The scallops were delicious along with the meat we ordered.

Service was impeccable, and if given the chance, I&apos;d eat KBBQ here again!"
2,"Outdoor dining available, located in a small plaza with other restaurants and bars. I have been wanting to try this place for years every time I pass by to go to gaam. 

Waited about 10 minutes Friday evening before it got busy for a table for two. Menu available by scanning the QR code on the table. 

Really disappointed with the portion size considering how pricey it is. Ordered the brisket, marinated beef and pork belly, it wasn&apos;t enough. We then ordered the seafood pancake. Usually pajeon are really big, served on a big plate but this one was tiny as well! I was still hungry at the end of the night and I am a small girl, I don&apos;t overly eat. 

Honestly, the quality of meat was good but it&apos;s as good as Kang Ho Dong and you would get more with their set menu for a better price."
2,"I come here a lot and the food is normally good I don&apos;t have complaints but recently I went in and the people taking down names for the waitlist are very vague and pretty much tell you to go eat somewhere else if it&apos;s an hour or two before closing and they don&apos;t want to deal with people coming in last minute which is really annoying. 

I feel like if you&apos;re going to close a waitlist an hour before you close then just do that, Don&apos;t leave it open and take peoples names down but tell them they&apos;re better off finding somewhere else ? 

Didn&apos;t make sense to me. And made me not go back since, Even though I&apos;m normally a regular."
4,"So, Quarters has been on my Yelp Bookmark for like the longest time but I never went. However, for my hubby&apos;s birthday this year we were limited in babysitters and places we can go eat at due to COVID. 

I tried calling Quarters a ton of times but no answer. I wanted to make sure that they were opened and to confirm that they have outdoor seating. So let me tell you, they do. 

Apparently, because of COVID the food comes out cooked and pre COVID it didn&apos;t. It actually still tasted pretty good coming out cooked. No complaints from my hubby and I. 

Their tables are all well spaced out. Staff are wearing masks and a shield. There&apos;s 6 ft stickers on the ground reminding you to stay 6 ft apart at check in. They text you when your table is ready if you have to wait. 

They give a ton of dipping sauces and sides. I loved that they treated my 2 and 4 year old normal. They gave them sauces and everything as if they were adults. Totally cool! 

Ordered:
Brisket - my gosh this was amazing with their cheese dip
Beef Belly - super delish with the cheese dip
Kim Chi Stew - SO FREAKING BOMB. this is highly recommended
Ribeye soft but no flavor
Beef Tongue - skip! was not memorable

Table was sticky which I didn&apos;t like too much. When I asked the staff to clean it again because its sticky he said that&apos;s the way it was. Water cups does not have lids even though I asked. Which I wasn&apos;t too crazy about because I was scared my kid would spill the water everywhere. 

Would I come back? Yes in a heartbeat! The service overall was fairly well. No huge complaints. The food was pretty darn good! Quarters actually surprised my husband and I on how good the food was. And that Kim Chi Stew still got me salivating! YUMMY! 2 thumbs up!

Tips:
*They have high chairs.
*Takes credit card
*Valet parking or street parking
*Right next to Toe Bang, Silverlake Ramen, Starbucks, etc. 
*Outdoor seating available.
*Michelin 2019
*Serves alcohol"
5,"My preferred restaurant in one of best restaurants in Los Angeles. As everyone knows that Los Angeles go so many nice places where you can eat and enjoy, but QKBBQ is one of them. 
Food is amazing here although with a small portion but the quality is unquestionably nice and refreshing.
The pork Jowl and seasoned boneless ribs are amazing here. Just melt in your mouth goodness. Also all the side dishes complimented the meat perfectly for me every time. Service here is nice along with a nice atmosphere.

Right now I am in Los Angeles but for a short time, so I have no plans visiting the place but I&apos;ve made a schedule for coming back and stay for a while then I should be able to enjoy their meal and service once again and will update this review."
5,"holy kimchi soup, this kbbq is FIRE 

i&apos;m honestly so obsessed with quarters! when los angeles lifted the outdoor dining restrictions, this was the first place i wanted to go back to. 

their sides, meats, and drinks are all phenomenal. i almost always opt for combo 1 or 2 and have never been disappointed. the grilled bulgogi is great, as is the seasoned boneless short rib, and the pork jowl (which i love dipping in the melted cheese that warms on the grill). their famous dipping sauce is EXCELLENT and compliments each element of the meal perfectly. the combo comes with a wide spread of sides and assorted dishes, all of which i&apos;m here for, but particularly fond of the kimchi soup. 

overall, 10/10 for the food, atmosphere, and service!"
5,"Amazing kbbq with outdoor seating available! Keep in mind they have parking in the back for $3 but you must pay online through a QR code.

When we arrived we were seated pretty quickly. We ordered the combo 2 and an order of the beef tartare. There is no grill and the food comes already cooked, but everything was really delicious!

Combo 2 comes with steamed egg, a choice of soup, and 4 meats: beef belly, boneless short ribs, grilled bulgogi, and pork jowl. We also got the cheese dip!! As usual, my favorite was the beef tartare, but the meats from the combo were also super delicious with the cheese!! Korean bbq tastes best with cheese for sure.

Overall, this place is amazing for its service. Quarters is my favorite place to go for non AYCE Korean bbq. I highly recommend!"
5,"Not only is this my favorite korean bbq spot in LA. Its one of my favorite restaurants in general. The way this place is ran cannot be beat. The service is always so fast and on point and the servers are all always on point. This place also has by far the best patio set up i have been to since covid. Its all tented with plenty of fire heaters to make it super comfortable. My go to here is the beef bulgogi, the marinated beef short rib, the octopus, the jumbo shrimp, and the kimchi fried rice. They always give you amole starters to make sure you can get a good taste of everything they have to offer. Will continue to come here weekly like i always have."
