5,I love this place so much. Great and fast service. Love that they have delivery option. During the COVID times it&apos;s very important for me that all the staff is wearing masks. And gloves also. Because I&apos;m afraid of Germs. And the thing is I looooove tacos so much! And all Mexican food. Even now I&apos;m writing this and I want those tacos again   Such nice flavors and sauces. A lot of choices. My favorite is shrimp. So safety and food are on top! Thank you so much  !
5,Came on a trip to LA and had the opportunity to try this awesome gem! We had just gotten to LA and we were craving some yummy tacos. Ended up here after reading the awesome reviews. Ended up ordering over the phone for takeout and ended up picking my order and eating outside. I ended up getting the 6 taco sampler and boy it was delicious!! I really loved the chicken Tinga taco and the beef in salsa taco. I also ended up getting a quesadilla taco and it was sooo yummy! Overall the meal was delicious and I would definitely come back for more!
5,"Guisados has one item that I have never tasted at any other taco place. Their amazing quesadilla. Their quesadilla is the best one I have ever had. Their freshly made corn tortilla is a perfect vehicle for the slightly charred and caramelized chunk of cheese they use. The cheese they use tastes so fresh, creamy, and cheesy that I think I could eat 5-6 of their quesadillas easy.  The quesadilla paired with their habanero salsa tastes so amazing! They do everything in front of you so you know you&apos;re getting the freshest ingredients made with love. It is perfect for an indoor date night experience. Their horchata is also really amazing. Make sure to mix it well or all the cinnamon and sugar does fall to the bottom. Overall, I would highly recommend. Their menu is very vegan friendly which is great to see. Their mushroom taco is not the best I would opt for another vegan taco instead."
5,"What is there to say about Guisados other than .... amazing. The staff are extremely nice and are able to walk you through the menu well. I have plenty of places I go for tacos, Guisados brings me home/comfort vibes. 

Will definitely be coming back for more tacos sometime soon!"
3,"Food is delicious; however, I need to address the issue of cleanliness. The senora posted at the window who is making the tortillas by hand does NOT wear gloves!!! WTH!!???? Everyone else in the kitchen wears gloves. HELLOOOO! We are in the middle of a pandemic. Everyone who prepares food should be wearing gloves. SMH! I don&apos;t care if her hands have contact with the stove. She can use tongs to flip them over! 

**Owner/manager: Make sure senora wears gloves at all times! This is for the safety of everyone, especially customers! Do you think I want to serve COVID tacos to my family?

P.S. The size of the tacos in The Sampler has gotten smaller since I first started eating here years ago. You can practically finish one taco in two bites. Not sure what&apos;s going on here. :("
4,"Food is great, it takes you back home if you are from Mexico, the flavor is just on point, even the simplest taco the one with just beans and queso it&apos;s delicious,
You might ask why i just gave 4 stars to a great place, here it is is because the prices are crazy expensive 
But i you can go have a couple of tacos there and go get full at a food truck like i do it 
But totally recommend"
4,"I remember when Guisados first came on the scene, introducing a whole new genre of stewy tacos to the already deep bench of street tacos and tex mex in Los Angeles. Guisados makes its own corn tortillas, which form very sturdy, thick base of the taco.  I find their tacos best eaten on-site but because of the thickness of the corn tortillas, they transport reasonably well.  I&apos;m partial to their beef and pork braises and rotate between the Steak Picado, Bistek in Salsa Roja, Chuleta in Chile Verde, and Chorizo.  When I&apos;m feeling like Mole, the Chicken in Mole Poblano is a tasty few bites.  The vegetarian ones like Calabacitas and Hongos are substantial too, but I&apos;m not vegetarian.  I also gloss over most of the seafood ones as well.  The Quesadillas are tasty, but super cheesy with a thick slab of queso panela in the middle, and messy, esp with the chipotle sour cream oozing everywhere."
5,"A MUST TRY! I got the sampler &amp; switched out the mole taco for chorizo (because I&apos;m allergic to peanuts). I literally said, &quot;Fuck this is so good!&quot; after every taco. Every taco was full of flavor &amp; finger licking good!"
1,"It seems like every Guisados is different. I first tried the W. Hollywood one, which was pretty good. Then I tried the one in Echo Park and all the tacos had bell pepper, which I hate.  Finally I tried the one in my hometown of Boyle Heights. It was disgusting. I thought maybe I had bad luck and I gave it another chance, but again the tacos were just gross.  I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s the management or I just went at bad times, but there are so many other places to get tacos in BH, so I will not try a third time."
5,"I dig the OG Guisados in Boyle Heights. IF you are patient (or lucky) enough to find parking, you&apos;ll be treated to one of the gems of Boyle Heights. I don&apos;t live anywhere near here, but I love going to eat in Boyle Heights.

If handmade QUESADILLAS with fresh, CRISPY pan fried tortillas and MELTED COTIJA CHEESE is your jam, you and I just might get along. THIS is what I go to Guisados for. 

If only legendary hip hop producer J.Dilla visited Guisados, he might have named his albums after quesaDILLAs instead of donuts. Just sayin.

Back on track now... try the SHRIMP TACOS. SHREDDED BEEF TACOS. I didn&apos;t care for the vegetable tacos (compared to shrimp or beef), but I tried them, and I&apos;d be very willing to eat them again if I were there with a vegetarian friend.

The Aguas Frescas are good too. If you live in Silverlake, ride a fixed gear bike, wear Toms shoes, have a beard and tattoos, and shoot ironic photos with a film camera, then you definitely want to try the horchata w/ cold brew coffee.

Anyway, try out the OG Guisados. You can&apos;t go wrong. Make sure to leave these peeps a good tip!"
4,"This place had been on my radar for a while. I decided to take a Monday off back at the beginning of March and celebrate my birthday by taking the Dodgers Stadium tour and planned on stopping here for lunch. 
Parking- we didn&apos;t see a parking lot and couldn&apos;t find a spot on the street it was located but we found a small lot about a block away
Location- it is small and clean; the staff were friendly and efficient
Food- got the mini taco sampler with 6 mini tacos for $8.25. I noticed on Yelp pictures that the price had gone up .75 cents from the end of 2019; the tacos are definitely mini and even though there were 6 I was still hungry...overall the tacos were pretty good...not as amazing as they look in pictures and some were definitely better than others; since I was still hungry I ordered a chorizo quesadilla to share with my son and at nearly $6 I believe it was overpriced

*overall this place was good and I will go back but I was a bit underwhelmed due to maybe my high expectations that I had for this place...I will visit this place again but I won&apos;t be hurrying back...probably more of a low 4 stars (3.5 rounded up)"
5,"THE best, and that&apos;s the truth! Can&apos;t go wrong with some tacos from this place. Always hot, fresh, and ready, and this isn&apos;t event the start of it. They got some good people over here and they got one for life in me.  You can guarantee a buck from me whenever I&apos;m in the area."
3,"Been meaning to try this place for quite some time.  Happen to be in the area so I was happy to finally try this place.  There were no customers so service was quick.  Food was quite good.  Ordered the following tacos...2 chorizo breakfast, 1 mole poblano tacos, 1 chorizo  and 1 bistek taco, 2 steak picado, 1 tinga de pollo and 1 chicharron. Also ordered a melon aqua fresca. Definitely not your typical tacos as they are much more flavorful and saucier.  Loved the variety!  My Favorite was the mole ploblano. What truly mskes these tacos so good is the texture of the tortilla tgey use.  Appreciated how each taco was nicely wrapped as I had to take it to go.  The drink was very refreshing and perfect sweetness.  Why not a 5?  As you can see in the picture, they got my order wrong.   Recieved 2 bacon breakfast taco instead of chorizo.  Was so bummed as I don&apos;t really eat bacon.  The other reason was the customer service.  My initial plan was to buy donuts and had $5 in  change plus $100 bill.    The order was close to $30. The response I got when I handed her the $100 bill was an big eye roll. That was disappointing. I understand  the coin shortage for all stores so that&apos;s why I take a wallet full of coins with me if I know the purchase is relatively small.  As a matter of fact, my husband gets embarrassed but hey, it&apos;s a win win.  Store gets change, my wallet gets lighter :)  In this case, I didn&apos;t have $30 in change. I also didn&apos;t feel comfortable doing any credit card charges anywhere as the day before I had to dispute $400 in unauthorized international doordash charges on my card. Despite my experience, I would still recommend this place.  Just be sure to check your order...but it would require you to repeat your order once it is handed to you eventhough it was repeated back to you immediately before you pay."
5,The best tacos in ELA.   Always fresh.  Don&apos;t order them to go.   You have to eat them there to really enjoy the flavor warmth and enjoy the monthly art  displays.
1,"First time here and I ordered 2 chicharon tacos but the young lady taking my order seemed super annoyed as I was asking different questions. I told her it was my first time here and had heard great things about the place. She handed me a menu as she continued to look at me like I was wasting her time. I was the only person there when I was ordering. Long story short, she had such an attitude and didn&apos;t listen to me. Instead of chicharon tacos I got what I think might have been chorizo. Not what I wanted and didn&apos;t realize until I got home. I live 30 minutes away so going back wasn&apos;t an option. Dissatisfied and didn&apos;t enjoy the tacos I had. I ended up throwing them away and going to a local spot for lunch."
5,"I eat in this great restaurant many times a year! This is the best place to eat.  I go there many times. The cooking is excellent, the staff members are friendly and the charge is affordable. I enjoy being in this restaurant for a nice supper."
4,"I love the price, design, and service here. They show respect and care. Music is very nice and the quality of meat and fresh tortilla are really satisfying with reasonable price. 
One thins for me is that their seasoning is too salty for me."
5,"Guisados was the perfect way to fill a taco craving. It was my first visit here and the staff was very friendly and warm. I&apos;m that person who always asks too many questions prior to ordering (I want to like what I get alright?). They explained all the vegetarian and seafood options and recommended the sample mini taco platter to me.

I was so pleased with this option as it perfectly filled me up and allowed me to try all their vegetarian options (I&apos;ll be back for the shrimp tacos!). The veggie sampler platter comes with a beans and cheese taco, a squash taco, a mushroom taco and a quesadilla taco. All were quite yummy and complemented one another well. 

I would return here for an affordable yet delicious and low key dinner with an added bonus of friendly service!"
5,Best tacos ever. I can never decide so I always get the build your own sampler &amp; you can choose six different mini tacos. On a good day my little self can finish two in one sitting! This place is amazing and I definitely recommend stopping by any of their locations!
5,I still dream of these tacos they&apos;re the best you&apos;ll find. This location is sooo good there&apos;s an ice cream shop near by so i recommend getting both and having a great food day.
