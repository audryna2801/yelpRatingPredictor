5,"Despite getting take out the food was still super hot and delicious. The noodles were cooked perfectly nice and chewy with some bounce. 

Ordered the Porcini Mushroom with spaghetti. Creamy sauce that coats the pasta well but doesn&apos;t feel too heavy and thick. Especially loved the bread, dipped in the sauce and it was spectacular. Also ordered the Arrabbiata with pappardelle. The sauce was spicy but not too overwhelming that you couldn&apos;t enjoy your meal. 

A must eat destination in the LA area!"
5,"I recently got Pasta Sisters take out for my birthday and I am very much obsessed! It&apos;s like my fourth time here so not sure why I lagged on writing a review. Fresh, delicious, and al dente pasta- you really can&apos;t go wrong with this spot!

I&apos;ve had their bolognese, four cheese, tomato &amp; basil and also the mushroom one and all of them are delicious! You cannot miss out on the burrata either- it adds the perfect touch to any pasta. Although I wish they had garlic bread or breadsticks on the menu as well for like a side dish, they do add plain bread (looks like they add some salt and olive oil to it) to your meal for dine in or take out. 

Next time I come back, I am surely trying the pesto!"
5,"Amazing, amazing pasta, folks. I&apos;ve heard about Pasta Sisters for years! On pasta lists of LA and foodies&apos;&apos; social media alike. I first went to Pasta Sisters before the Covid shutdown so I&apos;m grateful I had the indoor experience! PS is located in a strip mall so at the time, parking was limited but seems to be more open now.

Going on a Friday night, there were more or less 8 tables to dine at plus a counter so it was cramped...but in a fun, dense, &quot;urban&quot; sort of way. I felt like the oldest patron in there as a Gen-X&apos;er - Millennials love it!! I also noticed delivery guys from all the apps in and out, one after another, take out is big here! 

You&apos;ll see on the menu, there are entrees, but PS is also a small, Italian deli so there are options if you prefer to make a meal. In house and twice since via delivery, ordered the spaghetti with the green pesto sauce, which is to die for! I also have to add don&apos;t be fooled: the amount of noodle &quot;looks&quot; small - about a handful, but is actually very filling. Not to mention the generous amount of sliced focaccia bread to make your stomach sing a carbtastic aria, you&apos;ll be full very quickly! 

Having driven by a few times since Covid, there doesn&apos;t appear to be outdoor seating - the model seems to be delivery only? If you&apos;re able, support local with some delicious pasta!"
4,"Just stopped by for a quick salad and baguette pickup for dinner. HUGE BAGUETTE FOR $3! And tasted great. The caprese salad was lovely and fresh. Wish i had gotten some more olives with this dish. 

I have tried a few pastas from here and they were also tasty."
5,"The best pasta in LA. Reasonable prices and their tiramisu!!!! To die for. 

I wish I lived closer, but I honestly drive 40 mins to get there because it&apos;s SO good. 

I can&apos;t recommend this place more. 

Literally the BEST pasta ever."
5,"The food is as good as it looks in the pictures! I was expecting it to be delicious but my expectations were exceeded! I ordered the Bolognese Taglietelle and the Taglietelle with Porcini Mushroom Sauce and both were so delicious. Even the complimentary bread that comes with the pasta was fresh and tasteful. The portions may appear to be on the smaller side but trust that they will be more satiating then the bigger portions offered at other places that may not be as high quality. 

The Chocolate Ricotta pie was also so tasty and decadent."
5,"Wow this place lives up to the hype. Such great pasta sauce and fresh noodles. Many friends have recommended Pasta Sisters as this is the best pasta place around.

Recommended: 
-Bolognese Pasta with spaghetti noodles
-Pesto alla Genovese with Fresh Pappardelle &amp; added burrata 

Ordered ahead of time and picked up. Must try!"
4,"Love this place. Faves are the mushroom sauce, lasagna, and the seafood sauce.
Ps ask for bread (soak up all the delicious sauce)
A bit disappointed that prices have increased so drastically over the past couple of years. 
I still adore the fresh pasta but with the rate of price increase, I might hesitate from getting it
Pies and tiramisu are also quite good but not mind blowing"
4,"I&apos;ve heard a lot of great things about Pasta Sisters from fellow foodies and on YouTube videos. I was so excited to try it and although it was good, it didn&apos;t live up to the high expectations.

The pasta is fresh so they deserve to be praised for that. It was cool to see them making the pasta noodles in the back as well as seeing the open kitchen of preparing the dishes. The sauces on the other hand need some work as they were lacking seasoning and flavor. The pasta with clams came in a very light sauce which highlights the fresh pasta and clams but it honestly just tasted like salty pasta water. I know that the starchy water is used in pasta sauces but I wish it had some other elements to make the dish as a whole pop. 

On the other hand, I enjoyed the Porcini Mushroom Pasta! It was much more flavorful and had the depth of flavor I was looking for. The creamy sauce was perfect and the dish was very mushroom forward which I enjoyed. Definitely a pasta you would love if you like mushrooms!

Overall, I would love to give Pasta Sisters another chance and try a more flavorful sauce. But at the moment, I won&apos;t be running back as I think the price is too high for the rather small portions. $40 for two small containers of pasta is not the move especially during the pandemic. I will hopefully come back sometime in the future!"
5,"The Pasta Sisters know pasta! The parking lot is pretty small, so be prepared to find street parking if it&apos;s full. Upon entering, walk up to the counter to place your order. They&apos;ll bring your food to your table when it&apos;s ready. There&apos;s limited seating inside of the restaurant, so large parties are not recommended.

Their menu is basically a build your own pasta style. Choose between five different pastas and nine sauce. The pasta is made fresh daily, so you know that no matter what you get, it&apos;ll be good! Also, they give you bread with olive oil and vinegar to snack on while you wait for your food.

I ordered the Tagliatelle with Salmon Cream Sauce. The sauce was rich and creamy, and I really enjoyed the organic salmon pieces! I also tried some of the Porcini Mushroom Pappardelle and the Bolognese Spaghetti. The Porcini Mushroom has a similar cream sauce to the salmon but with fresh Italian porcini mushrooms. The mushrooms, however, made it seem like a completely different dish. The Bolognese consisted of ground beef and aromatic vegetables that are slowly cooked in red wine and tomato sauce. Super savory and delicious!

Some of the pastas are served in a swirled mountain. When I first got my plate, I originally thought that it didn&apos;t look like a lot of food, but boy, was I wrong! It was really quite filling!

You really can&apos;t go wrong with any of the pasta/sauce combos here. Everything is really yummy! I need to come back on a Sunday to try their Carbonara!"
5,"Thank you so much for serving great food keep it up!!! We&apos;ll be back soon.... wish you guys serve OC soon!!! 

We couldn&apos;t wait to get home to OC so we have it in the Car!!!"
5,"Such a delicious hole in the wall spot. Their pasta is delicious and service is very friendly and helpful! 

My favorites: 
-arrabbiata 
-Bolognese 

You can also add burrata on top as well! Their bread is also very tasty!"
5,Really friendly workers who embraced me like family. The gnocchi is heavenly and the pasta really hit the spot. Great food for date night.
5,"-Ordered Takeout During COVID &amp; Dined In Before COVID-

I love Pasta Sisters for their concept. &amp; It took some time to appreciate what they&apos;re doing. 

I&apos;m not rating this place 5 stars out of the bougieness of the environment/the service as do other expensive Italian restaurants subscribe to.

What they have is great fresh pasta that&apos;s available to you at a delicious price point that keeps you coming back.

Gnnochi, what I like to call yummy potato pillows, is time consuming and hard to make if you don&apos;t have the right tools. I&apos;ve been to $$ &amp; 5 star rated Italian restaurants, waited in line next to regulars who are dressed to the nines, and have paid for 6 pieces of Gnnochi pillows... for $30. I had no idea it was 6pcs, the size of chiclet gums, and even asked the waitress if they were joking with me. 

And yes Italian noodles has this trend of expensiveness, especially fresh handmade ones, but Pasta Sister begs to differ. 

For around $10, you can have hand made pasta, delicious hand made pasta.

&amp; THEY HAVE CHOCOLATE SALAMI, if you&apos;ve watched the latest BuzzFeed Worth It, you&apos;ll get what I mean. They&apos;re so nice for sharing the recipe, but I definitely recommend it here first. 

Our go to pasta orders: 
Pesto Gnnochi
Arrabata Spaghetti (it&apos;s their more spicier sauce, love it)

How you order:
- Pick Sauce
- Pick Pasta Type
- Optional Add on

No complaints. I love how this company employs the community and is not afraid to expand their food to different neighborhoods. This is a more humble to-go type of setting versus its mother restaurant in Culver City with a huge dine-in environment.

Moreso, this location does not have a big emphasis in the dine-in atmosphere, and this is especially true even before CoVid 19. (No Dine In During Covid btw)

First it is a small space - very much set up like a deli shop. Second, the only dine in set up from what I remember were 3 very small tables max that supports a party of two. 

So what&apos;s the purpose of this layout? 

Accessibility to their wonderful food. 

Fresh pasta without the ridiculous wait (It is a popular place though so I&apos;ll never know how it&apos;ll evolve). COVID19 has disrupted so many small restaurants, but one thing is happening without dine-in options: there&apos;s a focus that shifted where it should be - the food. 

Reliable, Delicious, Value, and it hits the spot. 

Food to go was delicious as eating it there. It was ready at the exact quoted time. Everything in there was nicely packaged, I walked straight in and out and enjoyed my dinner :-) Will come back again during Covid 19 for to-go since it was that easy and safe (limit 1 person inside)."
5,"First time here and I got the bolognese with tagliatelle and it was so good!

They give a good amount too, I struggled to finish it. The don&apos;t skimp out of the meat, sauce, or noodles at all. You definitely get/get more for what you pay for. 

Every order comes with FRESH warm bread too! 
10/10 I highly recommend and would come back again!"
5,"I wanted to update my review for the quarantine edition for Pasta Sisters.  I love Pasta Sisters and have gone here numerous times.  I had a sudden craving for pasta and was in the area so I decided to order.  I have always called to pre-order, so I did the same this time.  The quoted time was shorter than normal (which was great) as the wait time can be about 30-40 minutes, but I got quoted 15-20 minutes.  I ordered my favorite (Pappadelle Bolognese) and a baguette.

Once I got there, I went in to pay.  There was no one at the restaurant, so I was able to pay easily (bonus points because there was a hand sanitizer station next to register).  I can see that they made some changes due to the pandemic.  Everyone that I saw was wearing masks and sanitizer that I mentioned.  In addition, typically the baguette is open on one end of the bag (I was actually going to ask if they could cover it), but it looks like they already took that step already and the baguette was fully covered.  The only 1 small complaint that I have is that there were no markers for social distancing.  Thankfully, the restaurant was empty when I went there, but if I came during a crowded time, I would be worried that people would stand a little close.  I came here when the restaurants first closed, so perhaps these changes are already in effect. 

Aside from that, my overall experience was pleasant and I would come here again.  As for the pasta, nothing has changed it was still delicious and the baguette was still fresh and toasty.  I bought an extra one so that I could enjoy the pasta even more a day later (still delicious!)."
5,"So good! Where to begin???
Have anything on the menu. It&apos;s all fantastic.
The pesto and bolognese are my favorite sauces. The apricot tart was to die for. Highly recommend."
5,"The porcini mushroom pappardelle is spectacular. The sauce has a very umami taste but isn&apos;t too overwhelming. SO GOOD!!! I&apos;ve also tried the eggplant parmigiana, the lasagna, and a few of the desserts which are also extremely tasty. You really can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu here!"
5,Ugh I can&apos;t even begin to tell you how much I crave pasta sisters all the time. The Arrabbiata with burrata will always have a place in my heart! It exudes flavor and the pasta is never over cooked. This time I did order it with extra sauce because I am a sauce type of gal. Delicious!
3,"Food is excellent; however, hygiene practices are deeply concerning. 

Their Tomato and Basil, Three Cheeses, and Arrabbiata are all fresh. Tomato and Basil is a little basic - extremely similar to spaghetti. Three Cheeses is recommended if you love dairy-filled, cheesy pastas. And Arrabbiata was actually a little spicier than I expected, but the spice did not ruin the flavor. As for the actual pasta noodles, the texture is a little more on the firm side for the Tagliatelle style. 

On the other hand, their hygiene practices are extremely worrisome. Pasta Sisters is usually pretty busy, especially for dinner orders. What was most concerning was I saw the cashier touch her tablet and the phone (and at times even wipe her sweat), while cutting people&apos;s bread - all with the same pair of gloves. I was so disgusted that I didn&apos;t even bother eating the bread. At times, she even took off her gloves to better touch the tablet and did not put on another pair. PLEASE WEAR AND CHANGE YOUR GLOVES.

Furthermore, the restaurant is small and does not really enact social distancing. I was in the restaurant with 7 other people at the same time, and we were definitely not 6 ft apart from each other. However, I did appreciate a worker, who I saw change his gloves to avoid cross contamination between meats. 

Pasta Sisters deserves 4.5/5 stars for their food but 2/5 stars for their hygiene. I cannot overemphasize the crucial need for restaurants to practice good hygiene practices. I&apos;d like to come back for their food, but perhaps it&apos;ll be after covid."
