5,"I&apos;ve been trying to find a good Ramen spot for months.  We tried Tatsu Ramen and were super happy with what we got!  I wanted something with chicken broth, because sometimes pork ramen can be little heavy in general.  So, I got the Cheeky Ramen, with tofu. Felt healthy, almost like a chicken noodle soup would.  We also got a Bold Ramen (pork one), it wasn&apos;t greasy or heavy, it was really good and the meat was so tender and flavorful. That one was a little spicy.  Both were tasty!  We ordered on line, it said 40 minutes but the order was ready in 30, easy and friendly pick up."
5,Thought I&apos;d give them another chance when I was in the neighborhood and ordered takeout and it was great! Very quick prep time and the ramen was delicious. Much improved over my previous review. Will definitely come back!
5,"We&apos;ve been ordering, usually at least once a month, for several years now, and finally had to say - Tatsu is AWESOME. 

Bold and Red ramen are go-to&apos;s, along with the Pork Chasu rice side. Sooo good. The noodles are the best we&apos;ve had. Perfectly cooked with just the right amount of bite. And more perfectly cooked eggs do not exist as far as we&apos;re concerned.

Occasionally slightly salty ramen, but the (pretty big!) rice side dish is such a good compliment, with a slight sweetness to the rice. Absolutely delicious. 

Of the dozens of meals we&apos;ve ordered, maybe one or two had issues, but that&apos;s because they&apos;re often so damn busy. And for good reason. 

Many thanks to all the Tatsu badasses, especially for keeping things going during Covid."
5,"My only complaint here was a super long wait, but I guess that comes with the territory when the ramen is THIS GOOD!! :)

I had the vegan option with tofu and it was worth the wait... absolutely delicious! Also pictured is the pork ramen. I would highly recommend both!

Definitely a more casual atmosphere because you walk up and order on a tablet. If you want to stay and eat, you are seated at tables open up. Lots of standing outside and waiting, but luckily you get your food pretty quickly after sitting down. I&apos;m sure it would be faster if you did to-go. :)

I&apos;ll definitely be back!!"
1,"DO NOT GO HERE UNLESS YOU PLAN TO GO HOME AND REHEAT YOUR MEAL. 
While tatsu was once my absolute favorite ramen spot and a place I would always recommend to friends, this location specifically is extremely unorganized with their ordering system during COVID. They had so many people there for Doordash, Postmates, Grubhub to pick up that it was impossible to pay for your food after placing an order. We witnessed a man get verbally upset when we first got there and later fully understood his anger when a man working for a food delivery service verbally harassed my friend and I for going to pick up our food. I have never felt so uncomfortable at an establishment in my whole life. There needs to be separate lines or at the very least call people&apos;s names if they place their order in person (like the sawtelle location). They had so many orders to the point where the man working in the front had no place to put all of the bags of food, meanwhile there was a line of 15 + people waiting to pick up their orders. That many orders should not be accepted if they don&apos;t have the space or staffing to process everyone&apos;s orders, especially for something like soup which is supposed to be eaten hot. 

The food that was once delicious tasted sub par and was (not shockingly) cold by the time we got it. Everything lacked flavor and it was nothing like the ramen I remember loving from tatsu. They were definitely giving more importance to quantity over quality and that showed in the meal we were given."
1,"Do not believe the stars and reviews!! 
The 28 hours cooked broth is deceiving. Broth was below average. Meat was hard, not tender. Egg was extremely salty. 
Disappointing experience all around."
4,"I was in a mood for ramen and found this place on Yelp.
I ordered the Soul Ramen. The broth was rich in flavor. I didn&apos;t particularly like the meats - the braised pork belly did come with skin, which be the best part. The meat was no comparison to what I always have. The soft-boiled egg was good. By the way, it was a bit spicy for me."
4,"Had ramen and pork fried rice and it was delicious! The service was good and the whole
experience was positive. Excited we found this place!"
5,"***BEST RAMEN SPOT IN TOWN***
***EXPECT A WAIT***

I&apos;ve been coming here for about 4 years. This is the most authentic ramen I&apos;ve ever had. The quality is consistent and high. 

Try the pork bun and fried rice sides. 
Old Skool Ramen is the most popular ramen option and my favorite."
5,"So good that I literally eat it in my car during my work breaks. Hands down some of the best ramen I&apos;ve ever eaten in the US, let alone LA in general.

Regardless if you&apos;re vegan, you MUST try the hippie ramen with extra corn."
5,"I haven&apos;t wrote a review in a while but Tatsu deserves its flowers! I had the soul ramen to go with a ramune and wheeeew *chefs kiss* it was PERFECT. Great taste, great noodles. Yummmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!! This made my day. Amazing. Thanks"
4,"+ COVID 19 Review

TIP:

Order online (via their personal website as yelp has marked up pricing for pickup) and pick up in person versus order in person and wait around or in your car. If you do this, QUICK food service!! It feels like immediate pick up. Else, do delivery in whatever platform you desire and wait for 30 to an hour more (Yelp ftw).

+Also offering 20% off for Pickup Tuesdays !! (Pickup Only and Tuesday Only lol)

After reading their email showcasing the safety precautions they&apos;re exercising due to COVID 19 pandemic, it was absolutely reassuring when I went to pick up and noticed all employees are all wearing masks and gloves (as req by city). Also, contactless approach of leaving your pick up on the table and you pick it up (6ft dist)

As a long time customer, their ramen is better than average, in my opinion, way better than slurpin ramen, etc. They have optional FREE topping add ons, like corn and green onions, also paid options like my favorite soft boiled egg. 

My favorite ramen to order is bold ramen (basically the boldest flavor there is for tonkotsu), cheeky ramen (delish chicken broth with saffron), hippie ramen is also delicious (VEGAN option) for fans of gingery and clear soup bases.

Pick up will include all your items with utensils, noodles and toppings separated from your soup base, receipt stapled on the side, inside a rad looking bag that has a cute origin story short manga to read while you munch on your food. 

If your broth gets cold while you pick up, definitely microwave the broth only to get a bit warmer. If you want to be super cautious, although food is safe to consume and even though they did a great job packaging, I recommend replacing packaging with your own dishes to reduce surface transferring.

Happy eating and support the small businesses around you!"
4,"Ramen was good, service wasn&apos;t. 
I don&apos;t think it&apos;s appropriate to hold a client for more then 10 mins on phone then not picking up

Update after few more ramens I ate:
Added more stars to this since even though service could be better the ramen is really good. If you want to enjoy good ramen, I&apos;d go for the chicken."
1,"Another restaurant ruined by the Pandemic. This use to be my go to Ramen spot. Now, after bad ramen after bad ramen and hoping it would get better, I was just given Ramen that inedible. I can&apos;t even believe I&apos;m typing that. The salt is through the roof, it tastes like lemon grass, uzu, and fish. I&apos;m so confused. I know times are hard, but it&apos;s so sad to see great restaurants being taken out like this."
4,The Hippie Ramen is sooooooooo good! I love the broth I got delivery this time and the bag is just too cute! Yes I&apos;m a sucker for bags
4,"Tatsu is very good ramen, however, overpriced in my opinion. You can get more bang for your buck at other shops, like Kai and Slurpin&apos; Ramen. Tatsu is extremely tasty, however, the portions are not that great, especially to-go. I think the portions should be larger for the amount each bowl costs. When I do get Tatsu, I get either the Bold Ramen or the Red Ramen. I love the ground beef in the Red Ramen. The broth is flavorful and the noodles are very good. Tatsu is definitely delicious, but you can find cheaper and just as tasty options at other ramen shops in LA."
5,"Best place to get some food when in a hurry. Their customer service is prompt, rates are affordable. And the foods are great as well. I found this place when I newly visited the city, and impressed me with that first time visit."
1,I CAN&apos;T BELIEVE YOU CANT ORDER BY PHONE. What if someone doesn&apos;t have internet access or a car or a smart phone? Guess only wealthy people can eat here. It&apos;s pretty discriminatory.
1,"Wow! AWFUL CHEEKY RAMEN! I&apos;m not sure if they had a new chef or it&apos;s been like this for a while but that ramen is doused in SALT, I&apos;m getting a headache as I&apos;m eating it. Please inform your chef to be careful with that salt!! WTF!! I wish I could get my money back on this delivery!"
1,"I ordered through Postmates and it took about an hour and a half. Not a big deal since I knew in advance according to the app that it would take that long. However, the food was definitely not worth the price and in my opinion, didn&apos;t taste very good. To be completely transparent this way only my 2nd time having &quot;gourmet/restaurant style&quot; ramen. For $17 plus tax it better be excellent not just ok! It wasn&apos;t even good. I ordered the pork bun which was flavorful but arrived leaking grease everywhere. I&apos;d never had a bun like that, the consistency wasn&apos;t for me and reminded me of undercooked dough. 
I also ordered the fried rice which was actually tasty and flavorful but I felt the portion was too small. Perhaps that&apos;s the way it is for take out? Maybe in person it&apos;s bigger, who knows. However, the primary reason for the 1 star was the ramen. The pork tasted VERY gamey!!! Eeww, gross right? And it also looked slightly undercooked and the taste was definitely unpleasant to say the least. The actual ramen noodles looked exactly like the ramen that&apos;s 5 or 10 packages for $2 or what not. It was all stuck together and a little hard in the bowl even after I poured the actual soup/liquid part in. There wasn&apos;t much vegetables even though I requested extra and the flavor was lacking. The egg was fine, but the noodles were not up to par at all, especially considering the price. 
Maybe they were having an off night? Maybe its best to order and go pick it up yourself, not sure. The food definitely wasn&apos;t hot but warm when it arrived so that&apos;s not an excuse for the noodles/ramen being terrible. The poor tasting pork was most concerning. Either way, my first ramen experience was amazing at a spot called Chibiscus on Sunset, definitely check it out, like night and day!! Stay safe and Happy Thanksgiving!"
