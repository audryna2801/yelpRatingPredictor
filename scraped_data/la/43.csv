5,"This spot has had a couple different names over the last decade. Since it became Benny&apos;s, it became perfected. A local&apos;s favorite in the Playa Del Rey/Westchester/LMU area. 

I love their rotisserie chicken. More specifically, their soup. Which comes with chunks of zucchini, carrots, cabbage and yellow squash, served with a side of Spanish rice and tortillas. For under $10. It&apos;s so good. My husband gets their quesadillas, they are huge and a little greasy but exactly what you&apos;re looking for in a quesadilla. 

Their chips are amazing, and this is one of the few restaurants that actually gives you salsa and guacamole with their chips.

Super friendly staff who make you feel as comfortable as possible. I went to pick up an order and while waiting, they said I could chill in my car which was really nice. 

If you&apos;re a fan of Horchata or Jamaica, you&apos;re in luck here. I usually call in orders to go.

Over 10-Car parking lot located right next to the restaurant, also plenty of street parking nearby."
5,"I had a bad experience here at the beginning of the pandemic (my order was incorrect when I got it home and food quality didn&apos;t seem great) and only now just got around to trying them again, and wow--am I glad I did. The rotisserie chicken tacos are AMAZING and so well-priced! We&apos;ve now picked up food there TWICE this week!"
5,Benny&apos;s is fantastic! Food and service is always consistently great. Went there to pick up food today - good practices for covid. Christian was awesome as usual and very kindly ensured I had everything I needed (extra pickled carrots!). Thank you! We will definitely try to come here more often!
5,"Haven&apos;t even tried the food and Christian has sold me with his hospitality. 

Gave us samples of the protein and I am sold, so yum! 

What a neighborhood gem."
4,"We stopped in here on the way to the airport for a quick bite to eat. I ordered the carne asada burrito, and a horchata. 

The horchata was made perfectly! Not too sweet, and the right amount of cinnamon to top it off.

My burrito had lots of flavor, and was nice sized. However, I paid an extra .50 for sour cream that I did not get."
5,"Just a stone&apos;s throw away from home, I finally got to experience the awesomeness that is Benny&apos;s!

My wife and I ordered a slew of tacos with a variety of meats.  I was most impressed with the fatty, well-seasoned carne asada, similarly robust savoriness of the achiote pork accented nicely by grilled pineapple pieces, and even the shredded rotisserie chicken (had to try it given this place&apos;s name).  The grilled fish taco was also very good for its freshness and mad flavorful, slightly spicy chipotle sauce.  The only one I might pass on next time is the barbacoa...a bit drier than preferred.

In the realm of burritos, Benny&apos;s take on the California burrito was a pretty stellar one - an absolute behemoth filled to the gills with carne asada, cheese, guac, sour cream, pico de gallo, salsa, and fries.  What stood out to me right away were the ratios of the fillings as I barely even noticed the starchiness of the fries at first.  Just a couple bites was enough to sit like rocks in my belly, so this is an excellent option if you&apos;re HONGRY.

To top everything off, the dishes came with a hefty side of fresh tortilla chips, salsa, and guac.  The huge kicker was finding a pair of cream-filled churros fried to PERFECTION!  We agreed that these were the best churros we&apos;ve had to date =D

Together with the friendly and efficient service, this was an easy 4.5 rounded way up!"
3,"Hello , 
I find it horribly irritating that for the third time in a row my food gets packaged and it is left on the order table for an extensive amount of time instead of it being given to me. 

I order online a burrito and an agua fresca. I arrive around the approximated time my order will be ready. I am asked to wait on the standing sticker and I am asked again if I&apos;m placing and order or picking up. I explained my order , the method I used to place it and my name. I am told to wait on the marker and I do, as I am waiting (2 minutes in) I see what looks to be my order, but it isn&apos;t handed to me, I assume it&apos;s someone else&apos;s order. I am then asked to wait outside and I gladly do. I wait an additional 15 minutes outside. The person waiting next to me states she has been waiting an extensive amount of time. She decides to go and check and HER ORDER HAD BEEN SITTING THERE THE WHOLE TIME. 

AFTER waiting an additional 15 minutes! 

I then proceeded to check for mine and MINE WAS SITTING THERE THE WHOLE TIME (it was the one I thought was mine) 

I AM UPSET because my agua has settled and I DIDNT GET SALSA WHICH IS ONE OF THE REASONS I BOUGHT THE BURRITO.  

I waited a total of 45 minutes from the time I placed my order until it was given to me (more like I found it).

WHY HAVE SOMEONE ASKING FOR YOUR NAME AND ORDER IF YOU HAVE TO BE THE ONE TO RETRIEVE IT?

THIS IS THE THIRD time this happens. I love the food and quality of the food but the ordering system is HIGHLY FLAWED."
5,"Love their customer service! Especially the guy with the pretty eyes taking orders. 
Plus their menu is amazing. My favs so far are the shrimp burrito, chicken burrito bowl, and the red enchiladas. Don&apos;t forget to get the Yelp discount."
5,"I&apos;ve legitimately lost track of how many times I&apos;ve come to Benny&apos;s because it&apos;s just that good! My go-to are the carne asada nachos and burrito, but I&apos;ve tried their churros and quesadillas as well and they&apos;re amazing!

When I come I typically order ahead of time - sometimes and hour or two - and I appreciate how it&apos;s always warm by the time I eat my food. The staff is always super kind and quick to attend, I&apos;ve never found myself waiting an unreasonable amount of time. 

I also appreciate that Benny&apos;s is a good bang for your buck, their portions are good and you can always expect that they&apos;re not going to underserve your order. 

Overall, Benny&apos;s is a go-to! You can guarantee that whatever you choose is going to likely be better than what you were expecting."
5,"Some of the best burritos any time of day

Id you&apos;re looking to start your day off right, make sure you stop in for a breakfast burrito. My personal favorite is the bacon breakfast burrito and if I&apos;m with my lady, we&apos;ll get a chorizo breakfast burrito and split it for the culture

Lunch time can get real with a combination of the ROTISSERIE chicken burrito and a steak burrito. These are our favorites to split and truly make the day that much better

On top of that, the salsa that comes with the burritos along with the bag of chips makes everything that much better, the rojo is great if you&apos;re feeling spicy and the green salsa makes the chicken feel that much better

 Overall, one of the best places for a burrito when you need it"
5,"We used to live walking distance from this Benny&apos;s and it was always a great treat to walk to Benny&apos;s and grab burritos. We have moved but we still order it as delivery at least once every other month. Their food is consistently tasty. We love their rotisserie chicken, grilled fish, and carnitas are my favorites.  My husband loves the carne asada. They used to do a chorizo taco that was my husband&apos;s favorite - sadly it doesn&apos;t appear to be on their menu much anymore. (If any Benny&apos;s reps are reading this - please consider bringing it back!) 
Whether you get a burrito, tostada salad or quesadilla you&apos;re going to get a meal packed with delicious flavor and super filing. Also their guacamole is very tasty - not very spicy which I love. 

The line can get crazy so I always recommend ordering before you pick up or delivery.  If you call in for delivery don&apos;t forget to have them grab you some of their pickled veggies from the salsa bar."
5,"The Al Pastor and Rotisserie Chicken tacos are so good. Flavorful and full of protein. You can tell they&apos;re made with love. Also, this place is so affordable! Where else in LA can you get 4 delicious, filling tacos -- with chips and salsa and guacamole -- for $12 and change? It&apos;s enough for two people. Amazing. Benny&apos;s is going in our regular lunch and dinner rotation."
5,"Delicious, authentic Mexican food! 

Portion sizes are very big, and the service is amazing! The employees could not be more kind.  They even added complimentary churros to our order! 

As for the food, I recommend the veggie quesadilla highly! I never order quesadillas at other Mexican restaurants, but it&apos;s a must-have here!  Be sure to use their salsas -- the hot red one is excellent!

Other favorites in my house include the chipotle chicken quesadilla, and Benny&apos;s Nachos. They don&apos;t skimp on the cheese! 

Thanks Benny&apos;s, we&apos;ll be back!"
2,"Do you know how hard it is to pick up soggy tacos? I do. I placed an order for pickup which they said it would be 15 minutes. I was there in 10. When I arrive I tell them it&apos;s a pick up for me and he says it&apos;s not ready (he doesn&apos;t check, just looks at the monitor but I trust it). 

I pay then go to their patio (which is now their waiting area). I notice quite a few minutes go by and now I&apos;m the only person waiting. I go to inside to inquire but something tells me to look at the, formerly full and now empty, table for delivery services. Like magic there it is. I asked the young lady how long it had been sitting here and to let her know no one ever called my name. She asks me my name and checks it against THE BAG I&apos;M HOLDING then says, &quot;That&apos;s it.&quot; Then turns and walks away. My mind quickly said, &quot;No $&amp;!? that&apos;s it, I&apos;m holding it.&quot;) I ask again how long it had been sitting there. (A. I&apos;m on my lunch. B. My food is just  sitting there getting cold.) Her response, as she was turning away from me AGAIN, was &quot;we just missed it&quot;. Not even a sorry, let alone trying to make it right. 

The very first thing i notice is there is no heat emanating from the bag (I&apos;m holding it by the bottom). I would usually say something but like I mentioned I was on my lunch break. So without question I&apos;m very disappointed with the service. This has NOTHING to do with COVID. This is customer service and attention to detail. Wearing a mask doesn&apos;t make a difference."
4,"Tried several of there tacos. Their rotisserie chicken, is very similar to a Chicken Verde, was very flavorful. I enjoyed the carnitas and Al Pastor were great as well. The corn tortillas on the tacos fall apart quickly when salsa or sauce is added, so eat quickly.

I also tried the Nachos which  had a cheese sauce not melted cheese. I was skeptical but the sauce was surprisingly tasty.

I be back!"
5,"Ordered takeout for lunch the other day. 
Has parking in the rear for quick pickup. 
Carne asada California burrito was . 
Solid burrito - highly recommend."
5,Super yummy and quick! The nachos and quesadillas are a must! They also gave us complimentary churros!
5,"Amazing Mexican food!!!  The green enchiladas are way beyond delicious!! I can tell this place is the best in Los Angeles to eat authentic Mexican food and have the best service from the servers, chef and the best manager of course! Thank you!"
5,"I&apos;ve been eating here since before the pandemic, but we started ordering delivery from Benny&apos;s every other week when lockdown began March 2020. We are huge fans of the burritos, especially the al pastor, rotisserie chicken, and roasted veggie. The roasted veggies are soo flavorful, and I especially like the little chunks of zucchini and yellow squash, because they are like little bursts of sweetness. The huevos rancheros and nachos are also super tasty. Benny&apos;s does nachos really well for delivery. They separate the toppings from the chips so the chips don&apos;t get soggy on the ride to your house. Then you just add all the toppings yourself at home and enjoy your crispy nachos! I also really appreciate that Benny&apos;s includes chips, salsa, and a little guacamole for free with every order. Also, sometimes they throw in a free custard-stuffed churro!"
5,"The surf and turf is impressive! 

Churros are well worth the calories, don&apos;t leave without one."
