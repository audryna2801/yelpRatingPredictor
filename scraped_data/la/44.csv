5,"I have been here a couple times many years ago and so when I learned my friends were moving near here I told them I would take them to lunch here.  I picked top my buddy one day he had off and opened his eyes to magnificent greek food right down the road from his new place! 

There is a parking lot behind the store and during busy times I think valet.  When you enter the market you are greeted with a million options of authentic greek food- packaged and fresh!  It really is a amazing selection of great stuff!  In the front, is the restaurant where you order and then goto the patio to wait for the food.  They take their Covid protocols seriously and I appreciated it. 

We ordered a ton of food, some for us to eat there, and some to take back.  We each ordered the gyro meals, and gyro sandwiches to go, also fried cheese things, octopus and some honey beer. I wasn&apos;t sure what the gyro plates consisted of before I ordered, but let me tell you they were huge, and freaking delicious!!!  You get a bunch of the meat, a salad, bunch of huge seasoned fancy potatoes, and a pita also some cucumber sauce.  I absolutely loved eating it this way and making my own wrap!  it was so good! The meat is quite possibly my favorite meat of this type that I have ever tried! Its that good! perfectly cooked and seasoned! The pita is not your average plain, dry, water drinking inducing pita bread, this one is so soft, warm, and seasoned just magically!  Put the meat on the pita with some cucumber sauce and its heaven!!  No joke I think it could be a top ten food for me of all time- for me- its that good!

You can eat outside on the patio, its covered with lots of seating spaced out nicely with lots of fresh air. The staff will bring out your order whether its to go or to eat there. Its very nicely laid out with lights, a nice covering and even a fountain.

If you like greek food... or just good food in general this place is a must!!!  There is something for everyone from vegetarian to meat eater, and its all delicious!!  There is an incredible amount of authentic greek foods to order from that you cannot find elsewhere.  Its a must try on your LA foodie list!!!

I cannot wait to go back, and obviously highly recommend this place!!!"
5,"This pandemic has spurred me to spend more time exploring LA.  Not having been to Papa Cristo&apos;s before has been my loss because I loaded up on delicious olives, cheese, yogurt, and a takeout of fish gyros.

I plan to be a regular here.

[Please be a hero: wear a face mask and practice social distancing when you&apos;re here. Protect yourself and those serving you.]"
5,"(Took Out 06/10/20 WE @ 11:30am): Christ... this papa was your Greek daddy!

In the area with a friend who was signing a new work contract, I tagged along so I could finally try Papa Cristo&apos;s, a 70+ years Los Angeles institution that has been on my &quot;must-try&quot; list for years. Outside of traveling, I haven&apos;t eaten much Greek food in L.A. mainly because I rarely saw any specific restaurants with the exception of the all-encompassing Mediterranean eateries. Would I venture back for a more authentic Greek experience without the need of my passport!?

PURCHASE
Various Beers ($3.49 x3): I bought some of the available Greek brews I&apos;d never tried before. Generally speaking, Greek beers had an average of 5% ABV, were amber in color https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=n3GpU9wznuUf-DR8dW5B4Q&amp;userid=8jVT2inwc8GIQ6sH2UG9Vw, had an obvious honey aroma and flavor mixed with a hint of malt and a pinch of vanilla https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=vlOCUP-iAr3kGWzPq0No9Q&amp;userid=8jVT2inwc8GIQ6sH2UG9Vw, a light body, clean finish, and slight malty sweet finish - nice beers to chill to with a touch more bite than a Corona https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=P-NLzEp4G4T4b9G_WrcHvg&amp;userid=8jVT2inwc8GIQ6sH2UG9Vw.

Dolmades ($9.99): Served in a 12-piece package, these were simplicity at its best with no need for any dipping or dressing sauces. I would&apos;ve been happy with this as a meal https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=RADHv8lf7iSNIFhatM_f0w&amp;userid=8jVT2inwc8GIQ6sH2UG9Vw!

Lamb Gyro ($10.99): A two-hander I swore was stuffed with an entire lamb sliced into small delectable pieces with a smattering of romaine lettuce and tomato to give it some color while wrapped in a fluffy soft pita. I loved this so much, licked my fingers and plate after I finally polished it off, and was ready for a nap https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=vzduPT5KgWGFPRUtkni8PQ&amp;userid=8jVT2inwc8GIQ6sH2UG9Vw!

Chicken Kebab Gyro ($9.99): Large seasoned succulent chunks of chicken with equally-sized tomato pieces covered in chopped romaine lettuce all wrapped in a fluffy pita, this two-hander was a beast and instantly fell apart after the first couple of bites that resulted in a &quot;salad&quot; of sorts, so keep a fork close! Regardless how you ate this, it was damn good and easily coma-inducing https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=JO4htdB6aHgV6px8CrWbSg&amp;userid=8jVT2inwc8GIQ6sH2UG9Vw!

Veggie Moussaka ($10.99): Definitely an &quot;ugly delicious&quot; dish, it was a sloppy lasagna-like meal layered and stuffed with an assortment of vegetables such as eggplant, potatoes, tomatoes, and more - I felt healthier eating this https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=ruurDB_ox6RpoeTLod0LGg&amp;userid=8jVT2inwc8GIQ6sH2UG9Vw!

Baklava Sampler ($14.99): I always loved me some baklava and all the glorious honey and chopped nuts within all layered and wrapped in flaky filo - this 10-piece sampler had no chance once we got home https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=VOXbRz1OqORy_SAK3ym74A&amp;userid=8jVT2inwc8GIQ6sH2UG9Vw!

SERVICE
Due to the mandated shutdown of all dine-in options to slow the spread of COVID-19 aka &quot;Coronavirus 2020&quot;, they allowed for transactions placed online or in-store for take out only. The dining area was closed but should be open soon as dine-in restrictions were being lifted. We waited in a short line at the &quot;Taverna Kitchen&quot; entrance before we placed our order with a kind masked woman. About fifteen minutes later, off we went with our complete order. All was easy-peasy!

PARKING (FREE)
I parked in their medium private parking lot. Otherwise, there appeared to be plenty of free street parking along the main drag of Pico Blvd. and all surrounding streets (check all posted signs).

ATMOSPHERE, DÃ‰COR, AMBIENCE
A three-section floorplan with the small dine-in restaurant on one end (closed of at this time), the full deli and tiny market https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=mHtdADliuv_oCsLw7TI1jw&amp;userid=8jVT2inwc8GIQ6sH2UG9Vw in the middle, and the Taverna Kitchen on the other end https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=cyF3FzT3R9qwuvJDpgbVKw&amp;userid=8jVT2inwc8GIQ6sH2UG9Vw, everything was quaint to say the least with no frills and just a straightforward &quot;come-in-and-leave&quot; mentality. A decent amount of natural lighting came through the front glass door and windows while soul-sucking fluorescent lighting filled in the rest. I didn&apos;t noticed any TVs or background music.

ATTIRE
Totally casual, so I would normally be in a t-shirt, boardshorts, and flip-flops.

OVERALL
Papa Cristo&apos;s was an L.A. treasure that I was ashamed to have taken so long to find! The portions were large, the prices were affordable, the service was efficient, and seemed that they had all basic Greek food needs. I found total value based on the prices, service, and experience noted above (TOTAL paid experience was around $75.00 BEFORE any discounts and/or tip). And, they accepted my credit card of choice... AMEX! 5.0 STARS"
5,"So let&apos;s just start off by saying I&apos;m dating a Greek. Technically a halfie but a Greek none-the-less. 

I&apos;ve been trying to find a place that we can go that has snacks and other foods that he can reminisce on. He was close to his Greek father that has sadly passed so I&apos;ve been searching far and wide for a place like this. 

Unfortunately I wasn&apos;t the one to find the place but wow am I pleasantly surprised I didn&apos;t! Between the people, the variety and the hot food they serve you really can&apos;t go wrong.

I ordered some gyros and a huge thing of potatoes. They also have this amazing spaghetti with burnt butter! Like what? 

Highly highly highly recommend going."
5,"This was my fist time I went to Papa Cristo&apos;s and it won&apos;t be the last one. I don&apos;t understand how come I didn&apos;t find out about this place years ago  when I was studying at USC! I definitely need to make up for all this time I&apos;ve missed out l.
I came on a Sunday afternoon after 3:00, almost closing time. The valet person was a bit unfriendly.
I had the the falafel plate which was delicious, I think it&apos;s  the best one  I&apos;ve had for ages. The falafel were done perfectly, not over cooked so you can actually enjoy the flavor and  chew it without being afraid of getting your teeth chipped. The pita bread was so good that I devoured it all.
For the table I ordered the sizzling feta and tomato, it was good but the feta was a little strong for my taste so I ate the tomatoes.
I enjoyed seeing the lamb chops plate. I was told, it was juicy, soft and meaty. The beI don&apos;t eat meat but I was tempted to break the rules.
I wanted to try some desserts but they told us it was closing time so no more food could be served.
Street parking is hard so just use valet."
1,"Dear Yelp,

Can you please check to see what is going on with this place? We tried using the Yelp Checkin today and they wouldn&apos;t not let us.  The manager even came up to us and told us it could not be used but that this offer was &quot;only valid thru GrubHub&quot;.  

Why is it on Yelp Check In if it&apos;s only available through Grub Hub?"
4,"Heard of Papa Cristo&apos;s so much over the years and had the chance to visit and get to gyros to go. At first, the size was a bit questionable, lookin&apos; a bit small but that went out the window when I  unraveled the gyro and saw how much meat and vegetables they were able to cram into the container. I believe it was around $9-$10 for one gyro but the amount of food you get is worth the price. They are also very covid-compliant, offering sanitizer and requesting customers to not enter certain areas of the store to keep things safe for the employees. Would definitely visit again in the future if I&apos;m craving gyros."
4,I&apos;m increasing the grade to four stars because their spanakopita pizza and shrimp pizza is so incredibly good. Highly recommend.
3,"You know that feeling when you just want a gyro? And not a generic chain restaurant gyro *ahem, Arby&apos;s* but something that actually contains real meat and doesn&apos;t make you feel like dying afterwards? 

I&apos;m new to the area and happened to see Papa Cristo&apos;s come up on my Yelp search for gyro. They&apos;re family-owned and, &quot;Take great pride in providing our patrons with the highest quality and best tasting Greek home-style cuisine.&quot; How can they not be legit when you can order a WHOLE ROASTED LAMB from their catering website?! 

Anyways, you can order for pick-up through their website, which I did. You can also order through Door Dash (and possibly other delivery options but it might cost more even if you&apos;re ordering for pickup). I went directly through the Papa Cristo website, paid online, and was given a pick-up time.

When you arrive to the restaurant and park in the lot, there is signage at the main entrance telling you to pick up any to-go orders at the side entrance. I know people don&apos;t like to read signs but I&apos;m telling you here what you&apos;re supposed to do. So be better and don&apos;t wander around the property spreading germs and just listen. You ring the bell at the side entrance and they will bring you your order, packed and ready to go. No need to step inside the restaurant at all.

Even though I&apos;m talking about &quot;homestyle&quot; Greek cuisine, I&apos;m also a basic b!tch sometimes and I just want a gyro plate!!! LOL. My plate came with a HEARTY portion of beef/lamb gyro, one hot pita bread, tzatziki sauce, Greek salad and roasted potatoes. It felt like it was enough to feed a small family but I still had to order a side of rice (I can&apos;t help it, I&apos;m Asian!) and hummus (to dip my pita in!). When all is said and done, I enjoyed my gyro plate but I don&apos;t think I&apos;d go out of my way to eat here. I also know I&apos;m being unfair as Papa Cristo&apos;s is actually known for their lamb dishes which I will definitely return to sample more of the menu  offerings. Stay tuned!"
5,"The food is always great here. My wife is Greek, we are from Europe, so we enjoy great food like any individual who grew up in some part of the world, where food is part of our traditions. 

So if you like Greek food, papa Cristo&apos;s is a great spot to enjoy food with family and friends."
5,"I ordered take out (given the pandemic all im doing us ordering online ) and I wasn&apos;t disappointed at all. On the contrary everything was sooooo delicious and customer service was GREAT! They forgot my potatoes so they came back and delivered it. 

I ordered 2 chicken kabob plates and extra pita and sauce. But the extra pita was too much. I thought it wouldn&apos;t be enough but the two plates were plenty ! 

Def order take out from them! Fresh not soggy!"
5,"Lunch delivery from this location, really good chicken kabob wrap. Chicken was fresh and had good flavor. Lettuce and toppings were good. Pita was soft and fluffy. Really good ide have it again ."
5,"I have a problem with those delicious Lamb Chops. They pop up in dreams, Day dreams, random thoughts.. oh my.. you must try!! The folks there are very nice and always get my complicated order right! I hope this treat of a restaurant never changes!!"
5,"This review is 3 years over due!!! I came to Papa Cristo&apos;s in May 2017 for a pre masters graduation celebration with my Masters of Social Work cohort, while I was a graduate student at UCLA. A good friend of mine put together this event as this place is friendly for her diet she is on.
 
She provided roses for everyone not the restaurant. Upon entering there is limited parking in the parking lot but I was lucky enough to find parking in the lot before the rush came. There is also street parking as well. There are two ways to enter which are the front and back. I entered through the back which you have to walk through their Greek store and deli to get to the restaurant and seating portion. By the time the whole party arrived it was PACKED inside.

You have to order at the counter and Grey give you a card to place on your table so they can deliver your food to your table. Since I already ate prior to coming, so I was not really hungry so I got the house made Greek Honey yogurt. It was really delicious yummy treat.

After everyone ate we all took a picture with Papa Cristo! He comes out and mingles with the crowd. I seriously love his personality and unique look! He is so sweet too! Which was really fun! I didn&apos;t try any of the food items but it smelled delicious and everyone appeared happy with their meals!

Highly recommend. Check out the authentic deli, bakery and food! You won&apos;t be disappointed at all!"
5,"Of all the various Mediterranean spots in the Downtown LA area but I think Papa Cristo&apos;s takes the crown for the best! It&apos;s funny, I actually had never heard of Papa Cristo&apos;s even though apparently it was frequented by USC students while I was there. I happened to notice a delivery driver at my building with a Papa Cristo&apos;s bag and looked it up on Yelp and decided to try some takeout. 

The restaurant itself reminded me of the Mediterranean version of an Italian deli, they have a deli counter with various cold cuts and cheese, coolers full of hummus, and hot spanakopita and other pastries. 

In the back, they make the hot food to order, and it&apos;s delicious! We tried the beef kefta kabob wrap and the chicken gyro wrap. Both were quite tasty, they have small patties they fry up on the grill. The chicken gyro was my personal favorite, the seasoning is perfect and has great flavor!"
4,"My husband and I wanted to try something new and we randomly stumbled in to Papa Cristo&apos;s. We came in at 10 am and were happy to see they were opened. Here is what we ordered:

2 gyros sandwiches only 
Hummus (came with 3 pita breads)
Small Greek salad 
2 baklava

Our total- $50 

The gyros were good! Loaded with A LOT of meat. We are not big meat eaters so we set aside half the meat to make a second gyro for later. The hummus is more on the watery side but still good. The Greek salad is a pretty basic dish and it was also good. Now the baklava was a bit of a miss. I&apos;ve tried baklava at various (at least a dozen) restaurants and this one comes dead last. 

Anyway, we were forced to eat our food inside of our car because when we asked if we could sit outside they told us the area is not open until 11 am. So that was a real bummer. Overall it was a pleasant experience, a cute little charming place but don&apos;t think we would be back simply because it is our of our way and because we would rather explore other Greek restaurants."
5,"I want to write a long review for my boy Cristo, but I&apos;m going to get straight to the point. Incredible greek food, incredible vibes, reasonable pricing, great assortment. What more do you need in life? idk theres nothing"
5,"Always a great experience!  Love the food and staff.  During these days of COVID-19, lunch on the parking lot patio transports me back to Greece!  And say hello to Chris upstairs in his office as you come in from the parking lot..."
4,"Opa!

Papa Cristo&apos;s is a famous old school Greek market/restaurant in Los Angeles. 

They have big back parking lot, free. Small market inside. Deli Counter. The kitchen is connected to the market, this is were you order your food. Self seating on the other side of the market way. Large area, ton of seats and tables.

Staff are friendly. Service was great. Food comes out fast.

Papa Cristo walks around the restaurant and still works the kitchen and counter! Super nice and friendly as well. Greeted everyone eating and took pictures. You will not miss him (or you might cause he is a little short)!

Do not miss out on the free olives and peppers in the kitchen. Olives were super salty alone but worked well with the gyro. Peppers were super spicy but good. They also have a bunch of random free samples all around. Keep your eye out!

Lamb Gyro - $10.99 - Tender flavorful meat blend. You cannot taste any gamey lamb flavor. Such a good mix. The gyro is huge! Amazing portion size for the price."
3,"Expensive for the portion size give.  Raffi&apos;s Place is Persian and expensive (PC is Greek food), but they give a fair portion size. I&apos;ve heard of PC for years and never really came in. I like to go to Glendale when I want some Greek food. $21 for a whole ton of potatoes, 2 lamb skewers and a salad is kind of steep.

I ordered the lamb kebab entree and was disappointed and shocked. I mean two skewers of lamb is normal. It tasted nice, was a bit tough to chew. The potatoes were ok. They remind me of the potatoes at army base dining facilities. So nothing to rave about. You eat them when you&apos;re hungry and they work.

Papa Cristo is one of those Angeleno spots. Some love it, some pass. I pass."
