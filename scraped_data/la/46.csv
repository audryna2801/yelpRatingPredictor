5,"I saw the longest line ever for Donut Friend at a food festival once.... I chose not to wait. I really missed out! I got delivery with postmates TWICE because the donuts are so amazing. 

I started with the FUDGEGAZI. The flavors were so perfectly chocolatey. The chocolate cream inside was light and fluffy. I ordered this again the second time. 

The best and most surprising thing I&apos;ve had of all is the COMPASSION FRUIT DONUT. The flavor is bold and bright! Sweet but tangy and the passion fruit is such an unexpected flavor. To top it off some of the proceeds go to charity. 

The CUSTARD FRONT DRIVE was amazing. Love a good cream filled donut and this did not disappoint. 

The LAVENDER ARMS was surprisingly powerful. The lavender came through so well! There was a slight bitterness from the frosting or pieces of lavender itself. 

Can&apos;t believe these are vegan. I am OBSESSED. I will definitely be back. Looooooove it!!!"
5,"Thursday night &quot;Vegan Adventures &quot; I mentioned in another review of mine that a friend and I go on these adventures to find all the best vegan spots in the LA area. We had a sweet tooth and thought why not get donuts. This was not a disappointment! Every donut was amazing and taste really fresh. Let me say you would never know that there was no dairy in these donuts. So soft and really amazing flavors! The staff was amazing and friendly, and they were pretty safe with the social distancing. I would totally recommend this lovely place. They have an ice cream sandwich that I must try next time!"
5,"I love Donut Friend! The employees were wearing masks and super friendly, they are efficient with getting people thru the door and had contactless payment. The strawberry lab donut was our favorite, the cream inside it was light and fluffy and just the right amount of sweet with the rest of the donut. The say everything donut and custard front drive were equally amazing. The custard inside the donut and chocolate outside was very sweet but i couldn&apos;t stop myself from every last bite. Lastly the brûlée one was good but wasn&apos;t exactly what i expected although the cream on the inside was still delicious. Can&apos;t wait to go back!"
4,"A day off work I decided to go to a donut shop recommended to me from another musician friend. It was in my &quot;hood&quot; and I never knew it was there. This was a good opp to finally go. I walk in and immediately was greeted. There were so many choices with great names I needed a minute. The prices were surprising but I figured I&apos;m eating a healthier option than your regular mom n pop donut shop at the corner. And we all know most of us can&apos;t shop at Whole Foods all the time.
Now as a consumer I&apos;m like &quot;nah i cant make this a regular thing&quot; but as a human I can somehow see how a $3 donut is reasonable. Community involvement, donations, celebrity owned/driven plus vegan. Plus the rent in LA, especially for a business on York; I can only imagine the financial issues while in COVID (go their website, sh*t is real).
I will say this tho, the high price will make someone (ME) not want to buy more than 2 or 4 donuts. I mean I bought 4 and it cost me 15 (plus tip). But it will make me NOT want to come thru again unless I&apos;m with friends who&apos;ve never tried them and/or a very special occasion like today. Imagine if regular donuts cost this much. We would probably eat less. No one would buy a dozen Krispy Kreme donuts. Probably be a lil more healthier too. and even tho you are paying for a vegan product we all know to eat healthier cost more. Donuts aren&apos;t exempt.
So overall these were good, I cant front. I got the OLD FASHIONED MAPLE, CUSTARD FRONT DRIVE, JAVA BREAKER and GIVE UP THE TOAST. They all were good and they have so many others worth trying. I would mos def recommend everyone to try these and support. Its another celeb owned business within the community that donates, helps the homeless and supports local schools. They are promoting a healthy alternative to all of us who love donuts. Yes its pricey but some of ya&apos;ll spend on lulu lemon hoodies and Teslas, you can do it. And for the rest of us; support a good business or use it to spoil yourself once a month."
4,"I love my sweets, especially donuts! With the many donut options in Los Angeles, they are definitely on my list. I will still choose Sidecar as my absolute favorite donut spot, but this establishment serves up some decent donuts for a great price.

COVID Precautions: They would let 2 parties come in; one party would order and the other party was in the payment station. I felt secure and safe when I was inside. They had access to hand sanitizer at all times.

Ambiance: Modern and hip inside. 

Food: I went on a Wednesday night, and granted I went 15 minutes before close, they still had an assortment of donuts readily available.  Next time, I would definitely get there earlier to sample other options but I was able to order a few options. All were good and surprisingly still fresh.

Parking: Street parking out here sucks. Be prepared to take some time finding a spot nearby.

If you are around the area, and looking for a solid option for dessert, they are worth stopping in!"
5,"Just when I start thinking Joyce Manor sucks, I listen to the first record again and remember how incredibly genius it was. I mean, can you seriously listen to either &quot;Constant Nothing&quot; or &quot;Constant Headache&quot; and not feel euphoric? New York&apos;s got Vampire Weekend, but in LA we have Joyce Manor. Just like LA is a lot lot less pretentious and a ton more fun, so is Joyce Manor.

But why, you may be asking, am I writing about Joyce Manor in a review about Donut Friend? Well that&apos;s because there used to be a signature donut here dedicated to the band. It was called Joyce Lavender. Sadly though, they have re-named this donut Lavender Arms. I mean, I love Lawrence Arms probably more than the average Donut Friend patron, but come on guys, they are from Chicago! We deserve to have a donut dedicated to our local hometown punks. I guarantee if you go back and listen to those first few records again, then you will no doubt bring the name back to its original place...where it rightfully belongs. If not, that&apos;s okay. I&apos;ll still enjoy the donut, whatever you want to call it :)"
3,"COVID TAKE OUT 
-social distance 6ft stickers on the floor 
- staff wore masks properly 
-gloves worn 
-credit card only 
-hand sanitizer provided 
-plexi glass in place 

.:: Donuts ::.
Total for 4 donuts: ~$15.50
Strawberry lab: whipped cream and fresh strawberries inside a raised powdered sugar donut. Probably my favorite one, with the right amount of whipped cream. 
Fudgegazi: chocolate cream inside raised donut topped with chocolate and chocolate shavings. The glaze was dark chocolate, wasn&apos;t too much of a fan of this one. 
Nutellavision: chocolate hazelnut spread and olive oil inside a raised donut topped with a dash of sea salt. Interesting taste but it&apos;s also not my favorite, I can&apos;t quite put my finger on it but everything didnt mesh well for me. 
Custard Front Drive: rich bavarian chocolate glaze on raised donut topped with chocolate glaze. Also not a big fan of the chocolate glaze but the custard was good. 

Kinda bummed they&apos;re currently not doing the DIY donuts because I came solely for the pretty donuts seen on their website and INSTA. And they don&apos;t mention anything about that on their yelp. I would not have lined up that long for regular donuts. 

.:: Service / Ambiance / Parking ::.
The cashier was pretty nice. She got what I wanted and explained how they&apos;re no longer doing DIY donuts.

The place is pretty small, glass display boxes for donuts. Can&apos;t note much as it was an in and out transaction due to COVID. 

Parking was not bad, found free parking around the corner"
5,"Place your order to go and beat the long lines! 

VEGAN DONUTS ! What what ! Everything on the menu is vegan ... don&apos;t worry , I did the research for you already 

Yummy in my tummy. Was definitely worth the drive. 

The maple bacon one was so good. How the heck do they make coconut taste like bacon ? 

Donut holes were on point. 

The sprinkle cake one was my favorite. 

Check them out. You&apos;ll see it because there&apos;s a line in front lol. But my pro tip is to save time and place your order ahead !"
5,Great job with the special order letter donuts!! Very helpful and courteous staff. I loved the fact that you can pick from a variety of their flavors. The donuts were a hit. Thank you Donut Friend.
5,"VEGAN? DONUTS? THAT TASTE AMAZING???
I&apos;m not personally vegan, but if I knew how to make vegan food taste this good all the time, I might try it out! This place is located on a busy corner of the street but there&apos;s plenty of street parking in the nearby roads. During COVID I always see a huge line of people! If I have a bigger order (at least a dozen) I usually order ahead and just pick it up in store (no waiting in line!) 

My favorite donuts are:
ANGRY SAMOA
- this one tastes the sweetest, so if you&apos;re ready for a lot of sugar try this one out!
- it has nice coconut shavings and the base is covered in chocolate 

COMPASSIONFRUIT 
- I like ordering this one to balance out the sweetness of the other donuts 
- it&apos;s still sweet but is also a little tart which I love! 

MATCHA 
- I love all things matcha and this is no exception 
- this is also one that is less sweet so I like to put it in the mix when ordering a bunch of donuts 

SMORES
- it has marshmallow both on the inside AND ON TOP?! Genius.
- this one tastes better than what you think it tastes like, it&apos;s a low key winner 

Overall, I love coming here and getting these donuts as gifts for friends, for potlucks, etc. it&apos;s always a crowd pleaser!"
5,"TLDR: I didn&apos;t know vegan donuts could be so good and these donuts are some of the best I&apos;ve ever had. I&apos;m drooling just thinking about them 

I&apos;ve been wanting to try donut friend for a long long time and I finally got to try it a couple weeks ago. Donut Friend creates completely vegan donuts and they&apos;re better than any normal donut I&apos;ve ever tried. My favorite flavors are the creme brûlée, give up the toast, X-ray speculoos and the strawberry lab. I mean I love ALL of them but those would have to be the top choice for my palette. 

I highly recommend getting anything and getting here early because this place is popular and it is busy! The girl who helped us out was super nice and more than willing to answer any questions regarding the flavors - she also gave lots of great recommendations because we were so overwhelmed by all the options. 

Tip: come here if you have a major sweet tooth because they serve ice cream too!

5,"BEST VEGAN DONUTS EVER!!
Before going Vegan, I had only ever had Sidecar donuts in Newport Beach but they only ever carry 1 vegan donut which is typically gluten free too. (I&apos;m just vegan not GF) 
Have been here twice and love the strawberries and cream donut the most.
The Nutella one is great and the Nutella is in-house made. It has a bit of Olive Oil but don&apos;t let that scare you away. Adds a really nice balance to the whole donut.

The guava donut is very sweet and the matcha one is perfect sweet and bitter. 
I recommend ordering online and heading straight to the front door."
5,"Hands down, the  best donuts I&apos;ve ever had so far. It&apos;s amazing and full of flavours. Soo good!"
5,"If you&apos;re looking at Yelp trying to decide if this VEGAN donut place is for YOU, I&apos;m here to tell you YES. Yes it is. It is for everyone. If I didn&apos;t tell you it was Vegan, you would have never even known the difference. 

Do you like moist donuts? Donuts with clever names and flavor profiles? Regular donuts, cream filled donuts, cake donuts, cream between layers donuts, ice-cream donuts.. you get my point. Don&apos;t hesitate, just go in and try one that sounds good to you. You won&apos;t be disappointed."
5,"Definitely some of the best vegan donuts I&apos;ve had! The only issue is there are too many choices lol. We tried 3 today: Fudgegazi, Strawberrylab, and The Jelly Sound. They were all delicious!! The Fudgegazi was probably my favorite out of the three but they were all really good."
5,"This is my favorite donut place in LA--I&apos;ve been going hard on their donuts for at least six years. I love that they&apos;re entirely vegan and their flavor and name combos are so creative. I&apos;m a cake donut lady myself and their simple chocolate cake donut (paired with a cup of coffee) is seriously magical. We always get the Polar Berry Club as well and then whatever else looks good. These donuts are priced a little higher than a lot of shops in LA, but they&apos;re wonderful and worth it. 

I hadn&apos;t taken a trip to Donut Friend since COVID hit and finally did recently. I ordered ahead via Grubhub on Yelp, but to be honest next time I&apos;d just wait in line. The menu wasn&apos;t terribly up to date on Grubhub and unless you want to explain to everyone in the line why you&apos;re cutting, you can&apos;t really skip the line (even if you ordered ahead). They also cancelled one of my donuts via the Grubhub order but when I arrived they had a fresh batch, so they re-added it and I paid for it onsite. The staff was really cool and friendly and is doing a great job of only letting one person/pair in at a time."
5,"10/10. Donuts are not my first choice dessert but these were so amazing, I would 100% come back!! I am also not vegan but definitely worth noting that these donuts are vegan! Also, 10% off if you order a dozen!

There are so many flavors and pretty much every donut I tried was so good. My absolute favorite was the Husker Blu (blueberry donut), least favorite was polar berry (it was still good though haha). The Nutella and cookie butter donuts were super dense and rich. The s&apos;mores donut tastes more like a cake than a donut, but still tasty! I really wanted to try the matcha donut, however they sold out by the time I got there. I got there 2 hours after opening and it was already gone :( 

I would get all these donuts again but def need to try all the other flavors! I&apos;m so happy I tried Donut Friend!"
5,"We&apos;ve been coming here for years and love the donuts. Since donuts are getting me thru the day we try to get our daily fix if the line is not too long. Despite all the donuts being good, I still prefer the promise ring in vanilla. Less is more."
5,"Well, I have lived in this neighborhood for 3 months now and JUST made it here. To a vegan donut place, for me, a vegan! I guess tbh I am super careful with COVID so I have tried not to go inside any places at all, but this place has the correct policies in place. 
The occasion was doing an interview for a podcast with one of my best vegan friends, so even though we were Zooming the interview, I thought it was absolutely necessary to finally get some vegan donuts! 
I got there right at 10 am when they opened, and there was a small line of about 4 people in front of me, spaced well on the sidewalk. Everyone was respectful of the rules. You wait til they wave you in, only one party at the ordering area at a time, and one party at the payment area. 
Glad I was there early, so I got the pick of the pick since I hear they do run out of some throughout the day. 
I am not sure why I got 4 ... I just have one person to share them with and I have not eaten anything this sweet in ages, but I guess I will have to figure it out ;) I got the bacon one (Bacon 182!), &quot;plain&quot; chocolate (&quot;purity ring,&quot; lol), and &quot;plain&quot; sprinkles, as well as a Jelly donut (Sufjan Stevens themed name I can&apos;t remember) - I don&apos;t think I have had a jelly donut in at least a decade! 
Donuts were top-notch, COVID care was perfectly cautious, and I am so excited to make my best vegan friend jealous even through Zoom. I don&apos;t have a huge sweet tooth, but when I do, I will be back :) It is just a quick place to get in and get out kinda place so get in and take home some lovely treats for your housemates!"
4,"I love that they offer a variety of unique flavors. They always have long lines but they go by pretty quick. I&apos;m not a fan of vegan desserts, but these donuts - OMG and just as good as  regular donuts and maybe even better. The staff was really friendly and didn&apos;t feel rushed as we stared at all the amazing options they have lol the polar berry (cute name lol) is probably my favorite one. Their donuts aren&apos;t too sweet, but pack just enough sweetness. Go check them out :)"
