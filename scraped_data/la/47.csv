5,"More like YUMMYYUMMY! 
I had the matcha ice cream with oreo and fresh matcha crumbles and a nutella lined fish waffle cone. 
Because of the pandemic, they are only serving in cups but will give you the cone on top. 

Parking in the attached structure. A great dessert to follow some KBBQ!"
5,"I stopped into SomiSomi on a complete whim after walking by while waiting for my pho order to be prepared nearby. I noticed that their special that day was a matcha and ores swirl, so I just couldn&apos;t pass up two of my favorite flavors!! 

The dish of ice cream did NOT disappoint. It was so creamy and the flavor combination was perfect! With your dish, you also get to choose between a macaroon cookie or strawberry which is a fun touch! You also get the toppings so I stuck with Oreo and matcha to fully commit to my flavor combo!! I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a sweet treat! I would definitely try their fish cone when I save more room for dessert, too!!"
5,"Great ice cream + Tasty cone = Can&apos;t go wrong! Whenever I come to H Mart to do shopping, I have to make a stop at Somi Somi. It is located in the shopping plaza on the second level. The shop is small, but there are a few tables outside. When you&apos;re inside you pick your cone filling (nutella, custard, red bean, taro) and then your ice cream flavor(s). Each day is a little different, but they usually have some variations of Ube, Taro, Matcha, and Oreo flavors. Depending on the day, you can get certain flavors swirled together. personally I love the Ube and Matcha!

The cone they put everything in is made fresh right in front of you with a waffle like substance. They smell so good! Once they everything in the cone you can also top your order off with toppings like sprinkles, matcha powder, or cereal. 

Note that these cones are pretty big and they really fill them with ice cream! They are definitely big enough to share and I would highly suggest getting a cup too because they tend to drip all over the place. 

Right now during Covid, they also have an ipad in front of the register so you can do contactless ordering. They can also validate your parking for you if you park in the building structure."
5,"I&apos;m obsessed with the creamy ice cream and delicious bread cone.  The best combination dessert.  My favorite combo is sesame ice cream with nutella inside the fish shaped bread with strawberries on top.  My daughter&apos;s favorite combo is sesame or milk ice cream in a cup with the fish bread on top (since she can&apos;t eat it as fast).

Whenever we come to Madang Plaza for Lemon Tree, H Mart or Daiso~ we always make a pitstop at SomiSomi for a delicious treat.

The line may look super long sometimes but it moves really fast.  I totally recommend this spot for anyone who wants a unique/photo worthy dessert or is looking for a to-go treat!"
5,"Always a treat! The Korean soft serve ice cream is always smooth and delicious, topped with as many toppings as you like. The Ah-Boong, the fish shaped waffle, is filled with a delicious filling. I picked the custard which is absolutely delicious! You can even order just the Ah-Boong on its own as your dessert! There are normally 6 flavors of soft serve to choose from and 2 separate mixed soft serve flavors. We live in the Valley and it&apos;s totally worth the drive to K-Town! Somi Somi is sooooooooooooo good!"
2,"Went to this much awaited ice cream place . Ordered the Taiyaki filled with Nutella &amp; Ube soft serve. The guy making it was just rude. I do not know if this is how its supposed to be, their Nutella was filled in scraps. The Ube soft serve was yummy. I have been really looking forward to this place."
5,"I love taiyaki ice cream and this place offers the best of both world! I absolutely enjoyed the ice cream here. I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s because of covid but they are only doing the upside down taiyaki. 

I ordered the ube ice cream with taro filling taiyaki and it was the perfect combo, not just because they are both purple. The taiyaki was so soft and a little crispy which made it so yummy. I highly recommend this flavor! Both the taiyaki and the ice cream felt really light and not too sweet which was perfect for taste. 

One down side that I can think of is that it may be hard to enjoy this ice cream during Covid time because there are limited seatings outside. Once these seats are filled up, you may have to find a different spot to eat the ice cream. If it weren&apos;t for Covid , it would be easier for people to just walk around the plaza and enjoy their ice cream. 

Overall, I would definitely return to try out other flavors next time!"
5,Favorite ice cream shop. The waffle cone (and the Nutella I stuff it with) make all the difference.
5,"SomiSomi is a growing West Coast chain that serves soft-serve ice cream with a Korean-American twist. This location is on the second level of the Madang outdoor shopping center, tucked away along Western just north of Wilshire. 

When I stopped by, there were four flavors available either individually or in two pre-determined swirled pairs. I chose the ube-matcha swirl alongside a taro-stuffed taiyaki (or ah-boong). The ice cream had the uniform consistency you&apos;d expect of soft serve, but was also surprisingly dense, creamy, and rich. The taiyaki was prepared to a nice, delicate crisp, and the presence of taro offered an extra, warm, savory note to complement the entire equation. 

You enter your order at a tablet, which makes service fast, efficient, and error-free, and then you can customize things further with your choice of toppings. Thanks Yelpers for another great find!"
5,"I go to somisomi every week.
It&apos;s simply the best dessert place ever. They have lactose free ice cream! For all of us asian who don&apos;t do well with milk.

My favorite is the upside down ah-boong with the custard filling!"
4,"Smallest location I&apos;ve been too with not a lot of soft serve flavor options. 

Satisfied the craving for something sweet and cold. 

Staff members super nice and helpful. 

Social distancing enforced and practiced safely amongst the patrons that were there the same time we were. 

The parking structure provides you a ticket that needs to be validated, they ask right before they ask your name for your order. 

Overall, I love SomiSomi, always a returning customer."
5,"I stop by here any time I&apos;m in LA. I always get the green tea ice cream with red bean filling in the pastry, topped with fruity pebbles!"
5,"Great softserve Korean Ice Cream.  I was jonesing for Matcha softserve, and this place hit the spot. I had a Matcha/Milk softserve twist in the &quot;fish&quot; cone with red beans and custard. This is something pretty unique and specific to Korean soft serve it seems.  Its in K-town near the Wiltern so parking isnt so easy. You can grab a street one near the plaza its in , but make a mad dash since you wont have much time .  I think there are other locations, but I wouldnt take a chance with the Glendale Mall since its indoors.  There are other places, a few in Little Tokyo that carry great matcha softserve too, but not with the cone and custard."
5,"Lactose free soft serve?! Yes, please! 

SomiSomi has got it all going on. The deliciousness. The creaminess. The crunchiness. The photogenicness. Is that a word? Maybe not. Anyways, it&apos;s perfection. The buds and I may have even gone twice in one day...it was that good. Just sayin. 

Wish they had one in SF. But whenever I&apos;m in town, this is a definite go-to. Don&apos;t get me wrong, there&apos;s always a line. But the staff work pretty efficiently and effectively to take the orders and churn them out. They&apos;ve got a system going on in all that madness! 

5 stars."
5,"Sooo delicious! I always get the Nutella filling and milk flavored soft serve and my husband gets custard filling with a different soft serve flavor each time. Last time he got ube and matcha swirl. Always interesting and always good. The smaller locations seem to have shorter lines but even if you have a long wait, it&apos;s worth it. Toppings are included at no extra charge."
5,"Just came by this location yesterday and it did not disappoint. You out your order into the self serve kiosk and toppings are free. Once paid the person manning the front gets your order to perfection. I got the milk and matcha swirl with captain crunch, sprinkles and a macaron. Totally worth the stop if you&apos;re feeling like something delicious and Cole. Soft serve comes out extra cold and delicious. I will definitely be coming back."
4,"In town for business and I knew I HAD to return to SomiSomi. When I visited last year, I had it the next day because it was that good. Last year I got the milk ice cream with custard filled takoyaki. This year, I got the same filling but with oreo ice cream instead. I was honestly expecting the ice cream to be textured, since most oreo ice creams have the cookies incorporated. However, this was really smooth, but it was a good kind of smooth. Like as if you weren&apos;t eating ice cream. It was like butter. I wasn&apos;t TOO fond of the taste; I think the milk flavor was bettef. SomiSomi will always be my go-to ice cream in Koreatown."
5,"I got the matcha ice cream with no filling and it was SOOO GOOD. 

Tried the Black Sesame and it was so good. I had a hard time figuring out what to get because both were delicious!!

My sister tried the ube flavor and she said she liked it"
4,"Food: 7/10
Portion size: small
Service: N/A pay at the counter 
Wait time: 5 minutes on a Saturday 

We got the ube and oreo ice cream Ahboog style. The ube and oreo was delicious!  We got Graham crackers, coconut flakes, and rainbow sprinkles! You can also pick a filling and we got custard. I thought it was yummy! I wish I was bigger but it was a fun creation and delicious to eat!

You have 3 different styles you can get: ahboong, upside down, softserve in a cup. The flavors of ice cream are milk, oreo, matcha and ube. The two mixed options are matcha and milk and the one we got.
The 3 filings are custard, nutella and red bean. For toppings they have a lot of options and its unlimited! Have at it!

What&apos;s nice is that everything is lactose free except for the milk flavor! I&apos;m lactose intolerant so this makes me happy!

Tip: don&apos;t bite down on the fish cone until most of the ice cream is done! My ice cream almost popped out!

Also this is more of a takeout style. There are no real places to eat it except for the one bench outside. We also came here before the shelter in place so call them before you go!"
5,"After a long week of working in the hospital, I was thinking how will I spend my day off? Then I just drive in and bought this soft serve from somi somi. It gives me the breeze I&apos;m looming for since its kinda hot today. It taste really really good its my 2nd time having it and it was good to share this experience too with my sis"
