5,"Satisfied a taco craving. This was our first time at this location and truck.

Location: They have a couple of food trucks at the northwest corner of La Brea and Venice.  

Parking: They have about 10 marked parking spaces for customers, but at least a few more can park inside the area, as it&apos;s collocated with a gas station. 

Set up:  One truck has the cashier situated outside of one food truck and safe behind plexiglass. The other food truck has another worker that just gives you the condiments (radishes, onions with cilantro, limes, three types of sauces).  You just tell the worker how many of each you need and she hands it to you in a plastic bag. There is nowhere to sit and eat, so you either have to eat in your vehicle or take it home. Not sure if that&apos;s just because of current COVID-19 restrictions.

Service:  Quick and efficient. We got our entire order in about 8 minutes.

Food:  The food was tasty and fresh, and there was a lot of it. 
The Asada Fries was massive. Lots of fries topped shredded carve asada, melted cheese, and sour cream. The Chicken Quesadilla was full of cheese and chopped chicken. The (2) Carne Asada, Al Pastor, and Chicken Tacos were small in size, but packed with flavor and definitely filling! 

Oh, and it&apos;s a cash only business, so make sure you have some before heading over. 

We will definitely be back."
5,"Honestly one of the best tacos I&apos;ve had, but the real highlight of this place is the mulitas. If you&apos;ve never had &apos;em I highly recommend you try &apos;em. The prices are pretty reasonable and they&apos;re open pretty late every day."
5,"Let&apos;s TACO about pineapples on on these al pastor tacos  ⁣
⁣
If you haven&apos;t checked out Leos taco truck you have to give it a try! The pineapples on top are ⁣Even if you aren&apos;t a fan of pineapples, I recommend you give it a shot!  Sauces aren&apos;t picture in the photo but they included it when I asked for it! But the tacos were still good without it!
⁣
Finally got around to try tacos here after being told how good they were! I don&apos;t know why it took me soo long to finally give them a try! Came here during covid and they were practicing social distancing! DTLA has good tacos so if you haven&apos;t tried them, you&apos;ve been missing out!⁣ would recommend and come back for some bomb tacos!"
5,"Hands down the best al pastor tacos I&apos;ve ever had!! I went here 3 times in one week. 
For only $1.50 each taco and they put lots of meat too. 

The carne asada could be a little more flavorful but the chicken is good!"
3,"Average taco joint-  c&apos;mon folks.  Go to East LA or Baja to experience tacos and the bar will be set.

Its a great spot to get late night tacos and especially if they have their outdoor al pastor fire going.  It&apos;s the closest real taco to the west LA taco desert that we have- 

I had the tacos here recently- they moved their operations inside the truck due to pandemic- and the al pastor tacos were blah average.  I like a little char on mine.  Due to lack of high flame- it resulted in large chunks of pork fat- Which is not up my alley.

I&apos;ll prob drive the extra 5-10 miles to get some tacos next time..."
3,"Anyone who knows a good taco wouldn&apos;t call this place anything over average. Their food does not earn three stars--it&apos;d be less than that. I awarded  them three stars because they are 1. late open nightly. 2. They don&apos;t skimp on salsa and other toppings like cilantro and onion--it&apos;s help yourself. 3. They are pretty good organizers in terms of attending to big crowds and many orders processed quickly and conveniently. 
4. Located conveniently on a major corner. 5. Decent parking.  
Those five things are key when it comes to deciding between two taco spots of equal quality food. Sometimes ok take a lesser taco because they exceed in those five things over another spot known to have better food."
3,"Taco craving on a rainy night!  Thank goodness the line wasn&apos;t long, brrrr!  There aren&apos;t much parking at this gas station/taco truck.  Better off just park in the residential area and walk over.  It was my first time here, so I ordered a few tacos and an asada burrito.  I got the Chorizo, Carnitas, and Al Pastor.  After you order, you can go to the truck next to it for the taco condiments.  I opened them all up and took a bite of each, just so I can compare and see which I liked most.  The carne burrito beat all of them, IMO.  It hit the spot.  The tacos were the tiniest ones I&apos;ve seen!  I liked the Al Pastor the most, then carnitas, and Chorizo.  Chorizo was a bit dry and honestly, it didn&apos;t taste like chorizo to me.  At the end of the day, I was full, just wished I had 2 burritos instead of the tacos or have asada tacos.   I don&apos;t mind coming here if I&apos;m in the area again."
5,Leo&apos;s tacos are everybody&apos;s favorite. There&apos;s really not much to say because they&apos;re simply the best. GET THE AL PASTOR TACOS. If you get anything else you&apos;ll be jealous of your friends who only got al pastor and wish it was you.
5,"My friends and I were originally going to meet at the Grove but when we got there, we saw how crowded it was and thought twice. We then looked for options around the area and found this taco truck!!
With this many good reviews, I was so excited to try these tacos. They are so worth all the hype!
My favorite was the al pastor taco - the meat was so warm, fresh, and flavorful with a big piece of juicy pineapple on top.
The chicken tacos were also really flavorful and a little Smokey!
The next truck over had 3 different prepackaged salsas as well as onion, cilantro, limes, and radishes. The two spicier salsas were delicious and added a nice kick to the tacos.
Whenever I&apos;m in the area, I&apos;ll have to visit again!!
The price is extremely reasonable, but remember this place is cash only!!"
5,"Leo&apos;s taco truck is a must visit location if you are coming to LA. It sells some of the most delicious tacos and you will not be disappointed. 

Pros 
-Delicious food 
-Security
-Positive vibes 
-A must visit 

Cons 
-Busy on the weekends 
-Parking can be hard on the weekends"
4,"Been hearing for a while now how Leo&apos;s Al Pastor is the best in LA. Well, finally got to try it among Covid protocols, which means you get to eat it in your car. When I finally unwrapped my lukewarm, thin foil wrapped tacos, then somehow tear open the little bubble bags of cilantro and onion, then apply to my taco, drip some salsa on it without spilling it on my shirt, the whole experience sucked. They could have at least given me a paper plate. The food tasted really good, and I could tell if I had gotten these tacos straight away served as they should be, pre covid they would have been dope. So I gave back one star. Look forward to enjoying them once things get back to normal."
3,"Rating - 3.5 Stars

They specialize in Al Pastor tacos, but unfortunately it felt underwhelming. I was expecting it to be juicier, but they&apos;re sliced very thinly. Because of the thin slices, and the fact it&apos;s served with two tortillas, the taste of the tortillas overwhelmed the taste of the meat for me. I will say there was a nice char/crunch to the meat though.

I wish it came with onions and cilantro since it&apos;s an extremely basic taco with only meat and tortillas plus a slice of pineapple. It needed a squeeze of lime as well to help brighten things up. However for $1.50 per taco, guess you can&apos;t really complain.

You have to eat ASAP since they stack your tacos on top of each other, which results in the top tortillas potentially getting soggy.

Also, CASH ONLY!"
4,"Their al pastor tacos are so flavorful and juicy, and the additional piece of pineapple was amazing (and I don&apos;t even really like pineapple). DEFINITELY get these tacos. I&apos;d pass on the chicken tacos since they&apos;re pretty dry. But the cabeza tacos were also super juicy and flavorful. 

In my opinion, these tacos are pretty standard. Nothing other than the al pastor tacos stand out to me, but if I was really craving tacos, Leo&apos;s would hit the spot. 

They&apos;re cash only, even during COVID! Don&apos;t forget your cash because they don&apos;t accept Venmo!"
3,"Came here on the recommendation of a friend of mine. He is mexican and he told me these tacos are fire. I went with his recommendation and got their famous &apos;El Pastor&apos; tacos. My husband got 2 beef and 1 chicken. 

Heads up, these tacos are small. I ordered 2, however, 5 would have been the perfect meal. This is one of those instances where big things come in small packages. 

I never would intentionally get a spiced pork and pineapple taco, which is what the El Pastor is. But it works. The sweetness of the pineapple, with the pork is a wonderful combo. 

Here&apos;s the thing. I enjoyed the tacos and the experience having some authentic mexican food, but I would not go rushing back. 

My tacos were cold. None of the meat had any flavor. All the toppings were served on the side in little bags and building these tiny little tacos is difficult, with a lackluster reward. 

If these are authentic Mexican tacos, then I&apos;m disappointments. I prefer American tacos I guess. 

Regardless I enjoyed the experience. The food was clean and fast. If this taco truck was parked outside my work I wouldn&apos;t be upset."
5,"So glad I found this place! It&apos;s on the corner near a gas station but there&apos;s a line so it&apos;s hard to miss! 

We got 4 tacos, 3 sopes, 1 torta, and drinks for $20! Not only is it cheap but they were all really delicious. I&apos;m from San Antonio so I miss my street tacos everywhere and this place just made up for it. 

I&apos;d recommend this anytime to anyone! There are no areas to sit but we just parked and ate it on the back fo the suv during the sunset. Perfect!"
5,This place is fire and a food truck so good for social distancing. I love the fries and carne asada really nice people runnin this place
4,"They&apos;re located in the gas station called Sinclair w/ a subsidiary emblem. 
Free parking in a lot. 
They&apos;re open during the pandemic. They&apos;ll only serve you if you wear a mask. 
CASH ONLY
There were about 11 cars parked in the gas station lot just for the taco truck
We ordered the 
Carne asada tacos- very good
Pollo tacos- very good
Carnitas tacos- very good 
Carne asada burritos-ok. Nothing special. 
Carne asada quesadilla- very good

They give you small containers of red or green salsa- it was only ok
They have Coke in glass bottles


Really good food. Will be back!"
5,I have been in LA for 5 years and these are easily the best tacos I&apos;ve ever had. I got the Al Pastor tacos and they came really quickly. The pineapple was a new addition for me but definitely worked.
5,"My husband and I have been coming here ever since I moved to LA and it&apos;s definitely worth it. We came here to try the al pastor tacos initially and it does not disappoint. Although the tacos are street taco sized, they taste great and are cheap. We visited during COVID and they&apos;ve been taking great precautions with masks and gloves and separate areas for everything so we felt safe.
Last time we went we ended up trying the Alambres which is essentially a box full of your choice of meat (we got al pastor) topped with melted cheese and fajita veggies (grilled onions and green bell peppers). They give you about 6 tortillas on the side but we had enough meat after that for another 4 tortillas worth. Definitely a great hidden value buy if you&apos;re feeding multiple people."
5,"Have lived in LA for a couple years now and have enjoyed Leo&apos;s tacos for years. Al pastor tacos are a fav, the horchata is also nice and flavorful, always enjoy their Carne asada quesadilla as well. 

This was my first time going since COVID hit and the measures they&apos;ve taken are nice! Easy lines to follow, they got rid of the salsa bar and pre packaged everything (you just go to the truck next to it to ask for sauce and other condiments). 

Remember cash only!"
