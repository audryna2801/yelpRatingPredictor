5,"Great food and ambiance.
First time here to eat with friends, al fresco dining for us. Parking was available by the curb of the restaurant. No valet because of Covid.
It was a friend&apos;s birthday and wanted to splurge a little.  One of the main reason for this choice was because of 2017 Jonathan Gold&apos;s list. It did not disappoint.  Each dish we ordered came out delicious and satisfying.  One of my favorite was the Branzino Fish, it was nicely prepared and quality was fresh.  The Bone Marrow was full of flavor and the pastas were yummy.

During Covid:
Outdoor dining only.
Each table was separated and spaced out nicely.
Menu was available for viewing by using your phone to scan the QR code available on the table.  
Staff wore mask and face shield.  
Food plates came and were handled with safety in mind. 

Would Highly Recommend."
5,Delicious food! Cute place! Went there for lunch for my birthday and it was amazing! We had the arugula salad with tomatoes and Parmesan shavings it was simple fresh and absolutely delicious! I had the Bolognese pasta and it was very good! Was the most authentic flavor I&apos;ve had in all of Los Angeles! You have to get that! The lemon pasta was also good! The tiramisu tasted great! And the torta de nonna was tasty! The waiters were so friendly and everything was COVID safe! Loved this place would go again!
5,"Authentic and beautiful food. Tonight we had the zucchini flowers stuffed with ricotta, the black truffle pizza, and the tagliolini limone. They were all excellent. Their ingredients are quality. The servers are warm and attentive. They also are taking covid precautions seriously."
3,"I&apos;ve been super excited to try their Uni Pasta and Lasagna Verde that everyone has been raving about. We came here last night for outdoor dining. They have a pretty nice set up with tables spread apart on the side walk and in their small outdoor patio with heaters between each table. Good ambiance. When you first get there, they&apos;ll give you a sheet of paper with some covid guidelines such as wearing masks and sanitizing, etc. (although no sanitizers provided)

Food:
Uni pasta (1/5)- very disappointing. The dish looks great but it was very undercooked. Each bite was a bit crunchy and hard. We politely told the waiter who took the dish away and brought a new one 5 minutes later. Not sure what happened but they gave me the exact same undercooked pasta again. We told them it was undercooked again but we decided to just keep it. Don&apos;t think a third time would&apos;ve mattered. They didn&apos;t try to remove it from the bill or offer any apology for the poorly cooked dish.

Lasagna Verde (3/5)- honestly not as special as I was hoping for. I&apos;m a cheese fiend but the cheese was overpowering and lacked any other flavors or depth.

Ahi Tuna Tartar Crostino(5/5)- definitely enjoyed this one. Well seasoned and all the ingredients complemented each other."
4,"This is a high-end high-quality restaurant with excellent service wonderful Italian menu and friendly atmosphere. Lasagna verdi absolutely the best. The veal Milanese it&apos;s excellent. And it is a large portion. The pasta with a black truffles was amazing.

I&apos;d also love to say this place is overpriced; but the fact is, their food is top quality. They know how to make pasta, steak, fish, charcuterie, salad, you name it.

I don&apos;t think you can order anything wrong at this restaurant. It is expensive, so be ready to splurge. It is amazing though, so get ready for the divine. Amazing food, beautiful staff, feels like Italy itself! A Must Go."
5,"Definitely my fave Italian restaurant in LA! Love its bone marrow, tartare, lobster salad. Swordfish carpaccio and seafood risotto were okay, not as good as the others."
3,"Meh. The bone marrow was really good and so was the bruschetta, but the dinner was okay. I ordered a pasta with lobster in it and it was not bad. I had chocolate cake after which was also okay. The waiter was absolutely amazing which made the experience way better!"
5,"Came here looking to try their lasagna. WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED. Cannot recommend the lasagna enough. Incredibly flavorful and with the roasted basil added a crisp crunch to it. 

They have some fantastic complimentary crispy flat bread that&apos;s also seasoned. My mom and I (mostly me) went through two baskets. We tried the calamari and burrata with beet salad. Calamari was lightly breaded and fried to perfection. The burrata and beet salad was fresh and flavorful. 

My mom got the Uni pasta which was very heavy. This is more of an Italian take than an Japanese take. As a result it&apos;s much heavier with butter and olive oil instead of only a sea urchin reduction with pasta. They also included onion to it that added flavor to it but my mom is sort of allergic which was unfortunate. 

Overall I highly recommend this place for all their amazing Italian food-especially the lasagna. This place has terrific service and ambience for a date as well. Just so you know the place *is* a little on the expensive side."
5,"Best penne arrabbiata. If you&apos;re one of those people that never strays from the PA then this is the spot if you want the best. Perfectly al dente, the right amount of spice and flavor in that arrabbiata."
5,"David is a sweetie I got this amazing. 
I got this marichino cherry ice cream and it is amazing. . ... 
The cherries r tart and a great balance to the sweet ice cream"
5,"Came with 2 other friends and left happy and full! Their outdoor seating is on the sidewalk which wasn&apos;t my favorite but the food made up for it. We came at night and the outdoor lighting was very minimal making it a bit hard to read the menu. Other than the ambiance, I have no complaints! 

Food: 
- Octopus Salad ($26): The octopus had an amazing grilled taste and was so tender. Everything about it was perfect! One of my favorite dishes! 

- Uni Pasta ($39): Really good! Definitely a creamier pasta and the flavors are nice.

- Branzino Filet ($28): A decent choice but I wouldn&apos;t say it&apos;s a must order, especially compared to the other dishes. 

- Bone Marrow: Yum!! Such a rich and delicious dish. Highly recommend!"
4,"We went there to celebrate a friend moving to LA and got a last minute reservation for 6 on OpenTable as most other restaurants were either closed or full. 

The outdoor seating is on the sidewalk of Beverly Blvd, having some tables separated by nice partitions to give you some privacy and social distancing. You still hear random cars racing on the blvd and scares you for a quick second. The servers are mostly Italian and speak a lot of words in Italian which enhances the experience. The menu is extensive and tailors to most people, plenty of good choices to choose from. They also have a lot of wine choices, out of which I tried the Chianti by the glass (nothing special). 

The agnolotti was okay, nothing special but the risotto ai fruitti di Mare was delicious and rich with seafood. We tried also the tiramisu, carrot cake &amp; Nutella, the Panna cotta and the pistachio gelato. The panna cotto was heavenly and the pistachio gelato was really good. 
The food is a little bit pricier than you would like so not really budget friendly. 

Overall experience: It&apos;s a good authentic Italian restaurant in WeHo for a first date/event but not my favorite in LA."
1,"This was such a disappointing experience. The service was horrible, it took an hour just for the appetizers to come out (my husband had to ask for them twice). I think our server just forgot us. When we finally got our entrees (almost two hours later), the pasta was overcooked. The desserts were shockingly horrible, the ice cream tasted like cheap freezer burnt grocery store brand.  The two appetizers (caprese, and artichokes) were good, but the overall meal and experience were so bad, I would not recommend this place to anyone. Don&apos;t waste your money, especially with so many other great restaurants in LA."
5,"Holy smokes! 

This restaurant is out of this world. It was my first time having some fine dining since COVID and they were able to accommodate our party into two tables and followed all safety protocols. Read the rest of the reviews for some in-depth and I&apos;ll just talk about my favorite parts of the meal. 

We were able to try a little bit of everything from appetizers to entrees. My favorite appetizer was probably the octopus and lobster salad that they served. The octopus was smokey and it left a really flavorful taste in my mouth. With the entrees, I loved the Uni pasta which doesn&apos;t have its typical EMC flavor (if you know, you know) and it came with a perfectly good bite of seafood. I also loved the scallops, however I thought that it might&apos;ve been a tad bit salty. The lasagna verde was my absolute favorite. Yes, it is going to be a small piece but you are going to enjoy every little bite of it. This lasagna is unlike any other lasagna I&apos;ve ever had and it had a nice filling to it. 

We were able to try the tiramisu and the panna cotta for dessert. Again, it was amazing for what it was worth. We paid a good price on dinner and we were all so full and happy. 

Bring your own wine and/or champagne for a celebration! Their corkage fee is $30 for the first 2 bottles and $50 for the third."
3,"Since delivery is now at an ultimate high due to Covid efforts, businesses should start thinking about how their meals &quot;present&quot; visually in that form. If it isn&apos;t what you&apos;d want to serve on a dish in a restaurant to a customer, then it&apos;s time to think about how to add that &quot;appeal&quot;. I rarely get to treat myself to a nice pasta meal, but I ordered the lasagna and tiramisu as a &quot;f- it I deserve a treat at work&quot; day. 

The lasagna is definitely different from the traditional dish you&apos;d normally see served bathing in marinara. Their version has green pasta and spinach on the side, or maybe that&apos;s supposed to be on top? I dunno. Wasn&apos;t a saucy dish either. It did have a nice taste to it, the meat is really the highlight to this lasagna.  The portion size is quite small and coming from someone that doesn&apos;t eat large meals, that&apos;s pretty bad. You just might still be hungry afterwards.

Tiramisu on the other hand was very flavorful and reminded me of a sponge cake stewed in a Starbucks Frappuccino. I&apos;m not a coffee drinker, but this had a nice taste so I would try it if you are a tiramisu fan. 

I also did not get any napkins or utensils and I did request it on the app. Luckily I had one lonely fork in my office. 

This restaurant is relatively close to my office, but the portion size and lackluster presentation are things I&apos;ll remember for next time."
5,"The food is simply amazing here I agree with other yelpers... The food here is by far one of the best in LA and I&apos;ve definitely eaten at the best places.  I was very impressed and will definitely be returning sooner than later.  I had the white Truffle pasta that melts in your mouth, the pear salad was also great.  The only thing is the parking.  There no valet we had to park on Beverly Blvd but I guess that&apos;s ok since the food was so good."
1,"I&apos;m baffled on how many positive reviews this place has. By far one of the worst restaurants I&apos;ve been to. My fiancé and I didn&apos;t even finish our food. Everything was underwhelming. Service was terrible, too. I&apos;ve had better pasta from Olive Garden!"
5,I&apos;m so glad to see their amazing operation during COVID! I felt completely safe and enjoyed the experience to the fullest extent! Amazing quality ingredients and an all around authentic Italian menu! The Limone pasta is to die for!! Can&apos;t wait to go back!
5,"After 16 years of living in Los Angeles we finally got to try Angelini Osteria.  We live nearby, pass this place all the time on Beverly Blvd.  Problem is me as Italian cuisine is typically not my first choice.  Anyone whom follows me on Yelp will see I tend to favor Asian foods.

Am glad we dined at Angelini Osteria last night.  Also glad the 4 of us ordered a myriad of different dishes we could share.  This gave me a deep feel for their food, helped me identify a couple of dishes I now adore.  Sadly due to the health issues in California last night was their last operating evening until restaurants reopen post Coronavirus.

So let&apos;s jump into the food, why I gave these nice folks five stars.

Swordfish Carpaccio Salad:  This was a warm carpaccio bursting with flavor.  Never had swordfish so delicious.  I&apos;m used to swordfish in steak form.  This was a different twist on swordfish that almost tasted like ahi tuna.  Bottom line?  I loved it and will absolutely order it again.

Polipo:  Absolutely the best octopus in the Western half of the country.  It was seared, possibly grilled.  The center was light and creamy.  The combination of texture and flavor was not to be beat.  If you love octopus you need to order this dish.  All four of us agreed that this dish was the high-point of our meal.  Reality is I will return here, just order a double octopus.  

Anchovies:  Probably the most beautiful presentation you shall ever see of anchovies.  They were prepared flawlessly, a lovely appetizer to share.

Branzino:  Beautiful tasty preparation and presentation of branzino.  This is the only dish I had a slight problem with.  I hate bones in my fish and got bones in the first two bites.  Sadly this always happens to me with branzino.  My three dining partners had bone free branzino.  The taste; however, was exceptional as I did love the flavor.  I was just afraid of getting more bones.

Lasagna Verde:  The lasagna was amazing.  I rarely eat lasagna in an upscale restaurant; however, was curious to see their presentation.  Boy was I glad we ordered this dish.  The lasagna was perfect.  The pasta was light, the filling/sauce flavorful.  It was not your typical heavy Southern Italian lasagna.  Their rendition of this dish can change how anyone may perceive lasagna.

Agnolotti:  This dish was a pleasant surprise, nothing I would have ever expected.  Here we had pasta stuffed with short rib.  The combination of pasta with meat was fantastic.  It was also a very light dish.

Cheese:  The assortment of Italian cheese at the end of our meal was spectacular.  I will always order this for desert on future visits.

Profiteroles:  This was a decadent desert we all shared.  The pastry, chocolate and cream worked so well together.  If you love chocolate please indulge in this delicacy.

Sorbetto:  Obviously these folks know how to make flawless sorbettos.  We all got to try the special flavors of the evening.

Simone was a wonderful server.  The restaurant is simple, tastefully done and all about spectacular food.  I&apos;m inspired to return here ASAP.  Let&apos;s hope the health issues in Los Angeles are behind us soon."
5,"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaamazing Italian food. ( Period) 
Amazing food ( period ) 
I wish I could try every single thing on this menu because I KNOW it will be delicious. 
What makes it even more special is the comfort of the restaurant, the seating is close and familial.... The ambience is also welcoming, comfortable, and the staff are knowledgeable and friendly. 
There is valet parking ( just to State the obvious) 
If you want to eat here you must make a reservation in well advance.
I enjoyed the artichoke appetizer the most, the octopus appetizer was also a must try. 
I ordered the branzino and this was so simple , and tasty, especially if you like fish!! It was an authentic roasted fish dish with a side table entertaining moment  prior to eating it!! 
Can&apos;t wait to some back to try the uni or truffle pastas. 
With my favorite appetizers."
