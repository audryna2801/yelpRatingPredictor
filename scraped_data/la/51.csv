5,"Went out to eat for the first time since February. They were only seating every other table (staggered) so there was no one near us. Food was great, the employees wore masks and those plastic visors so it felt quite sanitary. 

Love that this place serves good quality meat and gives you Ssam to wrap with!"
5,"Solid Korean bbq all around. 
Among the 3 of us, we shared a beef combo and added a regular sized pork belly. 
The meat quality was excellent!
The pork belly was some of the best I&apos;ve ever had!! With the grilled kimchi mmmmmm, could literally eat that everyday. 
This place is called Ssam, so they give you unlimited amount of vegetable wraps (lettuce, cabbage, etc.). Hell yea!
We also tried their mulnaengmyun at the end, and it was pretty solid as well!
The service was on point. 
There&apos;s not a negative thing I can say about this place. 
I will definitely be back!"
4,"We were planning to go to Genwa but it was too last min, so our Korean friend suggested us to try out this place. We came as a party of 6. And, we were all glad we came. I thought Ssam Korean BBQ was pretty authentic, based on the name, you can tell it&apos;s a Korean bbq place with &quot;ssam&quot;! 

&quot;Ssam&quot; meaning &quot;wrapped&quot; refers in a Korean dish in which, usually leafy vegetables are used to wrap a piece of meat, such as pork belly or other fillings! 

So, this is the place that you have to focus on veggie wraps with meat, and if you do it the right way, 1000% guaranteed it will level up the taste! 

Quick tips: 
1) Grab a piece of lettuce, add a piece of raw garlic (a must), some rice and other side dishes if you like, and don&apos;t forget to add some &quot;ssam sauce&quot; (Korean chili paste). I loved it with pork belly the most, their veggie wrap def makes pork belly way tasty! Note: You have to eat it with one bite! 

2) You can order half portion to enjoy more!  

3) Try their spicy raw crab! It&apos;s a little mushy, but interesting to try! 

4) Get their cold noodles! So refreshing, so good! We order non-spicy one, but added with the vinegar and spicy chilled bibim sauce! It&apos;s cold, sweet and tangy! Hands down! Very delicious! 

4) Combo beef was good but a bit lack of seasoning! (I was wondering if they did it on purpose?  (cause we need to add sauce and other fillings for the wraps?) 

5) Skip loin back ribs, even it says &quot;BEST&quot; on menu. But it was just okay to us, or double check w/ the servers if there is another way to make it tastier! 

6) Dip the meat with the hot grilled cheese!!! 

All in all, the staff were all pretty attentive and efficient! They cooked all the meat for us, and even asked if we wanted them to cut out the fat before serving to the table. I thought that was thoughtful! They did consistently speak Korean to us, (I guess it&apos;s because we have friends who speak Korean), but most of the servers have no problem communicating in English as well! Service was on point! However, I probably wouldn&apos;t recommend anyone who&apos;s looking for a melt-in-your-mouth kind of experience to try out this place, but if you&apos;re looking for a more traditional Korean bbq style with veggie wraps, I think it&apos;s worth visiting!"
2,"Guys, how does this place have this high of ratings? 

This could have been an off night, but as Randy Jackson says &quot; Its a no for me Dawg&quot;. We actually came here by recommendation of a friend, and damn we wont be back. 

We had a big group of 8, so what do we do? Get the largest combo of course! Pretty excited to dig in and have a fun Ssam experience w my friends. Growing up we had Ssam basically at the ready, and most kbbq spots you gotta request it and half the time they dont have much, but Ssam has a good selection. They have the red leaf lettuce and the perilla leaves to wrap your meats, but for a place called Ssam as quick as we ran out they never really cared to replenish the ssam without us asking 2-3 times. It wasn&apos;t a crazy busy night either.

On to the meat, and there&apos;s not much to be said about it . For the price you could get far better cuts at some all you can eats (and im only about the a la carte life), but if you&apos;re going to spend just about $200 on meat you&apos;re better off going to the other places in the area. I wont name names of those locations, but the meat here was middle of the road at best. 

I&apos;m never a stickler on service, but it was just bad here. Our server wasn&apos;t cooking our meats well, so we just took over, and left the ssam and soju replenishing to him, but even with that responsibility he failed. 

To say the least we legit finished up quickly really disappointed, and went to JYJ up Western to make up for the ssam experience, and yes we did spend $500 as a group on KBBQ that night, but it made up for what we had here. 

I always keep it real for you guys, and again to be fair it could have been an off night, but I&apos;d say for now it&apos;s best to skip this place, and do the opposite of Nike. 

****I found the answer to my own question up top...They have people leave high reviews for free a beer or sodas."
4,"Nice place but not sure I&apos;d come back.

First let me say that this place is a nice restaurant but with the other options, I&apos;m not sure if this is a place I&apos;d frequent. 

The food - food was decent. Love that they offer a veggie platter for you to wrap your meats. The meat over all was very average. Maybe sat in marinades a bit too long? Enjoyed their meat combos and the prices seemed a tad lower than other places. 

Atmosphere - this is a spot that gets far less traffic than most of the other places so i didn&apos;t find it as noisy. Reminded me of the hole in the wall spots in Seoul. Less young folk and more older locals. 

Service - very good. Staff constantly checked in on us. Could not be better.


I was torn between giving this place 3 or 4 stars. Overall this place is solid but I&apos;m super spoiled by some of the nicer places. On a Friday night, this place did not seem as busy as other places. Good place to visit if you&apos;re not willing to wait on the weeken"
4,"Great bbq meats - my favorites were the marinated spare rib and the loin back rib. 

It&apos;s been difficult to find a bbq place with high meat quality and yummy noodles, but Ssam hits the spot for both. I recommend getting the spicy cold noodles as it&apos;s the best of both worlds. 

Parking is valet."
5,"Ssam you are amazing! I dream of this place and compare all korean bbq places to this place and its quality. We had a large party and everything was ordered for us already. Set dinners and the best service and food I&apos;ve had in a long while. The ribeye beef was so good! The shrimp too. Delish. Fresh and really good quality. Loved all the wrappings esp the onions and salad. The denjang soup was a bit salty but perfect with rice.  We enjoyed the entire experience so much. Been telling everyone about it. This is a must stop for Korean bbq. We love ayce bbq but the quality here and the amount of food you get for the set meal is so totally worth.  
As in all Korea town establishments it has a valet parking. 
Idk if other Ssam restaurants are as good like in Carrollton. Idk if it is the same but man this place is good!"
2,"I&apos;m just wondering how many 5 star ratings are bought and real on this page. My experience is similar to Rickeys experience and the rest who had a problem with their meat not properly being cooked.

My wife and I came here for dinner around 5:30pm ordered PRIME FLOWER SHORT RIB(the most expensive meat) and PORK SKIRT STEAK.

The prime flower short rib was cooked first and cooked into 2 sections. The first half was cooked OK which is why I gave them 2 stars. One side got a good crust from being cooked in the highest flames and the other side well that&apos;s when the night fell apart. We had one main person grilling our meat and servicing us. Not going to describe this person.

Cooked it in low heat. This meat is fatty and has nice marbles so has to be cooked in high flames so it forms a nice crust just like how you cook any steak. 

One side has a nice crust while the other has no crust so imagine the taste of the meat one side tastes like boiled water meat while the other tastes like it been grilled.

So they cook the second half of the most expensive meat in low heat and literally tastes like boiled water meat. Shouldn&apos;t servers be educated on how to cook meats according to their quality and price. 

Now it&apos;s time for the pork. This gets better. The grill that they cooked the beef they use to cook the pork. You never mix pork and beef. After the meat was cooked half way we asked to switch the grill. 

So the meat is being rested on the side for a good 5-10 minutes. Then comes our server dumps the meat and we don&apos;t see her for the rest of the night but we see her drinking with our neighbor table across from us.

while my wife and I both have chopsticks in our hands flipping our meat checking to see if it&apos;s fully cooked because it is pork and I&apos;m pretty sure she saw us. I don&apos;t care if I cook my meat but if you are a server in the customer service industry not serving your customers but drinking and chatting then that&apos;s not a bad look on the server but the establishment.

By the way the pork skirt tasted and smelled like shit. My wife and I literally took one bite of that and left. Here are some pics."
4,"True story: I used to HATE pork belly. 

That is...until I visited Korea &amp; Jeju Island several months ago and ate pork belly there....wrapped in lettuce. Turns out, I&apos;ve been eating my food the wrong way my entire adulthood!

Long story short, I came back very enlightened...and on a mission to find the same delicious bits of pork belly, kimchee, slices of raw garlic, jalapeno, and ssamjang wrapped in a gigantic lettuce. Searched Yelp for ssam and guess what popped up? Yeees! 

This is not your typical Korean bbq...its different! You need to focus the little veggie wraps...do eat the lovely little things in one bite!..I&apos;ve now been here with pretty much anyone in my life that I care about simply because its so addicting...but not even because the meat is that great. Its the combination of everything. 

Oh and they do provide you with generous portions or raw spicy crab, typical banchans, steamed egg, and either a kimchee or bean paste stew. 

Servers were always very quick to cook our meat and refill whatever we needed. Valet parking in their lot or find whatever street parking."
5,"BEEF TARTARE + SPICY RAW CRAB FTW

My husband loves Ssam BBQ because the meat combos are good quality and their sides. I love it here because they have two of my favorite Korean dishes: yookhe (raw beef tartare) and kaejang (spicy raw crab)!

The spicy crab is served as a side dish for free which is impressive. Super yummy with a kick don&apos;t be scared! Bite down on the crunchy shell and suck out the marinated meat and then spit out shell. 

The beef tartare is delicious! Don&apos;t be scared try it! The raw beef is frozen and shredded and tossed with sesame oil and sliced Korean pear and it&apos;s just sweet and tasty! Large portion too. 

I&apos;ll be back again soon! I think they have the best yookhe in ktown #truth"
4,"Came here for the first time, I wasn&apos;t impressed. But the service was better than a lot of other Korean restaurants, an extra star for the service. 

It&apos;s nice for them to allow customers to order half orders of meat. We ordered prime brisket, not marinated short ribs, and pork belly. The prime brisket was very marbled, they said that&apos;s the higher grade of brisket, they usually give the leaner meat for combos orders. Their not marinated short ribs was decent. The pork belly wasn&apos;t good, but I liked the kimchee and bean sprouts that came with the order. 

I will probably come here again, the parking is very convenient for customers, and it&apos;s only $2. Those guys were cool, unlike the other parking lots. R"
3,"My friends and I were at Ssam Korean BBQ to celebrate friends&apos; birthday. We were able to sit in a private room due to the number of people in our party and were separated from other diners.

I believe we ordered the beef and pork combo to share between 3-4 people, which costed ~$115. The quality of meats were not bad, but definitely not top of the line enough to justify a la carte pricing. It was also difficult to flag down servers as well. I liked that there were some pretty delicious banchans though!

Overall, I don&apos;t think I will come back because Ssam did not meet my expectations. For the same price, I would stick with Baekjeong or TK92."
4,"Come after 2:01PM to avoid the valet. LOL.

Anyways, they have the best value lunch special.
Today I chose Bulgolgi SSAM lunch combo - $14.99 / A HUGE VALUE!
- Comes with an abundant amt of Bulgogi, well made, seasoned
- A side soup, you can choose Korean Miso or Kimchi Stew (Chigae), I went w the latter, pretty tasty, well made
- Banchan set was nice: japchae, napa cabbage kimchi (perfection), radish kimchi, a miso seasoned green veggie, absolutely wonderful savory garlicky stir fried fish cake w thin slices of jalepeno, and a mayo noodle salad.
- The SSAM pkg was a platter of greens / herbs and ssamjang (savory seasoned miso paste) and sliced jalepenos
- You can choose WHITE RICE or JAKOK BAP (Purple mixed grain rice), I went w the latter

Service was pretty good. Except the waiter kept taking away my banchan plates without asking if I wanted a refill. So I kept having to ask separately, another person to help me out.

They were kind and refilled my SSAM (lettuce platter).

Value / Portions were grand.

If you are on OMAD (One Meal A Day), this is the meal for you!

Still a great lunch, tasty well made food.

Man their kimchi though, perfection!
It&apos;s well made, not too fishy like other places.
I would buy it by the gallon."
4,"Been our group&apos;s go-to lately for KBBQ.  Ssam has everything we want checked off at the moment: good quality cuts, good service, and no hassle.  

We typically get at least the large beef combo and maybe an additional if we have a larger group.  Combos are probably the way to go to experience a wider range of cuts.  

The staff comes and assists with the BBQing which is nice since we&apos;re able to just hangout and chat.  Most of the staff we&apos;ve encountered are very friendly!

Valet parking available!"
5,"This is probably my favorite place in Koreatown to get KBBQ. Although the prices seem steep, they give you larger portions and so you don&apos;t need to order that much. I would highly recommend getting the marinated galbi here. Typically, all you can eat KBBQ places don&apos;t offer galbi because of how expensive it is and AYCE places also give small plates of lower quality meat. 
Definitely recommend you to give this place a try instead of the AYCE KBBQ place you typically go to"
5,"Hands down my favorite high quality KBBQ place in Koreatown. I&apos;ve been to kanghodong, quarters, parks bbq, chosun galbee, and soowon galbi. This place is the most lowkey but I still like it better than all the others. There&apos;s barely a wait too on weekend nights, on Saturday night I waited around 15-20 minutes which is nothing compared to the 2+ hours quoted at KHD/quarters. 

I usually get the beef combo (beef combo for 3 is A LOT of food for 3 people, could probably feed 4. Beef combo for 2 could also comparably feed 3).
The marinated intercostal beef is SOO GOOD and really unique in that you can&apos;t find something like this at any other KBBQ place in ktown (at least not that I know of...). The difference between the beef combo for 2 vs for 3 is there&apos;s no galbi (marinated short rib) in the one for 2. I don&apos;t mind becauseI like the intercostal beef better but if you really like short rib you should order the 3 combo. Short ribs here are yummier than short ribs at any of the other aforementioned kbbq places. Comes with egg and soup - get the dwengjangjjggae it&apos;s bomb. 

Banchans are also really good, service is good and they grill the meat for you. The spicy nengmyeon is freaking good too and way better than the one at Yuchun imo. 

This place is freaking delicious and underrated af. This will always be my go to when I want kbbq in ktown and if you&apos;re one of those chumps waiting hours for quarters.. re think your life decisions and come eat here instead."
5,"OMG. This is my absolute favorite place for KBBQ in Los Angeles. I&apos;ve been three times, and every time the food has been consistently my amazing. Their top notch short rib is the best, and I could probably eat 3 servings just to myself. 

Service is below average when it&apos;s not rush hour. I know, makes no sense. It&apos;s not a fancy place and you can go in there with sweatpants. 

Price is high, but definitely worth the money."
5,I am so glad that Ssam Korean Bbq is open for dine in again! For anyone who have not yet tasted their Kalbi (marinated beef rib) I definitely recommend trying it. Thanks for opening back for dine in!
5,"My boyfriend has been mentioning about this BBQ restaurant many times and tonight we finally got to try it. The quality of the meat is really good. With lots tasty side dishes~ The staffs are very nice and efficient~
Very tasty! We are happy~~ 
Definitely will come for more for sure~"
5,"5 Noms out of 5 Noms
Location: located in the heart of K-Town the parking is in back. The only option I saw was valet. But then again I&apos;ve only ubered here. It&apos;s clean and the bathrooms are well maintained.
Food and drinks: we choose to get the Beef and Pork option for our group.  The meats kept coming out, all were good quality. The sides were good and what you would get at every typical kbbq establishment. The Beer and Soju selection is average, but enough to get you there!
Wrap up: they have good meat and amazing service. Nothing special when compared to Parks or Quarters, but I find myself coming back over and over again. It&apos;s one of the first places that I recommended as well. They must be doing something right! Keep it up!!!"
