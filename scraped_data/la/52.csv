5,"Holy shit. This place is so gooooooood.

I had the Director&apos;s Plate about 30 minutes from pickup so it wasn&apos;t freshly fried but my goodness this place is banging.  The fried chicken was still so crispy, the sauces were unique, the diced avocado and fresh blueberries were so unexpectedly tasty even when drenched in spicy hot oil.

I&apos;m really not a foodie but this place has me hooked so badly.  Every time I visit LA until the end of my life here on this Earth, Gol Tong is a must-go stop for me.  Please don&apos;t talk to me about Bonchon or other shitty KFC chains that you can get anywhere along the West or East Coast.  This is the real stuff and clearly made with love and warmth.  We need more places like this now more than ever during these times.  

Mr. Director, I salute you!"
5,"We came here on a Friday night to pick up
some chicken wings before California December COVID lockdown! We ordered the most popular item: boneless half and half chicken (soy garlic + chili). The owner/chef told us it would be ready in 10 minutes but we told him we would be there on 20 minutes instead. When we got there, he just literally took the chicken wings out of the pan and it was super hot and yummy!!! We immediately tried it on the car and it was &quot;legendary&quot;! Haha 

The owner is the only person at the store cooking and helping customers so great thanks to him for being super friendly and attentive! 

Parking was not bad when we came as people come and leave pretty quickly. Most nearby restaurants have closed early although we were there just around 8:30pm.

Overall, we will be coming back soon to get more chicken wings!!!"
5,"Came here for the first time today. 
It really is THAT GOOD.

We were alerted to Gol Tong by my brother who sent me an LA Eater article on the restaurant and the owner. 

Since we are in the pandemic, we drove down from Van Nuys, masked, and parked along Western and called in our order. I think the owner answered. He cooks and answers the phone and asks for your phone number. A bit hard speaking to him through mask, accent, and driving around the block, but he got the order. &quot;Ok, please hang up sir. I got to answer other orders!&quot; he said.  He&apos;s swamped with customers. 

We waited outside, for perhaps 30-45 minutes, with some six others. Finally we got it, drove back home, microwaved the chicken plate for three minutes, and dug in.

It was delicious. The sweet and sour, the sesame, the soy, the pineapple, avocado and chili pepper slices, just perfect. The colors  are as mouth-watering as the boneless thighs.   Two people could not finish it, there is so much there, and we probably ate only half and refrigerated the rest."
5,"We ordered all this for company lunch and it was a HIT!! 

Everyone loved it. You can honestly feed 2-3 people with one order of half and half. PORTIONS ARE HUGE!!!! Every flavor is very tasty my favorite is the chili (medium spicy). 

He has food ready for you if you call ahead and provides sauces, utensils and plenty of napkins. 

Excellent spot to try out!"
5,"Came here Feb 2021 during Super Bowl Sunday. The place opened at 3pm and we were lucky enough to get there right at opening. Everyone had preordered and there was only one guy manning the cash register, taking orders, and cooking the food yet the chicken was BOMB. Even though he was running a one man show, homeboy was cooking and plating those chickens beautifully. I wish this business all the success because the food was so tasty and good quality. 

Let me tell you, I thought $25 for chicken was too much but they give you a container full of chicken that&apos;s nice and juicy. The dark sauce with jalepenos is so delicious and has a taste I just can&apos;t describe. 

I wouldn&apos;t mind making the drive from OC to LA just to get this chicken again."
4,"My friend and I were looking for a new Korean Fried Chicken place to check out and found this place. We ordered the boneless soy garlic chicken to go. I placed the order over the phone and as we were driving to pick it up, I got a text of a picture of fried chicken from an unknown number. When I checked the number, I realized it was from the Gol Tong Chicken and that it was a picture of our order! We both thought it was cute and funny. 

The platter of chicken is pretty big and the toppings with the chicken are pretty interesting. It had pineapple, blueberries, avocado, and peppers on it. Surprisingly, they all went pretty well with the chicken! I am not even the biggest fan of dark meat but I thought the chicken was good and it was still nice and crispy despite it being covered in a liquid seasoning. We both really liked the two sauces it came with as well, in particular the mustard sauce that they provided was our preferred choice."
5,"Wow. Gotta say the hype is real. This is some great KFC (Korean Fried Chicken). All the more impressive being a one man operation. As many have recommended I got the Director&apos;s Cut, 3 flavors of boneless fried chicken: original, chili, and soy garlic. All bomb and perfectly fried, crispy and juicy. It came with 3 sauces all on the sweet side: a sweet soy garlic?, a sweet mustard, and a sweet &amp; spicy. The sweet mustard was probably my favorite sauce. It&apos;s a little on the pricey side, but you can probably feed 2-3 people with that. My fatty self has chicken for days now lol. I didn&apos;t see much of an outdoor setup so it&apos;s probably better as a to-go option right now. It&apos;s a pretty simple menu of fried chicken, you can&apos;t go wrong with any of the flavors. If you&apos;re looking for some Korean Fried Chicken, this place is a must-try. 

Service was fast and friendly. Called ahead at lunch time and it was about a 20min wait, I hear it can get pretty busy at night and the weekends though so be patient. It&apos;s literally just one guy. There&apos;s a small parking lot in front but it can fill up fast. It&apos;s Koreatown so there&apos;s street parking but you may have to walk a block or two."
5,"Believe the hype!!!

My bf &amp; I could not figure out what to eat. We were driving up Venice Blvd from Culver City when I found this place on Yelp. I called in my order &amp; could hardly understand the guy. I asked him for his opinion on what we should get. He asked for how many people, said something else and I just agreed lmao. After I got off the phone I looked at the menu pictures and saw fruit on the fried chicken. Ahhh I did not what to alarm my bf (he&apos;s hella picky &amp; pineapple on fried chicken??? He was deff going to bail) so I kept my mouth shut and off we went lol 

Located in a little plaza in Korea town, the entrance literally says, CHICKEN. We walked up and the guy greeted us, knew who we were lol and gave us our hot and just made chicken. We ate it in the parking lot and loved it allllll. 

The chicken is soooo good
The fruits go pretty well
It doesn&apos;t even need the sauce

Anyways. You got to try it!!"
2,"I think if you were allowed to dine in, the chicken would be better.
At the owner&apos;s suggestion I got a combo soy garlic and spicy.
The spicy was better, should&apos;ve just gotten that. Bc the double order was way too much food.

The chicken is good - boneless thigh meat. A little sad for me b/c I was looking for Korean Fried Chicken Wings extra crispy.

The spicy sauce too was excellent.

But since I live in the OC, after the long drive the chicken was not crisp. I had to rebroil in my toaster oven. Not the greatest experience.

The $2 for white rash was pricey. You don&apos;t get very much. Also I thought it was gonna be free of charge like most places (the owner said, hey my prices are all on the menu!).

So I got suckered into paying another $4, when originally I only wanted to spend about $16 for 1 portion of chicken, the owner got me into $30.

It&apos;s topped with avocado, blueberries and fresh cut pineapples. Odd but I did like the fresh cut pineapples.

Oh well."
5,"The director sure knows his chicken! To be honest, I haven&apos;t really read that eater article in its entirety, but I&apos;m always amazed at people who are able to find two great passions to pursue in life. You know what they say about filmmakers--if you can direct a chicken, you can cook a chicken--or is that just me.

Anyway, we ordered on a weekend night, and I knew that this place was going to be popular. Having called ahead of time, he said that the chicken would be ready in 20 minutes or so. However, after getting there, my friend had to wait another 20 to 30 minutes as the director meticulously made sure each order of chicken was fried to perfection. No post-production needed.

The half and half order was more than enough for the two of us. We got the chili, which was sort of sweet, and what seemed like the plain even though I think we wanted the soy garlic. Regardless, it was fried with love.

Highly recommend trying the chicken from Gol Tong but be prepared to wait!"
4,"***COVID-19 Takeout Review***

**Saturday Night Dinner: 1/2/21**

Gol Tong Chicken is a pretty cool spot! Discovered this place thanks to an article on Eater and decided to give it a try. I&apos;m not a huge fried chicken fan, but I do enjoy it and can definitely appreciate it.

To eat, we split an order of the boneless half and half, priced around $23. The half and half normally comes with soy garlic and chili, but we opted to swap the chili with the regular boneless fried chicken. The quantity is more than enough for 2 people. We actually had a decent amount of leftovers.

If expecting a quick pick up, this may not be your spot. Gol Tong Chicken was busy, and appears to be a one-man operation. It took about 30 minutes to get our food after arrival. The chicken itself was very good. I loved how the soy garlic came with unexpected items like avocado and blueberries. That being said, their regular boneless fried chicken was by far my favorite. While I found some of the soy garlic chicken to be a little dry, the original was juicy and prepared to perfection!"
4,"What an honor to have a super cool director make an awesome friend chicken tenders to perfection for you. Got to experience the takeout of half half chicken. The price and amount of food is great! It&apos;s not for one person unless you&apos;re doing a half order then maybe? :) 

The chicken itself isn&apos;t that flavorful truth be told. But the batter and sauce is YUM. Especially when it&apos;s crispy fried- even if it soaked sauces, STILL CRISPY . The menu is simple and honestly I love that. Director Gol Tong is a one man show so also please be patient, it was worth the wait. 

And the honey mustard sauce (the yellow bit) was so so so good. Order one more extra!!"
4,"I highly recommend the Director&apos;s Cut because you can try a little of each flavor, which included soy garlic, chili, and fried. The order came with 2 sweet sauces, which I didn&apos;t use much because the fried chickens were very flavorful. They were juicy and boneless, which was a nice surprise. The portions were very big and still tasted delicious a couple days after. I can&apos;t wait to dine-in at this place after the pandemic is over because I&apos;m sure the chicken tastes even better piping hot out of the kitchen with K-pop in the background.

Of note, we waited ~30 minutes for the order, probably because it was a Friday night, and there was a line of 3 people in front of us. Make sure you call ahead because there was a person who came after me at around 7pm, and the store had already run out of chicken."
5,"Normally for a place I enjoy I would sprint to Yelp to write a review but this time I had to especially simmer in my newfound love for Gol Tong first. The fried chicken here is hands down THE BEST Korean fried chicken I&apos;ve ever had in my life! 

My friend and I got the Director&apos;s Cut which features a trio of original, chili, and soy garlic flavors. All were fried until flawlessly crispy and breading/meat ratio was 10/10 and the chicken was SO juicy and tender. The soy garlic sauce itself is normally my go-to flavor for chicken but I will admit it wasn&apos;t my favorite here -- however the chili, which is normally not what I go for, really  surprised me. We also got a couple dipping sauces, out of which the honey mustard was the obvious star. The cherry on top .. is literally the cherries on top (and blueberries, pineapple, and avocado) -- I&apos;ve never had fried chicken come with fruit but if you think about it, it&apos;s the perfect sweetly fresh balance to the chicken. At the same time though, the chicken isn&apos;t even overwhelmingly heavy to begin with. I ate a ton and even the next day I ate all the leftovers (and there were a LOT) because it was so delicious and still juicy, and my stomach didn&apos;t feel bad. 

And not to forget the radish!! Normally radish would be included but that&apos;s not the case here; according to other reviews it&apos;s homemade so it makes sense why it costs extra.

Prices in general are so fair, because it truly is just the Director&apos;s one-man show. He puts a lot of love and care into his food and is so so friendly. My friend and I saw the tent/tables outside and asked if we could sit there; it turned out that they weren&apos;t part of Gol Tong so he literally set up a little table outside for us ;.; 

If you managed to read through this entire essay/love letter to Gol Tong, I hope it convinced you enough to eat here!!"
5,"Glad I finally went to this spot! Came on a Saturday night, ordered ahead and got my food on time without any issues.

I believe they are only taking phone orders atm, I&apos;d call about 20-30 mins ahead of time.

I went for the directors cut for 2 people. This includes all 3 types of their chicken, the plain, garlic and chili. Additionally, this came with extra sauces, including the chili, garlic and a honey mustard. The portion is huge, we got about 2.5 meals out of that for 2 people. Total was about $34.

Would definitely come back! Friendly staff and great food"
5,"My wife and I had wanted to go to Quarters to get some KBBQ yesterday evening but ended up having to scrap the idea after finding out it would be a 2 hour plus wait in order to get seated. On top of that, the dining situation did not seem the most safe as far as COVID pre-cautions so we decided to forego the idea of dining-in entirely and sought a take-out place. Within a minute of searching on Yelp, we quickly found Gol Tong. As huge Korean fried chicken fans, we immediately clicked in and placed an order for half-and-half spicy/soy garlic wings. Within 15 minutes or ordering, I got a notification that our order was ready for pick-up -- so fast! For this reason, I would definitely recommend not placing your order too far ahead of time; nobody likes soggy wings.

When we brought the wings back to our hotel -- about a 15 minute drive away, they were still hot and crunchy. Of the two types of wings included in our order, my favorite was the spicy one, which I would highly recommend if you have a mild to high spice tolerance. In hindsight, I wish I had bought some instant rice to go with my meal as it would gone really well with the tangy sauce. Paired with a bottle of Hite or OB beer from California market down the street, I had the perfect fried chicken meal. Would highly recommend the wings from Gol Tong."
5,"YES! I pass by this place all the time and haven&apos;t been and I&apos;ve lived in the area for 3 years. Today I finally looked it up on Yelp and had to see what the hype was about. I&apos;m here to tell you the hype is real people! This is some delicious chicken! My boyfriend and I got the Director&apos;s Cut to share at the recommendation of the owner/chef. He is so friendly and the chicken is fire!! My favorite was the chili chicken, but the garlic was a close second. You get the sauces with the chicken and they&apos;re all great too. The portions are huge! We can eat a lot but the 2 of us couldn&apos;t finish the directors cut together. 
Please go! Support this business it&apos;s amazing 10/10 I&apos;ll be back again :)"
4,"Food (5/5): The first thing I said when I said it in person was, &quot;Wow this looks really good.&quot; Also, there portions are huge, so make sure to share the full portion! Even though their menu isn&apos;t exactly expansive, the Half &amp; Half is really all you need especially for couples. The Soy Garlic doesn&apos;t have the biggest flavor but the yellow sauce (not sure what it is) it comes with pairs nicely. The Chili flavor is more of the classic spicy, sweet and savory Korean flavor. To me it kinda tastes like gochujang and bbq together. I recommend eating with radish and rice (make at home). The actual cook on the chicken is outstanding! Crispy outside &amp; juicy inside! 

Price (5/5): Worth the price! Quantity &amp; quality are *chef&apos;s kids*

Service (2/5): Painstakingly slow right now because there&apos;s only one man working! Yes, only 1 man cooking, charging customers, &amp; taking orders at the same time. We got here &amp; ordered at 5:20 and was told it would only take 20 minutes to get our food. At 5:55 he told my boyfriend he was STARTING to cook our food. We didn&apos;t end up getting it until 6:00pm. My recommendation would be to get here an hour before your normal eat time. FYI, if you&apos;d like to call ahead of time, good luck getting through. We tried to as we were heading there and didn&apos;t get through. I did see other guests go in and pick up there food though. 

Ambiance (4/5): When this lockdown is over, I can see this place being a great spot to watch a game. Hopefully, he can get another person to help out, otherwise, I wouldn&apos;t recommend sitting down here. There&apos;s three large TVs. There are about 5 tables perfect for couples, small group of friends, and families."
3,"Thanks for plenty of quantity!  It was tasted so-so.

Why was tax rate 10.95%? LA should be 9.5%. Is this just mistake or what it will be?"
5,"We got the soy garlic and the original and they&apos;re both so good!!! Very freshly made since he starts making your order after you call to place it. We placed an order pretty close to closing and he made too much fried chicken for our order and gave it to us complimentary :) Crispy and super hot and good!

Additionally, the owner is really friendly and welcoming! Highly recommend this spot and can&apos;t wait to try more of the flavors."
