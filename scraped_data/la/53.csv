5,"They have a deal right now - $1 AYCE Soju and Beer! Is that not the craziest thing ever!? I think it lasts until the end of March but don&apos;t quote me.

Eight opens at 5pm and is instantly busy. I&apos;m not sure if this is the norm or word spread about the liquor deal. Either way, the wait was about 90 minutes on a Saturday night.

Eight is called Eight for the 8 flavors of pork belly they have: original, wine, garlic, herb, curry, miso paste, gochujjang, and ginseng. The Combo A comes with all 8 served in a fun tray like a flight of pork belly. The combo also comes with a generous serving of seafood soup, as well as all the banchans. All flavors in my pork belly flight were good but I favored the herb, curry and gochujjang. I haven&apos;t had Korean where they cook at your table in so long, I&apos;m so used to self-cooking &amp; serving so that was nice having them prepare the meats for us on our own little grill in the outdoor tent.

This is a fun place to eat! Just prepare yourself for a long wait on the weekends."
4,"Came here for Valentine&apos;s Day and without reservations, we had to wait about an hour (which was totally fine). 

They&apos;re doing outdoor seating and they have heaters too! I appreciate that their tents aren&apos;t fully closed all around because that kind of defeats the purpose of outdoor dining. Staff were all wearing masks and they give you disposable trays/utensils! 

Would come again :)"
4,"Great service, the food was delicious.

I love how they gave rice paper as a side dish. It paired well with the different meats we ordered. I really liked the pork belly and the beef slices. The beef slices were very tender. The seafood Stew was also pretty good."
2,"This place is very overhyped for the experience I got. Very over priced &amp; the staff isn&apos;t that friendly. The food is good but, for the price you pay you get very little. It&apos;s not worth $80 in my opinion whatsoever. Don&apos;t recommend."
5,"Have you ever tasted happiness? Well, I don&apos;t know about you but this place comes pretty darn close. When I first heard of this place and it&apos;s specialty I was a bit hesitant because how many ways can you eat pork belly. Fortunately, they&apos;ve found a number of ways to prepare it. It&apos;s a parade of delicious pork belly. My suggestion is to eat it with plenty of kimchi, that really hits the spot.

The service is always excellent and although it&apos;s always popular we usually get in fairly quickly. It&apos;s truly an amazing spot with an array of delicious pork belly. Definitely try their special that gives you a good introduction to their many pork belly flavors. 

It&apos;s definitely in my korean bbq rotation. I try not to go as often as I&apos;d like because I want to continue to enjoy it to the highest level. 

Lastly, they have plenty of parking as they are located in a big shopping center."
5,"Los Angeles Koreatown is the US capital of Korean dining, outside of Korea of course.  So you got to be good to compete in LA.  8 Korean BBQ is a crazy concept, who would have thought of a Korean BBQ restaurant centered around 8 different marinade  / seasonings of thick pork belly?  Well, they do it and they do it well.

&quot;8&quot; is located in a strip mall, with plenty of free parking and a roving security guard, although the dude looks like he could be your long lost 140 pound uncle... well roving security is better than no security.

The place is modern and perfect for parties of four.  The square tables remind me of Chinese Mahjong tables, they even have a sliding drawer that holds napkins and chopsticks.  The griddle is centered mid table and has an opening where the grease is pushed off after cooking into a hidden trash receptacle using a turnip block.  Additionally, the circular chairs serve as storage for your items, just lift the lid, put your valuables in, put the lid on and sit.  Just remember to take your stuff out when you leave.  Yep, picture all that....

As for it&apos;s namesake, Combo A which features 8 rolls of pork belly is the way to go.  You get:
- Original
- Miso Paste
- Curry
- Wine
- Black Sesame
- Herb
- Garlic
- Red Pepper Paste
Each of us had our favorites and mine were Garlic, Miso, Wine, and the original.  The Waitstaff will cook, cut, and tell you when you can eat it.  With precision!  Make sure you use the rice paper and salad to wrap around the pork slices.  Especially tasty with the salt and sesame oil.  Oh by the way, dinner comes with Banchan, Seafood Stew, Salad, Kimchee, and Kimchee Fried Rice with Cheese.

You can order beef brisket, pork jowl, and other items also.  Overall, worth a visit...."
4,"Eight was absolutely delicious!!! They specialize in pork belly and is called &quot;eight&quot; because they literally serve you 8 different styles of pork belly in one of their set (a) combos (original, curry, miso, red pepper, herb, garlic, etc....) our favorite flavors were the miso and red pepper. The combo feeds 2-3 people (so come on an empty stomach!) We also had the beef brisket and that tasted flavorful and amazing as well. The quality of the meat is superb and everything tasted very clean. Comes with the usual ban Chan dishes which also includes radish paper (an absolute must for me)! They also make kimchi fried rice with cheese on top at the very end! Service was great as the servers literally do everything for you including cooking and cutting the meats. I&apos;ll definitely be back if I&apos;m in the mood for pork belly!

Tip:
- the utensils are in the drawer or the table"
4,"If you love pork belly, this is heaven!!! Their brisket and short rib meats were also good, but their pork belly was the best. Their pork belly definitely beats out pork belly I&apos;ve had at other Korean BBQ restaurants. 

The service here is great. They help you cook the meats and keep refilling whatever banchan you need. Their tofu soup was delicious!! 

Also love the ventilation in this place. It doesn&apos;t get smoky and leave you smelling like BBQ, which is usually what happens when I go to other Korean BBQ places. I don&apos;t mind smelling like delicious Korean BBQ, but it&apos;s nice to not worry about the smell it if you&apos;re going out afterward."
5,"Hog Heaven! No, not the Harley Davidson kind. I&apos;m talking marinated pork with a twist! There was so much Pork, I almost became a Senator! Had seen this place many times as the crowded entrance always intrigued me. Finally, it became a delicious reality. Especially since they offer alcohol! Soju(s) was the drink of the night. ;)

When you walk in, host/hostess will ask how many in your party. I love that they set up the table with plenty of ban chan, grill plate, and water. So when you sit, you can begin grazing while you look over the menu. Winner winner already! Must admit the menu made me bubble-headed so ordered the easy 8 House Combo variety. It was a huge amount of food. 

It consists of 8 very different marinated flavors:
Wine, Original, Ginseng, Garlic, Herb, Curry, Miso Paste, Red Pepper Paste...whew! What a spread! AND, with your Yelp Check-in, they will give you a free Flaming Hot Cheeto pork belly! This last one was my favorite. All flavors were without doubt, different and delicious. 
Along with your combo, you also receive a seafood soup which boils on your table with a heavenly broth. The aroma permeating is incredible. They also bring rice at the end to mix with the broth making a crispy Kimchi fried rice with cheese! Drooling now! You must look at the photos to get a better picture :p  

Our service was nothing less than amazing. Never had to flag anyone down as they keep coming to your table being attentive but not intrusive. A real plus is that they cook everything for you and cut it all up ready to eat. I&apos;ll do my own chewing thank you. It was so enjoyable and filling that coming back will be in the pork cards soon.

There is plenty of free parking as it sits in a large shopping center. It gets really crowded but moves quickly. Additionally they offer beef selections. 

As always, thank you for reading! =)"
5,"If you like pork belly, come here!! Lots of stuff to love about this place: 

* Got seated pretty quickly for a Friday night around 7 PM
* you can store things in your chair, so your stuff doesn&apos;t get smelly/dirty
* they have a bunch of flavors to choose from. You can get a free hot Cheeto one with a check in!
* everything was so juicy and flavorful. 
* the combo comes with kimchi fried rice &amp; soup 
* they cook everything for you!! 
* this place has a parking lot that actually has enough spots"
5,"If your in the mood for great Korean BBQ you will find some of the best in Los Angeles at Eight.

The meats served here are not fatty, and they are premium quality. It&apos;s nice to have another Korean BBQ that actually cares about the quality that is served.

They also offer a  nice variety if beers by the bottle. I found everything to be fresh on each visit.

The staff is always welcoming, the prices are fair for the serving sizes and everything always tastes fresh.

A few other Korean BBQ places could learn allot from Eight. Excellent every time."
5,"Probably one of my favorite and the best non-AYCE korean BBQ places in K-town LA. If you&apos;re looking for something a bit more upscale and unique and aren&apos;t planning on eating a ton of food, definitely give eight a shot.

Stick with the different types of pork belly although there are other standard fare available (e.g. bulgogi, brisket, etc).  There&apos;s a parking lot and plenty of other businesses in the plaza so this is the perfect spot to catch up with friends, grab some great KBBQ and just hang out!"
4,"I never had tradition Korean BBQ before so I didn&apos;t now what to expect. I am happy I got to experience an authentic Korean restaurant. We got the Pork combination and the pork was very good. 8 different flavors and I didn&apos;t have one bad one!
It came with a very spicy seafood soup. Unfortunately I can&apos;t have anything too spicy so i didn&apos;t get to have that. 

Overall it was a good experience. Get a Hite beer!"
5,"Came to this hole in the wall yesterday for lunch with a friend cause we were wandering around Ktown looking for places to eat. So we decided to try this place. Sooo goood! Much better than back home (we&apos;re visiting from San Jose). It was slow but the servers were super nice and friendly. The guy was sweet, always checking in on us. Lady was super nice too. They help you cook meats on grill plus you get to pick from few combo selections that they have. We tried combo a which included 8 different pork bellies, kimchi fried rice, tofu seafood stew, salad, and side dishes. Tasted very traditional and meats melted in your mouth. 

Best part is that you get to take leftovers home! (I can&apos;t get that deal back home.) 

Definitely coming back if I&apos;m visiting SoCal again."
5,"I 10/10 enjoyed my experience here. Definitely have to take advantage of the check in for a free Hot Cheetos flavor. They top it off with Cheeto crumbs and mozzarella cheese, a perfect combination when you wrap it with rice paper and garlic! 

I personally think the price is reasonable for the amount of food you get. We got Combo A for $62 (8 flavors of pork belly, seafood soup, fried rice, &amp; banchan) and we didn&apos;t finish, considering the fact we were starving. 

I really enjoyed the seafood soup because it paired well with the pork belly. It wasn&apos;t too over bearing and balanced out the greasiness of the pork. Probably my favorite part of the meal!

I didn&apos;t notice til the end of my meal, but you can actually put your belongings INSIDE of your seat so that it doesn&apos;t smell afterwards. So convenient and considerate XD 

Service was good and attentive, but it would be nice if the servers smiled more! 

This is a perfect place I would come with friends after a long week or for a celebration. The servers cook for you so that you can enjoy your time. The vibes were there and I will definitely be back!"
4,"I like this place for the variety of pork belly in a lot of different flavors. However, I feel I can&apos;t taste the differences in the flavors once they&apos;ve been cooked. Only the curry flavored one can be distinctively tasted. Other than that, this place is still awesome and the service is very attentive in cooking the food. The drinks are good too for big parties. I like that you can put your things under your seat by opening the lid too."
5,"Another amazing place that is becoming a go-to spot in K-town... 

Most weekday nights, it&apos;s not a very long wait for a table of 2. On the weekends during prime hours, expect to wait for at least 15 minutes. The parking lot for this whole complex is free and there&apos;s plenty of spots. I haven&apos;t had trouble finding a spot before. 

The service was not great when I first starting coming here last year, but it has dramatically improved recently. The seats are kind of like cans, and the top cushion part comes off so you can put jackets and bags into the seat while you eat. The napkins and utensils are in a drawer on one side of the table, so it&apos;s self-serve. My first time here, no one explained that, and when I asked the waiter, he just opened the drawer and then walked away immediately (- _ -). This most recent time I went, the waiter opened the drawer upon our arrival to the table so I appreciate that little extra gesture because it&apos;s not very self-explanatory that the drawer is there! 

On to the food...  The bonchan is always really good, love that they have the rice paper bonchan. The kimchi (cabbage and sprouts) are immediately on the grill. We have ordered the Flower Pork Belly Combo and the 8 Flavors Pork Belly Combo. 

The Flower Pork Belly Combo has my favorite cut - pork jowl, and I&apos;ve never had it better than at 8 BBQ. The thinly sliced pork belly is soooo good and not a common cut at other kbbq places. The Flower Pork Belly looks really pretty and interesting too. It&apos;s always so fascinating to watch them roll it out. Oh yes, the wait staff do all the grilling for you, and it&apos;s recommended to sit at the seats further from the grill. The fat will be flying! (But it&apos;s kind of nice to get a little bit of the fat in your beer :p) The 8 Flavors combo was a fun experience, but it was so much pork belly. With the other combos, you get more variety in textures and cuts. But I&apos;d say my favorite flavors of the 8 kinds were red wine, curry, and garlic. It was kind of fun to guess which one you were eating. And the wait staff grill it very artfully in rows on the grill. Pretty neat to watch. 

Meal closing is quite a process as well! As part of the combo sets, you get a whole stew boiling on the other side of your grill. As you finish it, the wait staff will use the bit left at the bottom and the kimchi and sprouts that have been on the grill this whole time to make cheesy kimchi rice. It&apos;s so rich, and a great leftover item to bring home. Also, the kimchi and sprouts are really delicious after being on the grill for so long, make sure you try some of that! And if you consumed too much of the grilled kimchi or sprouts, they bring out more to supplement the kimchi rice, so don&apos;t feel like you have to conserve them for the end.

For the atmosphere, it&apos;s a typical kbbq place, somewhat loud, got your giant screen tv&apos;s playing kpop music videos. But tables are pretty well spaced out. It feels clean enough despite all the fat and sticky elements that usually come with kbbq places. Make use of those seat storage spaces! The fat really does fly everywhere. 

Overall, delicious restaurant, reliable quality, and generous portions. Pork FTW!"
5,"If you love pork, you definitely need to come to Eight. You can have EIGHT types of marinated pork on the grill. And all of them are delicious! I will say since that option has so much pork, your group should definitely order another type of meat or veggie in order to balance it out for your taste buds -- my group realized this later in our meal!"
5,"I never thought pork belly could taste so good! 

Yea, I&apos;ve had pork belly at home. You know the ones you buy frozen at the korean store and then cook on your portable stove at home? 

But this...this is a different caliber of pork belly! 
We got their combo A with the 8 different flavors of pork. I loved getting to try the different flavors! And the portions are huge! 

Would definitely recommend to anyone wanting some quality Korean BBQ!"
3,"2 out of 3 of us prefer regular kbbq. One of three of us really liked this place. We were 3 girls ordering combo A. The first 5 were delicious. The last 4 were too strong for me. The one I liked the least was the curry one. The hot cheetos one was ok also. I think I was expecting more crunch but the cheetos just melts together onto the pork belly. Not sure how to make, or when to eat the seafood soup. I think we waited too long because the broth had boiled away and the shrimp was way overcooked. The shrimp was raw one minute, then after eating for a while, it was overdone and the broth was gone! Pay attention to your soup! My friend enjoyed sitting in front of the drawer and giving us the utensils and napkins that we needed. Overall, a fun, tasty place, but I wouldn&apos;t be rushing back anytime soon. I&apos;m missing all the other meats."
