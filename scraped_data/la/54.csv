5,"After finding Hoy-Ka on Yelp and taking my chances, I was NOT disappointed with their food. Ever since my first order here, I&apos;ve just been coming back because the food here tastes like comfort food. When you get here though there is a parking lot behind their storefront although it&apos;s shared with a drive-thru for Arby&apos;s and other restaurants adjacent to it so it can get crowded sometimes. 

For my order I always either get the massaman curry, spicy chicken fried rice, cream cheese wontons, hoy-ka soup noodle, or the shrimp fried rice. And ALL were exquisite and full of flavor. I know this place is already quite popular but I can see why and I will continue to recommend this place for Thai food lovers like me! 

If you&apos;re looking to eat out, they don&apos;t do a service where they come out and tend to you but you can order your food to-go and still eat out on their few tables outside. You can also ask for a cup of water and they kindly give it to you!"
5,"Crispy pork. Enough said.

Honestly this place has been great for both dine-in (pre-COVID 19) and takeout. The food is always tasty. I&apos;ve gotten the pad Thai, pad see ew, and egg rolls! All amazing. Service is always excellent.

My default Thai go to"
5,"Truly the best Thai food I have ever had. Came here on a Friday night and called ahead of time to place our order. Although we were told our food would be ready in 20 minutes, it was closer to 10, which is always a plus! There is limited parking behind the restaurant, but we were lucky to grab a spot. Also great to see that they are following strict social distancing protocols and limiting capacity inside the restaurant.

We ordered two pad see ews, one with chicken and one with tofu. The first thing we noticed is how fresh and hot the dishes were - we decided not to wait and ate right away in the car! The flavor of the pad see ew was addicting and the chicken was cooked perfectly - not too dry. Portions here are also quite sizable, for the price it is absolutely worth it. Can&apos;t wait to come back soon!"
5,"My boyfriend and I were scouring Yelp for about 45 minutes in an attempt to find a new restaurant to try in LA. We stumbled across Hoy-Ka Thai Restaurant and boy did it surpass our expectations!

Their menu is so vast and everything sounded delicious, so we decided to take a look at their Yelp reviews to see what others recommended. I ended up going with the Jade Noodles and my boyfriend tried out the Tom Kha soup. Both were so tasty!

Jade Noodles: I honestly wasn&apos;t expecting this dish to be so full of flavor! It was sweet, savory, and spicy! The sauce was amazing and the soup (which I asked for on the side) that they provided was also so nice and comforting to sip on while devouring my noodles. I also loved the duck, crispy pork, and BBQ pork that was in the dish!

Tom Kha: The flavor of the broth was so rich and deep! There was a perfect balance of tangy and spiciness! 

Overall, I would definitely recommend both dishes!! I can&apos;t wait to come back here again and try out their dishes!"
4,"Pretty good Thai food. Food is slightly sweet but not as much as most Americanized Thai restaurants. I knew I can only handle a small dose of spicy, so I only ordered mild, but most dishes still packs a bit more heat than I would like. 

The sneaky pork was my favorite! Really well marinaded and tender pork pieces along with nicely steamed Chinese broccoli. I was surprised that the broccoli wasn&apos;t tough and old. This will be a dish that I always order in the future! Larb and papaya salad are tangy so it helped offset a lot of the heat, and the fried pork bits are so good! I did not mind a bit of heat along with all that fattiness in my mouth. Drunken noodle was pretty standard, and we were also happy with massaman curry.

I&apos;ll need to keep in mind that I should order more non-spicy dishes since their mild was even too much for me, but I&apos;ll definitely come back!"
5,"So so so good! Authentic, delicious and fresh. Friendly staff too! Parang curry, papaya salad and pad se ew!!!! You can&apos;t go wrong. Love this place"
5,"I got the drunken noodles, pad Thai, and the crispy pork dish. Hands down best most delicious Thai food I&apos;ve had. Definitely recommend trying all 3 dishes but my favorite was the crispy pork and drunken noodles."
5,"Solid place for Thai food when you&apos;re in this area! Everything was flavorful and delicious, and did I mention...reasonably priced?  I believe most dishes were about $8-10.  Parking in the lot in back was also helpful.

Favorites of the bunch included the papaya salad, hoy ka noodle, and the crispy pork/chinese broccoli.  I was surprised the crispy pork stayed crunchy even with the sauce poured over it.

We also got the chicken satay as an appetizer and it was super moist/tender! Definitely would recommend this as well.

Service was also extremely friendly and our waters were refilled promptly.  Overall, I would definitely check it out again when I&apos;m in the area!"
4,"- Post &amp; Pre CoVid-19 Review -

CoVid-19:
They take safety seriously. Gloves, Mask, Blocked tables, stapled bag, and social distancing. This is one of the reasons why I still go here during times like these. 

A money saving tip:
For pickup and delivery, think about comparing the dish price with competing apps to see if any are priced differently. In this case, ordering from Postmates or Caviar is cheaper than directly ordering from Yelp as for some reason they pad $2 more per dish on top of competitor price. 

Now for the food:
__________________________________________________

This is my go-to Thai spot whenever I&apos;m craving for Thai.

And yes, I know there&apos;s plenty more out there, and yes, there are better options out there (small mom and pop shops are the best). But, I keep coming back here for the same reasons: it&apos;s reliable, great service, great ambiance, and nearby!

Reliable Go-Tos
- Pad See Ew
- Pad Thai 
- Papaya Salad (If you never had it, flavor profile: Zesty, Fresh, Sweet. Try it!)

Uniquely Amazing
- Roasted Duck Red Curry [Highly Recommended, Best Thai Curry, nothing bizarre, extremely flavorful.]
- Hoy Ka Noodle Soup [Great on a sick day, zesty, clear soup, delicious]
- Boat Noodle [Extreme Flavor, it&apos;s zesty, a dark soup profile]

Also, Thai Iced Tea is extremely sweet but heck water it down and you basically get two glasses of Thai Iced Tea haha.

Anyways, the service is always wonderful. The guy who works at night waitering typically is extremely humble and courteous. I always had my drinks filled and we were always checked up regularly. 

Overall if you want to have a reliable and great experience hanging out with friends on a work night or looking for a casual date spot, this place is the place to go."
4,"We decided to try this place after having an unimpressive experience at another Thai restaurant. We ordered through Postmates for our meal and my girlfriend and I were glad to see no ill-prepared related disorders for our meal. 5/5 on packaging to ensure it makes it to customers safe and sound. We ordered the Tom Kha and Pad Thai. Both came with exceptional portion sizes perfect for four people to be honest. For ordering the Tom Kha, it was nice to see that we were able to select a spice level. We ordered it &quot;hot&quot; and it was perfect--not too spicy, not too lackluster. And flavor was on point. The only reason this review gets 4 stars is because the Pad Thai&apos;s flavor was somewhat lacking. Perhaps the noodles had dried out by the time it got to us but we will be back to give it another chance."
5,"Wow. Just wow. If you&apos;re wondering whether to trust the reviews for this place and try it, DO IT. I promise you won&apos;t be disappointed. Nothing we had wasn&apos;t delicious.

We happened to order the hoy-ka soup with thin rice noodles, green curry chicken, eggplant lovers beef, pad see eiw, and the panang curry shrimp. It was all fantastic but the three things that I can&apos;t stop thinking about are (in this order): 1) hoy-ka soup (phenomenal on a cold night); 2) panang curry shrimp; and 3) green curry chicken. I have wanted to order from there every night since, but my husband has been making me eat at home. Soon, though, very soon."
5,Full stars for incredible service! Hoy-Ka goes above and beyond to make sure you enjoy their food. I&apos;d been going here since I first moved to LA 4 years ago and today when I had some concerns about the food they went out of their way to make it right. You don&apos;t see this often and they will have my loyalty!!! I&apos;ll definitely share pictures next time I&apos;m back.
3,I ordered green curry + pad see eiw noodles. Green curry was good but pad see eiw had this burnt taste &amp; smell to it.. some parts was burnt. I couldn&apos;t finish it but it wasn&apos;t so bad after all. It was little disappointing but I would try something different next time.
5,"So wanted something new in Hollywood and have been complaining about the lack of quality restaurants. Searched for something to eat and found this spot. I read the reviews like I usually do and found that they are consistently saying this is the top 1 or 2 best Thai in LA. 

I can say that the Jade noodle with the soup on the side was prob one of the best soups I&apos;ve ever had. The soup itself came a little cold but that&apos;s expected with delivery. other than that this place is delicious and so delicious that I will be ordering it again today! Going for their Tom Kha today!

Thank you!"
5,"My favorite Thai place. My boyfriend and I always come here for when we want thai. It&apos;s the best go to and it&apos;s always delicious! We&apos;ve gotten the pad see ew, green curry, Tom kha soup, pineapple fried rice and the cream cheese wontons. 

The pad see ew is our favorite for sure. You can really taste the pan fry flavor. Same with the pineapple fried rice."
4,"It&apos;s an interesting space- a bar and a restaurant all very closely put together so there&apos;s not a lot of walking space. Parking is very limited.

Food did take some time to come out but I wasn&apos;t that hungry and had ordered the Sneaky Pork appetizer. Now I was skeptical- why is it &quot;sneaky&quot;? The answer is that the SPICE is sneaky. You&apos;re fine chewing it but when you once you swallow your bite, the heat erupts from the spicy oil coating your throat. 

Texture of the pork and vegetables were great though; and I must say the vegetables hold onto that spicy oil better than the pork so it was even hotter to eat the vegetables. I had to order an extra bowl of rice just to make it less spicy and give me more food. Overall it was pretty good if you like spicy. Not quite numbing like szechuan/sichuan spice but close."
4,"I&apos;ve been here a couple times and this is one of the rare instances of a place in LA that I&apos;ve double dipped. 

First time was about a year ago and I followed the crispy pork larb suggestion from the waiter as well as a couple of appetizers. 

This time I asked for an under appreciated menu item and the host promised me that their curries were made to order! I pegged the Roasted Duck Red Curry and day chillin&apos; my half-sweet Thai Ice tea at the bar. 

Between my two experiences, I walked away feeling like the food here is just too sweet for my tastes. Both menu highlights and back 9 are all not quite just right for lovers of savory. 

The staff are outstanding and welcoming and the place looks hip."
2,"Wow this place had great reviews .... But I think they&apos;re all friends of the owner. The &quot;famous pineapple rice&quot; had some sort of curry base which my friend and I found utterly terrible, and the other &apos;popular dish&apos; the beef and broccoli was tough, hard, and the portion size was laughably and insultingly tiny for the price they charge. And chicken pad Thai was extremely underwhelming."
3,"Beef pad see eiw:
I did not like this. I had to cover it in sambal sauce to make it more appetizing. It&apos;s has a very strong one note fishy soy flavor. 

Thai iced tea:
Pretty good! Nothin amazing but nothing bad either. Worth it. 

Hot beef drunken noodles:
Oh boy. This was really really good! A nice level of spice and all the vegetables and basil really make this dish amazing."
5,"If you get anything out of this review, it&apos;s to order the Jade Noodles! I ordered via phone and picked up the Pad Thai, Pineapple Fried Rice, and Jade Noodles. The pad thai was incredibly flavorful and loaded up with plenty of shrimp and chicken. The pineapple fried rice could have been better as chicken was drier than I preferred. Okay, but the real star of the show was the Jade Noodle dish (dry, without broth). It comes with thin green noodles, crushed peanuts on top, duck, lamb, and crispy pork belly all of which are sooooo tasty. Not to mention, they pack their containers with food so it&apos;s definitely a good value! Highly recommend Hoy-Ka there&apos;s a reason all the reviews are so positive."
