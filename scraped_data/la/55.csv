5,"Wow!!! Sad I didn&apos;t find this place earlier. 

I only tried the Peruvian side of the menu, but am excited to try more. The food was very decently priced and flavorful. I ordered the lomo saltado, chaufa and the bistec a la pobre. 

My favorite was the lomo just because I tend to like that dish in general. However, I did like the plantain with the steak in the bistec a la pobre and the chaufa was good to have on the side with the other dishes. I would definitely order all three of these dishes again.

Also, as a caveat, I had all the food delivered and it was delicious, so I&apos;m sure it would be even better if I went there and got take-out or in a different world ate in. Look forward to trying more dishes soon."
5,"Last year (before covid was a thing) I went to Peru and I ate ceviche every day...I thought I&apos;d get sick of it, but never did. I ate lomo saltados almost every other day  and I loved it. While I had tried Peruvian places in la before, it just wasn&apos;t the same. Until I came here! 

I came on a whim after endlessly searching through Yelp for takeout. I&apos;m so happy I did because the ceviche tasted just like Peru! I couldn&apos;t believe it. For a split second it felt like I was back in Peru and not dealing with covid. Thank you so much!

I loved the ceviche (hands down best ceviche in la for sure!), lomo saltado and Tallarin! Can&apos;t wait to try more and the staff is just the nicest people ever. Thank you!"
5,"Two words:  lomo saltado.  

Do yourself a favor and head a half mile out of your way to support these guys working hard and serving deliciously tangy meals for about $14.

I live in South Park, and finding Mex Peru Gypsy on one of those delivery apps that refuse to accept their drivers are employees was one of the silver linings of this COVID-19 mess we are in.

They are fast (I can call in my order, and by the time I can get to my car and head over, it&apos;s pretty much ready for me).  Their food is delicious (I&apos;ve worked my way through the Peruvian side of the menu; lomo saltado is automatic, and I&apos;ll rotate through chaufa, tacos, ceviche, or whatever else jumps out at me for the second meal add to rationalize the trip).  

And the owner is a sweetheart.  The one time I had to wait any length of time, he popped out of the restaurant to keep me company like the natural chatterbox he so clearly is.  Support your local businesses, folks.  Mex Peru Gipsy has been around for decades; they know what they are doing."
5,"My boyfriend and I spontaneously picked this spot, not knowing what to expect. We ordered the lomo saltado and fish tacos, which were BOMB (very flavorful). The green salsa complimented the lomo saltado very well, with a slight kick to it!

The service was also great! I believe we met the owner, who was extremely sweet and made us want to return whenever we&apos;re in LA again.

Def recommend!"
4,"Came to this small hole-in-the-wall in Fashion District close to closing time on a Monday night. We ordered the tallarin saltado and shrimp chaufa. The food was a bit on the saltier side but overall enjoyable. It was also prepared quickly and they even gave us complimentary cookies. 

The only issue I had was that they packaged our (super!) hot food in styrofoam containers which melted and distorted the styrofoam. Would appreciate if they placed the food over foil or some other material."
5,"The green spaghetti-steak dish (Tallar√≠n Verde) was one of the tangiest dish I&apos;ve had in LA in a long time! A must have. The Maracuya drink is a magic potion of a drink that leaves you wanting for more. 

Most important of all, the manager or attendant there was extremely knowledgeable and polite. Can&apos;t find that hospitality nowadays. 

Going back next week!"
5,"La Comida mas ricaaaaa, staff is amazing super nice! They treated me as if they knew me Definitely will  be returning."
5,"I&apos;m Peruvian and I haven&apos;t had lomo saltado this good since I was back home. Absolutely insane. The ceviche, and a Rox chaufa was incredible good. The people working there are awesome and it just makes this the perfect pervian spot."
5,Supper delicious pollo de chaufa  y&apos;all need to come here! Everything just perfect for won&apos;t regret it!
5,"Since I was in downtown early in the morning, I yelped to look for a good spot to eat and found this gem. There were so many items on the menu I wanted to try but I ended up getting the lomo saltado and may I say it is delicious and the customer service was on point. It&apos;s a small spot with parking right out front on the street. Felipe was my chef and he was very attentive to my needs and Lalo made good suggestions on the foods I should try next. I&apos;ll be coming back again for sure. Thank you mex Peru"
2,"Bottom line: maybe an off-day , or maybe perhaps the only lomo saltado I really like would be Mario&apos;s, but the price is a little bit of a stretch when taking portion size into consideration. Quality was not on par with Mario&apos;s.


The lomo saltado was pan fried, and they used way, way too much oil which killed the taste. Steak was also skillet fried, and tasted greasy as it was oily and slimy. Mario&apos;s uses a thicker cut, and you can taste the grill from the criss marks. Couldn&apos;t say the same about this one. 


Portion size was considerably lower than Mario&apos;s, but the same price.

The excess oil just killed my taste buds. Probably wouldn&apos;t come back here in the foreseeable future as I&apos;d just go to Mario&apos;s if I ever want Peruvian food again."
5,First time here fell in love with the food and the staff if your ever in town stop by and treat yourself
4,"Food was pretty good. It wasn&apos;t as amazing as I expected seeing all the 5 star reviews. The portion size for the amount charged is a little smaller than other restaurants. There aren&apos;t but a handful of Peruvian restaurants in LA. Rika&apos;s is still the number one spot in my view with this spot coming in at a solid second. 

I ordered the Lomo Saltado and the flavors were what you&apos;d expect with a savory to salty mixture of veggies, beef, spices, and oil soaked up in fries. The meat was just slightly tough which is either cooked too long or lower quality beef. 

If you&apos;re in this area then this is a good spot to stop by. Just keep your expectations lower than a 5-star spot and maybe you&apos;ll leave happier in the end. :-)"
5,Great food made to order. Good food like my grandma made it fresh out her kitchen. I had the shrimp cocktail was delicious. And tacos were bomb
5,love the food here super delicious! nice staff also!
1,"My girlfriend and I were not planning on going to this spot but the place we wanted to go to (Tee&apos;s Cafe) was closed. I wasn&apos;t really feeling anything on the menu but my girlfriend ordered the menudo. The staff member who took are order recommended a dish that was similar to Trosos de res en salsa verde but I can&apos;t remember if that&apos;s exactly what he called it. I was hungry and just said alright, I&apos;ll take that since it was ready. We get the food and the portion is the size of a paper plate. Okay? This can&apos;t be more than $8 I thought. It was $14.50 for a paper plate with 8 bite sized pieces of meat (I&apos;m not kidding, there was only 8 pieces of meat). My girlfriend didn&apos;t like the menudo either, saying it was sorta bland. The kicker is her order definitely came with more food and meat and cost less than mine. The horchata was pretty bland as well and my cup was filled with ice. To top off the evening, there was another group that was leaving while we were finishing our meal and they sprayed Lysol over themselves, with us downwind of them...Would definitely not come back here. I wish I had gotten some pictures for this review but oh well."
5,Wowwww for sure did not think this place would live up to the stars. Would never have eaten there given the neighborhood/ location BUT thanks goodness we did. Incredible. The ceviche is fantastic
5,I&apos;m surprised I have never been to this place. This is by far my favorite Peruvian restaurant in downtown-- being there for more than 30 years it shows why they&apos;ll have many more years to come. Family-owned business and the owner has a lot of charm and is very humble. I definitely family and personal experience.
5,"This hole in wall delivered some unexpected flavor! I can say, without a doubt, this was one of the best tasting Peruvian ceviches I have ever had. I also got the lomo saltado that also amazed me. I highly recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area. The workers were soo attentive and caring, felt like I was eating at a family members house. They were so grateful we decided to eat at this location with hundreds of other possibilities in LA. Definitely check this place out. You won&apos;t regret it!"
5,"Amazing food! Hands down, best Peruvian food I have ever had. Lomo Saltado was delicious. 
The owner provided great customer service and was so helpful!"
