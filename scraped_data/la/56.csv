4,"I went to this place at 5pm-ish last Saturday. The waiting was lined up already and only one part of the restaurant was operating. I waited for about 30mins and they finally opened up the other half. 
This was my first time after covid-19, the price went up. This was expected as most of restaurants increased the price due to covid. Before shut-down, the cheapest option was under 20 but now their lowest option is $25.99

- the cheapest menu doesn&apos;t really have many beef options, mostly pork. If you are a big fan of samgyupsal(pork belly), this option might be perfect for you
- normally sesfood is not that good in any AYCE kbbq, but i come here for Squid and spicy baby octopus!!! I highly recommend these two
- their pancake is pretty good!
- no cold noodles  or soy bean paste soup  :(
- parking is valet, need $2.50 cash

I have been craving their squid so much i enjoyed it but sad to see price increased and i felt like not much to eat with option A. I might try option B or C next time."
5,"I dined here during February 2021 once restaurants opened up again. This place does not take reservations and is first-come, first-serve only. They have valet parking in the back of the restaurant for $2.50. Be aware that the lot is pretty small. There is also street/neighborhood parking around. For some reason the hours on their yelp page isn&apos;t updated, so I would recommend calling them to make sure they&apos;re open. It&apos;s AYCE and you cook your own meat. 

We came on a Friday night and it was super busy and packed. They had a tent outside and another opened spaced area for dining. The wait was around an hour before we got seated. The tables were pretty spaced well from each other. We sat in the non-tented area - I wish there were dividers between the tables here (the tents did). By the time we were seated, our side dishes and utensils were already prepped on our table. Side dishes include salad, kimchi, potato salad, radish, seaweed salad, bean sprouts, and rice paper. These are good, though I wish they had radish paper here. We ordered from the option A menu for $25.99, for a total of 30 items to choose from. We ordered steamed egg, soft tofu stew, pancake, beef brisket, seasoned beef rib meat, marinated pork belly, miso pork belly, thinly sliced pork belly, spicy baby octopus, and large intestine. TIP: order your meat in small portions so you can try more items! ;-) My personal favorite has to be the marinated pork belly. I really loved the marinade, it was so delicious! Everything was great, though I was slightly disappointed by the miso pork belly. It was a bit too salty for my taste. The thinly sliced pork belly was also a bit too fatty. I love that this place offers pancake in their AYCE menu. It takes around 10-20 min for it to cook so make sure to order this early on. It was a scallion pancake and it was pretty good and crispy. 

The service was good! It wasn&apos;t as difficult to call our waiters compared to other kbbq places and we got our orders promptly. For its price and worth, this is a solid kbbq restaurant I and definitely will come back here for more."
5,"Outdoor seating available during pandemic. We were seated in the corner and sufficiently distance from the other tables. 
I wanted to get kbbq specifically with beef tongue and road to seoul delivered! Came around 545 pm on Friday and waited a few minutes for them to se up the table prior to being seated. Our server was really nice and the other servers even came by to make sure we ordered already so service was actually really good. Ordered about 3 rounds of meat between my bf and I and I&apos;m glad on the last round they did not give full portions or else we&apos;d have leftovers (extra charge!). Quality of meat was still good. The banchan dishes were limited though but it&apos;s ok. 
There was a parking lot on the back side and you can walk in."
5,"I came here back in November 2020 for outdoor dining and again last Sunday (3/7/2021). Since then they&apos;ve expanded their outdoor dining. Back in November, I had to wait over 2 hours to get a table when I arrived at 7PM. This place is super busy. This time I was smart and arrived at 6PM before the dinner rush. We were seated in about 20 minutes. They had a huge uncovered section that they did not seat customers, probably because there was a slight chance it would rain. Then we saw a few staff members arrive for their shift and that section opened. 

All the food here is so good. The quality of the meat is extremely good for AYCE. All the beef was well marbled and really tender. You can&apos;t get the same quality in NorCal for $38. Sure, you can pay a la carte at Bay Area restaurants to get superior meat, but you&apos;re paying an arm and a leg. The quality at Road to Seoul is good without cheating out on quality. 

I always go with Option C because that&apos;s the only option with beef short ribs. I prefer the unseasoned short ribs over the marinaded short ribs. It&apos;s a must try. I love the ribeye with just a little salt. Also get the whole squid and brisket is always a must for any KBBQ meal. The miso flavor was my favorite for pork belly. 

Every customer gets a little seasoning salt, and sesame oil, but we finished ours really quick and asked the server more and they brought out a huge bowl of finishing salt and a squeeze bottle of sesame oil. All our meat orders and alcohol came out quickly. Service was amazing!  Definitely coming back every time I&apos;m in SoCal!"
1,"This place was pretty bad
First we called ahead we were down the street in the parking garage and the person on the phone said there was no wait but then there was a 30 min wait line i asked saying there was no wait i literally just called an one of the people work said oh thats not our fault just go outside and wait if you want to . Then during our meal the waiters kept forgetting our table and would only bring one plate for our group of 3. Not gonna lie we are big guys who could eat but they took 45-50 mins of 2hr eat time not bringing food we kept asking and they would say oh sorry i forgot. Then the part that was the worst was at the end they told us last call but not the 4 other groups around us that were seated before us. Then they didn&apos;t even bring us our orders for the call and told us &quot;sorry this is the best we can do&quot; they were serving everyone else correctly but our group they kept &quot;forgetting &quot; us because we were bigger people. Felt like we were discriminated against. 
Wouldn&apos;t recommend this place"
5,"Loooooooove the food ...... great customer service !!!!
It was a date night with my husband .... he enjoyed the food very much!"
4,"I love Road To Seoul! The parking here is iffy though. You can try parking on the street or in the neighborhood behind. However if you really can&apos;t find parking they have valet parking for 2.50 cash only though. They must take the cars somewhere else because the lot that they have is super small.

I usually do the cheapest ayce a menu. I love the bugolgi here and surprisingly the chicken. If they come around offering you a pancake, be sure to try it. It&apos;s just so yummy! Also recommend the egg pot. Most nights I&apos;ve been here, they have pretty good service considering they are usually pretty busy. I try not to push the button for service, but sometimes it&apos;s necessary.

They also usually have some sort of sport on tv. If it&apos;s your birthday be prepared for some strobe light birthday song action haha."
4,"Expect a long wait, expect it to be loud, expect it to be crowded, expect it to get dark when they sing happy birthday and you won&apos;t have any surprises when you come here to eat.

Definitely more of a club-like kbbq spot. It&apos;s weird, but it works. Don&apos;t come here if you want a quiet dinner and want to talk to the person/people you come with - you&apos;ll have to yell or wait for the music to turn down every now and then.

The food was really good. We ordered brisket, bugolgi, both soups, octopus and some other meats. 4/5

We even ordered a crap ton of beer and soju. They were short of beer glasses that when we eventually did get more, the glasses were warm.

Service actually wasn&apos;t too bad. I was expecting to have to wave down a server or get attitude (LOL) but everything was good! 5/5

Parking..... good luck hahaha valet if you&apos;re cool with someone taking your car into small valet lots"
2,Poor service. The food wasn&apos;t worth the wait. The meat was frozen when it was sent out to us. Never have seen that at any other KBBQ. Don&apos;t recommend
1,"Waited over 2 hours for cold outdoor seating, no cover, and horrible service. I won&apos;t be back."
4,"PRE-COVID 19

This was my last dining out before COVID-19 shut down all of LA&apos;s restaurant for dining. It was delicious!!!! Rice paper= game changer! Their spicy tofu soup was fine as well. Don&apos;t care too much for the pork belly as it&apos;s always too thick for me - I prefer thin ones I can get at the grocery store. All the other meats were tasty! I recommend!!!"
5,"Its open for takeout  I called to ask and they said yes, so I ordered and when I got there, my food was ready to go in a very fancy container. It was super delicious and had a lot of food for the price. Not going back to bulgogi hutt after this lol"
5,"Took 50 minutes to get seated, which they did tell us and we understood. But it was well worth it. Easily the best Korean barbecue I&apos;ve ever had, and we came back the next night. Spicy Pork Belly, Pork Neck were amazing. Can&apos;t wait to come back. Customer service was great. 6/5 if I could."
5,"Before Covid-19 Pandemic Situation.

Friendly, clean, courteous, PLENTY to choose from, great location, not far from ABC Mall, right in Korea Town. Meat and seafood is fresh! The dessert was great. The soft tofu stew was like no other. We highly recommend this location."
5,"I&apos;ve been very hesitant to dine-in at any restaurants due to COVID-19. This was my first dine-in experience during this whole pandemic and I felt safe while doing so. They have moved right outside of their building and are using their parking as an outdoor dining area. You can still park in the back parking lot if you&apos;re worried about parking. They check everyone&apos;s temperature before being seated. The utensils are pre-packaged. The servers are wearing masks and gloves the whole time. Tables were 6 feet apart and if they weren&apos;t, they have plexi glass between the tables. The food/meat quality is still the same, maybe even better (I might be biased as I totally missed having KBBQ). I would definitely recommend coming here. Like I said, I felt safe and the restaurant is taking all the necessary pre-cautions."
4,"A great spot for kbbq in the city and my first kbbq here actually. The pricing is definitely reasonable for an AYCE bbq place, and we got Option A which was $26 per person. The meat was yummy and I would definitely come back!"
5,"Road to Seoul, thank you. The food was delicious! I miss sitting down and eating Korean bbq. Everything hit the spot. Their parking is located in the back. They are doing their absolute best at keeping everyone safe while dining in. The food was amazing! The staff was amazing! We had a great time! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you."
5,"We love this spot for outdoor Korean BBQ it&apos;s delicious and great quality meat with tons of options!
They are handling the COVID-19 situation very well and I highly recommend."
5,"I was craving Korean BBQ and found that Road to Seoul was open for outdoor dining! The service was very attentive and friendly. Besides the fact that the grill is a portable grill, everything else is the same! I have no complaints regarding their selection of meats."
5,"The food was great and awesome service, definitely going back. Their bulgogi beef is super delicious. I highly recommend this Korean bbq restaurant"
