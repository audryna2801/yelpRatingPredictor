5,"One of the places we&apos;ve been frequenting for takeout during Covid.

I have to say, the noodles are on point.  For the kalguksu newbie, it literally means knife-noodles because the noodles are hand cut with a knife.  As such, the noodles are all different sizes and I love that.

The dough is made with flour and water, kneaded and given time so that it melds to become perfectly bouncy and chewy.  I ordered clam kalguksu last time and the noodles had the perfect bite to them and the broth was so comforting, I have to give it 5 stars.

I also tried my niece&apos;s spicy seafood kalguksu and it was delicious as well.  

The portions are generous and I was stuffed.  I&apos;m happy to report that this place has changed my mind for the better.  

On the side, if anyone makes it out to Korea, there is a kalguksu alley in Namdaemun you have to try.  All the restaurants in the alley serve kalguksu and it is so good.  Until I can make it back there, at least I have Hangari Kalguksu for my knife-noodle fix.  I&apos;ll take it!"
5,"Stopped by for a weekday dinner and got seated pretty quickly. They offer outdoor seating and all the tables have a plastic divider between them. 

We ordered the steamed mandu, seafood kalguksu, and bossam. One of my fav things about this place is the barley rice that comes as a small appetizer. It&apos;s the perfect little portion with a nice touch of sesame oil. I find their homemade young radish kimchi to be the best combo with it!

The mandu and kalguksu are my go-to items and are consistently good (this time was no exception)! Their homemade mandu has a generous amount of meat filling. Kalguksu noodles are hand cut - thick, chewy texture that goes really well with the hearty seafood broth. This was my first time getting bossam and it was our favorite dish! The pork belly wasn&apos;t too fatty but still super tender and flavorful. The accompaniments (spicy radish salad, garlic, jalape√±o, shrimp sauce, and pickled cabbage) were good too but I found their radish salad to be a tad sweet. The medium size is quite large and could probably feed more than 2 people. 

Overall, would highly recommend this place for all of the above items, especially bossam!"
5,"Decided to try this restaurant for my first time. Outside seating with social distanced table because of COVID. Ordered the Hot stone bibimbap(combination dish), Chicken Kalguksu(soup), and Busan Milmyeon(cold noodle).

 The bibimbap comes in a hot stone pot that gives the rice a nice crunchy texture. All the topping goes hand to hand with a lot of flavor. 

The chicken kalguksul broth was rich and creamy. The chicken was really tender. My favorite one! 

The Busan Milmyeon had one of the best buckwheat noodle texture that I&apos;ve had. This dish was really refreshing.

I&apos;ll be back soon to try their bossam!"
5,"I freaking love hangari! My favorite is the chicken kalgaksu  my friends love the seafood soup! 

They&apos;re both delicious and have their amazing homemade noodles in it. 

I also regularly order the bibimbap. I love how they give you barley tea and barley along with the sides. Their kimchi is ok but our favorite is the kimchi radish. I don&apos;t know why that one tastes so much better ."
4,"Simple, cheap, and filling! The portion size is gigantic and it&apos;s definitely enough for you to get full, but at the same time it isn&apos;t expensive too! I went for dinner and ordered spicy seafood noodle soup~ total was only around $16-19. 
The soup broth is delicious and it makes me want to drink one spoon after another. The noodle is knife cut noodle so it&apos;s super chewy. There&apos;s plenty of seafood in the bowl including clams, crab, shrimp, and mussel with some zucchini and pumpkin?squash? 
Overall I recommend it especially when you&apos;re just looking for something simple, not too heavy, and warm! 
Side note: there&apos;s three side dishes that they provide. The kimchi is fresh with a hint of sweetness (loved it) and the radish is also pretty good and crunchy. Wish there were more side dishes tho!"
5,"If you are looking for the best chicken kalguksu look no further! This is the spot!

Their chicken kalguksu is so flavorful and comforting! I also really enjoy their bossam. I always stop by here when I am in Korea town!"
4,"Finally had some time to try the very well-known kalguksu and we did it most properly - by popping opening our containers in our car in the parking lot!

Our spicy seafood kalguksu was quite tasty - thick, lightly chewy noodles in a thick, spicy broth topped with a good mix of crab, shrimp, mussels &amp; clams.  For the price, I&apos;d say the portion was a bit on the smallish side.  The unfortunate downside (through no fault of the resto at all) was that the shellfish was very difficult to eat in-car, so def something to be aware of.

We paired the noodles with the steamed dumplings that turned out to be nicely seasoned with pillowy soft skins.  Again, pricy at $15 for just 8 of these.

The flavors and textures were absolutely there, they just didn&apos;t quite blow me away enough to justify the cost."
3,"Ordered seafood soup with the hand cut noodle and a side of barley rice to go. I&apos;ll start with saying the broth and noodles were delicious! Next time I&apos;ll only order the plain or chicken because my seafood was very overcooked- mushy crab, chewy shrimp and the clams were super gritty. Was a bummer because I spent $21 on it. Barley rice was  reminiscent of oatmeal. I&apos;d definitely come back tho, there&apos;s so many other things that I&apos;d likes to try on the menu."
5,"I have yet to see Hangari not busy!! They probably have about 10 tables outside, but we still had to wait a good amount to get lunch over the weekend. I felt pretty safe eating here since each table is sectioned off with dividers, but there were still a good amount of people here. 

The food came out pretty promptly, and the service was still pretty on-point, despite the hectic nature of outdoor dining with a bunch of plastic dividers haha.

I tried the Kimchi Kalguksu and we got the Bossam as well. The Bossam was SO tasty, and it really hit the spot. I actually prefer the non-spicy Kalguksu options here--the plain and the Chicken are my go-to. The spicy ones can be quite spicy if your tolerance isn&apos;t high, but very umami and delicious. Oh, and the portions here are still huge haha."
4,"They have you sign in with your phone number and check your temperatures. We felt very safe dining outside. The restrooms are temporarily closed.

We ordered their popular bibim mil myeon and the bossam. The portions were very large here and the various kimchi side dishes were tasty. A great place to stop by for noodles."
4,Great Koren food. Delish. Very helpful staff who helped us navigate and order the right food.
5,"AMAZING. There&apos;s outdoor dining and they turn over tables relatively fast. We waited for about 20-30 minutes on a Wednesday night, and they took our order while we were still in line. 

I had the plain kalguksu and my boyfriend ordered the vegetarian cold noodles. The portions are HUGE. The bowl my noodles came in was so wide, full of thick chunky pieces of zucchini, potatoes, two dumplings, and noodles. The noodles are so delicious and have an incredible bite to them, and the dumplings are also huge and stuffed full of meat. 

I was worried the cold noodles wouldn&apos;t be as good but the sauce was a perfect combo of sweet and spicy, plus it came with a side of soup that the noodles had been cooked in. 

The broth was incredible. So savory and has so much depth. Dunking some of the barley rice in it and eating that is heaven. I finished everything because I&apos;m a monster, but I also felt like I would explode from the amount of liquid in my stomach."
5,"If you&apos;ve never had bossam before, you have to try it here. You don&apos;t need to get bossam anywhere else. Once you get the bossam here, it will change your life. Long time ago, I wasn&apos;t a huge fan of it because I had some pretty bland ones. I used to think that boiled pork belly was a bad idea and wondered why it even existed. But then my friend introduced me to Hangari. That&apos;s when I realized that bossam is so underrated and is actually super worth it. This place is bomb.

First of all, this place offers the freshest and best tasting side dishes. They don&apos;t have a huge selection, but they offer top quality fermented vegetables. I love pairing the bossam, pickled radishes, garlic, and ssamjang (fermented bean dip) together and wrap it up with the radish paper...it&apos;s seriously so amazing. It feels healthy when you eat it lol.

If you&apos;re not a fan of pork belly slices, then get their noodles. They have a spicy cold noodle that tastes amazing. They also have a chicken kalguksu. It&apos;s so comforting. Literally anything you order here will be good. They have a modest menu, but whatever you order won&apos;t disappoint so don&apos;t be shy and get their noodles, bossam, and dumplings.

TL;DR
Best bossam in Koreatown. Do not bother going anywhere else.
Kalgusu is bomb.
Gotta pay for parking or find street parking."
5,"Went there today with my mommy and we are stuffed and satisfy.

1) barley rice which is free with their ban chan (appetizer) of kimchi which are made in house with their own farm grown vegetable.  They put sesame oil in that rice and it&apos;s SO good!  I gave it 5 out of 5 and I&apos;ll be back to try their barley rice bibimbap next time.

2) plain Kalguksu is 5 out of 5 foe me.  It come with pumpkin, potatoe, zucchini and 2 dumplings.  The noodle are thick and chewy, just perfect!  I couldn&apos;t stop eating and finished the whole bowl and I&apos;m stuffed.  Serving is big, it&apos;s enough to feed two people and I can&apos;t believe I finished it.  The soup is perfect and light.  The dumpling is OMG good!  Next time I&apos;ll get a plate of just the dumplings too.

3) seafood kalguksu is 5 out of 5, I just tried the soup and it&apos;s really tasty, fresh and good.  You get the seafood aroma but not overpowering and it&apos;s a bit sweet and not salty.  My mom couldn&apos;t finish it but she ate all the seafood.  It came with clam, mussel, shrimp, crab and more (I was too busy eating my own bowl).  

4) bossam is 5 out of 5, the serving is for 2 people but it&apos;s more than enough to feed like 3-4 people.  The meat is tender and just perfect.  Unfortunately it&apos;s not lunch time so we can&apos;t order mini size.  We had to take it to go because we can&apos;t finish it.

I want to try the sujebi next time and the chicken porridge.  I mean I want to try everything.  

Definitely a to go place in Ktown that&apos;s perfect for nice noodle and decent food and big serving."
5,"I reordered from here again and this time got the plain sujebi and it was incredible!

The plain sujebi comes with 2 mandu in the soup and the fat-torn-off- noodles are nice and chewy. I got this for delivery too the noodles didn&apos;t suffer at all. The size for the soup was EPIC. It comes in 2 giant to-go soup containers and was enough soup to feed two grown adults with left overs or make four meals for one very hungry person. It comes with a side of two types of kimchi which tasted fresh and delicious. I recommend buying extra kimchi it&apos;s so good and pairs perfectly with the sujebi. 

The broth for the sujebi is so good. It reminds me of western style chicken and dumpling soup. The broth is very savory, a dense flavored chicken stock (not fishy at all tasting, if you&apos;re sensitive to anchovy flavored broth you&apos;ll like this soup a lot since I don&apos;t think they use any in this one.) white pepper to give it a kick without being spicy,  and just the right amount of salt to bring everything together. I&apos;d order this if I wasn&apos;t feeling well. It&apos;s a perfect get-well or hangover soup. The dough noodles absorb that well flavored broth and become addictive.

The soup taste great cold as well, you can eat it right out of the fridge if you don&apos;t feel like warming up.

Overall, they have some of the best Korean food in Ktown."
4,"Outdoor seating is ample here! Each table is separated with plastic dividers so you&apos;re safe and cozy with your party. Staff wears face coverings as they come take your order. I came with a group of 5 and we only waited 10 minutes. They give a yummy rice appetizer that goes really well with the spicy bean sauce they provide. And they provide a lot of pickled veggies. 

Their soups are so tasty and largely portioned. I ordered the medium Bossam and it was more than enough food for two. I&apos;ve never had Bossam before and it was helpful to go on hangari&apos;s food Instagram to see a video post on how to eat the Bossam correctly. The pork belly was sooo tasty. Pork belly is my favors and they give SO much here. This was a great authentic Korean dining experience and if you love picked veggies or home style comfort soup, this is the place for you. 

Parking was easy on a Sunday afternoon, you can park in the plaza or find street parking. Definitely enjoyed my experience here and I can&apos;t wait to come back!"
5,"Located in K-town, this Korean restaurant specializes in kalguksu which is hand-cut noodle soup. They also serve many other dishes including their famous bossam. 

We ordered the spicy seafood kalguksu and the medium Bissau. 

The spicy seafood kalguksu came with so much seafood and noodles! The noodles had the perfect texture that was thick and chewy. The broth was so flavorful from all the seafood and I enjoyed the kick from the spice. If you love spicy and seafood I definitely recommend it. They give a pretty generous portion that can feed up to two. 

The bossam was delicious! I love eating it wrapped in the cabbage and pairing it with all the sides and the sauce. I also love that they give garlic slices and radish. 

This place was definitely a great experience. The servers checked our temperature upon arrival and were friendly. I highly recommend Hangari for its amazing Korean comfort food!"
4,"My favorite place to get bossam!!!! Their bossam is moist and very fulfilling!!!! 

I love their sauce!!! I also tried the chicken noodle soup and chicken porridge here but I think my favorite is still the bossam!

Highly recommend this place to everyone. Parking is tough and messy but since Covid hit, it has gotten better! Make sure to call ahead or order online!"
1,"A dead mosquito was found on the food container.
The mosquito wasn&apos;t in the food, but it was stuck on the lid of the container.  
I don&apos;t think this would have happened if the cooker or cashier took care of my order.
I was so sad. :("
4,"We had the most wonderful patio dining ever.

We ordered...
- 2 person bossam platter
- Icy cold naeng myun was so refreshing
- Spicy bibim naeng myun
- the hot knife-cut chicken soup (very healing if you are feeling under the weather)
- Hand made dumplings
- Ban chan set

Food was abundant. 
We left in a food coma."
