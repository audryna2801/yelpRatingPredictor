5,"These tacos were quite delicious we tried the tongue, beef cheek and the chicken tacos and they were tender and flavorfuldelicious and wonderful. We also had the Pina Aguas Frescas and that was one of the best that I&apos;ve ever had. The process was easy it was social distance and service was great if you&apos;re looking for late-night eat this is a wonderful taco truck to visit."
5,"There are so many taco trucks in LA, all boasting their specialty and claiming their legitimacy over the best taco truck in LA. HOWEVER, in my limited experience over tacos in LA, El Chato takes the cake. 

You get to a small parking lot and see the line snake around the street and you just know that this is going to be a good meal. Some have claimed that El Chato&apos;s taste even better after a heavy night of drinking, I can firmly testify that you don&apos;t need any help to enjoy your first (or many bites) into a taco from El Chato. 

They keep their menu simple with other options: quesadilla, mulitas, burritos etc. But their tacos are bomb. Don&apos;t miss out, they do have adjusted hours for COVID and are opened earlier on Fridays!"
5,My favorite taco truck!  Usually busy but they always adhere to the Covid rules.  My favorites are their al pastor tacos and chicken burrito.  Super nice folks working hard to get you up and out quickly.  5 stars from me.
5,Always busy.  But the crew is also always friendly and the food comes out quick and hot.  Great place to quick up a late dinner on my walk home after work.
4,"Delicious LA street tacos. If you live in Los Angeles, and you haven&apos;t been here before you&apos;re doing it wrong. Open late and located in a decently centralized area for the majority of Angelinos, you need to stop by. A lot of the hype goes to their asada, which my friends all rave about. Choices of tacos, burritos, quesadillas- what more do you want from a taco truck?

Ordered my standard four chicken tacos. Absolutely loveeee their red/orange salsa. Has the right amount of kick and it is super addicting. I could probably eat like eight of these tacos in one go if I was hungry enough. Four was definitely not enough for me. Will be coming back."
4,"Probably the best taco truck within the vicinity.
It&apos;s not always there but when it is, it feels like you finally found that 4-leaf clover you&apos;ve been searching for. It feels like a game; you&apos;re wondering if they&apos;re there and when they are, you feel like you won.

Price:
You definitely cannot be mad at their prices! $6 for a combo burrito is solid. You can get all meat for $7 or extra meat for an additional $1.25. The tacos are $1.25 which is pretty standard. 

Food:
The portions of rice, beans, meat, etc are well-balanced and decently-flavored. I won&apos;t lie and say it&apos;s the best I&apos;ve had, but it&apos;s still pretty good. Whether or not it was an accident, some of the Carne Asada burrito had crispy bits and I enjoyed it. People say the tacos are small but it&apos;s just the tortillas. The meat per taco is SUPER generous. You could order a few tacos, eat them, and still have enough that fell over to make another taco or so. 

Reading the reviews will convince you the line is as long as the Great Wall of China but I didn&apos;t have to experience this(fortunately). It may be that it was 10pm on a Tuesday but we were in and out.

I will definitely be coming back sooner or later. I bet I&apos;d enjoy the meal 3X as much after a night out and look forward to."
4,"What stands out here is their grilled onions! They are absolutely addictive, they serve them alongside your meal and I would come back just for those alone! Service is wonderful, they are very friendly and fast. Prices are fair and the food is extremely flavorful. I really enjoyed the pastor as well as the salsa. Worth checking out!"
4,"This place is good but only thing is they&apos;re burritos aren&apos;t that good to be honest. I tried their tacos every time, and I decided to go with a burrito. Their beans and rice both tasted too mushy to be honest. If you come here, their Tacos are much better than the burritos. Their rice and beans lacked flavor, especially the rice"
5,"One of the best tacos in LA. 
Pastor tacos are great, don&apos;t forget to ask for grilled onions and jalapeños."
4,"$1.65 per taco. Got the Al Pastor and Buche. PACKED with flavor, and loaded with onions, cilantro, and salsa for each taco. Delicious. To-go comes with salsa verde and red salsa, radishes, limes, and cucumbers, which is awesome.
My real issue is the texture, because they cut their meat into smaller pieces. I like when the buche is in large chunks because the texture really comes into play with the chewiness."
5,"I came here on a Thursday night and it wasn&apos;t crowded. I got the carne asada and marinated pork tacos. Although they are small , they pack a might need punch. They are filled with lots of meat and you can get onion on the side,  which are delicious ! Definitely going back here the next time I come to L.A.."
5,"Not to call myself a taco expert at all, but I have tried so many taco trucks and restaurants in LA and this has to be my favorite. Even if all the other articles and videos talk about other joints, THIS IS IT PEOPLE 

Sometimes it&apos;s ultra busy and sometimes it&apos;s so dead that it makes me anxious it&apos;ll close. So please visit this place so it doesn&apos;t close! 

They open as of 9PM so perfect for late dinners or late night munchies. They double up on flour tortillas for each taco and every flavor is delicious. Never dry, always saucy and full of flavor. Just wow! A good portion for moderate appetite is 3 tacos but if you&apos;re hungry, order 4 or 5. 

They used to have all the condiments out on the side of the food truck but it&apos;s now in the truck and they serve it all on your plate. You can always ask for extra of course. 

Ugh writing this review made me hungry. Coming back here next week."
5,"This taco truck is definitely worth the hype. I came here around 9:30 on a Saturday night and it wasn&apos;t too crowded yet. We were able to find parking on the neighborhood street just next to it. 

At $1.50 each, their tacos are reasonably priced for what&apos;s standard in LA. I decided to try their carne asada, al pastor, chicken, and buche (pork belly)

I had never had buche before but really enjoyed, its somewhat similar to carnitas which they don&apos;t have here. The chicken was ok, I&apos;d probably pass on that next time. The carne asada was my favorite and probably some of the best carne asada tacos I&apos;ve had in LA."
5,"This truck is on the corner of la Brea and Olympic. Their tacos are truly addictive. I am being 100 when I tell you that there aren&apos;t any tacos in the city of Los Angeles that I taste better than their tacos. I&apos;ve eaten almost everywhere, I am a true foodie. These tacos are everything!!!"
4,don&apos;t always like fish but when I do have fish I make it El Chato Taco Truck tacos. I have been following since it was two fryers in a parking lot to China Town and then a food truck.
5,"Yelped this place randomly at 1am with my friends. We drove there was lots of people and I ordered 4 2 asada and 2 al pastor. They have quesadillas and burritos and tacos with avocado. 
My tacos were delish as well as the Agua de horchata. We got it to go because there is no where to sit and eat there. So basically you just stand or eat in your car. 
They were amazingly greasy good. I regretted not ordering 2 more. 
Late night food option MUST! :)"
5,I love this food truck and I love more their tacos. I do not like most of the food trucks but this one and other in the san fernando valley are my favorites. As for the pastor tacos they are delicious.
5,"There&apos;s actually a great taco truck within walking distance of my apartment, but when I&apos;m feelin like GOD TIER tacos, I take a drive here. This is my #1!!!

The tacos are amazing. Truthfully, I&apos;ve only had the carne asada, but that&apos;s just my go-to at any place. They&apos;re so good! And the salsa!! I love their salsa. 

Once or twice I tried their carne asada burrito, and those are just as good. Definitely get the salsa on them!

I almost always get my order to-go. Of course, it&apos;s a taco truck; but many people set up a table on the trunk of their car or stand around and enjoy a plate before they go. That&apos;s not usually me, but it&apos;s an option! A little difficult, though, since parking is a bit of a struggle. There&apos;s street parking and a tiny lot, but those are generally full....expect to look for street parking and expect to park a little far. Definitely worth it, though!"
5,"This weekend flew by so fast. Came down to LA for my good friend&apos;s wedding &amp; just had to squeeze in some time to grab tacos before we left. Our friend&apos;s all recommended El Chato, so that&apos;s where we ended up after the wedding. The tacos were bite sized (for me at least) so it was perfect for us to order almost one of each. The tripe of course was my favorite, crispy, caramelized, tangy from the pickled onions, creamy from the avocado. Don&apos;t forget to ask for a grilled jalapeño. We topped it all off with a little dessert...carne asada, rice &amp; bean burrito. Omg...the absolute best &amp; I&apos;m here just craving another one while I&apos;m writing this review. Apparently, waits can get a little long, but we got here just a little after they opened, 9pm. Don&apos;t forget to check their Facebook page for hours though, apparently they close sometimes even during their regular hours!"
5,"I know that there are a ton of choices when it comes to tacos in Los Angeles. Bar none, this truck is the best. Chorizo and carne asada are everything! 

Bring cash."
