5,"Yummy spot, prime location. Grab a drink a little snack and walk around. Had out door seating too which was nice"
5,This place is fantastic! Super COVID friendly and delicious food overall. One of the items I got was the Oreo cheesecake in a jar....it takes like HEAVEN!!! So so good; highly recommend it. The donuts are great as well!
5,"Parking is available in Plaza, about $5 for 20.  I had a meeting at 11:00 am and was able to find metered street parking which I used an app to make payment.

Cafe Dulce is a small shop easily converted to accomodate outdoor seating.  The tables are set up for 2 people.  I borrowed another chair to accomodate our party of 3.  Although we were in the main entrance on the ground floor, we were a good distance away from the foot traffic.

The entrance to enter the cafe was blocked with a table.  From there the  counter was close enough to see the over hanging menu.  Employees were masked and gloved.  The plaza was busy but there wasn&apos;t a line for Cafe Dulce.  It did have a steady flow of customers.

All the drinks and food handed out were covered and sealed.  Customer service was excellent and efficient.  My dulce latte was at the right temperature.  Not scolding hot.  I do like it sometimes scolding but this latte was smooth.  I like how it was not over sweeten still able to enjoy the natural bitterness from the coffee beands.

It was nice to have gotten out breaking the monotony and enjoy some air and people again.  The client was happy with the physical metallurgy product we were developing.  It would be nice to come back here again to finalize the project and get another wonderful cup."
5,"Cafe Dulce is THE gem of Japanese Village Plaza and Little Tokyo.  They have the most amazing donuts, sandwiches, salads and COFFEE (*Drool*).  My favorite drink is their Vietnamese coffee and second favorite is their Hong Kong milk tea.  My kids are obsessed with their pebble cereal donut bites.  

If you follow their Instagram, you can also find out when to buy these heavenly donut hotdogs on a stick with the most delicious dipping sauces.  We order 6 for 2 adults and 2 kids and they are gone within minutes.

Beyond the incredible food, the service is TOP NOTCH.  Everyone is friendly, knowledgeable, and so helpful.  I highly recommend Cafe Dulce to anyone looking for a great meal, dessert, caffeine fix in the Los Angeles area!"
4,"This place is great, and the staff is really helpful! Because of covid we can&apos;t  go inside, so the person helping me let me point to all the things I wanted in the window. And when we got to two items that I was trying to decide between, I had to mime the question of which she liked better. She didn&apos;t skip a beat, and helped me narrow it down. She also helped me decide what latte to get, as I was stuck between three.. The winner was the Cafe Dulce latte, which I highly recommend! I was warned that it was on the sweet side, but I honestly didn&apos;t think it was too sweet. I thought it was just perfect!

Do yourself a favor and get the blueberry bun. Out of everything I got, I can say with confidence that it was my favorite thing from there. I would go back there specifically for it, and I intend to.

I also got the maple macadamia donut, and the coffee crumble donut.  While I wish that the doughnuts were a bit taller and fluffier, they are spot on in their flavors. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coffee flavored doughnuts because the flavor is typically faint and half hearted. Not here, though! I also wish the macadamia doughnut had a bit of chopped macadamia sprinkled on top, but it&apos;s not a big deal.

I&apos;m looking forward to the next time I&apos;m in Little Tokyo so that I can try the other pastries, lattes, and that korean sandwich!"
4,"I stopped by today after taking a little stroll around the Japanese village. They have their pastries displayed in their window with the prices and names which makes deciding so easy and nice. There are some outdoor tables and seating and I believe their doing cashless payments would credit card only. The woman who took my order and helped me this afternoon was very kind and friendly. You order at the front door and they bring the pastries to you in to-go containers. I waited less than 5 minutes for my drinks. Super easy and safe since they&apos;re practicing social distancing and requiring that you wear a mask to be helped. Love that. 

I ordered one iced dulce latte, one iced milk tea (both large) ...I&apos;m so glad I got a large of my milk tea. So yummy and lasted me a while so I was able to sip on it at home later on. Very large sizes, awesome price. 

I also picked up two of the bacon donut holes for my husband and I to try and one of the chewy tapioca balls/rolls. I forgot what they were called. But holy cow! That chewy tapioca ball WAS DELICIOUS. It&apos;s huge and I split it with my husband as we were driving home and I wish we bought 10 more. No joke. So delicious. 

They&apos;ve also got some vegan donut offerings. I saw a vegan pb&amp;j donut. All their donuts look tasty. I&apos;ll def be back."
4,DONUTS ARE GREAT. I love the texture of the donut and I also like that they are not overly sweet. My favorite is the Cinnamon Toast Crunch! I think the store has really great presentation and that alone makes you want to buy everything. I saw sandwiches on their menu as well and I would love to come back to try those. Definitely check them out. Located in Little Tokyo village shopping plaza.
5,"I&apos;m obsessed with their blueberry matcha ! I&apos;ve been coming here for years and it&apos;s been a while. They still value the quality of there drinks and service! I highly recommend the blueberry matcha. It&apos;s a refreshing way of drinking matcha. 
 This place is also prefect because they have donuts and coffee &amp; tea! Their donuts are also pretty good! I like their small ones bc they&apos;re bite-sized."
5,"I was out in LA and love trying new coffee spots. I noticed people loved both the coffee and donuts so I said we needed to go. We tried the maple macadamia, green tea, strawberry jelly and mini fruity pebbles and bacon donuts. We didn&apos;t realize after we had left that they had way more donuts and they even had a coffee cake donut!!! *crying. Anyways, they were so good! I especially loved the strawberry jelly one because it has fresh strawberries in the middle. I was a bit hesitant at first because I&apos;m not a huge jelly fan, but this was just right and was not like those fake jelly inserts. I also really liked the texture of the green tea down, wasn&apos;t so matcha-y and had a thin layer around the custard. My Vietnamese coffee was really tasty, just how I like it, &quot;in the middle strong&quot; lmao."
5,Amazing vegan peanut and jelly doughnut.  The whole fam said I had the pick of the day.  Lattes and hot chocolate were perfectly sweet -not overly sweet.
1,"Gf ordered 4 of these Mason jar type desserts.

All 4 were sour and had major carbon dioxide generation when eaten the next day. You can see the cracks in the cream

They were cold when we arrived home and fridged immediately so it&apos;s not like we left it out. Bye bye $20"
4,"I have been here a couple of times and didn&apos;t realize I hadn&apos;t made a review. But since we are in a unique time right now, I decided to write one up, especially since my brother and I were able to make a stop here last Friday when getting a boba kit from Milk+T nearby :)

We decided to get a bunch of the mochi balls, especially since my mom loves them. But we also tried the newer ones that we saw since the last time we had been there. I got the Churro Dinosaur egg one and actually enjoyed it more than the other mochi balls because I have a sweet tooth. We also got a jar of the triple berry cake in a jar and wished it was a bit bigger since it felt like we paid more for the glass container than the cake because it was sooo good! The cake was moist and had sooo much frosting and berries stuffed in there!

Would go back again whenever we are in the neighborhood since it is located in downtown LA."
5,"Every so often, they make a limited quantity of their sausage doughnuts, which is now my new favorite item from here. During our once a week outing to get some sunlight and groceries, my fiancé and I picked up some elusive sausage doughnuts (6 per person!), a jug of Hong Kong milk tea, and a matcha blueberry latte. 

We already knew the drinks were good because we&apos;ve had them before. But the sausage doughnuts... man. I wish it were a regular menu item! SO GOOD. Super crispy coating with super soft fluffy inside and juicy sausage inside (TWSS). It comes with tasty sauces as well, a sweet and spicy one, and a mustard that isn&apos;t like regular mustard. 

They do takeout or curbside delivery and observe the 6ft social distancing rule, yay. Follow golittletokyo on Instagram to see when the doughnuts are available, you gotta keep an eye out."
4,"It&apos;s totally normal to order a half gallon jug of their Blueberry Matcha Latte, right?

1/2 gallon = 64 ounces (equivalent to four 16 oz drinks). See, the CDC aren&apos;t the only ones that can do math (and my numbers are actually verifiable and hold up)

During these times, it doesn&apos;t make much sense to order single drinks several days in a row, so Café Dulce came up with a brilliant way of getting around that. For $19 ($25 if you want Oat or Almond Milk) they&apos;re offering 64 ounce versions of the following drinks:

*Matcha: Matcha Latte or Blueberry Matcha Latte
*Milk Tea: Assam (Hong Kong), Chai, Jasmine, Gen Mai, Rose, London Fog (Earl Grey), Apple Spice

It&apos;s supposed to be good for up to a week but to be on the safe side, I finished it within 4 days.

They&apos;re also doing a lot of other great things now, such as the Community Feeding Community program where donations are made to provide meals (for those economically impacted) and fulfilled by Little Tokyo &amp; Arts District small businesses that have seen their volume substantially decline.

So if I need to drink a half gallon of matcha to do my part, sign me up."
5,"Dulce is a hip coffee spot. Definitely worth checking out, has multiple locations but the one in Little Tokyo is the original and the best! Got their Hong Kong Milk Tea in the half gallon jug. It does take about 2 hours to order the half gallon with any milk type drink in it. Make sure you order in advance or have some time!
Love the flavor!! The donuts here are also amazing and unique!!"
5,"Great little place. My matcha latte was smooth and refreshing.
The vegan pbj donut was the perfect treat! The flavor was light but still noticeable."
5,Little Tokyo&apos;s most community minded small businesses. You&apos;ll find cafe dulce at almost every community function so you know it&apos;s good. You can pick up jugs of their blue berry matcha latte which is what has been fueling me through work from home.
5,A GEM. I love this place. The staff are so friendly and the coffee is amazing. The breakfast burrito is one of the best in LA. The service is quick and they even have a few tables set up outside! You&apos;ll never be disappointed here. So happy to support this small business!
4,Made a quick stop to try this gem. Loved the coffee.. I also got some donuts . I tried the Oreo donut it was good but I expected a cream oreo filling inside. Was hoping they had the sausage donut but they didn&apos;t .. will be coming back to try more things ..
5,"5 stars for this gem in the heart of Little Tokyo. We&apos;ve been here before and tried a bunch of &quot;just before closing&quot; goods and felt I needed to come back at a time more reflective of daily business

Best Vietnamese Coffee!! 5stars
Seasonal Lemonade. 3.5 stars. Good but blue?!?
Pastrami Burger! 4.25 stars. Excellent ingredients, obvious local market select, coleslaw garnish provides a serious splash of flavors that takes the sandwich in another direction (not my simple flavor approach, but very good). Bun, brioche, awesome!!
Caprese Sandwich! 4.25 stars. A bit over sauced in pesto, again I&apos;m a less is more, but the baguette was awesome so it works!

Service is stellar, 5 stars and don&apos;t forget to try the famous matcha donut!

I&apos;ll be back. Bring the family."
