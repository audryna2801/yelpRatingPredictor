5,"First outing after COVID. We wanted to get out of The Valley and try something new. Somehow we ended up here. Haven&apos;t had Korean bbq in a couple of years. While driving I was craving kimchi, if that&apos;s how you spell it. Anywho................
First The heaters did it for me. I was cold that evening We had a 15 minute wait which wasn&apos;t bad. All COVID precautions in place. Temperature taken and all. 
Amazing customer service and attention. 
The food............. Amaziiiiiiiiiiiing ! 
You have to try a little of everything. I wanted to take the cook at our table home.  
No downfall at all during this visit. Just happy bellies. Worth the drive from The Valley"
5,"My friends &amp; I (3 total) ate here on a Thursday night on 2/11/2021.  Decided to eat here versus Quarters because the wait for a table was only 10 minutes versus 1 hour at Quarters.  I&apos;ve eaten here many times in the past but seem to love the vibe and atmosphere of Quarters more. However, we opted to stick to Kang Ho Dang Baekjeong due to the smaller wait time.  They both offer an automated text message system that will message you when your table is ready.  

Due to Covid-19 restrictions all meat had to be cooked yourself. Prior to being seated, each guest&apos;s temperature is obtained using a temporal thermometer. All waiters and food runners donned masks, face shields, and gloves.

Service was fast &amp; efficient.  Our group was ready to order drinks and decided on ordering the large portion of the beef combo ($114.99) which included the thinly sliced brisket, prime marinated beef, prime rib eye, soybean paste stew, and steamed egg.  The meal also comes with the complimentary banchan (sides) which compliment the meal. Their banchan is pretty standard in comparison to other KBBQ spots that provide a wide variety but you can always ask for more.  All meats were high quality, juicy, and tender.  Despite the restaurant not being AYCE the large beef combo provided more than enough  between the 3 people. We came hungry after almost a 2 month hiatus of not eating KBBQ and we left with our stomach and hearts satisfied.  This restaurant is definitely on the top of my list of places to eat when it comes to KBBQ.  I&apos;ve never had any negative experiences and will definitely come back."
5,"I&apos;m a huge fan of Baekjeong and I&apos;ve been here many times, the meat quality is impeccable and this place still remains to be my favorite kbqq joint! This review is more specific for the takeout option during covid (LA in lockdown again).

Obviously the meat will not be the same as freshly grilled, but the quality is still there! The marinated beef is one of the meat that still upholds to the standards even without the grill. Others such as brisket and short rib is a little tougher, but I still enjoyed it anyway!

If you&apos;re afraid that you won&apos;t get the whole banchan because of it&apos;s takeout, don&apos;t be! They gave you all the banchan that you would&apos;ve gotten if you dined in. The corn and cheese came in cold and you&apos;d have to microwave it yourself. Everything was packaged nicely for you.

The one compliant of the whole experience is that there wasn&apos;t a place on their website when you order for you to give instructions to them (ex: I wanted more garlic on the side etc.) But other than that, the experience was very smooth and nice. Will definitely be returning for more!"
4,"Dined here for Valentine&apos;s dinner, and had a good experience. We ended up parking across the street in the garage and paid $15 for all day parking. 

Right now they only have outdoor dining (located in the back of the restaurant), but so are all the other restaurants in that area. It&apos;s outdoors with canopies for covering and walking through that area felt like I was in an open marketplace -- pretty fun to experience! It kind of made me feel like I was in a different country for a second with everything being outdoors hahaha. 

We arrived at 8:15, got quoted a 2 hour wait, and got sat around 9:45. They check your temperature before seating you, and they have a restroom inside of the restaurant for customers (all the way in to the left).

There is a QR code on the table to scan for the menu~ We ended up ordering the Beef Combo for 2, $69.99. It came with Brisket, Marinated Beef, &amp; Prime Short Rib. The brisket was brought out to us already cooked, and we got to cook the other meats on our grill. Since it&apos;s outside, they have a different grill set up than they do inside. Corn cheese &amp; steamed egg are brought out separately instead of it being directly on the grill. 

They have a decent selection of Banchan, although I&apos;ve had better elsewhere. You can always ask for more if needed! Their service was pretty good even though it was on a busy day. 

Of course it&apos;s a different experience than indoor dining, but for what it was, we had a great dinner and would come back again. :)"
5,"Great service.  The server was always attentive to our food on the grill. He didn&apos;t even let me grill my own food. He took 100% care of us.
The meat was great. 
The atmosphere was great.
The 1 hour wait no so great but is to be expected during peak time"
5,"Just adding another 5 star to the list. KHDB definitely deserves it from the food, service, atmosphere. Came at lunch for outdoor dining and it was awesome. Pre-Covid the wait is hours but since it is only minutes. 

You still get delicious food with service that better than most Korean restaurants. The banchan is pretty good here. The beef combo is a good value for the amount of food you get. 

The brisket comes out cooked for you, the marinated short rib and prime beef you can grill it yourself on a portable tabletop grill. The kimchi stew isn&apos;t spicy but has good flavor with pork belly, rice cakes and tofu. The steamed egg is better good too.

Can&apos;t go wrong with anything ordered here."
5,"Finally after a year of being stuck at home, we were able to go out for dinner. This was my first time at this Korean bbq restaurant. This place has out door dining inside a tent. They have heaters to keep customers warm. All the employees are wear masks and gloves. Prior to coming they check your temperature. The wait time was only 25 minutes which was amazing. The food was really great and the service was outstanding. Employees were super friendly and welcoming. Location was clean and sanitized after each group."
5,"Although I&apos;m used to the all you can eat format of kbbq, this place reminds you that you don&apos;t need endless meets to enjoy a quality place. My favorite part about the bbq experience is the cheesy corn that comes on the side of the grill. 

Since the meats provided are truly top of the line, you don&apos;t need too many options to be satisfied, that said, they&apos;ve got a wonderful array of sides to go with the exceptional ingredients that they offer for BBQ

Great environment and an on point menu to match"
4,"This review is for the outdoor setting. My group ordered the large beef combo, it comes with two choices of soup but they no longer have the egg &amp; cheese corn for free which sucks. We ended up ordering the egg on the side and paying $3.99 for it. There was no cheese corn available at all. The service was good especially since it was busy &amp; I&apos;m sure its a lot of work to walk back and forth from inside the building to outside. They cook the meat on a separate grill &amp; then bring the meat to your table when its ready. Don&apos;t worry they do ask you how you want your meat cooked before they cook it. You have a grill at your table but its mainly to just keep the meat hot. Overall enjoyed it and would come back again."
5,"I love Baekjeong so much. This place is really the best KBBQ place I&apos;ve had. I ordered Premium Seared Pork belly, Beef Tartare and Spicy Paste Cold Noodle. Everything was perfect! So delicious and service was great. Can&apos;t wait to be back."
3,"Coming from out of town- I was very excited to try KBBQ in LA. I&apos;ve tried ones in New York, Georgia, Chicago and Michigan, but heard great things about the KBBQ in Cali - heard this place in particular was famous and popular amongst locals. 

I was left though very very very disappointed.

Firstly, because of COVID we were unable to grill ourselves or be seated in tables with grills. That itself kinda ruined the experience for me. I cannot blame the restaurant on this one because it was for safety concerns, but we were a little disappointed. 

The main reason for the 3 stars is because of the meat quality. It was very low- there was just way too much fat on them and overall the taste was OK- compared to usual and other restaurants. On the plus side, the side dishes were delicious.

Another reason for the 3 stars was because the service  was v poor- there were so many people working too, so I was kinda impatient. We ran out of water, we wanted rice etc but each time it took 10 minutes just to get our server to stop by our table. 

Wouldn&apos;t really recommend this place - really subpar."
5,"Came here to try out some of the non-bbq items on the menu since I was on a time crunch but still craving quality korean food in the area. Per my server&apos;s suggestion, i opted for the seafood tofu stew. it was a good portion and comes with rice and unlimited side dishes. If you&apos;re on a lunch break I would recommend coming here on a weekday since those items will come out a lot faster than having to grill meat to your preferred liking. Thank you to Shannie!"
5,It took me so long to actually figure out where exactly we were eating last night . My friend kept saying this is the Best Korean barbecue in Hawaii. This place is so good! All I know is we walked in into what seem like to me a Korean food festival. A huge parking structure filled up with like maybe seven huge tents for each restaurant. I don&apos;t know maybe because I&apos;ve totally given into the coronavirus style of  life (completely casual comfy clothes)  I was a little shocked when I walked in there ! I probably wasn&apos;t dressed appropriately because it felt like a nightclub all of a sudden Ha ! Thank God for this Covid mask nobody can actually see I&apos;m uncomfortable ! The vibe in the air was that people were so excited to be out eating !  We were too! I mean who doesn&apos;t get excited to eat Korean barbecue. Of course there&apos;s always plenty of sides that I can eat that don&apos;t have any meat but because of Covid they&apos;re not allowed to cook your meat for you. Which kind of sucks but I understand. I mean the whole part of going out to eat is not having to cook right ! All around I gave this experience five stars because it was so delicious and super fun . There was a two hour wait with the reservation.  Parking is super hard to fine. We all spent one hour waiting for valet in the car just a park. So come with that patient attitude.
5,"Went here back in January. This is the best Korean BBQ restaurant I have eaten at. I have eaten at atleast 30 other Korean BBQ spots. Maybe its good because they cook it for you. Meaning you don&apos;t get to mess up your meal yourself. The wait can be long but, it is well worth it. Definitely stop in when you can."
4,"So I&apos;m writing this review mainly for the Covid era. I don&apos;t mean to write negative things on Yelp, so I&apos;ll start by saying this restaurant when I dined in pre-Covid, was the best Korean BBQ I ever had. And I&apos;ve been eating Korean BBQ my entire life.

However, I tried getting the beef combo recently so my dad could try their food. It was almost 90 dollars for the small combo, with 3 types of meat, a complimentary stew (I did kimchi jiggae) some banchan and cheese corn. 

As I said, I didn&apos;t eat any of this stuff, but the feedback I got from my dad was the meat was overrated, the corn was good, but his wife slammed it all down. I did look at the food as it was unpacked. My thoughts were, and mind you I&apos;m fine with paying 90 dollars for 2 meals if it&apos;s as good as I had dining in, but I don&apos;t think there was enough meat, or banchan for 90 dollars.

I write this not to discourage diners, but hopefully to inspire the restaurant to make some adjustments to get even more business. I def want these guys to thrive and be here when I can dine in again. (Thanks Obese Molester Trump for doing nothing about the virus)."
5,"Had an amazing outdoor dining experience here the other day (and we got to grill some of our own meats!). Baekjeong is an authentic KBBQ experience.

Located in one of the busiest plazas within Koreatown, getting here means navigating through a makeshift street of dining tents including those of other KBBQ heavy hitters like Quarters. This street-food feel even adds to the experience, and it was like being transported to a bustling pre-pandemic food court. The meats are delicious, we ordered a small portion of the Beef and Pork combo and while definitely on the smaller side -- we were able to order enough to fill us up. The banchan and japchae were really great too. 

I highly recommend this place for KBBQ lovers, and they&apos;ve killed the outdoor dining experience."
5,"I&apos;ve been here too many times to not write a review. If you love KBBQ, this is one of the best! I&apos;ve had it both here and in Korea, it&apos;s amazing. I really like the set up of the grill which consist of other side dishes as well. 

I usually come during lunch hours when it&apos;s less busy, pick either the pork or beef combo and you&apos;ll be super full, trust me. It&apos;s A LOT of food. 

The last time I came here was actually today, right in the middle of our Covid pandemic. Indoor dining is not allowed, patio and takeout only. I think they go beyond just the regular safety measures here: my temperature was checked out front and then again inside in front of a body temp scanner screen (like an airport). Because of Covid they are not allowed to cook for you right now, so roll your sleeves up and get grilling :)

You have the option to cook for yourself if you choose to sit at their patio otherwise, you can sit outdoors beyond the patio and they can cook to order for you. It was not too busy, the patio has plexiglass that separates tables from each other and the seating outside also are separated 6ft apart. The staff was very attentive and checked on us very often to make sure we got everything we needed. 

Food here is as tasty and delicious as many others have said. Pretty good quality meats, huge choice of sides including soup, salads, corn cheese and eggs. Their eggs cook on the grill as well, you&apos;ll know what I mean - it&apos;s mixed with some sort of chicken broth and it&apos;s good AF.
Appreciate the great lunch and safety practices. I&apos;ve been craving and finally got to eat at Kang Ho again ^_^"
4,"I&apos;ll give KHD a 4 star (prob was a 4.5 pre covid).
Dined here last week as outdoor dining first opened.

Meat quality: still great - they cook certain cuts in the kitchen and bring out &amp; the rest is left for you to grill. My gripe with this is that you get less meat. I&apos;ve been here multiple times with the same sets (4 person beef set) and the post-covid set was drastically less filling.

Side dishes: great, but i had to ask for things that would normally come with our table (kabocha squash / sweet potatoes)

Service: maybe a bit biased but we were seated in a corner so it was hard flagging down an employee."
2,"HUGE DISCLAIMER: My experience might have been an anomaly. I ordered during COVID-19  (take-out) and my experience may not actually reflect the quality as Kang Ho-Dong (Or any other Korean BBQ) is a place best dined-in. In fact, would not recommend you order take-out here. You lose the Korean BBQ experience.

Still though for 75 dollars, this was a total letdown. Most of my ire stems from the price and the cold meats. Again, it was take-out, but my server never called me when ready as promised.  

Ordered the combo for two.

The prime-rib galbi was okay. Was not cooked medium rare as requested. The sauce marination was underwhelming, and I had a better experience at Soowon Golbi. 

The hot-stew with beef was the highlight of the meal. Spicy, but not too spicy, and adding the veggies to the broth elevated the flavor. 

Willing to give this a shot in the near future, but on a strictly dine-in basis."
5,"I it was a very friendly atmosphere, the wait staff was awesome being able to sit outside was a great bonus after eating most of my meals In the car due to covid.
Food was abound and had more than enough to take home..: we&apos;ll be coming back again"
