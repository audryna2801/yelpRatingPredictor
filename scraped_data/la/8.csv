5,"Having lived in NYC for 10 years I am a huge Katz fan so let&apos;s just get that out there. Since I can&apos;t get my fix thanks to COVID I had to look for the next best thing and now having eaten many rounds of #19 I&apos;m a believer!!! To be honest to the point where I&apos;m not sure who wins the Langers vs. Katz battle anymore!!! Highly recommend getting the Pastrami Chili Cheese Fries as well. If you&apos;re doing delivery like me, ask them to put the cheese on the side so you can heat it up in the broiler!"
5,"If I could give this place 6 stars I would. BEST PASTRAMI SANDWICH I&apos;VE EVER HAD, hands down!
I ordered the pastrami sandwich on rye with swiss cheese, cole slaw and russian dressing. This is probably the most famous version ($19.95). 
As soon as I bit into it, it was heavenly. The thick cuts of  pastrami are cooked perfectly with pieces of marblely goodness throughout, the rye is soft and fresh along with the cold crunch of the beautifully made slaw. You can automatically see why they are so famous and highly regarded as the best pastrami in Los Angeles.
They are open during the Covid pandemic however there is no inside dining. Pick up only. They also offer a curbside service right out front if you call ahead.
I ate is so fast I forgot to take a photo!"
5,"I came here during the weekend in the afternoon and the parking was located about a block away from the restaurant. Traffic is horrendous and taking the back alley roads is the fastest to getting there.

I ordered a full pastrami sandwich beforehand and was ready by the time i arrived to pick up. The bread was very soft and crunchy at the same time. The pastrami was delicious, full of flavor, and soft. The addition of coleslaw in the sandwhich gave it a very nice crunch. The pastrami sandwich was a literal perfection of what I was looking for.

Overall, I loved the food. The pastrami sandwich definitely lived up to my expectations and the hype I&apos;ve heard about it. I will be coming back for more once the COVID situation dies down."
5,"So, this review goes to both GoldBelly and Langers.  Goldbelly is a service that brings the countries best know foods to your door in a ready to prepare package.  It&apos;s very cool and easy.

I was a little suspicious that the food may not be fresh and lack the experience of actually being there, but to my surprise it was delicious - of course, being there would have been special as well so have something more to look forward to once the world opens up again.

I ordered the famous Langers Original  #19 Pastrami sandwich.  It came with enough product to make three (3) good sized sandwiches.  Starts with fresh pastrami piled high, smothered in thousand island, two slices of swiss, and topped with coleslaw.  through in a dill pickle and magic happens.

Despite being shipped from LA, the pastrami was really delicious.  The assemble was easy.  Vacuum sealed in plastic wrap, 90 seconds in the microwave and we were in business.  The bread was fresh, cheese tender and soft, thousand island needed nothing, and the pickle had a nice snap!

I surprised a few co-workers with the lunch and now we cant wait to order again, I&apos;m a big fan of visiting landmarks such as Langers, but Goldbelly is the next best thing to being there.

Hope to see you soon!"
3,"this place is more like 3.5 stars out of 5.
if you want to see inflation in real life, look no more than langers.
I remembered back in the days (2014) when the famous 19 was only like 14 bucks. Now they charge 20 bucks for it. the sandwich is the same size and nothing has changed.  Just everything is getting more expensive.

As for the food, i have only tried the #19 sandwich and to be frank, its good... but i don&apos;t know if its worth 20 bucks for it. The pastrami sandwich comes with a mountain of pastrami, swiss cheese, cole slaw and Russian dressing. They will also give you prepacked pickles as well. The bread is rye and everything goes very well together. If you get it to go, make sure you eat it quick since it kinda gets soggy after a while from the dressing and cole slaw.   

If you opt to pick up inside the restaurant, its only street parking.
However, they do allow for curbside pick up...

The surrounding areas isn&apos;t the greatest...Dirty streets, and lots of homeless people at the park right across the street.

PS: There is a west coast vs east coast battle on the best pastrami sandwich.
Katz in NYC is known to rival Langers. I&apos;ve been to both, and i have to say that Langers #19 is way better than the pastrami sandwich at Katz."
5,"Have been eating here for over 50 years 
Have had pastrami at the best in NYC
Langers is better

Neighborhood has changed but worth the trip

Seems like each sandwich has about a pound of pastrami"
4,"Apparently Langer&apos;s is a LA institution that you have to try and #19 is the only thing to order. I liked it, the rye bread was really soft snd crust perfectly crispy. The sweet cole slaw was refreshing and the pastrami was really tender. But it wasn&apos;t the best or worth waiting in line for hours. 

Order online for curbside pickup or in person pickup. 
Parking is a pain in the you know what. There isn&apos;t much space in front for curbside pickup, might have to circle around."
4,"Dropped by Langer&apos;s Delicatessen when we were in LA for the day. We heard it was like New York&apos;s Katz Deli, so we had to try it out!

While it&apos;s not better than Katz, it is the west coast equivalent. We had the #19 ($19.95) on Rye which was hot pastrami, coleslaw, swiss cheese, and Russian dressing on double-baked rye bread. While it was a great sandwich, next time, I would just get hot pastrami sandwich with a side of pastrami. ;) 

The Katz experience is the gold experience, and Langer&apos;s is right behind.

Go on their website to order online, and you can do curbside or in store pick up. If you do curbside, include your vehicle make, model, and color, and they bring your order to you right on time!"
4,"Finally tried the #19 pastrami! I must say, it was the best pastrami I&apos;ve tried. Their bread was very good quality and coleslaw was delicious with the pastrami. The pastrami has a little gaminess to it but thats what pastrami is all about. I&apos;ve tried couple places in LA and there&apos;s a reason why people love this restaurant.
On the side we also ordered the potato salad and fries which also were great to eat with the sandwich. Oh and their pickles are delicious too! I believe they sell it on a jar or something for pickle lovers! Sour and crunchy."
5,"New Year&apos;s Eve 2020 
I picked up three pounds of pastrami plus the usual:  Cole slaw, potato salad, rye bread, Swiss cheese, Russian dressing...no pickles as the pickle vendor is no longer in business and the new vendor&apos;s pickles aren&apos;t to my liking. I still have pickles from the last time I was here. Cantor&apos;s makes their own (I think) so I&apos;ll get my pickles there. I usually get a chunk of hard salami to gnaw on on my drive home. But for $36 a pound it&apos;s as expensive as the pastrami. It&apos;s now around 7:30pm and I&apos;m done eating...I&apos;ll go to bed in a bit and miss the the new year arrival. Wishing all of you a better 2021 than what we had this year. 
Stay safe and support your essential workers (tip well if you can).

5,"With so many great reviews, couldn&apos;t resist trying, and Yelpers came through again! BEST PASTRAMI SANDWICH hands down!!!!!!! I used to frequent Nate n Al&apos;s but had to find a new spot after they closed down. Grew up with Canter&apos;s but my taste buds have matured to Picky level. Langer&apos;s is the new family fave for us from now on. Can&apos;t believe we didn&apos;t try them earlier. 

Again, pastrami was outstanding. Cole slaw was a bit too sweet but people usually like sugar so it&apos;s a preference thing. Try and see what you think. Pastrami didn&apos;t look like much in the photo but that&apos;s only because the bread slices were thick. Trust me, it&apos;s loaded with meat! Good luck finishing one."
5,"Famous for there #19 and with good reason. Thickly sliced pastrami, chopped into smaller pieces, loaded with coleslaw to cut the fat and keep you going, sandwiched between two slices of double baked rye bread. 5+ stars

Matzo ball soup- 5 stars, broth was clean and flavorful. Very similar to the both in traditional chicken noodle soup with one large, spongey, and fluffy matza ball.

Brisket dip(sandwich)- 4 stars; French bread roll with brisket that was tender and fell apart to the bite, topped with cheddar cheese and came with dark au jus.  Although it came with a slice of pickle it, it was missing the crunch and freshness of veggies making it too heavy for me. I found myself gasping for air half way through my HALF sandwich. Go with the #19. You&apos;re welcome.

Steep prices for sandwiches. Total was $46 for a pastrami sandwich, a half sandwich with soup, and cup of oj. Don&apos;t venture, go with the #19"
5,"After having their famous pastrami, the number 19, numero uno, best fricking sandwich I&apos;ve ever had in 2013, I kept thinking and craving about this sammich for years.

I believe my quest was fulfilled that day, but I longed for more. So I kept on searching all over the west coast to see if a pastrami sammich this good could exist somewhere else. I&apos;ve search high and low, far and wide, over and under, but I couldn&apos;t find a pastrami sammich that even came close to this level. There&apos;s good ones out there....but this thing is just on another level. 

While on our way back home from our Disney visit on Monday, January 20, 2020, I informed the Wifey that we were stopping here and there was no stopping me. You see, there&apos;s been a couple of times that I wanted to stop here again prior to that day, but we always wound up somewhere else that she wanted to go. So on that day, I summoned the courage of Arya Stark and told her, &quot;Not today!&quot;

Just like some places in downtown San Francisco, this part of downtown LA is gritty, grimy, greasy, glaring and genuine. I&apos;m used to it, so navigating places like these is a natural skill. Sometimes you just gotta go to hell and back to get to the reward. We arrived here on a cool afternoon at approximately 1700 hours. We parked a block away and had a nice stroll to this iconic place.

Serving Angelenos since 1947, Langers is the west coast&apos;s answer to Katz&apos;s Delicatessen in New York. If you see someone moaning like Meg Ryan, that&apos;s just normal around here. Or maybe that was the 5150 performing a concert across the street lost in her own world. Whatever the case, that&apos;s what makes it quite an adventure and part of the experience.

Stepping foot inside is like stepping back in time. I don&apos;t think they&apos;ve changed the interior since they first opened. That&apos;s part of the charm of this place, but don&apos;t be expecting to pay 1947 prices for the sammich. Their sammiches are on the pricier side, but these aren&apos;t ordinary sammiches. And I was here on a mission and I wanted the # 19...a hot pastrami on rye with Swiss cheese and cole slaw with Russian-style dressing. 

After a long 7 year wait, I finally got to satisfy my craving and this sammich just melted in my mouth as I made a happy face like Mark Wien&apos;s &quot;yummy face&quot; on YouTube. Yes, it&apos;s that good and just like I remember it from my first experience. 

Now I gotta try their other sammiches. I heard the corned beef is also delicious. I also realized they have beef tongue. Holy mother of Mary and Joseph. I&apos;m looking at you, # 9. Now I got another reason to return.

5,"The best -- and fully functional curbside pickup. 

Highly recommend their classic #19, pastrami on rye with Cole slaw, Russian dressing and Swiss cheese. No better sandwich has been made. 

Chinese Chicken salad is pretty good... but this is not a salad place. No reason to come here to buy salads. It won&apos;t be amazing. Get a sandwich. #19 if you can. And tip well, these people are awesome and they deserve it."
3,"Although the #19 is quite tasty and definitely enough to share, when you practice IF and go 20-48hrs at a time without eating, when it&apos;s time to eat ITS TIME TO EAT!! With that being said, the #19 was sufficient for my one meal. However, as you can see by pics below, there was several pieces of fat and rind (maybe from another cut of meat) inside my sandwich. For a $20 sandwich I&apos;d expect more. Also, since I ordered delivery through postmates it ended up costing me about $27 (with delivery fee, service fee and tax), this did NOT include the tip. 

Please note, I&apos;d highly recommend ordering in person and picking up yourself. That&apos;s what I should&apos;ve done had I known delivery was going to take an hour. Since the sandwich has coleslaw it was a little soggy by the time it got to me. I did request to have the coleslaw put on the side and NOT inside the sandwich. I quickly received a notification from postmates saying the restaurant said it would be an EXTRA $4 to honor the above!! WTF?! That&apos;s a bit pricy just to have coleslaw put on the side and considering the sandwich is $20! I get it, the cost of the container and extra covid costs. Either way, just be aware if you&apos;ve never been to this business (like me). Stay safe and healthy out there!"
4,"It&apos;s been at least 10 years since I&apos;ve been back to Langer&apos;s but I finally made it back!

Stopped by on a Monday around 11am. There was no line and the Hot Pastrami Sandwich ($19.99) I ordered was ready in about 5 minutes. The prices and portion is comparable to Katz Delicatessen in New York. The sandwich itself was a little messy to eat so have lots of napkins close by! The pastrami was very good but the cheese made the sandwich a bit too oily. I&apos;m a West Coast girl so I definitely enjoyed the toasted rye bread!

There is generally a parking lot near by with validation but I&apos;m not sure if they&apos;re doing that right now due to COVID. We found metered street parking fairly quick but we did go on a weekday."
5,Had a craving for a Reuben so ordered the Corned beef / Pastrami one lb each combo. Came with a whole loaf of rye and I must say the best rye ever and some mustard. Both of the combo meats were great sliced nice and thin and tender with great flavor. First night we made the Reuben with my wife&apos;s homemade Russian dressing and the third night a Pastrami both with my wife Amy&apos;s Coleslaw. My craving was satisfied beyond my expectations. Oh I need to mention it was shipped on time through Goldbelly&apos;s. I definitely will do this again.
5,"The #19 is the pastrami sandwich of my dreams! I still remember the first time I ordered curbside to-go. It smelled so good that I took my first bite while driving on the freeway and literally moaned by myself in my car. The pastrami itself was just the right amount of fatty and salty. The bread was the perfect amount of toasty. The coleslaw, Russian dressing and Swiss cheese adds that certain &quot;je ne sais quoi.&quot; **chef&apos;s kiss** Honestly, I rarely give 5 stars because it means perfection -- but in this case FIVE STARS ALL THE WAY BABY! 

For those of you who can actually put it down and eat a whole sandwich and still need sides: the fries, coleslaw and potato salad are also very good accompaniments to the sandwich. But be forewarned, the order of fries is humongous so I hope you have an air fryer for reheating your leftovers."
5,Now that&apos;s a sandwich. It was rainy and I could tell I wanted to eat that #19 - it&apos;s something to believe it. I do.
5,"Pick up was super simple.  That&apos;s important...  otherwise , what can I say about this LA Institution that hasn&apos;t already been said?  They&apos;ve been doing this for longer than I&apos;ve been alive.  And for as long as I can remember this is what pastrami on rye is supposed to taste like.  They haven&apos;t lost that lovin feeling... do yourself a favor and just place the order already!"
