5,"Daikokuya just never disappoints!
Went last night for the first time during Covid-
Short wait and outdoor dining.
If you haven&apos;t eaten there yet, there are plenty of parking lots and the Village structure is right down the street.

They are known for their signature Tonkotsu ramen which is a hearty, rich broth made from pork bones. It takes hours to make and no one in SoCal does it better! This ramen come with 2 slices of pork, a perfect egg, bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, and a sprinkling of green onions. I have yet to find a more authentic, delicious ramen in LA!

PS: If you&apos;re wondering about the random bad reviews, do yourself a favor and look up the people who wrote them. Unless you too are a person who thinks AYCE &apos;sushi&apos; places who drench crunchy rolls in Teri sauce are 5-star worthy or swear that non-Japanese owned cheaper chain restaurants are better, completely disregard those few bad posts!"
5,"Never disappoint  Even if it was during the Covid period., Outdoor  Dining Food tastes as good as before.  My favorite thing here, how many times I have come here, first thing to order is pork kutsu over rice. The taste reminds me of my childhood. Everything is just right. If you in the area you should check it out."
5,"I&apos;ve been come here for years.  Never disappoints!     Waiting in line and dining in is what I missed the most.  lol

Due to COVID, takeout is the only option.  I usually order the Daikoku Ramen with a side of Tuna Sashimi.  So good!  There&apos;s a reason why this place has been so popular.  

Highly recommend this place!"
3,"recently here for a dinner because a friend of mine was craving for Daikokuya.

i always believe Daikokuya Little Tokyo is always the best branch among the others when it comes to the flavor. even though, the others aren&apos;t bad.

that particular evening, i wanted something else so ended up getting Tsukemen. my normal go to ramen is the Daikoku ramen. i got the ramen combo with the Chashu pork rice bowl. flavor-wise, the food was great. i have no complaint.

however, since we are eating outside and weather is a little chilly. the soup got cold super quick. so we just gotta eat it extra fast. i mean I&apos;m sure all of you understand that a room temp ramen doesn&apos;t taste as good as hot ramen. not gonna blame them about this.

another thing that was a little off for me was, there was no designated place for people who were waiting for table to stand. they were just standing all over the place. the table i sat was the closest one to the entrance so different groups of people legit stood next to my table for pretty much my entire meal and i felt a little uncomfortable with that. covid or no covid, i dont feel comfortable when there are random people standing less than 6FT to the table i sit on.

the food was great, it was overall wasn&apos;t really a good experience for me. first, food got cold quick. second, i wish they could designate an area for people who are waiting. due to covid, a few stores to the left of them were closed down and it was pretty much empty there. why don&apos;t ask those people to stand there?

will i come back? no if people still stand and wait all over the place."
5,"I get it every time when I&apos;m in Little Tokyo 

Very very good

I hope this place NEVER closes. 

I&apos;ve tried best Japanese ramen in New York 
But this place is in my top 2"
5,"I&apos;m not the noodle guy to say the least and so needless to say I haven&apos;t had many noodle meals and especially at a restaurant. This place was it though, I ordered up the spicy noodle bowl and it was very good, quickly came out and the service was awesome also, I will definitely come back and especially when it&apos;s cold outside like it was today on super bowl Sunday , thanks dudes , good food and I&apos;ll see y&apos;all very soon."
4,"My last review was from 5 years ago, let&apos;s do a COVID edition!

They used accept CASH only and no take outs but with the pandemic they had to update to credit cards and take out.

I came here a few weeks ago and let me tell you.... the street is popping! They reserved street parking area for outdoor dining and honestly, it&apos;s a bit crowded.

I ordered to go and got my favorites: daikoku ramen and takoyaki and the quality still tasted the same!

The bad thing about outdoor dining in this area is parking is even worst than before but of course people find ways to still visit and enjoy Little Tokyo!

All the employees were wearing a mask and social distancing can be hard to do sometimes."
4,"The food was AMAZING! We order for pick-up.  It was all there and the order was correct- when we upacked it all.  LOL! (now-a-days its not alwys the case- so I metnion this as a good thing). 
The have outside sitting and they are super busy.  
Its super difficult to find parking...TIP: go with another person for pick-up so one of you can circle around the block while the other one goes inside. 
We ordered 6 different dishes plus 3 different appetizers and it was all excellent!  I am confident that anything that you order here will be good."
5,"{Overall: 5; Food: 5; Service: 5; Atmosphere: 4}

So good. Daikokuya is my new favorite ramen.

*Daikoku Ramen: The noodles were cooked perfectly - basically the equivalent of al dente. The ramen broth was amazing. It was salty, creamy and flavorful without being overly rich or fatty. 

Love how you can add small donburi as a combo.

*Gyoza: The gyoza was topped with a heaping pile of green onions. The flavor and wrapper texture of the gyoza was great - I just wish it was a little crispier on the outside. 

Service was really friendly and attentive! All safety measures in place for COVID."
2,"Disappointing experience here recently. I remember a rich flavorful broth with fresh,  well seasoned ingredients. This past visit, I had cold, watered down broth with an egg that was still cold inside. Nothing stood out as exceptional or even good. What&apos;s worse is that I took a date here."
5,This place made accommodations for us at a little table near their outdoor dining area since it was still a little bit of a waitlist to sit down.  I appreciated their attention and time to make sure their guests had a great dining experience. I ordered the vegan spicy ramen and my husband got the Daikokuya tonkatsu ramen and he really enjoyed it.  I also ordered hot green tea since it was chilly outside and they did come by and check on us several times during the evening (I think to make sure they had tables for the rest of the guests on waitlist but I appreciated that).  Loved it here and would come back again to this location!
4,"Stopped by for lunch and got seated right away (outdoor seating only). They require you to first pay inside then bring out the food to your table. Our food came out hot within 5-10 minutes of paying so service was pretty fast. 

We got the tsukemen + beef bowl combo and the teriyaki chicken bowl - both came with salad and miso soup. The ramen broth was flavorful and the noodles were nice and chewy with a decent amount of chasu pork. The beef bowl was good but nothing special. The chicken teriyaki bowl was pretty much what you would expect as well. It was a generous portion of chicken but a bit dry. I think if I were to come back I&apos;d try a different rice bowl. 

Overall, this place was decent for a quick lunch. Portion sizes were generous and taste was pretty good as well, but nothing out of the ordinary. Service was fast, but something about the whole experience felt more cafeteria-like. Would recommend if in the area and looking for a casual experience."
4,"I truly enjoyed my food. Service was quick and friendly. I like that they offer ramen in 2 sizes, small and large. 
I&apos;ll be back again for sure."
4,"Still one of the top Japanese style ramen places to attempt to beat. Daikokuya is still on top of their game with a most delicious rich broth and unsurpassed history to boot.

Their side dishes are near equal, but you don&apos;t come here for a spicy tuna roll.

Pandemic orders in place, sparse dine-in availability is contingent on city orders, but take away is always available even for a late-night hunger.

Pricing is slightly above par and you can use a credit card now."
5,"Their outdoor seating was amazing and the ramen was incredible! We got the Daikoku Ramen and the Spicy Miso Ramen with some toppings and the Octopus Balls and Gyoza were fantastic appetizers. Highly recommend calling ahead to put your name down the day of, besides the wait it was fast service and amazing food!"
3,"I thought this ramen place was just ok. 

Pre-covid the lines for this restaurant was always super long. And given the yelp reviews I was expecting spectacular ramen. Unfortunately, that&apos;s not what I got.

COVID-19 precautions: there are able 6-7 tables outside. You enter the restaurant and put your name on the list and you have to wait outside. Once it&apos;s your turn they will call you back inside, you place your order, and you are seated. 

Service: service was great. Servers constantly coming by the table asking if anything was needed and refilling drinks. 5 stars**

Food: Ordered a few dishes:

1: Gyoza- Was not fresh. Received cold and chewy. Not a crispy spot on the dumpling even when it&apos;s clear that it was pan fried/seared. The gyoza itself was bland. It&apos;s saving grace was the dipping sauce.

2: Takoyaki- Pass. Served not fresh either. Received cold. Drenched in sauce. Takoyaki it self have one tiny piece of octopus and was very dense. 

3: Ramen- Was ok. If you like your ramen broth creamy then this is for you. I must say, the broth was very flavorful. The noodles were perfect for me. The bamboo shoots that are added were really flavorful. 

4: Oolong iced tea: I enjoyed.

Overall, I thought this place was ok. Total bill for 2 bowls of ramen, 2 appetizers, 1 iced tea, and 1 sake = $76.

I&apos;m glad I tried it but I will not be back.


Cheers!!"
4,"Must try-
Spicy Miso Ramen. This was my favourite! The spice and miso taste was just nice and made the soup super tasty!  The pork had the right amount of fat, which made the whole ramen taste awesome. 

Daikoku Ramen. I preferred the spicy miso ramen over this but this was also good. It tasted a little more bland compared to the spicy miso, probably because the soup had much less fat. 

The wait during covid period was pretty long so I&apos;ll recommend being there early. I reached the place at 7pm on Sunday night and waited 1.5h, given that there were only 4 tables outdoors. Service was good though."
5,"with how many reviews daikokuya has, i expected the ramen to be good, but didn&apos;t know it would be *that* good. 

my friend and i ordered the spicy miso ramen and the daikokuya ramen and i honestly couldn&apos;t say which was better ~ both were incredibly well balanced and full of flavor. i was worried the spicy miso would be too spicy, but it was absolutely perfect and i enjoyed every single bite. we also ordered a california roll on the side, and i couldn&apos;t believe how fresh it was; it was an excellent palate cleanser to cut through the saltiness of the soup. 

this was without a doubt the best ramen i&apos;ve had in los angeles so far and easily my new go-to takeout, especially in this colder weather."
4,"I&apos;m shocked that I never reviewed Daikokuya.

Daikokuya represents a key player in Asian American food history, at this point... Daikokuya Little Tokyo is one of the OG institutions in Los Angeles, and more importantly in the history of ramen in the U.S. Well-regarded ramen shops can now be found in just about every major city in the U.S. and Canada, with a huge explosion in popularity in the early 2010s. Back when Daikokuya opened in 2002, it was a whole different ballgame. Daikokuya was quite possibly the standard-bearer in its food category on this entire continent. Back in the days when 99% of Americans thought &quot;ramen&quot; was synonymous with instant noodles, long before Michelin-starred Japanese ramen shops could venture across the Pacific Ocean to open new outposts with the expectation of lines out the door on the first day, Daikokuya was consistently churning out bowls of legit, authentic tonkotsu ramen.

I&apos;ve had many better bowls of ramen since those days, but dare I say Daikokuya can still hold its own. A steaming bowl of Daikokuya ramen, kotteri-style, will never fail to hit the spot."
5,"Hands down best ramen ever! My partner and I decided to get a late dinner from here (one of the few places open pretty late during COVID so this was a plus), and we ended up getting the panshu pork bowl and daikokuya ramen combo with a small beef bowl! Everything was SO GOOD and so tasty! We were a little hesitant about going here since we&apos;re not big on ramen, but don&apos;t regret it at all! Definitely going to keep going back for their ramen. Their portions are pretty big so their dishes are totally worth the price. Not too expensive. 

We ended up eating a bit of the ramen for dinner, and then saving the rest for lunch the next day. Even on the following day the ramen was BOMB. Super mouth watering; writing this review makes me want to go at this very moment for some ramen.

You&apos;ll definitely keep wanting more!"
