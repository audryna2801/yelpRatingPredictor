5,"Beautiful, entertaining amd for everyone. Pre COVID there were lots of activities and I hope they will be back!! Little shops and ice cream parlors. Large stage. Seated places. Guards around to maintain safety."
5,"Out of town and wanted to try something off the beaten Vegas path, so are local friends took us here.. Super cool spot! Lots to look at, chill vibe w/ a stimulating environment, and delicious unique food and drink joints. We went to Bin 702 for food and drinks, and it kept us going for most of the night. Ended the night finishing our drinks underneath the stars in the outdoor chill spot, it was great. The staff here was super friendly too and also taking every precaution to be safe during this pandemic. The management was even gracious enough to help us the following day locate our friends lost phone... Will def come back next time I&apos;m in town!"
5,"I moved to Fremont street 2 years ago and as crazy as this city is, when I found this place I felt all anxieties melt away. The only thing I feel upon walking in is Peace. Its the only place I go to escape the shenanigans of Las Vegas. The Best vibe downtown and I highly demand that you check it out on Fremont street."
5,"Trying to find a place for the whole fam? 
Well checkout the Downtown Container Park.

Parking is street parking, or there&apos;s a decent size parking lot on S 7th street. 

We went during the day, and the whole family enjoyed it.
This place is amazing. It has a good amount of eateries and small shops. The best part of this place is  the huge  playground made out of shipping containers. Not only will the kiddos enjoy it, but the adults will too! 
I know we did. We took my two year old son, and he enjoyed himself.

There&apos;s a nice small courtyard where you&apos;re able to sit down and enjoy the food and beverages you bought while the kids run around. 

Definitely will try their bars out next time."
3,"My family and I came here one evening in January and we basically had the place to ourselves. We scored a parking spot near the corner of the entrance. It&apos;s a little sketchy over here so watch your surroundings. There were homeless people cursing near the heart statue in front and the huge praying mantis but I got some cool shots in afterwards. We were welcomed by the security attendant upon entering. Most of the retail shops and eateries were closed and there was no live entertainment probably because of the covid times. 

My kids had a blast running around the interactive playground with the treehouse. One of the employees showed them how to play the tag button game and played with them a bit. This was not a relaxing place for us we were literally running around after them up and down the slides and over to the concert train area. Certainly bring a jacket since it gets cold during the cooler months. They still had music playing, the trees were lit up, the glowing sign near the grassy area was cool, and the outdoor seating was nice. I think we were there for 1 hour and saw about 10 other people that&apos;s it&apos;s."
3,"This is probably not a fair review because of Covid.  We went there last night and they were supposed to be open until 12pm, but half of the businesses in there we closed or closed early. 

We really didn&apos;t get the full experience.  Would have been nice if there was a band playing live music  and all the stores and restaurants were open.  Best thing in there that was open was the little shop that sold every item in the store for $5 or less.  Employees were really nice and all the touristy stuff was cheap.  Some of the same items you see on Fremont street shops for $20 were $5 in this store. 

The container park is a nice concept and might have a better experience when Covid is over."
4,This place was clean and COVID precautions are taken seriously. There were quite a few restaurants closed but the kids had a wonderful time playing in the large treehouse playground. You can sit close and enjoy a beer while your kiddos play! Major plus!
5,"A downtown gem. It&apos;s a couple blocks away from Fremont, and it me a lot more chill, local vibe. There&apos;s a playground in the middle for adults and kids (giant slides, blocks and light game).  Lots of local boutique shops. Great bars/restaurants! The Downtown Terrace is a wonderful brunch spot (unlimited mimosas, all day everyday). Oak and Ivy makes delicious handcrafted drinks (try a Irish mule) and bin702 has great happy hour and cheese(ask about the daily special). There&apos;s different events hosted at the middle stage and live music. There&apos;s something for everyone!"
3,"Parking is $3/hour. You pay in advance as you remember your parking spot number. Three levels at the container park with multiple photo areas to get good shots. Many restrooms available. The middle is a large size playground for kids. The end is like a stage where I&apos;m sure they have summer performances. They offer multiple shops, bars and restaurants. Personally I didn&apos;t see myself trying out the restaurants and many were closed. The space on the outside looked relatively large but when we actually walked it, it was not that big. Cool concept and people are friendly."
5,"Hands down best grilled cheese sandwiches at BIN702! On top of that,  Devin, the security was so honest and sincere! I forgot my purse and he ran told return it to me! I  would recommend this place 1000%!!"
5,"Very cool place. You can&apos;t exactly do your back to school shopping but it&apos;s a fun place to hang out, people watch and have an experience. The world needs more places like this!"
4,Lots of street parking and easy to find right on Charleston ave a short walk to the Fremont experience. The Park is free  to walk through with a few places to eat and a couple shops they also have a stage but it&apos;s not being used because of the virus.  Worth stopping if your in the area
2,"You can&apos;t take drinks in, you can&apos;t take drinks out. If you get food from a nearby restaurant and try to take it in to eat with friends who ordered something in the park...they won&apos;t let you in. The taco place is just meh and takes forever. Lots of the few places inside are closed. Due to covid, aside from the main entrance, all of the ways in and out are padlocked...so I guess if something bad happens and people need to flee, you&apos;re screwed. It&apos;s pretty much just a park with fake grass, lots of kids and drinks that are way more expensive than drinks on and near Fremont St. I keep going back thinking it&apos;ll get better but so far it&apos;s just been a disappointment."
4,"Finally finally finally,

Things are starting to open Joy is starting to get back into the air here in Las Vegas. Soooo.

I decided to hit downtown and see what was open and see what I can find.

What I found was the container Park. I&apos;ve been wanting to go for a while now and finally did

This place is pretty awesome. Soon as you walk in you feel like you&apos;re in a different place. It&apos;s enclosed except for the front of course

It has lots of shops lots of restaurants it&apos;s a really nice place, they have an awesome playground and treehouse and really big slide for the kids. it&apos;s a great place to go and relax for the whole family, have some food, maybe some drinks, and watch the kids play on the playground and of course do some shopping.

This place is pretty cool. I&apos;m excited to go back. I recommend if you&apos;re looking for family fun, shopping, dining, and to let the kids let off some energy, this is definitely the place to do it. For the locals it&apos;s great, for the tourists it&apos;ll be great, it&apos;s not far from Las Vegas boulevard on Fremont Street and it&apos;s a fun hip place. I highly recommend."
4,"This place is great to hang out for the day! It has everything a family wants.. there&apos;s a playground for the kids, a variety of restaurants with outdoor dining, outdoor stage for live bands, and cute boutique shops for shopping ;) definitely recommend coming here!"
4,"Visited my daughter over the summer in las Vegas,  she took us to this cool spot on Fremont.  Its literally at one end of the strip before you enter into the frenzy of the casinos and other visitor attractions. 

I felt like the container area was a residential favorite spot. I loved the fire breathing locust or whatever  it is. I could feel the heat generated from the fire and I was across the street. 
Inside we got some drinks and walked around. They had a movie showing and many people sat on blankets and ate food while watching. It seemed very family friendly."
1,Very cute park. Went in there with a few other influencers to take photos.   Security was very rude dissing our photos. Then i mouthed off and said &quot;not like anyone would wanna see his bald ugly ass he said were 86&apos;d and escorted us out.  Haha.  No wounded the place is a ghost town with staff like that.  Highly recommend firing that guy mario.  Get a life rent-a-cop
4,"During a recent Lip Smacking Foodie Tour that I went on, it included a  walk-thru of the Downtown Container Park.  We didn&apos;t do much but walk thru it, but it&apos;s clear, it&apos;s earmarked for a &quot;Randy Berger&quot; return.  Very interesting indeed.

Shipping containers, stacked two stories high, make up the area.  Coffee shops, ice cream, BBQ, craft beer, hot dogs, boba, whiskey bar, tacos, pizza, waffles, jerky, and more.  That, along with, a park-like area, music &amp; performance stage, and several shops, definitely makes one wonder and dream.

#RandyBergerReturn"
2,"Had a great time and really enjoyed exploring the park until one of the guards, the taller bald guy was extremely rude to my friends and I and kicked us out simply for playing around in the jungle gym and enjoying the facility. Used to recommend this place to all my influencer friends but after that experience I&apos;m disappointed in the parks choice of workers and will find friendlier experiences in the area. Extremely rude...."
5,Devin was Really awesome and conducted himself in an orderly fashion!! Not to mention the park was really cool
