3,"BEST LOCATION ON THE STRIP- if you ask me. This is always our go-to hotel for our annual trips to Vegas for a multitude of reasons, location being one. 
It&apos;s right in the middle of everything which makes getting around super easy. 
The Linq has its own little strip located right behind it that is FULL of things to do and places to eat. 
The hotel rooms are always reasonably priced from my experience and the customer service there has always been great! Something we have recognized in the past which I think really shows a good deal of caring about your customers, is house keeping keeps track of everyone who denies service for multiple days in a row. If you have not been seen in 3 days, someone from the front desk will come up just to check in and make sure you&apos;re doing alright, which in a place like Vegas, is a really good thing to do. 
Some things I noticed this time around that weren&apos;t necessarily a problem, but a lack of attention to detail were: our lamp next to our bed  looked like the lamp shade caught the receiving end of a left hook. It was all crumbled up and looked as though maybe someone tried to straighten it out but not replace it. 
The corners of both mirrors in the bathroom were broken off on one side and the bathroom doors did not lock which made me feel a tad uncomfortable seeing as though I was staying with my boyfriends family and that could have gotten awkward. 
Something else that I noticed - there was a lack of sanitation stations. I LOVED that they had areas where you could get masks- that was great thinking, but I spent a great deal of time looking for the hand sanitizer and sani wipes to wipe things off before and after I used them and there was certainly not staff going around to wipe them off after every single time someone used them, that&apos;s just not manageable. 
All in all, the experience is always worth our return- this last time around was just lacking in the details to really put this place at its full potential ,which I would definitely like to see in the future."
3,"Quick trip to Vegas on Christmas Day and found a hotel stay deal for $17 yes $17!!! The resort fee was just as pricey but we enjoyed our stay for under $40 in Vegas. This hotel is conveniently located near lots of eateries and centralized to the strip. 
Free parking for guest which is a plus.
The rooms are nice, we had a view of the pool however due to covid the pool has been closed.
There is a $15 early check in fee however the concierge will hold your bags for free at no cost.
Upon arrival they will check your temperature and there are plenty of hand sanitizer stations."
4,"We enjoyed our stay at the Linq. There were no issues with the reservation or billing or noise. 

With fees and taxes we booked the hotel Thursday-Sunday for $272! I love the location. You are in the middle and have short walks to just about everything. The Linq strip has a ton of fun places to eat, drink and people watch. 

We chose a room with the high roller view. I loved looking out the window and see people on the ride. 

The rooms were clean and everything worked just fine. The only thing was the water pressure sucked, but, the water got super hot, so that&apos;s good...

I&apos;d stay here again. 

Here&apos;s a Las Vegas tip, you still have to wear masks everywhere, but, use the disposable masks rather than your own cloth masks. It gets pretty smoky and dirty everywhere, and since you&apos;re unable to wash your own personal mask, it&apos;s best to get a fresh mask."
1,"We stayed here this past weekend. I was excited to try this place out but from the start it was all downhill. 

The parking is terrible. You have to park in a parking garage and carry all of your things in. It&apos;s a pretty far walk and if you brought several bags, it&apos;s a PAIN!

The have kiosks for you to check in. There was 1 person behind the counter that was NOT friendly at all. I asked if she could help me by adding an additional night to one of my reservations. She was irritated to help me to say the least. She added the additional night then handed me a paper with confirmations on it and had me go to the kiosk. I have my rewards club but I couldn&apos;t apply them when I checked in at the kiosk. It was not easy to use in that regard. 

When we got into the elevators you had to use a room key to get to your room. Our keys weren&apos;t working then some of the elevators aren&apos;t reading them. It took us 15 minutes just to get on an elevator to get up to our room. Very frustrating.

The lights in the bathroom constantly go out. You have to push a reset button but it&apos;s super hard to push in and when the lights are out, it&apos;s super dark. I couldn&apos;t see anything and had to find a reset button that&apos;s on a plug. I was afraid of electrocuting myself.

The WiFi....is TERRIBLE! Don&apos;t even try to use it. 

Early in the morning some of the workers were in the hallway speaking to each other but yelling down the hall to speak. It was very unprofessional. This went on for almost an hour. It started around 8am. 

I tried to see about having a little later check out time but they charge you. I&apos;m leaving on a Monday but they still nickel and dime you. I&apos;m getting ready to check out now so keep your fingers crossed they don&apos;t throw anything else at me. 

I&apos;ll never stay here again."
1,"Worst hotel experience. We stayed at the Linq over Valentine&apos;s Day weekend and we were pretty excited. When we got there, parking was literally an ABSOLUTE NIGHTMARE. there are 20 floors for hotel rooms but only 4 parking floors so it took longer to find a parking spot than it did to wait in line for check in and find the room. They only have self parking and it&apos;s $15 a day on top of all the other itemized fees you will incur. The line for the elevator was horrendous so make sure you have time to wait to get to and from your room. Restaurants were closed to only those with reservations (which were impossible to get). The hotel REEKED of weed. Literally everywhere you went. It&apos;s cool if you smoke, do what you do, but that doesn&apos;t mean I want to smell it and smell like it for the duration of my visit. Walls are thin and the rooms were disappointing. 
Casino was okay, but good luck getting a drink while playing. Seemed like there were only 2 people walking around taking drink orders. 
Garbage. Will not be back."
1,"If you feel for your own safely I would avoid this resort at all costs. The amount of people here to cause a problem or looking for problems ..
 groups of gangsters are now walking the Linq Promenade and between that and the homelessness it&apos;s just mind blowing. 
The Rooms here are Micro-Sized and not enjoyable , no one is really practicing social distancing ,, you can have all the signs in the world to day lStay six feet apart&quot; but drink people don&apos;t care ... do yourself a favor , Avoid this part of the strip until 2022 when all of this gets cleaned up and fixed...


Your safety is not the Casino&apos;s priority, your cash is.

Again if you value your safety , go somewhere else ."
1,"BEWARE FALSE ADVERTISING!!!! 

When booked this hotel the pictures made it seem very clean and modern and upscale, little did we know this place was a smelly dump. Don&apos;t waste your time on this place you&apos;re better off going somewhere else. 

The LINQ is just refurbished trash. Finding the parking garage was a Indiana Jones temple maze. The outside looks modern and up to date but the inside looks like a Chuck E Cheese&apos;s. There&apos;s also tons of ghetto ass people everywhere I swear I thought I was at Circus Circus the Walmart of casino resorts. The rooms are meh, you can definitely tell they&apos;re just re-painted and they feel lifeless and empty. It&apos;s a refurbished hotel so I can feel all the old ghostly souls wondering through the hallways and rooms. 

I also tried to tip the lady at the front desk for checking us in so late but she literally threw my cash back at me which was rude, She didn&apos;t even say thank you for trying to tip or for the gesture. 

The entire LINQ smells like a burned down village from all the collected cigarette smoke from the past 60 years. The rooms also had marking on the walls scuffs and skid marks. 

I&apos;m definitely never coming back here ever again. Changing our hotel to Paris for the next night."
1,"The valet lady today thought I was a hooker or something because she sent me to the trash and told me that&apos;s wear the Uber&apos;s would pick me up. No one else was sent there. It&apos;s smelled really badly and I was so embarrassed because I was with my bf! This lady totally judged me by what I was wearing! I&apos;m disgusted by the valet lady. 0 stars for her. Don&apos;t look cute and sexy, the valet lady will send u to the trash sadly"
4,"Got this hotel at a great deal rate. We got the king suite for Valentine&apos;s weekend. The room was decent, a couple of issues here and there but nothing major. The room was spacious and the amenities were nice, wish they had a coffee maker though. What I liked the most was the hotel was located in a prime area you could shop and stop at a variety of places to eat. Overall, our experience was good, we&apos;d stay here again in the future for sure."
2,"Let me start by saying you have to make your way through a parking deck maze to get yourself to the hotel registration entrance. Once we finally made ourselves inside, we put our masks on and had to get a temperature check. You then wait in a line to get checked-in at a kiosk (very similar to the kiosk check-ins you see at the airport). It was pretty simple and straight forward. We then made our way through the maze of the hotel and up to our room. There were a few bags of trash sitting outside of our room which was kinda gross and weird but I guess they had just cleaned it. I was stunned to walk into our room and find that there was not a real window in the room. What was considered a window was covered in vinyl film so you could not see the outside as at all. On top of that the room was very small so it really felt like a prison cell. The shower curtain was dirty as well. I get anxiety being in a room where you can not see the outside at all so I called the front desk and tried to get switched to another room but they said they were not doing any room changes at all. I said I was happy to pay more to upgrade to a different room but they said there were no other rooms available. I looked online and saw that there were rooms &quot;with views&quot; available so I walked the long trek to the front desk and had to wait in the long check-in line again to be able to speak with a person. After chatting with the front desk manager for a bit and explaining the situation, she said that they did have suites available but it was an upgrade and it very much felt like she was insinuating that I would not be willing, or able, to pay extra for that which felt very judgy. Long story short, I was able to pay extra for a different room but I was pretty disappointed that I had to waste an hour of my time to get to the bottom of it. The suite we ended up with was nice with two bathrooms, a separate living room and bedroom, two windows with a view of the strip and it was only an extra $80 from the original prison cell room we had. I was shocked there was no mini bar or waters in the suite. 

We did not spend much time in the hotel other than in our room but the lobby and casino smelt a lot of smoke but I feel like that is every Vegas hotel. The location to get an uber was kind of far and it was very difficult to catch an Uber on NYE due to the fact they had to go through a long maze of cars and taxis to get to the pick-up spot. We just walked to the strip to get a better pick-up spot. 

TLDR:
I would not stay here again."
5,"We came to the Linq to ride the Ferris wheel.

I was so nervous because I am afraid of heights!

It was a wonderful experience. The ride is a half hour and it goes so slowly you barely feel it.

I would definitely ride again hopefully take part in the happy hour."
2,The parking structure is ridiculous  and the hotel elevators are also ridiculous. We waited 25 min for a elevator The room is decent however you can hear hallway noise. It&apos;s definitely a young crowd hotel. Will not go there again.
2,Hotel room was clean although when it was being serviced I found that one of my items I had brought to the hotel went missing. When it was time to check in it was terrible and unorganized. Elevators were constantly always be full. On the plus side the casino downstairs is good and the restaurant in the hotel is also good.
1,Let me start by saying don&apos;t even bother calling in for prices. They give you an amount you are going to pay which is for your room. After they take your card number and all your info they then rush through a disclaimer saying you are going to be expected to pay (once you get to the hotel)50$ a night deposit that is refundable (sketchy and weird it wasn&apos;t said upfront) and also a 44$ resort fee per night! That was more then they even charged me for the room! Aside from that I asked what that fee is for and she said it was for Internet access and gym. I mean I don&apos;t even pay that much for my gym PLUS internet for a whole month! Why will I pay that each night?!? The fact that they throw all this in at the end right after taking all your payment information is a scam. Either include it in the price and be upfront or don&apos;t do business at all.
1,I wouldn&apos;t stay here again even if the room was $1. Place is so dirty! Elevators don&apos;t work! Room smelt like straight ass
3,Room was jr suite very good room horrible view of the industrial alley way everything was closed due to &quot; pandemic &quot; even being a guest I couldn&apos;t get a ride on the linq very disappointed
5,"Yes it&apos;s not the four seasons or Bellagio, but my rating is based on price, location, and experience. We stayed for $12 plus tax resort fee
On a Sunday night. The room was clean,
It&apos;s all we needed. The casino was small, clean, and awesome.  In what other city can you get a nice hotel room for such an awesome price?, and we were right on the strip. 2 minutes from flamingo, 5 minutes from Caesars and 10 from bellagio! It was awesome! Love this place. And check out my pics, there was an alien watching us from the pool!  My advice try to stay during a Sunday thru Thursday period, you will save so much money, and you will be able to eat there breakfast spot hash house which is amazing!"
3,"Who remembers the Quad Hotel and Casino!? 

It was recently rebranded as the Linq and added more casino space and a brighter entryway from the strip. 

This place was literally a maze... 

The main entrance from the strip and side entrance from Harrah&apos;s was like a finding Waldo! 

If you were fortunate or unfortunate enough to stay here, you&apos;d remember how difficult it was to find your room or suite! You&apos;d be lucky to get to your high floor room via a working elevator.

I remember one time I was comped a suite which was great but it was located all the way up on their newly renovated towers.  I was so lucky yet unlucky because their damn elevators were broken... they allowed guests to use their service elevators! 

The rooms were tiny but clean. 

The balconies were a great feature but that&apos;s about it.

Valet was a great accommodation unless it rained and flooded.. yes it rains in Vegas and yes it floods! It made national news when I was there. Tons of insurance claims.  

The casino was always packed with dealer impersonators. Always fun and entertaining.

Limits on the table games were always amongst the cheapest on the strip.

Their staff were friendly but the hotel was old and definitely needed a renovation if not demolished. 

It always had an excellent location - snack dab in the middle of the strip!

Thanks for the memories and the rare room key which I have kept as a keepsake."
1,"If I could give it a -5 stars I would, very disappointed, I could hear the elevator all night long. I could hear the people that were on one side of me and the people above me, there was no view to speak of , my window faced the windows from the other part of the hotel, I got lost in the parking structure as I was leaving took me 15 minutes to find my car because everything is a big joke and a maze. They will not see me as a guest again."
1,"Centric hotel and modern deco. However finding a room is confusing and a looongest walk ever (no luggage assistance nowadays). Elevators always full, long waits. Room deco pretty ok, wished little bit more clean. A lot of noise between rooms, hall parties are common. Swimming pool maybe the most disapointing area at the hotel... not very clean, no spots available, not very sunny due to building, constant young underground party, towels and pool service should change their customer service, etc. Since there is plenty of hotel offer in the area, I would recommend another option."
