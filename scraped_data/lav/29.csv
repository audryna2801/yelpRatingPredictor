5,"Love everything about the Promenade. Located right in the middle of the Vegas Strip. Whether you want to ride the high roller (huge Ferris wheel), Get a quick bite at In-N-Out Burger, Gordon Ramsay Fish &amp; Chips or Starbucks. Dine in at one of the many restaurants, Shop at one of the many shops, my favorite is I Love Sugar, or just people watch this is the place to go. One of the best perks is when they re-opened after the Covid shutdown, the Linq waived all parking fees. In October 2020, they reinstated parking costs but Parking remains free to hotel guests, Caesars Rewards Card members (the player&apos;s card for the Linq and other Caesars Entertainment properties), who have reached Platinum, Diamond or Seven Stars, and Nevada residents who have i.d. (You must scan your local ID prior to entering the parking lot to avoid getting charged. Mask are required when walking around in the Linq Promenade. The Linq Promenade is a short walk from Caesar&apos;s Hotel and locates between the Linq hotel and the Flamingo Hotel. It&apos;s the perfect place to stroll at night, take in the sites, grab a bite, and do a little touristy shopping."
5,Everything you need right out side the Linq Hotel. Loved how many different restaurant choices there were and the shops were cool to. Ziplining was a blast my husband and daughter said. Fun times!
4,"Visited Vegas 2 weeks ago and stayed at the Flamingo for 5 nights. The LYNQ Promenade is located in between the Flamingo and LYNQ hotel connecting the two hotels with a walk across the street. The area is filled with will stores and restaurants. At one end is the Las Vegas High roller observation wheel and the other is Margaritaville and access to the strip. The area was busy in the evenings with people walking around and going to the bars. There is also a Starbucks that I visited every morning (shout out to Tanner the barista for keeping me caffeinated). Great place to grab lunch or kill sometime during the day. Check out Virgil&apos;s Real BBQ for lunch. The food was great, they also have a walkup window for to-go and bar ordering. This area is not like other shopping and dining districts in Vegas. Most of the restaurants are moderately priced and the shops are not high end. More souvenir/tourist type shops like you find along Freemont. The area was clean and roaming security mainly enforcing mask policies. With Nevada&apos;s COVID policies the shops and bars close at 10pm along the promenade but the Starbucks is very busy in the morning around 9am and the area becomes crowded around dinner time. If you are staying at any of the hotels around Flamingo or LYNQ it is worth checking out for lunch."
4,"No need to go down to Fremont Street when you can find almost same atmosphere here, in Shops, casinos, restaurants and people watching. I really enjoyed walking around and this area and all the shops &amp; restaurants it had to offer.  The main restaurant is the IN &amp; OUT Burger it was busy and non stop both times we came in but that is IN &amp; OUT!  My Favorite shop was the Ghirardelli Chocolate Company (hmm CHOCOLATE) Love this store!
They also have another well known name Starbucks at the end and busy busy busy (double the prices as a regular Starbucks) But I was in need of Coffee my 1st morning there.  For those that still play Pok√©mon Go like myself they have many stops &amp; gyms where you can play Safe and everyone is required to wear a mask!! Since the Promenade is a Creaser&apos;s property face coverings must be worn unless drinking, smoking or eating.. If you are a party person they did offer several bars and shops that sell those mega boozy drinks you can drink while walking around and it opens up to the Las Vegas Strip which sadly once on the strip they do not enforce the face coverings :("
4,"The Linq Promenade is like the Strips version of downtown Freemont experience. Just in the way that it&apos;s a good place to stroll about at night that is outdoors. You&apos;re not in a casino or club setting. There&apos;s bars, shops and restaurants and music playing that you can explore late into the evening. It&apos;s a nice change of scenery that isn&apos;t gambling and you are in the center of the strip.
     The Promenande is like an Alley way between the Linq and the Flamingo with the huge high roller in the center. So this is a favorite place for selfies. Brooklyn bowl is here, Sprinkles, In &amp; Out burger and other celebrity chef joints. There&apos;s a constant flow of people just parading through all day and all night.

5,"Wow this place is great. We were staying in a condo at the flamingo Hilton which is behind the flamingo. This was literally right next-door you just go out the back go around the bottom of the promenade and there you are. Right underneath that giant Ferris wheel contraption. I did not try that thing by the way because I can&apos;t imagine being in there for an hour with no access to a bathroom. However there are a bunch of cool bars and restaurants and it&apos;s a pedestrian walkway so you can be safe. I had a lot of fun and an Irish pub in that area.

As you walk out to the strip there is Jimmy Buffett&apos;s Margaritaville right there on the left. It&apos;s convenient to everything, also very close to Guy Fieri&apos;s restaurant which is completely fantastic. I found myself here pretty much every day we were in Las Vegas. If I go back I&apos;m gonna make a point of staying right here so I can stay in this area and come bcak"
5,"The LINQ Promenade is an outdoor shopping center between the LINQ and Flamingo resorts. 

There are many nice restaurants here, plus other shops and the High Roller. 

The Eastern entrance is hard to find, but it does exist. 

It&apos;s somewhat crowded, but it&apos;s outdoors, so it&apos;s probably safe enough. For this current summer, I&apos;d recommend visiting at night--it&apos;s too warm during the day."
5,"This is one of my favorite places on the strip. My husband and I usually stay at the Flamingo since it&apos;s pretty much in the middle of everything and having the LINQ promenade right next door is so nice when you want to do something and don&apos;t want to walk too far. There is so much to do with shopping, restaurants, and attractions. Would definitely recommend visiting when you come!"
1,What a joke.  There are 10 people in the entire walkway and they are charging for parking. Harrahs is truest worthless. I&apos;m in shock.  Avoid this dump.
4,"This is a super cool area located directly between the LINQ Hotel and Flamingo Hotel. There are many options for shopping and eating. It&apos;s also home to the FlyLINQ Zipline and High Roller. The area isn&apos;t very busy in the morning, but the crowd really picks up late morning to afternoon. We stayed nearby and visited this area once or twice daily. If you&apos;re not in the area, I think it&apos;s definitely worth stopping by."
5,This place was my favorite in Las Vegas for having a good time with friends. We got to drink and listen to music outside they havee great restaurants and desserts. We even had the courage to ride The Linq&apos;s zipline!! That was one of the great experiences I&apos;ve ever had even though I was very scared haha (: Can&apos;t wait to go back some day.
4,"This is a very nice area. It is an open air dining, shopping and entertainment center. It is located between the Flamingo and the Linq on the Las Vegas Strip. This is where the 550 foot tall High Roller is located. It is the world&apos;s largest observation wheel. 

There is so much to see and do here, the Fly Linq zipline is here. It&apos;s the only zipline on the Las Vegas Strip. I&apos;ve love the one at the Fremont Street Experience and this one is great with a 114 foot high launch tower and the zipline is more than 1,000 feet long. Nice view while flying through the Promenade. 

Jimmy Kimmel&apos;s Comedy Club and the Brooklyn Bowl are here, 32 lanes of bowling, several bars and live music. The live music venue seats 2,000. 

There are 40 restaurants and stores here with more than 200,000 square feet of space. O&apos;Shea&apos;s Casino is down here, there&apos;s a Gordon Ramsey and Guy Fieri&apos;s restaurants as well as an In N Out Burger, Chayo Mexican, Yard House, American Beer and Cocktails and many others. 

As far as stores there is a Harley Davidson store, Peir 30, Sky Shop, VR Adventures and much more. It&apos;s a great place in a great location a must do Vegas trip location."
4,"The promenade is a fun addition to the Las Vegas strip. We loved the restaurant selection, activities, and artists. The area is very clean &amp; accessible for people of all abilities. At Christmas the decorations are particularly pretty! We found the restaurants at the promenade were always easy to get a table at for 2 or 4. It&apos;s maybe an area not as well-known, so there were not any wait times. Also, the access to the Las Vegas Monorail was under construction while we were there but it was great to have access so close!"
4,"Located between The LINQ Hotel &amp; Casino and Flamingo Las Vegas, it includes the world&apos;s tallest observation wheel, the High Roller, and many other bars and restaurants such as O&apos;Sheas Pub Las Vegas, Tilted Kilt etc. 

It&apos;s a fun little promenade to walk through. It&apos;s fun to sit outside and watch the Zip Liners go past. I liked going on the High roller during sunset. I also enjoyed bowling at Brooklyn Bowl. I haven&apos;t tried the zipline yet. The place is clean and well- maintained.

The parking lot to the promenade requires a little walking but worth it. I believe it&apos;s $12 to park but when validated it&apos;s free. 

There&apos;s a beautiful fountain and free shows every evening I believe. Esp. during chinese new year... they have spectacular performances. Overall, a great place to people watch, eat, shop and play."
5,"What a fun little promenade to walk through.  
The parking lot to the promenade requires a little walking but worth it.
It&apos;s $12 to park but validated it was free. (We had dinner here and went to see the Mat Franco Magic Act. ) 
Looking up, we saw people ziplining which looked fun and a gigantic, slow-moving ferris wheel. Maybe next time. 
There are several choices for lunch or dinner here and my fave place to stop by outside of Beverly Hills, Sprinkles Cupcakes! 
There&apos;s a lovely fountain and a great place fo people watching too. I prefer places like this as good alternatives if you have kids with you.
This fun pocket reminds me of a little Universal Citywalk and 3rd Street Promenade. Shop, eat and walk through."
3,"This is a really cool little area just outside the Linq casino/hotel. Many, many shops, bars and restaurants. 

The walkway leads you up to the Linq Roller (yawn). 

We stopped in the Yardhouse, Tilted Kilt, Socks and Bottoms, Favorite Bistro. A nice variety of food and merchandise. 

Misters are on because it was nearly 105F every frickin&apos; day. 

It&apos;s worth a stop."
5,"Great spot for you to enjoy your day and night at. So many different venues and activities for you to enjoy and or watch people ride the Zipline. 550 feet above the ground, you fly across people walking though the Promenade. Prices start at $25.00 and up. A must do if your dare devil.
The other cool attraction is the High Roller, I call it the Ferris Will. The view is amazing. Prices vary,more at night.

For your Dinning experience I would recommend, Guy&apos;s Fieri&apos;s kitchen&amp; Bar,Flour &amp; Barley,brick oven pizza and Gordon Ramsay, Fish and Chips.
There&apos;s several other eateries these 3 are my Favorite when I&apos;m in this part of the strip.
During the Holidays the Promenade had live entertainment and the whole area was decorated in Christmas decor.
The LINQ Promenade is part of the Caesars Entertainment and there&apos;s more being built.
A must visit when your in Vegas.

4,"I love the Linq promenade, there&apos;s so much to do here.  Jimmy Kimmey comedy club, great sushi burritos, an ice bar and even some street entertainment.  This all leads to the high roller.  There is a lot of action in this small place.  It&apos;s really fun to walk down at night when you see all of the lights, smell all of the food and go into some stores.  The LINQ promenade is considered an area and isn&apos;t one actual thing....really plenty of things to do in one area.  They also have a really cool zipline over top which goes much faster than the one at Fremont.  Also the In N Out burger there is clutch.  An affordable and tasty option on the strip, pretty cool spot."
2,"My cousins and I stayed here for one night before our other resort room was available at another hotel for the rest of the weekend. The place has self check-in kiosks, which normally is cool with me, but it had so many glitches, that it was frustrating to get it figured out, especially the parking ticket issue. 

Room with two beds were really small, basic and nothing glamorous about it at all, which is funny because even Circus Circus has better rooms than this place. 

As we were leaving to go out, we saw a Prostitute waiting outside of someone&apos;s hotel room and people who stayed here are rather rude. A woman was trying to press her room floor in the elevator, I told her that she needs to swipe her card first to press her room key and she jumped down my throat. I guess it&apos;s expected when you&apos;re staying at a lower-end hotel. 

Glad I tried this place out, never again."
2,"Its okay. Only good place to eat is Gordon Ramsays fish n chips. Its the same shops you see everywhere else but with more dining options just nothing else for me. I have eaten at some of the other places but none of them were anywhere I would return to. There is a huge lack of places to sit. Even before this virus bullshit there weren&apos;t any good places to just sit and people watch, relax, etc. A few years down the road and here we are still the same issue. I have seen a lot of turnover in the eating as well as the retail spaces."
