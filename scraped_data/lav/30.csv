5,"Another COVID review, of course. One of the best things that we experienced during our stay was the cleanliness of the hotel - so much, that my boyfriend shared that on several occasions. 

More than enough staff members in the area and stationed at key points - elevators, escalator rails, entrances with infrared tech. It was awesome, definitely more than other hotels.

Rooms are spacious, perfect for a family or if traveling with friends. 

Despite the wonderful things Venetian/Pallazzo offer, we probably wouldn&apos;t stay here again due to the location which is key when staying on the strip - it doesn&apos;t seem far but it is, besides we found ourselves traveling to &quot;the other side&quot; quite often. It&apos;s just a personal preference and wouldn&apos;t dock a star for that reason. Overall, it&apos;s a great hotel!"
4,"During our stay in Vegas, we originally booked our room with the Venetian. However, upon checking in, we were offered with the option to upgrade to a suite in the Palazzo. So glad we went with it because I really enjoyed my stay! We got the Double Queen Luxury Suite on the 42nd floor. It came with a super spacious bathroom with his and her sinks, a makeup vanity area, an amazing bathtub, and a standup shower. It also had a living room area with an amazing view of the strip. My favorite part of my stay was that bathtub - I came downstairs into the Grand Shoppes, bought some bath bombs and bath bubbles from Nectar, came back up, and took two baths during my stay. They include a mini TV in the bathroom, so I had it on during my bath. So relaxing! 

Other pluses include (1) free parking, (2) staff members managing the elevators so it&apos;s not overcrowded during COVID times, (3) really REALLY friendly staff, (4) and high quality lotions and soaps. Yes, I normally do not care for the complimentary soaps and lotions offered at most hotels, but the ones at the Palazzo smell like heaven. They were also thoughtful enough to offer COVID-specific freebies like hand sanitizer bottles, wipes, and masks. It&apos;s the little things! If the Palazzo offered a microwave and fridge, my stay would&apos;ve been perfect. With COVID happening, we ordered a lot of meals to-go. By the time we got back to the hotel room, our food was cold so an option for reheating would&apos;ve been excellent. Next time I come back to LV, the Palazzo would be a solid option."
5,"I chose the Palazzo over The Venetian because of the modernized room. The Palazzo was nice to offer a complimentary suite for healthcare workers, which I redeemed for this visit. Although there wasn&apos;t much to do on the Las Vegas strip, The Palazzo&apos;s amenities and suite was more than enough to compensate.

My Queen Luxury Suite was on the 42nd floor, which had a separate elevator access from the rest of the floors. The room had a great view of the strip and beyond. The suite was very spacious with a small step of stairs separating the bedroom from the living room. The architecture of the room was very sleek and modernized.

The amenities included 3 TVs (bedroom, living room, bathroom), control panel drapes, vanity mirror, double sinks, and bathtub and standing shower. I requested a fridge, which they brought up a dorm sized fridge. They also have &apos;medicine&apos; fridges as well. 

The only downside was there was no microwave available. That means if you have food leftovers, they&apos;ll most likely be cold if you leave it out for awhile. I think this was to get guests to buy food from the in-room dining menu or food court.

Due to COVID, I was mostly wandering inside the hotel, which has great amounts of shopping due to the Grand Shoppes. There&apos;s also a gondola ride service for pay that takes you within the Venetian waters.

Parking at this hotel was free and easy to locate with many spaces available. Check-in was a breeze and I was able to check-in at The Venetian since both hotels are connected to each other."
4,"The Palazzo suites are great, very spacious and the sunken living is a nice touch. They offer the largest standard accommodation on the Vegas strip at 720 square feet. But they are usually near the most expensive for a base room on the strip, also be careful about the $45/night resort fee.

5,"During my trip to Las Vegas, I ended up playing here the most at both the Palazzo and Venetian.  

If you are new and play quite a bit, I would sign up as their free play is very generous compared to most places.  I do not understand their point system at all, but I did ended up getting over 47,000 points and I ended up getting around $200 dollar worth of slot play which was nice as I used it to get back my loses.  I ended up playing their for 12 hours I would say going back and forth from the Palazzo.  They have this big even in November for members as I racked up a lot of points, but I wonder if I can order the stuff online as mentioned.  I had a very good day as I was able to get around $700 dollars worth of winnings only to loose back $400 in an hour and a half.  My bets are usually around $1.50 to $2.40 range depending on the game.

Unfortunately, I found out they had now they had a glitch in the system over the weekend so I ended up getting only 4700 points.  I am assuming 1 point per dollar play sounds right since I spent 4 days there.  So no gold status anymore.  But I enjoyed the free play and they during that time and in return they got me to gamble quite a bit and got back their money I won from them.

The Palazzo was not as crowded as the Venetian and I ended up winning more there too as well. They have different games there like the Raging Rhino and their is a similar one to that one.  Lots of 4 Towers from Aristocrat as they had 10 of them.  I ended up winning over 450 on one of them and then another 100 dollars on Lightning Link too.  I ended up spending more time gambling at the Palazzo, but keep in mind that the selection of games is not as good, but I was winning here more and I do better when the crowds are less that is why I am a morning gambler.  Overall the walls are really high here and the ventilation is great."
5,"It is a beautiful hotel! I&apos;d say overall the most elegant on the Strip.

The whole enormous complex is very clean, lavish, and spacious. We enjoyed our various walks inside and outside the hotel, including the wonderful airy atrium. The Venetian canal shopping area is a classic in Vegas.

Even during with current COVID conditions, the hotel does a great job with temperature screening, constant cleaning, complimentary masks and hygiene kits, and other measures. The air is consistently less smokey than other hotels which is reassuring and may attest to good circulation / filtration.

Our hotel room was an enjoyable suite. it was not overwhelmingly large, but overall very roomy and comfortable. The layout is well done and the views of the strip from our room were nice (though other hotels near the Bellagio fountains are the best Strip view in my opinion). I do wish the room had at least a coffee maker, though they offer room service coffee (for a price).

The food options are excellent, including Yardbird, and the pools are lovely (even in cooler weather). Service was excellent throughout.

Overall, a fantastic hotel."
5,"I love the shopping mall here it reminds me that I am in Italy and looking up at the blue skies. This casino, hotel, and shopping mall is very modern, clean, and has great staff. They have all types of stores from luxurious to the most common as well."
5,"Great Covid-19 safety measures in place!

My bf and I have stayed at the Venetian (in the Venetian tower) before and loved it.  This time, we stayed in the Palazzo tower on the 50th floor, the Paiza Club level.  The suite was amazing.  It had a large living room, 2 restrooms, a bedroom, vanity area, and a large walk-in closet.  It was 2000 square feet and housed a piano, 5 televisions, a jacuzzi tub, and pool table.  The automated window coverings were a nice touch.  Being the highest floor in the state of Nevada, the view was spectacular.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. 

Despite the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, we felt very safe.  They seemed to have taken all precautions- plexi-glass everywhere (bathroom sinks, casino tables, etc), every other slot closed off to allow for distancing, masks enforced, elevator capacity limited to 4, hand sanitizer dispensers everywhere, thermal scanning at elevator bays to rooms, people stationed at high touch areas assigned just to wipe down whatever was touched...  
Cleanliness throughout the hotel and casino were immaculate.  We were impressed.  

Security to the tower was great.  Security was stationed on the first floor in front of the elevator bay and you needed scan your room card to pass them.  

Service was outstanding.  We checked in on the Venetian side with Michael.  Michael was professional, friendly, super personable, down to earth, and helpful.  Other staff we encountered from housekeeping to security were wonderful, too.

I highly recommend the Palazzo!"
5,"We had an incredible stay at The Palazzo since our last visit in 2019.  We decided last minute to come to LV on our last stop of our honeymoon road trip.  We initially booked at Venetian which is their sister property right next door.  However, the hotel clerk suggested we upgrade to the Palazzo for a better strip view.  

Upon arrival, the staff was beyond accomadating.  We were in the long check in line and were prompted to another area for faster service.  The concierge and front desk were exceptional.  Kudos to housekeeping for the immaculate room service.

The Palazzo is a chic and modern hotel located at the north end near the Wynn and walking distance to the Fashion Show Mall.  There current health guidelines make you feel safe to stay and play at their casino.  They implement mandatory face masks and gaming tables have a 3-person max with plexi glass barriers.  There are a wide selection of good restaurants: Cut, Lavo, Bouchon and many more.  The Grand Canal Shops are for those who want to spend their winnings on high end designer merchandise.  They recently opened a Boba shop (The Alley) here as well.  The little things that get me excited.

The decor is so beautiful with chandeliers all over the casino area.  The hotel has all suite rooms. The rooms are elegant and makes you feel right at home.  The sunken living room is luxurious and comfortable.  The bathroom has a double vanity, powder table, and a soaking tub.  You can even watch TV in there.  The Palazzo is now my favorite place to stay when I&apos;m in Sin City.  Thank you for a wonderful honeymoon experience!"
5,"I do believe this is the safest spot on the strip for those wishing to venture to Las Vegas and have Covid-19 concerns in mind. 

From the moment I entered the elevators, there was someone wiping things down. 
Temp checks upon entry. 
Workers wiping down escalators. 
Staff wiping down check-in area. 
Hand sanitizer stations at the ready. 
Social distancing enabled room service

The staff is to be commended for an exhaustive job well done. 5 star hotel lives up to its reputation."
5,"Stayed here back in January. Rooms are the same as the Venetian side so love it! Big and clean!

This side doesn&apos;t really have that many restaurants that open late, you will have to go to the Venetian side for a few late night options."
4,"Palazzo is a bit under rated versus the fancier places like wynn or even venetian.  

The casual dining is good and less crowded than other places, as well rooms are at least as good.

\\"
5,"During COVID lockdown procedures - 

Went here for a stay vacation and loved it! Checked in on Friday for a
one night stray but it was fantastic. As some locals know, there&apos;s been a concern for safety on the strip. During my stay, the only way to get to the room is if you had a active room key. 

Also, asked for a bottle of champagne and balloons to be there when I checked in. Worked out perfect! 

Now, we had a lot of in room dining service. It took awhile for them to answer, but I&apos;m sure they are working with only a portion of there staff. 

Huge, clean rooms with a additional security!"
5,"There is nothing more exhilarating than placing a large bet on your favorite sports team,  your favorite card game or even a max bet on a slot machine - the sheer thrill of the anticipation.  It&apos;s a journey of emotional ups and downs. It will leave you either clutching your head in agony in the realization of your loss sets in or alternatively jumping for joy as you come to terms with your unbelievable luck as you look to the heavens in appreciation.  The chasing of this feeling knows no bounds and many people fall victim to this never ending cycle. If you play it right and listen to the gambling genius also known as Kenny Rogers - you&apos;ll eventually know when to hold em and when to fold em... or you don&apos;t.  

Las Vegas to me has been my playground.  You either hate it or love it but I&apos;ll admit the casinos know how to take care of their players.  At least they did for me.  Whether I won or lost, I was always invited back with flights, limos, suites, show tickets and endless amounts of liquor and food. Who doesn&apos;t love being pampered!? 

This was all before the financial crisis of 2008.  I remember getting a comped suite at the Palazzo with several grand in cash and free play as well as food! Times were good. I was making a decent living from both work and the stock market... those were the days when casinos were giving out cash like it was going out of style.  I&apos;m glad my gambling addiction is long gone and for the better.  

Thanks for the memories though."
5,"So happy were here. We were at Cosmopolitan for 5 days where  a dealer assualted my husband. She denied her action and we had to file a report and had asked to look at the cameras. So follow up was never taken or anything. It was so rowdy over there and a fight broke out during our stay where I saw blood on the floor. Employees there didnt even take any precautions. Alot of people not wearing masks. 

Here at Palazzo, they take Temperature check,provide complimentary masks everywhere, 4 people max on elevators and people are alot more considerate here. Clean and Classy. We are never disappointed in our stay here."
5,"Given the current situation with the world, this hotel has done all it can to make sure guest feel safe. From clean bathrooms to making sure all guest wear masks, I felt very safe during my stay at this hotel. 

I originally had booked for the venetian but I received an invite for a bigger room upgrade with a view at the sister hotel The Palazzo. Is a better option for those who are not ready to be in crowds of people. The Palazzo is quiter, smaller in comparison and the casino is half the size of the venetian making for a much more relaxed environment. 

The hotel staff at both locations do a good job at following all covid rules. You will however see a few people walk without mask in the hotel, but is expected. Theres no enough staff to follow everyone around and making sure they keep their mask on but overall if they see someone without a mask they will address it. I did see a couple securities who were not exactly fond of enforcing the rule. But it&apos;a okay not too many walking around. The real problem is when you step outside the hotel. No one wears a mask.

Because the hotel is smaller and you are staying at one of the luxurious hotels in vegas there is not a lot of cheap eateries. The grand lux cafe located inside will be your cheapest closest option. Not to worry it is good altho not very cheap but the cheapest inside. The venetian does have a bit of a small food court if you dont mind walking to that side. You also have an easy walk to the grand canal shops where there is a much bigger food court with a chipotle and a panda. But due to covid season it closes early at around 7 and of course it is a much longer walk. 

If your looking for a place to stay while in vegas during corona season and want to feel safe, then this is the place. While some things can be improved such as long wait times for the elevators and possibly no pool access during your stay. The experience is a great one and the rooms here are elegant."
5,"Came here during covid and upon checking the rooms seemed very clean and they even give you a welcome pouch with extra masks, hand sanitizer, and other little things."
4,"Fabulous accommodations. The restaurants are unbelievable. Live music upstairs by the shops. Social distance enforcement. Masks required. Clean. Not smoky or dingy feeling. The dealers at the tables could be nicer. Two of them were strait up rude for no reason so we went and played black jack at the computers at the bar, and actually won our money back we lost at the tables. I&apos;d definitely come back to stay here. I feel covid-safe, but I&apos;m still able to enjoy myself. The best part was the free live music. The band was great. And the food. You really don&apos;t need to go outside the hotel to have a great time. Plus it&apos;s a gorgeous property."
5,"Walking through these beautiful hotels that are made preety much like malls with sleep in suites.
All of the restaurants and stores. Jist walking through the hotel you get lost looking at all the detail. Everything about the inside of this location is a must see experience when hanging in the Famous Vegas Strip. (Once you come inside you should expect about 3 hours of indoor exploration.The decorations that showcase miniature parts of the World here the experience is Venice, such a nice transformation."
3,"I. Pre-planning 
We originally booked cosmopolitan and determined that it might not be too Covid friendly. We booked at the palazzo for their one bedroom suite 2 queen beds. 

The price was great for their Covid friendly environment with the suite that we received. The ability to feel at ease at our hotel with a great room type.

II. Entrance in to hotel

It is the first expression that matters upon entering the hotel. 

A. Safety 
The Palazzo takes Covid seriously from glass separators, free antibacterial, free face masks for guests, and their staff wearing masks and gloves.

B. Stores
The stores that normally don&apos;t have a sale had sale signs of percentages off on taped on their door. The businesses close earlier. It is worth still shopping at the Venetian stores.

C. Restaurants
Most the restaurants had options for reservations or just to walk-in. The preference was reservation to control Covid safety.

DAY 1 
Lunch

We ate at food court and grabbed a cheese pizza with a philly cheese steak sandwich and fries. Food hit the spot for our first eatery in Las Vegas.


Dinner
We decided to try the number 1 yelped restaurant in the Venetian called SUSHISAMBA . It&apos;s price was $$$. The food wasn&apos;t appealing and taste as common as a $ restaurant.  SUSHISAMBA isn&apos;t on my first place to eat at anymore. 

II. Rooms

A. Living room


B. Bathrooms 
Our room is located on the lowest floor 40 as requested.  The one bedroom 2 queen suite has 1-1/2 bath with a TV in the full bathroom. Having 2 toilets makes it easier when you have more than 2 people in the room. The 1/2 bathroom can hear people in the hallway. 

C. Sleeping Area
Night 1
The beds were as soft as feather which allowed us to sleep. We were awaken around 11pm to 1am by someone on the 41st floor jumping onto the ground. 

III. Pool

A. Covid enforcement
The staff wear their masks around the hotel including the pool area. The seats are sanitized with a towel on to of the seats. The chairs are 6ft per pair of chairs front, sideways, and back. There are security staff enforcing face masks. There is a speaker indicating to enforce social distancing. 

This is where I have to ask how the mask wearing rules are enforced:

1. No one wears masks in the pool.
2. People going in and to other pools are not wearing masks.
3. People are on chairs not wearing masks.
4. Life guards by pool with no face masks.

I had looked around and noticed that not everyone was wearing a mask while on a chair. I had to take my Pepto from a night of toilet visits and my mask was half off to take my pills. I was told to wear my mask by the security guard. My girl indicated that the same guard didn&apos;t enforce on the rest of the guests on other chairs. Too much power? Or selected because I look Asian looking?  Was I to be the example?  

As I walked out of the pool area,  a mixture of people were on chairs with masks off and staff were not enforcing on them. It was that one moment where I got selected to made an example off by one staff member security guard that may have been on a power trip that made the start of my day worse off. It took this one security guard to make me evil eye the rest of the staff and it was the same security guard that made not feel relaxed at the Palazzo pool. Palazzo management, please educate your staff not to select 1 person and to enforce on everyone. This made the start of my second day feeling upset and fired up, I came to relax and enjoy the pool. I didn&apos;t go into the pool today. I got upset with my girl and now this trip is starting to suck. Please be equal when enforcing non-mask wearing. Was still fired up at the time of my disagreement with my girl.


B. Quantity with Quality 
There is a total of about ... to be continued at the end of the trip. Still at the Palazzo."
