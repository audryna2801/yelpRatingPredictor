4,"Grand Bazaar Shops is a nice group of stores in an open-air setting. I came here during the pandemic--some shops were closed, but most were open.  

The outdoor setup isn&apos;t the best idea for Vegas as it gets hot in the summer. It was around 115 when I was there, and I definitely did not want to spend too much time looking around."
5,Grab yourself a drink here and roam around the shops. Great way to pass time with friends in this very lively and happening streets.
3,"Grand Bazaar Shops are just that, bizarre. It&apos;s located in front of Bally&apos;s. This is more or less a tourist trap. It has a few independent and local places but it&apos;s mostly chains. There&apos;s also the typical bars with oversized frozen margaritas. 

It gets stars for having a few great places in it to eat. First there&apos;s Istanbul Mediterranean. They have a fantastic falafel pita. It&apos;s pretty big. Right next to this is Marash. They have ice cream and sorbet. It doesn&apos;t have much seating outside the bars. Luckily the food is portable. A few tables are located in the middle of the shops but good luck finding anywhere to sit if there&apos;s a crowd, which almost will be always. The rest of the shops stink. 

A good thing is that the shops are open late. If you need something after a crazy night out you can get it here. The falafel, ice cream or sorbet are good all times."
3,"We had plans to dine at Giordano&apos;s, not knowing that it was in the Grand Bazaar Shops.  In fact, we didn&apos;t even know about the Grand Bazaar Shops.  We walked by several shops/eateries on our way to Giordano&apos;s, but didn&apos;t stop in at any until after our meal.  We actually spent a good hour browsing, but most of that time was spent in It&apos;s Sugar.  (BTW, It&apos;s Sugar turned out to be a great place to find a White Elephant gift!)  There were several restaurants that looked good, but we had already eaten unfortunately.  The Grand Bazaar Shops seem a little lacking in quality stores, though it is a nice change of pace from the high end brands of most of the other LV Strip malls.  The walkways feel a little narrow and claustrophobic, and had there actually been people in the shops, it probably would have felt cramped.  Overall, I&apos;m glad to have passed through, but we probably would not stop by again."
3,"Born in February 2015, the Grand Bazaar Shops is a 2-plus acre Grand Bazaar themed open air restaurant and retail complex fronting Bally&apos;s in the heart of the Las Vegas Strip. With the Linq and the Park it is one of the more recent developments extending the Strip outwards. When it first opened in 2015, it reflected a West Coast version of the infamous Turkey Grand Bazaar Shops meets Downtown Las Vegas Container Park. In its infancy stage before CVS opened it featured 120 shops that were primarily unique mom and pop shops. In my earliest days of visiting, it seemed that it&apos;s future were mom and pop shops with a possible retheming of Bally&apos;s to the Grand Bazaar. Four years later it is a different place. It is a place that I will share with you the reader.

  The Grand Bazaar Shops is truly the Grand entrance to Bally&apos;s. The best thing I can say about it is that it is a great use of space that had been underutilized going back to the days when Bally&apos;s was the original MGM Grand. For decades it was an uninspiring linear garden that separated Bally&apos;s from the Strip. What it did was connect Bally&apos;s to the Las Vegas Strip.

  During its first four years, it reminded me of the Downtown Las Vegas Container Park. The reason is that the majority of businesses looked like they were based in oversized containers under a Grand Bazaar themed roof. Today the tenants include Tix 4 Tonight, Giordano&apos;s, a 24 Hour CVS, Blue Ribbon Chicken, Subway, Turkey Ice Cream, a Tiki Bar, and Wahlburgers. Much of the activity occurs on the main outdoor corridor bridging Bally&apos;s to the Las Vegas Strip. Interspersed on the main corridor are cushioned (some with umbrellas) benches with a grand view of the Eiffel Tower, Swarovski Starburst, Bellagio Fountains, and Bally&apos;s. A Giordanos patio restaurant occupies a good part of the center.

  I&apos;ve caught its act since March 2015, a month after it came to life. The first time that I laid eyes on it was a few times during a week long family staycation. Since it opened, according to my Yelp check-ins I had been here 52 times. Because it is in the center of the Strip, this has been a nice rest stop. Especially when Starbucks was here from 2015 to early 2019. Post-Starbucks I regard it more of a nice spot to sit on a cushioned sofa bench than to shop. I enjoy sitting down and taking in the views of the Eiffel Tower, Bellagio Fountains, Swarovski Starburst, and Bally&apos;s. Especially at night. Now that the Starbuck&apos;s passed on, I prefer taking out a 24 ounce cold beer from its CVS and drinking it while admiring the sights. As far as shopping, it isn&apos;t saying much that I think the best tenant is CVS. As far as shops a current sight are corridors of closed down ones. The left side of the main corridor lost all its shops. This eyesore will be alleviated when an It&apos;s Sugar complete with an oversized gumball machine replaces the dead shops. For the record, they lost a very nice Starbucks, a Redneck Riviera, Swarovski Boutique, and Lodi&apos;s. In my opinion, when a Starbucks closes it is not a good sign.

   One business I&apos;d like to see go is the paid parking. The host property Bally&apos;s charges $15 a day for the parking garage that also serves this complex. 

   The restaurant situation is better. My family and I enjoy dining in Giordanos. I thought that Blue Ribbon was decent.

  The main attraction is the Swarovski Starburst. Throughout the day and night it is eye candy that is just as sweet as the candy It&apos;s Sugar will soon be selling. At 9:00 pm and midnight it really comes to life with a 3 minute sound and light show. Co-starring with the towering Swarovski Starburst are the Turkish themed roofs that change colors. In my opinion the Swarovski Starburst is the attraction 24/7. With Starbucks gone, my favorite Grand Bazaar Shops activity is sitting on the sofa cushioned bench that overlooks  the Swarovski Starburst, Eiffel Tower, and Bally&apos;s Jubilee Tower to the north and the Bellagio Fountains Show to the west. The Grand Bazaar Shops is also a grand spot to capture the Bellagio Fountains. Especially from the upper level Giordanos.

  Although the Grand Bazaar Shops isn&apos;t really grand, it&apos;s an improvement over what it was before. Because it&apos;s in the center of the Strip and connects to Bally&apos;s , &quot;I shall return.&quot;"
3,"You&apos;ll likely stumble upon this shopping center if you are walking down The Strip by Bally&apos;s. It&apos;s not the most exciting variety of shops, but worth a quick stroll through if you are passing by. Another major perk is that there is a clean bathroom at the back of the shopping. A definite perk if you are walking and don&apos;t want to maze through a casino for a bathroom.

The shops are tiny, similar to the shops at Container Park. The shops include goods for purchase as well as food spots. Some notable shops are Honolulu Cookie Company, Waffle Bar, and Lush. In the middle of the shop are comfortable outdoor furniture to rest a bit. 

I wouldn&apos;t go out of my way to come here, but it&apos;s a worth a stop if you are in the area."
4,"On one of our many strolls down Las Vegas Blvd we stopped to watch a local band play at the Grand Bazaar Sitting Spots.  For &quot;free entertainment &quot; this was one of the top things we did in Vegas.  We got to sit outside, eat for one of many food places and the music was awesome!!!! The Saints of Las Vegas has something special.  The group appears to get along great and chats with the crowd that gathers to watch.  Remember to bring sunglasses since your facing the Sun.  I am worried with the shops that are closed that this idea is not working for the developers.  Maybe the direction show go with band at the attraction and the restaurants and drink locations be feeding on the group that gather.  Get more seating and some advertising and BINGO we have more foot traffic!!! This is again for locals and travelers."
2,"If you&apos;ve ever been to the red light district in The Netherlands, this is the retail merchandise version.  

Stalls that might be too small for a pony - one after another, after another.  

It is not a particularly pleasant experience to stroll through and, although they were clearly going for the open air bazaar feel, it comes across as seedy and sweaty with not enough space to move through the maze of offerings.  

Hold tight to your belongings, because they could easily be bumped and lifted in the jostle of this outdoor venue."
3,"Grand Bazaar, huh?
Let me tell you a little something about the Grand Bazaar.

Now there is nothing wrong with the selection of shops and eateries here: they&apos;ve got a ton of random little stores that 1) make for some real good window shopping and 2) actually house something you may want or need.
I&apos;m most thankful to find a Honolulu Cookie Company so comfortably tucked away in the corner . . . cause I love me those cookies.

What I really couldn&apos;t get over was the trek getting there . . . that was truly bizarre.

When has the Strip been littered with so many people relentlessly selling timeshares and stuff?  Dude, it&apos;s hella crazy.

Without getting into too much graphic detail, I had to make sure to averted my little ones eyes from the more adult themed stuff they were peddling on more than one occasion.  It was really quite disturbing and gross and goes against the notion of Vegas as a more family oriented destination.  Moreover, how effective is that kind of advertising in this day and age anyways?  I mean everyone knows the best place to find adult entertainment is through yelp.  duh.  search strippers.  enter.  boom.  and then uber yourself over to one of these very fine establishments.

Truth to be told, I rarely go the Strip anymore and after this recent visit, I&apos;m definitely restricting my outings to a couple choice casinos and the Honolulu Cookie Company.
Oh the perils I go through for those cookies."
2,These shops are just touristy spots. Eating at the pizza place or grabbing ice cream is great. I love the Starbucks here but the shop (bazaar area) is really touristy and I hold on tight to my purse while walking thru here. There are a lot of distractions from sales people to tourists to homeless people digging in trash cans. I&apos;ve been here 48 hours and witnessed 4 people dig in trash cans--- saw 2 pull food out and eat the food. It was really sad. We stayed at Bally&apos;s so it was convenient to walk thru this area to get to the pedestrian bridge or to grab a Starbucks but I wouldn&apos;t go out of my way unless you&apos;re dying for a yard tall frozen overpriced daiquiri. ;)
5,"We love this little plaza. It has a little for everyone.
Gifts, food, jewelry and of course drinks!
Our favorite store is Red, its a small liqueur/convenience store with a little bit of everything.
Since this is an outdoor mall it can get very hot during the summer months. They do have mists that help cool things down. 

We can&apos;t wait to try Wahlburgers which just opened up!"
2,I really wanted to like the grand bazaar shoppes. I can see the beautiful lit up roof from my balcony at the Cosmopolitan and it was speaking to me. We went because we were going to dinner at the  BLT steakhouse in the Bally&apos;s. Wow was I disappointed. The concept is the new trend in Vegas which is to put shopping at street level for people walking by all the casinos. The only problem was that the stores were kind of expensive for what you were getting. The only one I even considered was the one with the cute doggy clothes named Celebi Paws but my dog won&apos;t where clothes.
1,"Terrible experience security forced me to buy something
Or they said I had to leave. So I started throwing money in the trash can after I bought something. I also have video if it&apos;s hard to believe I don&apos;t lie. It was the big white guy and the supervisor, with the tattoos."
3,"Makeshift kiosks built into storefront structures is how I would describe this shopping area.  There was dining options and retail locations that seem to try to look like local places but, fall short.  There was one that was a bar store front type place and it just seemed odd that people would sit to have cocktails like it was a bar.  There was a hot dog shop and ample outdoor cozy seating which I enjoyed for a bit while people watching.

For me I just don&apos;t understand the lure of this place when there is much better shopping areas to take advantage of for the same price.  The only place that seemed worth visiting was the Starbucks that had amazing hot coffee (which I rarely ever say about a Starbucks) nice patio and ample outlets to charge up your electronic devices."
5,This place is hopping it has everything you need very good food and plenty of beer and stores.i spend a lot of my late nights down there and had a lot of fun.if you stay at Bally&apos;s hotel its right out front easy to get to.
3,"While visiting Vegas for a short weekend getaway, I came by the new Grand Bazaar Shops, which is right in front of Bally&apos;s. I am surprised to find out from some of the stores that this place barely opened up last week (Vegas truly changes from month to month).

I think it is great that this little shopping area opened up, as there really wasn&apos;t anything here before, except for the long walkway leading to Bally&apos;s Hotel front entrance. 

But I would say that about 40-50% of the stores are still &quot;coming soon&quot;, but I am sure the next time I come visit here (which I am sure will be in the distant future... it&apos;s Vegas, how can I stay away?) It will be busy and booming. Anyways, with a ton of stores right next to each other, it reminded me of the Pacific mall in Canada. Most of the stores are of a very little space and most of the stores has an employee just waiting by the front door trying to get some business. There are a few stores that are 2 or even 3 times the size as the other stores, but this place for now is pretty much dead at the moment. 

And the stores that are here are pretty expensive. Like one of the stores I walked into was a sock store. This store has some really fun socks (like the Superman &amp; Batman socks have caps on the back of each pair) but the prices were pretty expensive ($10-18 for most). 

There is a waffle place, The Lionesse Beauty Bar, Havaianas sandal store and such. Towards the back of one of the aisles, there is a guy who is selling his artfully talented art work made with the use of spray paints, ripped pages of the phone book, napkins and other scraps of paper (each painting is going for $43, includes tax). 

Give this place some more time for more stores to open up, this place will be a nice place to browse around (would be nice for there to be more shade in this area though)."
3,"The Grand Bazaar doesn&apos;t exactly scream &quot;grand,&quot; but it&apos;s an okay, open-air area to stroll through. It&apos;s basically a collection of shops, pop-ups, and concessions connected to Bally&apos;s. During the day, the hanging mist machines cool the place down to make strolling around a little more bearable in the summer heat. Still, it isn&apos;t exactly a popular gathering area. At night, there is a little more activity since that&apos;s when everyone goes out and passes through the area.

The middle part of the Bazaar has plenty of seating (some with large patio umbrellas), so you could just sit around and hangout for awhile. From the Waffle Bar and Ramen-ya to the sexy ladies running the mini-bar, there&apos;s a little bit of everything here. There&apos;s a Starbucks near the escalators, and a Wahlburger being built on the opposite side. Aside from a few rather overpriced clothing stores, souvenir shops, and novelty stores, you could find a ticket office (for shows on The Strip), the Marash Turkish ice cream stand, and a free phone charging area among others.

P.S.: If you&apos;re going to use the free phone charging system, don&apos;t use your real email; use a secondary one. You will need it and your phone number in order to open a locker, charge, and retrieve your phone."
5,"Go to Dirt Dog for authentic Los Angeles street food.  Great bacon-wrapped deluxe hot dogs, and fries that stick to your ribs.  A welcome addition to the GB Shops.  DirtDogLA.com"
4,"I&apos;m becoming a fan of the Grand Bazaar Shops. I could have easily given a 2 star review back when there was a lot of empty businesses and terrible food options. Now they have a good variety of food options and most of the spaces are filled with tenants. You can enter the Grand Bazaar Shops from the Strip, but I usually enter through Bally&apos;s. Swarovski has a &quot;Midnight Celebration&quot; light and sound show every night at 9 pm. You&apos;ll want to have your camera ready when you see the Swarovski Starburst lit up it&apos;s so beautiful! The Swarovski Starburst is a 14 foot in diameter custom designed LED light fixture and you can&apos;t miss it. For food I absolutely do not recommend Pisa Pizza, instead definitely go to Giordano&apos;s for some amazingly delicious deep-dish pizza instead. Ramen-Ya, Redneck Riviera and Wahlburgers are notable mentions and once Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken opens you&apos;ll want to try their Mac and Cheese. Even though the Grand Bazaar Shops open market closes at a certain time depending if it&apos;s a weekday or weekend, it&apos;s nice that some of the restaurants and bars have extended hours."
1,"I&apos;m not sure what this place looks like during the day but at night it&apos;s pretty dead and dirty.

I thought it looked pretty from afar but when I got closer I was a bit disappointed. 

I hope the place has improved since my visit back in November. It needs it."
