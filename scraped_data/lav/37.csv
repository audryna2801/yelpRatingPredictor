4,"Sooo where to start! 

Gorg! I lived the SLS when it was there and it was cool to see the Sahara Nostalgia found a home. (Felt like Ginger- Casino fans-lol)

The decor is so beautiful that&apos;s honestly it really does rival some of the big names on the Blvd... they should be taking eyeing! 

Delightful rooms with new modern decor. I&apos;m not a huge gambler but I will say that the gambling tables and classy. I live for decor and even the casino had an ambiance for the savvy traveler. It didn&apos;t just say &quot;gamble gamble gamble&quot; it said,  &quot;chill, relax-it&apos;s a vibe&quot;

Pluses: lovely lovely decor, from the elevators to the rooms- rivals much pricier hotels on the Blvd. it was a very comfortable stay! Restaurants delish- makes up for no room service. 

Minuses: The plumbing is a lil suspect.. slow drain I showed and sinks. (Reason 4/5) Maybe it&apos;s the age of the hotel, the Renovation makes you forget it is probably an old structure... stayed in two different t rooms and there were a few inconsistencies amongst them. This and that!
Since COVID, a few amenities aren&apos;t avail- room service, spa, pool, etc limited access but avail. Pillows not as  plush as I&apos;d hoped.

Overall pretty sweet.
Def worth see the new! Lots to offer; lounges, writing areas- speak easy longe vibes through the hotel. 

Stay tuned for more pictures..."
5,"There are a lot of gambling options for retired folks like me in Las Vegas...I go downtown, the Strip, and to local casinos just to get a feel for which ones excel, then weed out the lessers. The Sahara is on a list of standouts in this unique time.   

When a player leaves the blackjack table, a worker is on that spot like a Molly Maid pro on caffeine.  They spray and wipe not only the chair, but the area where one might rest elbows.  There are wet Purell towels and gel dispensers all over the main floor and I see visitors doing a lot of sanitizing...being a germophobe is smart nowadays.   

The Sahara does not have plexiglass barriers separating players from each other and the dealer. Thank GOODNESS!  It&apos;s like you&apos;re sitting in a confession booth at some of these casinos...except instead of talking about your sins, you&apos;re gambling. Nobody says much when there are plastic barriers, so it&apos;s no coincidence Sahara&apos;s table games are more lively than some. They have reasonable minimums and it&apos;s just a nice all around atmosphere.  The dealers and pit bosses are friendly, w/o attitudes, it&apos;s clean, and overall, a notch above a lot of other places.  I hope it succeeds. 

My only concern is the lack of a visible security presence at the entrance.  Maybe they&apos;re watching and I&apos;m unaware, but I don&apos;t really notice anyone checking who&apos;s coming in...are they masked properly, what&apos;s their temp, do they look stable, do they smell revolting, do they look like they could be up to no good?  I just think there should be more security and these days, guests  notice right away if a place looks safe or not."
4,"We stayed for a weekend during covid and although the casino is still open, as are many of their restaurants and booth we chose not to partake in many due to the large amount of crowds still populating the area. So this review will mainly cover our hotel room and the covid sanitation and regulations.

So first of all this hotel is much nicer than I thought it was going to be and really popular. When we first checked in there was a line of about 15 people to check in. There was rules posted on a monitor of the mask and the hotels covid regulations that was in plain sight in the lobby of the hotel directly in front of the check in counter. The line for check-in also had socially distance space holder stickers on the floor to suggest where one should wait in line for appropriately spaced social distance. There was security in place at the entrance and at the elevators making sure people wore masks whixh was also good. The elevators had a 4 person per elevator limit which for the most part people adhered to except if you had 4+ people in the same party going to the same room, then the more than 4 people rule didn&apos;t apply. 

The room itself was clean with a very modern feel, the mirrors were a trip, made it feel like a fun house but overall it was good. There wasn&apos;t much room for storing clothes as they opted for sleek side tables instead of a traditional TV cabinet with chest drawers so the only place for clothes was in the small closet space by the front door, where you could hang your clothes. There was a luggage rack however so if you just kept your stuff in a suitcase it wasn&apos;t that big of a deal. The bed was a trading bed with a pillow top and was pretty comfy if you like soft beds. The pillows were medium firm and they provided 4 of them in our room because we had a king bed, which was more than enough as they are the larger ones. The window 2nd as a headboard/art install with it&apos;s blind covering, it was very effective at keeping the light out but just felt a little weird in placement. Overall the room was good and we enjoyed our stay. 

There are 2 parking garages, one of which is off the Las Vegas blvd but has no entrance off the street since they have construction going on. The other entrance had self parking options which were easily accessible from the hotel. There wasn&apos;t a guard shack so I wouldn&apos;t keep anything valuable in the car but there wasn&apos;t any people hanging around either so it&apos;s just as safe as any other public parking location.

I&apos;ll state again that our stay at the HOTEL was good but now we will talk about the casino...
What a shit show! People not caring about masks, hardly any sanitation stations, no glass protection for the tables or social distancing at the slots. It was crazy. And security couldn&apos;t possibly as EVERYBODY to do what they suppose to do because they just wouldn&apos;t be able to meet that demand AND also watch for fights or gambling table issues. So aside from walking through it to get to a restaurant we avoided the casino floor. That&apos;s not to say that the place was packed because it wasn&apos;t really, for Vegas, it was pretty dead but there were enough people to see the issues. 

Another interesting thing about the  stay at this hotel was that it had an updated flight map schedule off the lobby for those flying in and out of LAS airport. There was also a Starbucks coffee shop, Gelato and deserts Cafe along with other yummy eats connecting the lobby to the casino floor. Past the casino is a hidden gem, their high end restaurant, Bazaar. It was incredible but the review for that will be in another yelp review. So many different great things to offer at the Sahara, I would definitely stay here again. Maybe for CES next year because it&apos;s proximity to the convention center makes for an easy walk instead of communicating via Uber or I could just jump on the tram. Either way, definitely will try this place out again in the future."
1,"Airline crew and airline hotel boards - please read this. Do not put your crews up here. Unless you like being flooded with hotel reports...

They don&apos;t provide microwaves for your crews. None. Not even a centrally located microwave. They &quot;have refrigerators available first come first serve&quot; which so far means never. The rooms smell of cigarettes strongly, and when complaints are made, are told &quot;people smoke outside and go into the non smoking rooms. We can&apos;t stop that.&quot; 

Your crew wants to unwind after a tough day and you don&apos;t want fatigue calls. Well, they&apos;ll be forced to watch the very few non-guide offered channels as the tvs have locked out any option to attach something like a fire stick or chrome. Brought their own laptop? The wireless is very unreliable and slow. They may not even be able to update their ipads. Also the wireless has seemingly blocked streaming sites, which is wrong on a few levels including it means they are injecting packets probably. So your crew gets to stare at yet another episode of Big Bang Theory.

Covid related: The place is packed. No distancing anywhere to be found. The restaurants are shoulder to shoulder lines waiting to get in. The fitness facilities are packed and no measures being taken to reduce spread.

The area at night is not a good place to walk. Nothing like an FA getting harmed to convince you that this location is wrong. Given that crews can&apos;t easily eat in their rooms without fridges and microwaves, and they can&apos;t safely eat at the restaurants, the remaining option is walking to one of the few close restaurants. While several of them are quite good, the walk after sunset is not. I personally had 5 different men approach me asking for whatever just trying to cross the street to the local thai place less than a block away. And I&apos;m an older woman pilot. The younger FAs are likely to be harassed even more, god forbid assaulted. 

No ironing boards in the rooms. No coffee. Poor in room entertainment. Awful wifi. No microwave, no fridge, smells of smoke, no distancing. Dangerous area. They claim some of this (ironing boards, eg) is due to covid yet take no other precautions throughout the hotel. And they might say they restrict streaming because of wifi speed but 1) it&apos;s the slowest wifi I&apos;ve had at a hotel in years WITH the blocking and 2) much larger hotels manage no problem.

What crews need in a hotel is not the same as tourists. We need to be able to relax and prepare for the next day. We need to be able to eat the food we brought with us, and keep the food for the rest of our trip from going bad. We need to update our jepps and check the next days weather. We need to feel safe alone. We need our morning coffee. We need to maintain our health which means not sleeping in cigarette smoke. We need to look sharp which means ironing boards. We need to do our best to avoid more exposure than we already get to covid. This place offers none of that. 

Sign a contract with another hotel. This isn&apos;t a good one for crews."
1,"Helo my name is Jorge I&apos;m a Vegas Local Today I decided to book a room with my wife in The Hotel to get away for one night , as we got to the hotel made our check in and went up to the room we wore very disappointed by what we saw . The room seem a bit dirty and not clean , In the bed there was dried  BLOOD stains and what looked like other person hair . We wish we had a good time and got away for a night but we ended leaving very disappointed and our night off was ruined . we hope you can understand the harm that this could have done to anyone booking this room with Blood being a serious thing specially on times like this . Look forward to hear from you soon don&apos;t let this matter unsolved 

This msg I sent to the GM he replied and later when I wanted to
Give them a new chance I did not even get a discount, worst hotel in town I rather stay at any other hotel than this ."
5,"The Sahara is a Stunning Hotel and Casino!

I was greeted in the valet area by &apos;Gator&apos; who was managing the area. He was  super friendly and greeted me like a long time guest! Which I am! I was a regular back in the 80&apos;s and 90&apos;s! They had the best lounge acts and bars back in the olden days.

And now the hotel has been completely remodeled. Its truly beautiful. Everything about the décor is trendy and shiny. I was informed that &quot;Magic Mike&quot; will be opening this year in the Spring for a 10year engagement! Cant wait!

Thank you for always being a Las Vegas staple that we all enjoy! I look forward to returning!"
3,"We found that that Sahara was in partnership with GSR and we were expecting very great things as we got our room for free with resort fee covered.  The casino itself is renovated and really nice inside.  The game selection is not as big.  Maybe I am too spoiled at GSR.  

Gambling wise I would give it a 1 star.  I am not so sure if I was having the worst luck at the casino or what not, but lost money very quickly here like $300 dollars in 30 minutes and I was playing different machines and no bonuses were popping up.  When I finally got a bonus it was only $5 dollars.  Machine selection was okay, you had the 4 towers for buffalo, buffalo diamond, etc.  But it is a very small casino overall with limited selection compared to other casinos.  It looks like no one was winning when I was playing.  I ended up coming back and playing, but only for 1 game and got the bonus and got 20 dollars which was alright.

Hotel is clean though and remember when it had a roller coaster there and it was old looking.  For a free room it was not bad at all, but it is very small and bathroom is tiny as well. There is a sliding door with no lock though which I did not like.  The shower was very slippery as well. The other thing I did not like the desk was on top of the television and it looked funny with the top being slanted, but it is to cover up the previous cover.  The is not bad for free however.  Service was pretty okay.

The restaurant selection is very limited.  If you are expecting the GSR experience do not expect this as the rooms are not as nice and you can not use your free play that you have from GSR"
4,"Beautiful hotel. Newly renovated. The reasons I choose this hotel are the distance from the parking lot to the lobby, the gym/spa are beautifully renovated, rooms are renovated and the mirrors are HUGE! Bathroom and room cleanliness 5/5. Kind and attentive staff. Good prices. 

Downside - parking structure is a little ghetto so watch out for what you leave on your seats and remember to always lock your doors. I try to stay away from the parking structure past 9pm."
1,I was very disappointed to see that such a large hotel chain would have shades in the room that featured a crowd of white people. In today times its very important to show diversity when you choose to feature people. For this reason alone I wouldn&apos;t stay at this hotel again.
1,"This place has become ghetto the staff are not very helpful, my room stunk like weed for the 4 days I stayed... I was offered to move and to be honest that&apos;s a hassle once your set up and out and about to have to comeback and move and no guarantee that room won&apos;t be smelling like weed.. 

Since the legalization of marijuana properties and clientele has dropped considerably and low room rates due to Covid-19 have only made things worse. The staff is allowing people to pile into rooms meant for 2 people yet they have 5/6 ??? The current climate of our country shows how scared people are to complain and the management did absolutely nothing??? To pay any resort fee to stay here you would have to be a idiot... The place is also not in the safest area and security and police are nonexistent as for the poor lighting due to construction...

I do not recommend taking the bus RTC rent a car it&apos;s safer people are living on the bus and the stops are no safe..."
1,"This hotel room is being ok, but the pillow is not clean. I will provide true photo of these terrible experiences. More importantly, I have been staying over for 2 nights without WiFi connected. I had been calling the front desk, and they kept telling u to reboot ur device and forget the network and reconnected  the network. None of these trouble shooting were actually working on WiFi. Thanks for no WiFi for my 2 nights, and this is my first time to try Sahara hotel and it will be my the last time to stay here. This is true review and it&apos;s honest by my name and true experiences!!! Again, people do not think about staying in the room with a stable WiFi in Sahara. Go to other hotels with a stable WiFi. Thank you. Save ur time and money!"
3,"We checked in to two rooms in the Alexandria towers.

The rooms were set up pretty nicely.  There is a long couch in each room which reminded me of seating in an old school diner.  The style or theme is sort of chic but with a modern twist.

Highlights --
* front desk representative was very sweet and polite.  She made it seamless to check in.
* lobby is beautiful.
* sister property of GSR in Reno so if you have stayed at GSR before, you&apos;re likely to be offered comps by Sahara.

Not so great --
* parking:  its dark, almost no lighting.
* lots of people smoking weed or doing other things in another very poor lit area right outside of the elevators (outside).
* not a lot of security in the poorly lit areas.
* hallways to get to the rooms are very poorly lit also.  
* no microwaves in the room.
* low water pressure for showers."
1,"I loved this place so very much, when I learned that Moreno took over I was extremely excited to see it become the Sahara... I have waited several years to come back and visit . I was told by Sahara that my play from GSR would be transferred over and that my Tier Level would go from Club Grand Ultimate to Infinity Rewards , I was assured that my status would be changed to Legend as ultimate would  no longer exist , GREAT I think , I will spend my feee time at GSR and it will reward me at the Sahara .... Was in contact with Sahara for many months and was told to wait for the system change over ,, emailed them last night to make a reservation was told they see my status but I have no comps which is funny because the Infinity Reeards website says Legend Members get an Annual Hotel Stay and GSR told me that Sahara would honor this...


After speaking to a host twice and being told my account information is not in the system , I write. Very descriptive email to Sahara asking for help and letting them know I want to book a room October 25 for just two nights, I literally want to come spend money at their Bazaar Meat and have a tasting menu... but Sahara does not care...

I guess I&apos;m not important enough , which is Very VERY sad, and a bad way to treat Loyal GSR guests...  all I want is to stay, I never thought it would be like pulling teeth.... 

IF YOU REALLY WANT BUSINESS how about treating potential customers like they are with your time ? I hope someone reads this and reaches out to help me, but I have a feeling Sahara doesn&apos;t care about providing good customer service ."
5,"I personally liked the rooms a lot and how they were decorated, the mirrors everywhere make the room look more spacious than it is. My stay ended up being only $50 (they waived the resort fee because WiFi didn&apos;t work) which is an incredible deal. Comfortable bed. Only thing is I wish they had a microwave"
4,"Awesome hotel, nice views, great king size room with great decor.  Most hotels in Vegas are good, this one can&apos;t go wrong. Lots a places to eat, clean lobby and the gym was amazing too."
2,"I&apos;m saddened to report that this hotel has really gone downhill. My husband and I have stayed here many times, back when it was the W then SLS.  We&apos;re highly rated and play a lot in the casino. We were so excited to hear it was being renovated and would be adding new restaurants and amenities. During this last trip we noticed the vibe was completely different- We saw one guy with a garbage bag as his suitcase at check-in, and what appeared to be a homeless man passed out at a slot machine.  We were also woken up by a party in the parking garage blasting music at 2 AM on a Thursday night - it took security over an hour to shut it down. And the next night there was a double car fire on the roof of the parking garage!

The rooms are also in desperate need of a renovation- the room we were given had obvious water damage on the ceiling and a funky smell. It also appears that the elevators were forgotten during the renovations as two were down and the others rattled on the way up/down.

This new management/ownership company really sh*t the bed on this one! Why spend millions of dollars on a renovating the casino and forget to fix the rooms and lack security!? I just don&apos;t understand- needless to say, we will not be returning regardless of how many free rooms or free play they offer. 

The ONLY reason I&apos;m giving this two stars and not one, is because our favorite restaurant - Bazaar Meats - is inside this hotel. For their sake, I hope the Sahara gets its act together."
3,"I agree with all the 3stars review. At first glance the lounge is nice and the room doesn&apos;t seem so bad ...but when you add all the little problems if I had to pay a resort fee I would not be a fan. 

Here&apos;s what&apos;s wrong: no couch. Oddly placed tv on a mirror...  no coffee maker.  The water in the shower doesn&apos;t drain. The toilet paper is positioned as far away from your reach as possible, the curtains don&apos;t work, and the air conditioning is questionable.  

Also, I found fake eyelashes on the floor....


It just does not exude cleanliness. 

If you don&apos;t want to spend a lot of time in the room and all you want is a place to rest then this is your place. Otherwise, I would not go here if you want something more."
1,"My wife and I have been staying here for four nights , We understand thats thsre is a pandemic on going however the options here are dismissal the pool is open only 4 hours a day, Starbucks on a couple hours in the morning and even there all standard still closes at night leaving no options for eating at all, the second we had no water for hours the manager said there was an emergency she was not very nice about it and when water returned there was no hot water for another hour, rooms are small but nice very small window is the only view outside. No one seems happy there very minimal staff maybe over worked and stressed. Good Luck I wont be staying here ever again."
1,"Imagine, you just pull off the road from a long day&apos;s travel, exhausted from the chaos of driving, but excited to experience Vegas and all that a 4-star hotel has to offer. As you drive into the Strip, you see the flashing lights, the beautiful hotels, and the excitement builds. Finally, you make it, in the midst of the desert, you&apos;re finally at your oasis: The Sahara. You pull into the parking lot and everything checks out, you chit-chat with the front desk staff, get your room key and are excited to experience the high life.

The elevator&apos;s quick, zipping you upward, and your anticipation builds. The doors start to crack open, and a wave rushes over you. It&apos;s not the excitement. It&apos;s not the energy. It&apos;s something much, much more pungent and vivid: the smell of raw sewage. It cuts like a knife, into the depths of your sinuses. Announcing its presence with a brash slap to the face. Here I am. Time to suffer. 

You look to your companion perplexing on your face. &quot;Do you smell something?&quot; You ask, hoping the stank is a mere mirage, but there&apos;s no doubt in his eyes or his nose. 

Unless you&apos;re longing to live with Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo, Donatello, and Master Splinter, don&apos;t stay here."
1,"manager Aromn 702-761-7008 

USELESS ABSOLUTE NO HELP! 

He was so condescending and suggested I made a booking with Groupon...he handled me as low class/ lowly guests not worth the effort! 

HORRIBLE SERVICE 
 
BOTH HOTEL, SAHARA LAS VEGAS AND SNAPTRAVEL

Between the 2 of them I don&apos;t know who&apos;s lying...the hotel canceled my reservation...Fraud BOOKING ON BOTH ENDS...I&apos;m stuck in Vegas homeless! No refund or accommodations. 

No one seems to care 
It&apos;s been 12 hours...no where to sleep, shower or use the restroom. 

No options given...Absolute Nightmare!"
