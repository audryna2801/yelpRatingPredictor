4,"One of the main reasons I stay at NYNY is location. This Hotel is connected to Ex Caliber and MGM, which is connected to Luxor and Mandalay Bay. As an Mlife member it&apos;s convenient to be in close proximity to four other Mlife properties This past trip, I felt very comfortable with the steps NYNY has taken in assuring the safety of their guests.   Complimentary Masks and sanitizers  are in every room. The restaurants distanced the tables from each other. Hand  washing stations are located throughout the Casino floor. 

The staff were all friendly and professional. The casino is an easy walk from the parking garage . This Hotel has plenty of food options. 

I stayed in a basic room and it had an ironing board,iron, hairdryer  and safe.  The room was comfortable and served it&apos;s purpose . The room did have  popcorn ceiling, tho. 

NYNY isn&apos;t one of the top tier Hotels but it gets the job done."
4,"We visit Vegas on a regular basis but this is our first time staying here.  We normally like to stay closer to the intersection of Las Vegas Blvd and Flamingo as it just feels more center and easier to walk between casino&apos;s, but with limited entertainment and experiences, we decided to be adventurous.  And I can honestly say it was worth it. 

For full disclosure, we&apos;re not high rollers by any means, but we play enough to have earned Platinum level with Mlife.  This provided certain perks including comped rooms along with free play and dining credit so we actually didn&apos;t pay for anything except gambling during this visit. 

All the employees we encountered were professional and helpful.  A special shoutout to the dealers and pit supervisors where I played High Card Flush for about 3 hours.   The staff at the front desk in the early AM is a little sparse, as in only one person working, and we needed new keys because we opted for a late check out the night before.  (Heads up: Your room key actually gets turned off at a specific time so if you do extended check out, you need new keys.   I didn&apos;t check to see if my phone still opened the door or not).    And while most smart phones will work as a room key, I discovered that older android phones might not work  in the elevator to active the floor. 

We had a players suite, which was a nice room, but you can tell by the pictures below, the view wasn&apos;t super great.  Since we did the mobile check in thing, we couldn&apos;t request a higher room.   We were also level with the roller coaster which mean we could hear it and the associated screams when it was running.   It made for a challenging afternoon nap.  The room itself was clean, but it&apos;s time for a remodel.   I understand that probably won&apos;t happen for a while until COVID is over.   The bathroom is tiny compared to similar hotels on the strip, no separate room for the toilet,  but the spa/tub was awesome!  

We loved the fact that quick service restaurants were plentiful.  Although we had a meal at Gallagher&apos;s Steak House, and ate a couple times at the American Restaurant, it&apos;s nice to have quick options if you just want a snack.  Easy access to the Excalibur, Park MGM, and MGM made it a pretty centralized location for the south part of the strip.  

I did hit a handpay (see picture below), along with a couple other 4 digit payouts, so the casino&apos;s does pay.   This doesn&apos;t mean it will pay next time, but we did take home more $$$ than we brought.   They have a good mix or newer and older slots (which usually pay better).   In fact, we were on our way to the Excalibur when I we found a bunch of slots we hadn&apos;t played yet at NYNY so ended up staying.  

Overall, I can say we had a really good time at NYNY.   Out of all the hotel/casino&apos;s in that section of the strip, NYNY is officially our favorite."
5,This place was great loved the staff room was great with a strip view been a while since we have been back because of Covid 19 very important to us that every thing was so clean alot of great food happy people great job to everyone at this great Hotel can&apos;t wait to go back again thanks again
2,"When I got there to check in, there was no one in front of me, but there was a wait. Idk why and it wasn&apos;t explained to me, but the lady who assisted me &quot;upgraded&quot; my room. I kind of wish she didn&apos;t, because it felt like a half-mile walk from the elevators to the room. I got plenty of exercise to say the least. Upon walking into the hotel, you&apos;re greeted by massive cigarette smoke. If you&apos;re allergic or can&apos;t really stand it--Tough! 

The bathroom seemed cool until I looked up during my shower and saw a wad of old chewing gum near the shower head. It was so gross! And there I was thinking  I&apos;m paying to look at gum every time I shower...Wow!

This was my first time in Vegas, by the way, and for someone who has never been to New York, the Towers were a bit confusing. 

The decor, furniture, wallpaper all escaped from - bad movie in 1987. The restaurant outside of the hotel was the best thing about it. If I return, it&apos;ll be to visit the restaurant; the hotel itself--nope, never again."
2,"I was hoping for a lot better but just sad that we had to go threw loops and jumps to get to our room , it was honestly one of the worst hotel experiences ive had , im not going to lie the room was very nice ; clean ,  big , everything was up to par on that part ; but customer service needs a tune up and quick cause the younger version of Leslie Jordan is a rude p*ri*k sorry my spell check , &quot;prick&quot; . If i could not deal with this guy i would but i did deal and im not happy , rude demeanor rude replies , we paid a entrance fee OF 120$ here to get on the ELEVATOR RIDE that the casino offers ... 

If you are skinny and dont mind the stairs take them and save your self the headache from the damn elevator that thing is a JOKE no laughing !"
4,"Came here to meet a friend and their 10 year old. The main attraction for us was the roller coaster. We had so much fun that we rode twice. The mom and her son stayed in the game room while we went to the table games.

Overall, we had a good time. It&apos;s not the newest spot on the strip and these days is probably very budget friendly. They do a good job of building a made up, NYC vibe along the same lines as Paris or Venetian.

If you have kids or like roller coasters give them a visit."
4,"Every time I stay at a Hotel I always give the room a bedbug inspection, I did notice some blood stains from some bedbugs that had probably been smashed on the bottom of the mattress! But the room was fairly clean and I Used half a can of Lysol to disinfect the room ourselves. 

The room was comfortable and cosy, no complaints! We had a great view facing the North west side of the roller coaster. The staff were pretty chill and welcoming."
2,"Disorganized and dumpy. Tried checking in at 2p.m. and the whole process was not efficient. It involved standing at a table, then a line then only 2 of 10+ windows with actual people working. Room not ready, but they&apos;ll &quot;upgrade you for $25 a night and those rooms are ready&quot;. We get finished pre-checking in and then waited on the text. 3:15 p.m. (after published checkin time) went back to the disorganized checkin process to wait another 30 minutes to find out rooms STILL not ready but they ended up checking us in to a &quot;strip view&quot; (rooftop view of Casino) with a very little strip view. For no added cost. You would think a professional resort would have this down, I&apos;ve had better service at a Holiday Inn. Property run down and furnishings just gross, but we prepaid 5 nights and are stuck. Vegas is begging for tourists, but I&apos;ll find other accommodations when we come next time (we spend 35+ days a year in Vegas."
5,NYNY is definitely one of my favorite spots on the Strip. The atmosphere is always fun and exciting- somehow always has the NYC vibes going- things like Tom&apos;s Urban and Nine Fine Irishmen help with that. The layout and design (both inside and outside) are really impressive and honestly mind-blowing. They&apos;re also really responding well with COVID. Absolutely one of the must sees (and must experience!)
1,"This hotel along with their other properties charges you a $40.00 + &quot;Resort fee&quot; for a resort that is closed for the season. When I asked the hotel operator what I&apos;m getting for my $44.00 resort fee she was speachless.
That in my mind is a crime! Taking a persons money and not giving them what they paid for is a crime. A resort in this case. Pool, hot tub and so on."
4,"From the past trips that I have taken to Las Vegas that there Isn&apos;t alot of things that are there for the kids when you check most hotels that Includes the Excalibur and the Circus Circus that has a full scale rides and midway games .

Have a great time out on the strip and take advantage of the many food places in some of the many hotels that are located on the strip many buffets do close early . Happy Night out In Vegas."
3,"This is a good family hotel. I like the security it has. I didn&apos;t stay in the hotel much. I was in the room or on a mission thru Vegas. The room was decent. The location is real lacks with their operation here. So, it has a different vibe from the other casinos on the strip. I rather stay here and head to the other casinos for a wild time. 

Live, love and laugh.

1,"The pillows cases are dirty,it looks like they didn&apos;t even change them ,it had like make up on it never again"
2,"You get what you pay for...
We booked this because it was one of the first places open after Rona. It was very cheap. But so are the rooms. If I had of paid more for the jacuzzi suite room, I would have been pissed at the quality. It is old. Basic. No fridge. We&apos;ve stayed in Vegas a lot, and no where was as run down as this. The drapes in the room probably haven&apos;t been dry cleaned in months, if not years... opening them, you could smell the must and dust. Closing them was a challenge, they would get stuck. 

The casino remains overwhelming smokey. Perhaps a better ventilation system would be helpful as other hotels seem to make the smoke smell moderate. 

We checked in on a Wednesday, and now temperature reading. We did see the &quot;EMT&quot; people taking temperatures of people prior to check in, but it definitely was not streamlined. 

We didn&apos;t get service this stay because of Rona. Which is fine, we asked for clean towels. 

The pool is small. We didn&apos;t go without chairs though. The pool doesn&apos;t quite look like the pictures on line. 

I think MGM should consider a remodel on NYNY... maybe that would have been a great use of shut down time. We wouldn&apos;t stay here again."
5,"Due to an emergency maintenance issue, my family had to find a place to stay for the night. After looking up some hotels around the area, we decided to stay at NY NY since we haven&apos;t been there before. We booked the room an hour before we got there so we didn&apos;t have high expectations but the rooms were better than I expected. 

Joseph (dark hair, glasses) at the front desk provided an exceptional customer service and was patient with every single guest as he helped them with the check-in process. When it was my family&apos;s turn to check in, he answered all of our questions and treated us as if we were repeat VIP guests. The hotel stay was not planned and could have been a stressful event for us but everything went smoothly. Thank you Joseph for making our stay a memorable one!"
1,"This was a great hotel years back but are no longer customer friendly. I made reservations a couple months back and told them I was coming in on my Birthday and maybe they could upgrade or comp us some amenities. Agent said she would note the account and make them aware of this special day on our arrival. Anyways upon check In the agent was really cold and wouldn&apos;t offer us anything, not even some discount coupons. We were really disappointed and felt very unwelcomed. I thought maybe I could talk with the Consiger and see If he could gets us some Comps or discounts, well the NYNY does not have a Consiger and that right there says alot. Out of all the Casinos I could have spent my four day Birthday weekend at I choose the wrong one."
3,"It&apos;s okay..... staying here pre-covid was fine with kids.  But expect a loud pool area.  Combined with a noisy roller-coaster overhead,  it&apos;s not my recommendation. 

The pool staff is nice and attentive.   The rooms are great for the price.   And there are lots of food options."
1,"This place is dilapidated and a COVID breeding ground. We stayed on a nonsmoking floor and it still reeked of cigarettes. The casino is packed with people who aren&apos;t wearing masks, fighting and yelling. I nearly walked out after seeing it and now I wish I had. Several employees would just walk right by maskless people, probably because everyone here is so unusually aggressive, they&apos;re probably afraid they&apos;ll get decked if they say something. 

The rooms don&apos;t have a mini-fridges, microwave, or coffee machine. The ice machine on our floor made about 3 pieces of ice before crapping our. Just one night here felt so dirty and uncomfortable. Never again."
1,"TL;DR: I got bit by a bedbug while here, which left me with multiple painful bites on hand, took photos + videos, filed an incident report, received an unsatisfactory answer from management with no real resolution to the situation. 

I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever really written a bad review, but I had to after my experience at NYNY. I originally booked a Park Avenue room, and upon my arrival I was greeted to a room that was less than stellar. The safe was locked so security had to come up to reset it, there was a surprising amount of dust on the desk and mirror, the windows were incredibly dirty, and the room was more dated than I expected. I usually do a walkthrough of the room but I was too tired and just needed to relax. Big mistake. 

I woke up with bites on my hand. Small, but painful and multiple bites. Then I saw a bug crawling over the top of the sheets and that&apos;s when I saw it. A bedbug. After doing some research I don&apos;t see how it would be anything but a bedbug. A security guard came up to the room to complete an incident report, take photos and collected the bug that I had caught in a plastic bag. I tried to be as calm as I could but I definitely was feeling pretty anxious, although I did everything I could to be reasonable and to collect photos, videos and the bug itself. 

The manager moved me to another room, and sent out my laundry to be washed. I do appreciate that. But I was told the laundry would be done the next morning, on the day that I checked out, only to find out my laundry was delayed and I&apos;d have to come back to collect if after I checked out. That was definitely an inconvenience to me as I had to delay my departure out of town that I was originally expecting to have. 

I received a call from the manager, saying that a third party came in and the room came back negative for having any bugs. I&apos;m not sure who this third party was, how they may have tested the room, and whether or not the test was thorough or accurate. I really wanted this whole situation to be discreetly taken care of, but after getting that response back I felt like I needed to be more vocal about it."
5,"What a great stay. Well worth the cost. As it was very minimal. The rooms are sort of dated to the 1990s but themed from The Great Gatsby Era. You get a combination of both. Parking is plentiful and free at the moment with the parking included in Resort Fees today. Pretty neat hotel. Hardly any gaming tables for gamblers, I think they had 5 open total. Plenty of in house restaurants, deli stands, diners, sandwich stops, plenty of bars and most are open 24/7. Lots of vending and hydration stations. But no refill water stations, I noticed just Vending. However the rooms are spacious, clean, big screen TV, my room had a 40&quot; which was good enough, as I was there only to sleep a few hours, and for it to provide ambient entertainment, the neighboring rooms are not soundproof. Be prepared for that! Especially if you have, most likely, a party couple and a crying baby to boast in your ears all night... They sell Earplugs in the stores!! Highly recommended if you don&apos;t sleep with a TV on. The only downfall are the neighboring rooms. Be sure to ask for a non neighboring door room! I stayed there because these were non smoking, so no weed smells in my room or clothing. Plenty of security. I enjoyed my 1 day stay. Big comfortable King size mattress with a good comforter. Clean floors. Drink vending on every floor, plus ice machines. You are steps away from the Casino from the elevators. I would easily stay 2 or 3 days here. Parking is a long walk though. Covid closures as normal. No shows. No coasters. No indoor activities but Casino gaming. The cool drink Slushy bars were closed on weekdays. Enjoyable and comfortable stay minus the room quirks that can be corrected if you ask the check in clerk or pay an extra $40 a day for the Jr.Suite upgrade. No thanks, I would rather eat a steak!!"
