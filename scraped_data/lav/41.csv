4,"I&apos;ve always wanted to stay at Caesar&apos;s Palace especially after watching the Hangover! Glad we were able to book a night here as our first stop on the way to Idaho. Check in was easy despite the long line. We arrived pretty late, around 10pm and of course there were intoxicated idiots not wearing masks. The rooms are clean and the price we paid through Hopper was a steal.
 
We stayed in the Julius Tower and the room was a decent size with two queen beds, perfect for our family of 4. It was pretty clean and comfortable. I just wish it was easy parking and closer to the hotel lobby and elevators because it was a hike to get to our room with 4 luggage&apos;s, a cooler and two kids.
 
The goal is to stay at all of the 4 to 5 star hotels and casinos in Las Vegas in our lifetime, but I would probably stay here again given the deal we got from Hopper and when things open up again because options are limited and we were constricted and being extra cautious because of Covid. Plus, my favorite buffet is here and would love to go back there again when Covid is over and we can all be normal again."
5,"December 2020: We were lucky with comp rooms &amp; we had a great time in December 2020. Nice room; clean, easy check in/out at the kiosk. Everyone had masks, workers were spraying/cleaning left and right. It felt safe &amp; comfortable, especially these times of pandemic/COVID-19.. Would consider staying there again in the future."
4,"Always a great stay here...Hotel is first class. The room was very nice and clean, the bed was comfy and the staff was very friendly. I was lucky I got checked in very quickly and also checked out without a wait.
pleasantly surprised! The valet was very quick and they have it set up for automated service. You scan your ticket and they bring up your car right away. The restaurants are outstanding and the shows are excellent. Saw Madonna at the colosseum, a little too warm inside but that&apos;s the way she likes it.   They have a great amount of gaming, restaurants, bars. live music and dancing with some good cocktails This casino is within walking distance to the many shops on the strip. Can&apos;t say enough about this place."
3,"I have been to Vegas many times as it is one of my favorite vacation destinations.  To this day I have not stayed anywhere twice as there are so many options and I just want to try them all out.  This time around, I decided on Caesars.  I remember my first time coming to Vegas, I told myself I would stay at Caesars one day.  This place is massive, to the point it&apos;s a little bit too much.  Check in was pretty smooth, and the staff was friendly.  We had a room in the Forum Tower.  The signage in this place is very confusing and the directions given by the front desk was not super clear.  Lugging around luggage on a carpeted floor is not a very fun task.  The staff I ran into along the way said they were new and did not know where the tower was.  I definitely got my steps in before I found the right place.  

My room was a king suite.  The room was roomy but very outdated.  There was very little space to unpack and organize like I like to do.  The bathroom was nice and big as well as the shower.  The shower did not drain properly but I did not feel like changing rooms after my adventure to get to the room.  The fridge is stocked so you cannot place any drinks in there without getting charged.  That seems to be the trend at most of the hotels on the strip.  Each room has a safe which came in handy when I won anything.  

It&apos;s COVID times so I knew coming in things would be a little different.  I felt safe my entire stay.  There were so many things closed on the property which was a little inconvenient as I know neighboring hotels have way more options available to their guests.  That being said, I did not spend any money on the property gambling or eating.  

Would I stay here again?  That is a big maybe.  It is one of the most iconic hotels on the strip and I know it is a good time as I have hung out here many times.  I&apos;ll keep shopping around for now!"
2,"Wow, to say I am disappointed is an understatement. I spent Valentine&apos;s Day weekend here, 4 days. It&apos;s the iconic CP with the high ass room rates and daily resort fees! Since being in COVID their rates have been more affordable so I took advantaged and booked and so did the rest of the world. I arrived at 11:30pm and the line to check-in was long AF! We checked in through the app so it sped up our check-in process. We were placed in the Forum Tower. The room was very outdated, ugly carpet and drapes but we are here to sleep so I wasn&apos;t tripping. 

The room had the drapes that opened with the buttons on the wall but unfortunately our didn&apos;t work. The bathroom had a TV in the mirror which was nice when I was doing my hair and makeup but it only had about 8 channels to choose from. The shower was huge but the knob was broken and both shower heads were on at the same time. I don&apos;t want water blasting me on top of my head. The furniture was beat up! The mirrors were dirty. The toilet was located in a water closet but the light was dimmed inside. It took about a minute for the light to turn on completely and I found a effin booger on the wall right in front of the toilet! I was so appalled. I slept in that room one day and asked to be changed. The process to change rooms was simple, I wasn&apos;t asked many questions. 

I was then moved to the Julius Tower. The rooms in this tower are updated but smaller. Double sinks in the bathroom. Nice view of the pool. The issue with this room was the sheets on the bed were stained. Looked like makeup but still I don&apos;t want to pull back the sheets and see filth. At this point I am done and not moving again. 

I would NEVER stay here again, why you ask? Let me tell you.

Everything cost money! Everything! The refrigerator in the room was filled with alcohol bottles and if you even pick up the bottle and put it back, they will charge you. It&apos;s censored. In addition, you can&apos;t use the refrigerator, if you want to use it for &quot;personal use&quot; they charge $75. There is no coffee machine or microwave. But there was a Keurig in the room but if you wanted to use, cough up $15! Like Starbucks wasn&apos;t downstairs. To keep our items cold we filled the ice bucket and it stuff inside of it. It sucked not being able to bring our leftovers back to the room because we had nowhere to store them. I don&apos;t want food poisoning. 

Lines everywhere! To check in long af! To check out even longer! To get inside the parking structure is like a demolition derby with people cutting the line and about to crash. To leave the parking structure is even more drama especially if you room card isn&apos;t registered for the parking garage like mine. So I had to wait in the long ass customer service line again to get my card fixed. 

Hella people all day long. Yes it is was holiday weekend so it was crowded but I&apos;ve been in CP without it being a holiday and it&apos;s always crowded. The COVID protocol needs to be improved. I saw lots of people with no mask. There was security telling people to put on their masks but some wouldn&apos;t comply. 

The distance to walk from the parking structure to the front desk feels like a mile. Depending on where your room, it is a distance from the parking structure. Just be prepared to walk. Unless you can afford daily valet parking then do you boo or get ready to get those steps in. Ladies, wear sandals until you get to the car so you can save your toe if you are wearing heels. 

Caesar&apos;s Palace is a beautiful hotel. I love the Forum Shoppes. It is very conveniently located on The Strip. The restaurants inside are very good. Customer Service is great but all of that was not worth the BS I went through for 4 damn days. My room at The Strat was cleaner than my room here. This was a one and done."
5,Caesars Palace is always a five-star experience. So many memories. Amazing shopping lots of good stuff the OG fancy hotel. So many delicious restaurants! So many things to do wake up early or  go to sleep late ! You will definitely get your steps in this hotel!

5,"Caesars asked what my fondest memories were of their palace. The concerts I seen here and the people I met. The Forum shops is always nice to walk thru. The pool is always camera ready. Pure and Omnia. That&apos;s how long I&apos;ve been coming to Caesars. But there are bits and bobs here and there for you to discover. A humorous night with Celine Dion. Being in Mariah Carey&apos;s music video for her song Infinity.  The energy that night was so fire it over flowed into the casino floor and people playing slots kept asking, &quot;what happened?&quot; Coz they felt that energy too. Then returning for Xmas w/ Mariah Carey. Perfect way to set the holiday season vibe with the Queen of xmas.  From beautiful holiday sets to a classy sophisticated look on Lady Gaga&apos;s jazz show with surprise guest 94 yr old Tony Bennett. Being surprised with a performance by Tony Bennett was like getting to experience what it was like to watch the real Rat Pack of Vegas perform. Then right before Covid began I finally got to see Madonna and she came out into the crowd. Such an incredible performance.  Prior to the show I literally ran into one of her dancers. He actually ran into me though since he was in a rush to get to stage. Nice fellah.  Who gets to see Madonna up close and then have her walk into the crowd in Vegas? Not a typical Vegas story to tell. Then the world shut down and looking back I am so glad Caesars Palace had booked these performers coz who knows when music lovers will be able to enjoy live performances again. I know it won&apos;t be for quite some time. This weekend a nice worker helped me get a limited edition card which I didn&apos;t know about until the night before.  By the time this is posted I don&apos;t believe the cards will be available.  My favorite Halaal Guys is also just across the way and that just brings me back to NYC. Sweet way to end another stay and was nice to see Caesar out on the strip was wearing a mask!  This is the Caesars I know.

Everything is OVER PRICED so be ready. But even like that is Absolutely one of the best properties on the strip."
1,"Finally got the chance to stay here since they had a deal on room.  Check in process went smoothly. You can check in at a kiosk if you don&apos;t feel like getting in line at the front desk but the line moved very quickly.  My first gripe is the fee they charge for checking in early.  It already irritates me that other hotels will charge for early check in, usually $20.  Caesars charges a whopping $50 to check in early. Ok, I see how these greedy bastards are. The woman at the front desk was very friendly.. as a matter of fact all the service workers I encountered at Caesars were great.

Moving onto my room, I got a Palace Premium room. It had a large bathroom with his and her sinks, shower, and large tub with jets.  Makes sense that they have a bath treat store downstairs.  The minibar had a bunch of items that you get charged for if you remove them so be careful. There was a fridge but you get charged for that too.. so ridiculous.  If you&apos;re a coffee drinker, they have a coffee maker but you have to bring your own kcups.

The hotel and casino itself is huge and it&apos;s pretty easy to get lost.  I made a mental note that the entrance to the parking garage is on the right side of the food court.

Speaking of parking, I paid $36 for parking for the 2 nights I was there. Other casinos I stayed at (The Plaza and NYNY) during this pandemic make parking free because they&apos;re glad to have us back I guess. Not the greedy bastards at Caesars, not a chance.

Overall, I would not stay here again. I will probably try the flamingo or something nearby within walking distance.  They didn&apos;t even have much open in the food court. One night I was stuck eating difara Pizza again for dinner after I already had them for lunch."
3,"Just got back from our weekend stay in room 5226 of the Caesars Forum tower and while the room was clean and the bed was comfortable, the fixtures are falling apart and all in all the room seemed to be in dire need of a remodel/refresh. The drape control buttons did not function at all, and the frames for the pictures and mirror were peeling and damaged. The shower handle was very difficult to turn, the shower head was covered in scale and half the nozzles didn&apos;t flow anymore, and the drain was clogged/slow to drain so by the time you had a 10 minute shower you were standing in 2 inches of water. We would stay in Caesars again, but avoid the Forum tower rooms and try a different more recently renovated tower."
1,"From slow checkin/checkout procedures to slow parking garage exit processing this hotel doesn&apos;t compare to other nearby hotels. Do yourself a favor and skip the 30-40min lines and pay $50 more to stay at Bellagio.

There&apos;s some construction going on where their child-safe &quot;carpets&quot; are covered and unavailable. Their member services are excruciatingly slow and apparently children are not welcome even to hotel stayers. 

Not sure how much you&apos;d have to spend here to get decent service but clearly Asian millennials with children is not their ideal customer. That&apos;s too bad cause we&apos;re getting old :P

I will say that for $20 extra you get an &quot;upgraded&quot; room with 2 WiFi passes, a keurig in your room (using it will cost another $20), two passes to the hotel gym (6am-4pm) but are children welcome at the gym? They didn&apos;t say and I didn&apos;t bother finding out.

Never again, Caesar&apos;s."
5,"Love this place. Great restaurants, great mall. I love the over all decor and feel of the place. It&apos;s maintained beautifully and so stylish. I&apos;d definitely love to stay in the hotel some day!"
5,"After research I found the Octavius tower here would best suit me and found an awesome deal I. Premium room online. I had never been to Las Vegas before so it was a bit overwhelming. Masks are required and they took temperatures before checking in. The staff is very accommodating, professional, friendly and always made an effort to personalize you. The accommodations were clean and stylish. The layout and decor is classy comfy. The bathroom was spacious and well lit. 

Out of habit, I walked in and for some reason assumed Alexa would turn the lights on but that didn&apos;t happen. But not their fault but maybe for the next upgrade. Also, I was not a fan of Ivy. I&apos;m old school and prefer face to face contact about recommendations not texting with a bot. These things don&apos;t affect my rating because they&apos;re just personal preferences I&apos;m sharing - in case you&apos;re weird me like."
1,"I had one of the worst experiences at this hotel yesterday. I came in to check into my room and the lady that was at the front desk, Maria was so unwelcoming and rude. She was unable to accommodate anything we asked for. She assumed I was willing to pay $50 for an early check in which I was not. I asked her what the view of the room would be and she said in the rudest way possible &quot;the parking structure&quot;. Not once did she smile at me, be friendly to me, or make me feel welcomed. I ended up not staying in this hotel and staying somewhere else. It was that bad..

I was very upset because i&apos;ve stayed at almost all of the hotels in vegas and was looking forward to trying this one out. I will not be returning whatsoever. Very very disappointed in the hospitality and service I received. 

There are many other hotels in Las Vegas that have friendlier staff, are cleaner, and take better care of their guests. As someone who has worked in the hospitality industry, I don&apos;t recommend staying here and I recommend staying at one of the other hotels."
5,"Biggest casino and hotel in all of Las Vegas! Many a lot and poker rooms, The Bacchanal buffet, and this is where the famous OMNIA night club is. If you do visit Vegas you do have to visit the famous Caesars palace casino and hotel."
1,"Our stay was 11/14/20 - 11/17/20 at Caesers. We arrived, and there are five million valet parkers outside. They talk to you, insist on taking your bag, and then your able to go check-in. We make our way to the Diamond Desk and are greeted by an overly friendly employee. A wonderful conversation happens and we are given our room in the Agustus Tower, Strip/Fountain view.  

We get to our room and it is clean, for the most part. To be fair, we had appointments lined up that we had to be at. So while we are in the room, we are waiting and waiting and waiting for our bags. I call down to the desk, it takes FOREVER for anyone to answer, they apologize and transfer me to baggage. The phone rings forever again, over five minutes before someone picks up, they apologize, explain they are busy and will get our bags soon enough. In the meantime, my concierge had texted me checking in with me. I explain I have required appointments I have to be at and I need to leave. I was informed that they would not drop my bags off if I was not in the room. So we wait and wait and wait some more. Overall it was over 55 minutes. I call back down to baggage, it rings for over five minutes, and at this point, I am overly aggravated because I am being held hostage in our room. I go downstairs to baggage, I see the guy at the podium, just staring into the sky as the phone is ringing and he is not answering it. I find a bellman and ask for my luggage which he grabs for me. Overall it was an hour and 18 minutes and I had to get it myself. 

We unload our stuff, move around the couch so it faces the fountains, and I find all sorts of food under the couch that housekeeping apparently does not clean.

The bed was comfy, the shower was nice, and the bathroom was modernized.

Numerous times, I would pull up into the valet area, with 5 million valet people and they apparently need more people because they do not want you to leave your car, even though you have a tag, and they make contact with you so you can move your car up. This defeats the entire purpose of valet. Why should I have to wait, because you as an establishment have man power issues. Now for those of you reading this, it is not wait 30 seconds. We are talking 6,7, 8 minutes at a time for VALET. It got to the point where they would tell me I could not leave my car in the valet line and walk away, but I am spending all my time waiting around.

I needed stuff shipped to the hotel, which should not have been an issue. So I have it shipped and dropped off. The night before I am scheduled to leave, I get back around 7ish. I am shocked I do not have a message from the desk letting me know I have a package. I call the operator and I am informed that I have to wait until the moring time because they are only there, I think she told me 430pm. Needing it before my flight, I head down to the Diamond Desk and make contact with an individual. I inform them my frustration, I have never heard of this policy, and my list was rather extensive why I was frustrated. In the end, I got, &quot;I&apos;m sorry.&quot; Eventually, that night my package was delivered to my room.

In  the end, if you have never stayed here, it is one of those things that you have to say you did it one time. But now, I have been there done that, never need to stay there again. Yes it was comfortable in the room, yes it was cool to have our private viewing at the fountains from our room. The street noise was comparable to staying in NYC in our room. What drives me to be impressed overall with a hotel, is the customer service. It is overly evident that this property does not have it. Why should they be required to have it, I mean people are going to stay here regardless, it is iconic. There are other properties/hotels that are far more attentive to details, appreciate everyone that walks through the door, can handle the customer load and will provide attention to detail. This property is not one of them and they do not have to be, I mean look at the reviews. They definitely do not reply back to reviews either, because they do not have to, people are going to stay here regardless. Think of it this way, if we are Diamond, what type of service do you think you are going to get if you do not have status?"
1,"Do NOT move any of the water or snacks in your room.  They have sensors under each item.  I was charged $35.00 for picking up an item, looking at it and putting it back.  When I checked out and disputed the charge, the person at the front desk said we&apos;ll dispute it and get back to you.   

Never heard back and I&apos;m out $35.00 for looking at something."
5,"Me and el viejo had an amazing stay at Caesars this past weekend!  

We did a two night stay and both check in and check out we&apos;re easy and simple but that might have been due to the fact that we arrived at 9 am on Friday and paid the extra $70 for early check in and also checked out before 10 am.  In my opinion getting there early and paying the extra money was worth it because when we passed by the check in area after 12 pm it was PACKED, even the express check in/out lines were long. 

Our room was cleaned really well and was spacious. A bonus was the hot tub in the bathroom. There were snacks in the room but obviously for an extra charge...$8 for a small can of Pringles? No ma&apos;am I&apos;m good. Our view wasn&apos;t the best (hello air conditioner units) but it was no biggie. 

My favorite thing about this hotel is how much there is to do within the actual hotel or at least within walking distance. There are so many restaurants open (2 Gordon Ramsay restaurants, Cafe Americano and The Lobby bar which are both open 24 hours, and Nobu), so many tables and machines for gambling, and the Bellagio water fountain is right next door. El viejo also really enjoyed the Montecristo Cigar Bar. We were never bored and felt comfortable knowing that we could go right upstairs to our room for a quick break. 

Regarding COVID safety, I&apos;ll say it again, they are doing they&apos;re best. They provide many hand sanitizer and mask stations, all employees wear masks, machines are spaced out, and they promote social distancing and wearing masks. I did my part by taking my own bottle of hand sanitizer and cleaning wipes and doing a quick clean of the furniture in our room as soon as we walked in. But at the end of the day we&apos;re in a pandemic and going to Vegas is my choice, a choice I made knowing the risks. 

A little plus: get the Caesars Rewards. It&apos;s free to sign up and you&apos;re able to build points while gambling and even at most restaurants that are under the Caesar&apos;s brand. 

Overall all this hotel was the perfect place to stay at for el viejo&apos;s birthday weekend and we&apos;ll definitely be back!"
