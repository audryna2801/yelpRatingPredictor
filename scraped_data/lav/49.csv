4,"Yes, these &quot;shoppes&quot; are a tourist trap (as is the entire Strip, no?) and the theme is a bit kitschy. Yes, the stores are either large international chains that you already see at home or touristy gift shops. And yes, in normal times, the crowds and narrow walkways, especially along the canal, make it tough to get anywhere quickly. Disorienting, even, given the spider web-like floor plan.

But, still, you have to give credit where it&apos;s due: a shopping environment that has a &quot;live-action&quot; attraction - if you can call the gondoliers along the canal that - instead of more passive manufactured landmarks like the fountains at the Forum Shops at Caesars. At various times of day, there may be musicians along the side of the canal and at St. Mark&apos;s Square. Best of all, it&apos;s free and open to the public. 

Also, there are smaller retail gems like the Royce outlet, which sells high-quality yet accessibly priced Japanese chocolates."
3,"I guess if you like shopping then this is your jam.  Exploring Vegas for the first time, we walked around the different hotels and ended up walking through the Grand Canal Shoppes.  I don&apos;t shop unless there&apos;s something specific I need and I definitely do not shop on vacation.  But there&apos;s definitely a lot of shops around here if that&apos;s your thing. 

I found the whole concept cheesy.  I mean, it&apos;s fake.  You&apos;re basically in a fake setting, as if you&apos;re in Europe with a screened ceiling overhead, with a blue sky with some clouds and the shop buildings are copycats of architecture that is supposed to resemble somewhere else.  Depending on what you&apos;re into, you may like it or not.  If you want to shop in a range of different stores, from high-end fashion to souvenir-y kind of shit, then this place may be what you&apos;re looking for."
5,"This place is inside the Venetian.  It is beautiful.  There are many shops, gelato/espresso vendors, and restaurants.  Walking through this place is like walking through Italy.  You can also ride the gondola, and there are free concerts at the square."
4,"The Grand Canal Shoppes has been instagrammed so many times by me, I have lost count. I love capturing the gondolas with the sky ceiling. It makes me feel like I&apos;m back in the actual Venice.

There are a lot of different stores at different price points here. You can usually find something that works for you. 

I love the street cart at the Mexican restaurant. You are able to grab something quick to eat and not have to wait in line. Oh, you must also try the gelato!! Delicious!"
5,"Great for people out of town. I love the sky ceilings, I was mesmerized because I have never been to a mall like this. The shops here are mostly luxury and high end and I feel like I didn&apos;t really see anyone in the actual shops. It was mostly just people walking around enjoying the view. It was pretty crowded because we went on New Year&apos;s, so it was getting sweaty and a mess. I&apos;m sure it&apos;s a much more pleasant experience on a less crowded day. 

There are lots of picture opportunities on the first floor during the holidays because it is all decorated. However, it&apos;s hard to get a good picture because it is flooded with people and most of them think they own the place. People will get an attitude with you and tell you to move because apparently they are so much more important. Wouldn&apos;t come here for the holiday decorations unless maybe if you go early in the morning it&apos;ll be less crowded."
4,"I have been to many of the restaurants in the Grand Canal Shoppes and have walked through here many times.  It&apos;s one place I bring tourists from out of town.  They&apos;re always impressed by the gondola area.

A must stop is St. Mark&apos;s Square.  There are live performances by musicians, living statues, and other forms of entertainment.  Find a seat somewhere, sit and relax for a while and rest those tired feet.

The variety of shops is evident as you walk through.  Ice cream places, a macaron store, as well as jewelry and other high end places.

If you&apos;re a shopper when you come to Las Vegas, this is one place to check out.  The prices may give you sticker shock, but you don&apos;t have to buy.  Take time to look around and enjoy the atmosphere of this faux Venice in the desert."
5,"Grand Canal Shoppes at the Venetian are a must see when you come to Vegas. The sparkling, clean, and welcoming shops are quite a sight to see!"
4,"Over the years Super Cute Wife and I have strolled through The Grand Canal Shoppes. She enjoys.....shopping and observing.....and I enjoy spending the time with her. The Canal itself is nice and relaxing and the shops are enticing. I always am drawn to the new food offerings hoping some are plant based specialty shoppes but she likes the clothes. 

You&apos;ll find opportunities to set sail on the gondola&apos;s if you wish. Or you can stroll on either side. It is quite pleasant to walk through The Grand Canal Shoppes, and be guided into a few stores by the love of your life. However I can certainly, unequivocally do without the time share hawkers. They can be found by the strip entrance and a few other places throughout the canal. We actively have to dodge them. See them coming and it just cheapens the feel there. 

We&apos;ll visit again and again, probably not buy much more then overpriced tea (as I do) and dodge the time share hawkers. The majority is pleasant, especially for SCW stopping into the higher end shoppes. Enjoy it, but watch out for the sharks outside the canal!"
4,"One of my favorite places to shop; plenty of places to go and see. There&apos;s all kinds of stores; Louis Vuitton, Kate Spade, Gucci, Fendi, and so many more. The first floor is the casino and games, second floor is the shopping. You can walk to any other location on the strip from here. Beautiful place to see!"
5,"One of my favorite places to walk. It provides a cool break from the heat outside, but you still feel like you&apos;re out in the open air in a beautiful environment! 

I mostly enjoy the different sweet treats I can get here - macaroons, Royce chocolates, ice cream sandwiches. But there are some stylish clothing shops here as well. As well, as more savory food options."
5,"Beautiful. Can it be said any other way? It&apos;s still Vegas, so you do get the smell of cigarette and cigar smoke, and the occasional drunk person strolling down the canal. But if that&apos;s not something that you can handle being around, no shopping center in Vegas can really help you fully avoid it.

The reason I write this shopping center so highly is because of the beautiful ambience, including the artificial Skyscape with lights, and actors painted to look like statues. I don&apos;t know if I can say that you feel like you&apos;re in Italy or some other area of Europe, but you definitely don&apos;t feel like you&apos;re in the desert ... Which you are.

What you get is a serene mix of European storefronts, and world-class restaurants surrounded by water, gondolas, and everyone else that can&apos;t keep their jaw from dropping."
5,"So nice to come here, First, parking is free! Nothing wrong with free. The shops are awesome and there are plenty of places to eat by the shops. From food court food to gourmet and even a steak house. The place has bars, restaurant galore, ice cream shop, bakery etc and on and on and on. AND, you can catch some good entertainment too for nothing. Lots of good things to see here form people watching, shopping and eating, this place is not only a tourist spot but can also be entertaining for locals. So stop by at the grand canal... i do recommend this place. :) happy shopping wooohooohoo!"
5,"The grand canal shoppes at the Venetian are some of my favorite.  There are a lot of things to do in this area of the strip and it has been built up even more since my last visit with the Wynn and a new shopping complex just down the street a few blocks that is huge and has tons and tons of additional shopping. 

It&apos;s a bustling part of town and you can easily spend hours and hours here.  

The shoppes are charming because there are plenty of escalators to reach them and, once inside the building, it&apos;s a complete recreation of the Venice canals with a functioning river/pond inside that the gondoliers use to take people around.  If you pay around $80 you can ride one and they will sing to you.  It&apos;s fun. 

There are lots of shops in here - both lower end and high end as well as touristy shops for knick-knacks to take home to friends and family.  You can also find restaurants, some themed for Italy, some not and sweets shops.  

We had a good time enjoying the street performers who act like statues you can take photos with, looking at art, and smelling the sweets in the macaroon and ice cream shops.  We also stopped in White House Black Market and Alex and Ani to look around as well as Louis Vuitton and some other classy shops. 

After we were finished we went down to the casino level and enjoyed burgers and giant shakes at Black Tap overlooking the canal and watching the gondolas drift past.  

A great time spent here!"
5,"Wow! What an amazing shopping experience! I discovered the Grand Canal Shoppes killing time on a Friday night waiting for my group to show up for dinner. I&apos;m the target audience for a place like this because I don&apos;t drink and I don&apos;t gamble. 

This is not a place to find discounts, these are only boutique high end shops. There are hard to find things here like sports memorabilia and high fashion.

The lynchpin of these shops is the grand canal. It is set up to look like Venice and with the sky (roof) painted, it gives feel of being outside. The gondola drivers also sing while paddling. 

This is one of the highlights of the Palazzo and Venetian and it&apos;s highly recommended."
5,"Tonight enjoyed dinner at the fabulous TAO restaurant and I am visiting the night club too. The Grand Canal shops are so much fun to play and have fun at. There is great shopping and some of the best dining in Vegas, for the strip at least. It has been quite awhile since I visited here and so much has changed with many new stores opening that I did not even know about. The best new store here would be The Void. It is a real VR experience that one can live the Star Wars world hands on!

The surroundings of the Grand Canal shops has decor that is something one would experience on a trip to Italy. There is so much vivid detail put into the designing of the buildings and its surroundings. The ceilings are very large and it opens up the whole building to make one feel small in such a beautiful little world filled with canals and shops to play in. The feel of the shops is a positive vibe that is uplifting and encourages sightseeing at every turn with always something beautiful to see and experience."
5,"We stopped in here our first time in Vegas to get on the gondola ride and to shop. We came back again Feb 17, 2018. I am truly loving the places decorated for the Lunar New Year-Year of the Dog. It was nice to see this area decorated. Of course the LOVE sign has many people taking photos in front of it since there is a nice waterfall behind it. 

I love the painted ceilings and the theme inside to give you that feel of Venice. There are little bridges you walk over (photo op) and gondola rides (inside or outside). The gondola ride was very fun and entertaining. I agree that it&apos;s one of those things you do at least once. 

There are high end shops inside the mall and even stores like Harley Davidson. I came here to get a gift inside this store so was glad to find it easily. There is a nice selection of restaurants here too. I remember seeing a show that was happening in the open area, but on this visit I didn&apos;t see anything. Happy shopping/dining!"
5,"Who doesn&apos;t like shopping? Well, if you don&apos;t, you&apos;re definitely in the wrong place because Vegas is all about the shopping. On the one side you have the Grand Canal Shoppes then across the street you have the Forum Shoppes. In the words of the awesome Celine Dion, &quot;Vegas has great shopping, food, shopping, entertainment, gambling and did I mention shopping?&quot;

Located next to the Venetian (or part fo the Venetian?), the Grand Canal Shoppes is suppose to give you the feeling that you&apos;re walking through the streets of Venice. Through the middle of the shops is a meandering canal which if you&apos;re willing to pay you can take a professional gondola ride through. The ceilings are painted with clouds and periodically they will have live performances in the courtyard area. There are seats around there for you to sit down and sip some espresso. 

There are several Italian restaurants and French cafes in the area. Paris Baguette has a balcony where you can sit and get a bird&apos;s eye view of the shops. If you want gelato, well, there is no end to the variety of flavors that you can choose from. They have clothing stores, art galleries and just fun places to satisfy your sweet tooth. 

Love the shops here but if you&apos;re looking for the name brand luxury goods, then you&apos;ll have to head across the street! Remember to stop by Godiva to get your free piece of chocolate when you sign up for their mailing list."
5,"I love shopping here. We always pick up my husband&apos;s shaving cream at Basin White. They are 2 for 30$ and last a long time! 

We went to LV too and received superb service from Ms Jocelyn Lopez. We didn&apos;t get anything though but we had fun trying bags. Service like this is why I appreciate LV. 

Final stop was at Salvatore Ferragamo. I have always wanted to try their shoes (friend&apos;s recommendation) but have never gotten the &apos;right&apos; shoe person and i dont live near one. The lady that was helping me was really helpful. She gotten me a few pairs to try. Sorry I didn&apos;t get her name but she has an accent- she&apos;s from Yugoslavia. Sorry if i spelt that wrong too. :( But she&apos;s really passionate with her work. I bought me a pair and will put them to test today."
5,"Great place to get away from the gambling scene. This place is big and finding the exit can be challenging. Many great shops and the gondola ride (a bit expensive) is fun. If you get the right person, you&apos;ll also get a serenade. The entire setup here is very relaxing. Lot of thought given to the design as if you look up you&apos;ll see the top of the building looks like old Venetian style buildings. 

In addition to high end shops, you&apos;ll also find a good blend of low end shops such as H &amp; M. Lot of high end and fancy restaurants here but you get what you pay for. They have a Lobster restaurant and at $24.00 for a lobster roll it&apos;s not a bargain but it&apos;s very good. There&apos;s a dessert macaroon place and confectioneries to satisfy your taste buds.  Plenty of security personnel everywhere. On occasion you will find some street performers."
3,"Went to Michael Kors shop to buy shoes and nobody payed attention on me in the beginning. I had to ask for help. When I finally said I&apos;m going buy it then everybody start to be friendly with me. Service could be better they have a lot to improve. 
However make up store Inglot had great service"
