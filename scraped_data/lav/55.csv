3,"Came here after they opened back up and I was just glad to get out of the house! Had a good time, but I can honestly say that I don&apos;t think that any extra cleaning measures have been taken as a result of the pandemic other than surface acts to make you think that they have.

The room wasn&apos;t deep cleaned and looked like they just went over it because they had been shit down for a while, but nothing major. Yes, they have the seals on the doors and everything, but it&apos;s nothing to throw up a sticker and say that they&apos;re not going to do as much in between cleaning during your stay &quot;for your safety.&quot;

The buffet was closed, but the other restaurants were open. In the casino they have wipes at the slots, but no one was really using them. They had someone at the bottom of the elevators handing out masks, but not at the doors leading to the strip.

All in all I had a good time, but if you&apos;re super concerned about COVID and you can&apos;t tell that this is all just a show to make you think that they&apos;re deep cleaning and care about the spread of the virus, then you&apos;re deluding yourself."
3,"This is a 2021 review for the month of FEBRUARY During COVID. I Hesitated to give it 4 stars, even though it hurt a little to leave only 3 stars! This hotel has so much potential. Let&apos;s start off.

CHECKING IN: 
The associates here are ALL either super rude, or passive aggressive, makes me wonder how long they have been working here. It took me about 1Hour to check in, there was about 3 people behind desk, and taking forever with one guest. Mind there was check in Machines. I stood in a line for 30 minutes and no one helped me, the guy was helping a person in the desk Infront of me and when he finished with them he just walked away, even though he saw me standing there... 
I went to the other desk where he was at and he very rudely told me I had to wait in another line because he was off duty, but he was still behind the desk. The lady pointing ppl to lines was being rude to everyone, got into an argument with a couple of people, the darker skin skinny lady with wavy hair(sorry didn&apos;t get her name) These associates are literally the worst I ever had to deal with! I was so tired and just wanted to check in. They knocked off one star for the terrible terrible attitudes all of them. Except the Asian man, he was mildly friendly. But just doesn&apos;t cut it. 

THE CASINO: 
It&apos;s a good size, has a lot of entertainment, surrounded by restaurants and a cute little lounge area with a bar, doesn&apos;t look the cleanest and smells like cigarette smoke a bit, even if the restaurants are there lol but it&apos;s still interesting to walk around. 

THE ROOM: I got a 2 queen bed, with the Eiffel view.
Honestly if it wasn&apos;t for the view of my room, this review would have to be a 2 star. I definitely recommend the EIFFEL VIEW, it&apos;s worth it!! The room was okay, cute bed board, cool French frame. The bathroom was nice and clean. Beds get thumbs up! Clean and comfortable. The carpet is super dirty lol and the bathroom door paint chipped. The room need some upgrades and maintenance forshure. No microwave only small mini fridge. Safe didn&apos;t use it. Waking up to the Eiffel and strip view reminded me I was in LAS VEGAS every day, and at night you see all the lights of the Paris Blue Float and bellagio and the fountain Beautiful! I would get this room again! 

COVID RESTRICTIONS: No Pool, mask on at all times, more than half of the restaurants here were closed. And no pool. I&apos;m not surprised. 

OVERALL: This Hotel is so nice on the outside, and everything it stands for a trip to PARIS IN LAS VEGAS, they just need to work on the Inside because what the point of a nice outside when the inside is eh. Also covid has affected a lot. I would stay here again, I&apos;ll give this place a 2nd chance just for that beautiful view. But definitely  needs work. You can stay here and still have a badass time in Vegas! Just don&apos;t expect too much lol

The end"
3,"This place has a 3 star rating and honestly I think that&apos;s fair .. I had zero contact with a hotel employee during my stay.. not one interaction.

First I booked online and even checked in online on the day of arrival .. a security guard checks to make sure you&apos;re wearing a mask and have no fever and he waves you through to where the self check-in kiosks are. I get my keys from the machine and follow the sign to guest elevators.

Rooms are a little shabbier then my last stay but overall a good deal for what I paid. There is obvious dust on the moldings in the bathroom.. 

Apparently you don&apos;t get room service each night you&apos;re there .. They only came in on Friday morning .. no one showed up on Saturday.. I didn&apos;t complain because I was traveling alone and didn&apos;t need anything. 

Self parking was easy with the room key .. I don&apos;t like the way the hotels nickel and dime you .. room rate + $42 resort fee + $24 for overnight parking.. it&apos;s listed on the website so no surprise at the end .. just annoying.

Most of the bars, restaurants and shops are open but be aware some are not. Hand sanitizer stations located throughout the hotel and casino area.

Overall an average stay but even at a motel 6 you get a person to check you in not a machine."
2,"I&apos;ve stayed at Paris twice in the last 30 days. The first time was &quot;OK,&quot; the second time was more disappointing, as we had done mobile check-in, which apparently does not entitle you to skip their long lines at 3pm - you still must wait for 20 minutes to ultimately interact with an ATM to get your keys.

The hotel was fine: not particularly fancy or high-end as you might think with the French theme, but also not seedy by any means. My upgraded room had a nice view of the Eiffel Tower and the Bellagio Fountains.

Many of the shops that are meant to stay open until 10pm will close at 9:30pm, because they apparently count their nightly sanitizing procedures as part of &quot;being open,&quot; despite customers not being allowed in. I don&apos;t know if this is official policy, or just ungrateful employees trying to get off work sooner. 

The casino wasn&apos;t bad. Blackjack with a shoe can be found for $10-15. Craps was mostly $15. I appreciate that Caesar&apos;s isn&apos;t doing the asinine Plexiglas dividers at table games like MGM properties are. If you want to play your table games inside that box the guy from &quot;You&quot; kept people in, MGM properties are waiting for you.

I did think their sanitizing procedures for craps were dumber than MGM by comparison. Paris insists on scrubbing the dice between shooters, even when the only two shooters were my friend and I, in the same party. I told them they didn&apos;t have to do that, but they said &quot;well, it&apos;s for our safety.&quot; That was believable until 1) I remembered that they almost never touch the dice, there&apos;s a stick for that; and 2) They sure didn&apos;t mind mish-moshing all of the chips that came from either one of us, or other people. It&apos;s just dumb, inconsistent security theatre that slows the game momentum down.

I&apos;m down with safety protocols, but let&apos;s stick to ones that actually work... or at least having defensible logic when you&apos;re told that what you&apos;re doing *isn&apos;t* working."
5,"Ooooh la la! This was the first time I&apos;ve ever checked into a hotel room by myself! My room was perfect! Check in was a breeze! 

My room was ready on time, I had the app loaded ahead of time and I just went to the kiosk and checked in. My room was perfect, no complaints! 

This was my first time staying at Paris but I might come here again if I&apos;m back in Vegas! I came here with girlfriends and I think that choosing Paris was a great choice. It was in the center of the Strip and that&apos;s the best place to be! 

I liked my stay so much that I booked my room for April! Hoping there will be more restaurants and shops open when we come back!"
5,"This review isn&apos;t based on a stay at the hotel, but we did go in and use the Casino, shop at the gift store and dine at a restaurant (Mon Ami Gabi - see that review - 5 stars as well).

So, if your significant other wants to go to Paris France this isn&apos;t going to get you out of that one, sorry! But, the casino is nice and spacious. They have some nice photo ops (flower walls) when you first walk in.

Gift store was Paris themed for the most part, they did have some hockey apparel as well. Staff in here were friendly. They had some discount shelves that had some really good deals and we actually found a couple things we wanted. Prices overall weren&apos;t too over blown and discount items were very reasonable. 

All in all the time we spent here was nice and our dining experience was every bit of a 5 star dining experience. 

If you&apos;ve never been to Paris (Las Vegas) you should take a few minutes and stop in, it&apos;s worth the time!"
1,"CAR PARTS WERE STOLEN (WORTH OVER $1,000) AND PARIS LV DID NOT COMPENSATE / HELP WITH MY VEHICLE. 

If you plan on staying here, please reconsider. I was without a working vehicle for 4 days and even had to spend an extra night trying to resolve this issue. 

Do not stay here, NOT recommended."
4,"I&apos;ve stayed here before but my most recent stay was unexpected and just a couple of days ago. The price for the night was pretty decent except the resort fee made the deal not as good. Kind of ridiculous considering we really aren&apos;t using many amenities during this pandemic.

Self-parking is free for hotel guests, so that&apos;s nice at least. Just use your key to enter or exit. When you head to hotel registration, they have a security guard scanning your temperature. From there, you are directed to a kiosk for self check-in. During registration, you can opt to connect with Ivy, the texting feature they offer. I was able to use that to get extra toiletries while in my hotel room. There was little to no contact with hotel staff. Mask dispensers were posted throughout the hotel. I felt much safer now than when they first reopened the strip. However, Paris does not offer plexiglass for gambling at tables like other hotels.

The rooms were clean except for the carpet; it looked old. The shower was very spacious. Overall, I am satisfied with the cleanliness of the room and hotel at that price point. It&apos;s not comparable to Venetian or anything, but good for an affordable hotel."
5,"So, the casino is spotless. We got here a bit before our reservations at Mon Ami Gabi. Easy valet parking and everyone is socially distanced and masked.
I sat down to wait for my family to arrive. Two presses of the button and WhooHoo!
The floor staff was excellent. I was hand payed and still made my reservation on time.

Don&apos;t forget: when you hit for a payout, ALWAYS tip the person who pays you!!!
It&apos;s called Vegas Karma and is appreciated more than ever in these downtimes."
2,"Guys I paid for room $140 plus fees. I think next time it&apos;s better to take a different hotel, coz I had an old and dirty stuff plus cleanliness ......."
1,Theft after theft in the reviews!  We are just two weeks past ours and still NO APOLOGY from the Paris!  Do NOT stay here.  They have got to start taking the safety of their guests seriously.
4,"Had a comfortable, first stay at the Paris Las Vegas. Despite all of the constant changes with COVID, everything ran pretty smoothly with check in and our room seemed clean upon arrival. We had a standard, king size room and the room was a comfortable size for two people. 

Staff was friendly and courteous overall. The casino had several hand sanitation stations and other safety/distancing protocols in place. Dining, services, and shopping were extremely limited during our visit, so there really wasn&apos;t much to do for non-gamblers. However, it was nice to just be away in a clean and safe space. 

There&apos;s a lot Las Vegas has to offer guests, especially with respect to hotels. The Paris Hotel is a good option, on the strip, for a quiet get away without all of the Sin City craziness. It may have limited options of things to do, but it is also in a good location on the strip to access many other favorite experiences and places."
1,"Caesars has really dropped the ball here , the safety situation is very serious . I did not feel safe at this property and there was fighting outside of the hotel like every hour.. this place has gone downhill so fast , the people who are coming are not here to enjoy they are here to consume cause problems for visitors.  Caesars claims to take the safety of its guests seriously but when I witnessed  a fight , there was NO SECURITY for a good 10 minutes and then they come busting out with no idea of what&apos;s going on and start to HARASS EVERYONE   &quot;If your a hotel guest go inside if not, leave immediately ..&quot;  I was just walking to the Miracle Shops ... needless to say, two hours in and all I wanted was to go home and avoid all of this &quot;ghetto mess&quot;   I will not be returning to Caesars Propeties  for the foreseeable future 
   I DID NOT FEEL SAFE OR PROTECTED!!!!"
1,"This is the worst place ever, Housekeeping Manager Crystal Verret is the rudest person I had issues with her months ago when the hotel reopened.
They rooms are nasty and customer service is the worst.
I never will stay again with Caesars Entertainment just because my experience with the unprofessional Crystal Verret."
4,"Checking in was absolutely fast and easy
 (We are diamond status) the room was very nice. 
We had a view of the Bellagio water show. 
We had an awesome view! 

I hated that we were charged for hotel resort fee.  Which is ridiculous. 

The casino was nice. The ladies would come to us to serve us drinks. Except this one blonde lady. Ugh. She was rude. 

All in all. We&apos;d definitely stay there again. 

We were able to park in diamond status as well. 
Parking was spacious and easy."
4,"One of my favorite properties I have stayed at so far.
We stayed in a standard 2Q room on the 12th floor.
The room exceeded expectations. Style/decor was quite nice for the price. The bathroom had a beautiful, large shower and entire room overall was clean. It&apos;s also always great to have a usable fridge!

Negatives:
- no USB ports
- fancy looking but terrible shower heads (no water pressure!)
- only 3 wimpy pillows on each bed
- unimpressive pool area

Of note:
- temperature check for primary guest at check-in
- kiosk check-in unless high status, easy enough but we couldn&apos;t ask for upgrades or make location requests
- no daily maid service

The casino itself doesn&apos;t do much for me. Seems fair sized but somehow has almost no slots that appeal to me. Limited dining variety to begin with and even moreso with COVID closures! It is easy enough to get around once you orient yourself. 

We actually split our time between Paris and Bellagio and preferred our room at Paris, especially when considering the price difference between the two.

Overall, a nice hotel and a great value in Vegas."
4,"Post COViD... 3.5-4 

The rooms are nice and comfortable. Pretty big compared to others. No daily room service due to the virus. Bed was comfortable. Bathroom was big, could do some updating on the bathroom and shower. Room comes with a refrigerator. They have masks everywhere and the security guards are strict. Wear it right or they will come after you. I felt safe though, more safe then a Costco. I wish they had more food service/restaurants available. Easy check in with self kiosk. 

Nothing was really opened in their shopping area. The tables and games were limited. The dealers are all protected but most of them weren&apos;t fun. And acted like they didn&apos;t want to be there. Tough dealers. Table service sucks. The waitress never came around and if she did you order something and then 1 hour later she&apos;ll show but you&apos;re long gone by then. Horrible service. 

Pool hours were limited and on reservations basis only. But then you text to put your name on the list then they say it&apos;s not busy and no waitlist, then you go and there&apos;s a line out the door. And some guy saying it&apos;s at capacity! And their technology is broken. Also no gym. WiFi sucks. But they still charge you the crazy resort fees!! During this time at least they should waive it if they&apos;re not providing that service or limited service. Only thing we got out is free parking."
2,"Abysmal.  Really sorry client base.

Caters to bargain travelers.  

Worse of all: not only is the legendary buffet shut down due to &quot;Covid&quot;, but an outside terrace bar named Hexx featuring &quot;bottomless mimosas&quot; attracts the worst customer base ever!!

There you can see the miserly cheapos imbibing garbage &apos;champagne&apos; mimosas! One after another! Endlessly! Ugh.

Monstrously imbecilic marketing ploy that CLEARLY is backfiring on management. 

Tacky tacky tacky."
5,"Absolutely loved this hotel! My last time in Vegas was about 9 years ago before baby came along. After baby and 13 years together, me and baby daddy needed a little getaway. So very last minute we decided to use my birthday last month as an excuse to celebrate and go to Vegas. The last time we were at Vegas we stayed at the Travelodge across from Circus Circus because 1. We were young and our wallets were hella cheap and 2. We just really wanted to spend our money on alcohol to get f****d up. Forward a bunch of years later and now our pockets are a little more full and getting all sorts of drunk not being a priority, we decided to to be extra and stay at the Paris Hotel. Bad and bougie honey! 

For all these recent negative reviewers I have this to say: Stay home and don&apos;t go to Vegas to begin with. Seriously, don&apos;t. Stay home booboo. What did you really expect ? That it would be completely empty ? That room service would really be available? That every single person would follow the masks regulations? That all shops/restaurants would be open? Take a seat if you did. They&apos;re doing their best, just like everyone in the world currently is. And I knew what the risk would be coming to Vegas but I did my own part and packed my masks, hand sanitizers, and sanitizing wipes. 

But give credit where credit is due. Rooms are cleaned down properly. A lot of restaurants and shops are closed as they should be. All employees on the floor who spot someone not wearing a mask very nicely remind those people to put it on. They&apos;ve set up machines to every other chair. Cleaning staff are constantly wiping down and sanitizing. All staff wear masks. There are many hand sanitizer stations located throughout the hotel as well as masks. 

This hotel was the perfect place to return to Vegas. We&apos;re going back to Vegas for baby daddy&apos;s birthday next month and pretty sure we&apos;re going to be staying at Paris again."
2,"Stayed here for 2 nights in our cross country road trip with the family. My 2nd oldest is a Paris fanatic so we surprised her with this place. 

The positive first. Like most casinos on the strip they do have a lot of shops and places to eat (we visited during covid pandemic so most were closed naturally). The check in process of self kiosk with workers wiping down and sanitizing machines  was very nice and comforting. They had plenty of sanitizing stations. About half were push and the others hands free. Be nice to just have hands free stations but more is better then less in these times.  Part of the checkins is you have a mobile concierge. 

The mobile concierge was a joke. It&apos;s strictly a device  they used for pushing sales and there venue. Other then the self checkout on it I did not like the service. Actually when we checked in we we had a used towel waded up in our bathtub. So I texted immediately. Never received a response. But I did. Receive texts reminded me to dine at there in house establishments. 

The room was very hot (set it to 65 and was still hot) and the beds were  not  comfortable. On this cross country trip we have stayed at nothing but Marriotts so maybe we were spoiled by comfy beds.  

All in all my Paris fanatic daughter was excited and that made it worth it alone. But next trip to Vegas I will not stay at Paris."
