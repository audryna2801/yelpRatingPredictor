4,"What a fun little place this is.  Stopped in today to go to the grocery store and also to the Korean restaurant. Oh yeah we also went to the foot massage place. You can do all that in one little strip mall what a bonus.

Parking is chaotic for sure.  

Many Asian restaurants in here and all look good. Also a boba tea place. Yum. 

It&apos;s a fun place to visit and the grocery is great!"
4,"The last time I was in Las Vegas was 5 years ago, OMG  the Little Saigon has morphed into not just Chinatown, that was a misnomer, it&apos;s now the most amazing Asian town, so many Japanese sushi restaurants, conveyor belt buffet n Korean bbq, shops, boutiques, cafes even bars!
We&apos;re so exhausted sightseeing, I&apos;d like to come back here but w only 3 nights, we can&apos;t see everything.
It really sucked, I spoke to a taxi driver he had nothing to do n cussed out the demo fascists shutting down everything. That Japanese buffet I had the same in Tokyo was shut down indefinitely, it&apos;s not worth it for me to be served n have to ask for more. It&apos;s infuriating but still Asian town is alive n really crowded but heck, it&apos;s not more crowded than Walmart, if you didn&apos;t die shopping at Walmart n Home Depot, you won&apos;t die here, the wuflu doesn&apos;t bother anybody here."
4,"Mood - shopping

Upon entering this strip mall there is so much to see, eat, and entertain as you stroll thru each corridor of the outside plaza or in the mall itself. There is truly something for everyone of all ages here. Each restaurant, tea place, bakery, retail store, realty, authentic grocery and travel agency has its own piece of history here. Ive been lucky enough to chat up several owners and employees over the years to learn more of the history from a personal perspective. 

As you stroll the walkways, there are several framed signs of history, art, &amp;  entertainment that adorn the walls. In the center of this plaza is a statue named &quot; Journey To The West&quot; in which the theme is based on. 

The Plaza was first opened 1995. In 1996 Clark County stated the Plaza to be an Asian Pacific American Cultural Center. The governor at the time Mr.Guinn actually designated the area as Chinatown in 1999.

Would def recommend- With the plethora of growing shops in this plaza it is def one that must be entertained at least once. 

Location is Spring Mountain/ Wynn - ample parking, however it does get congested."
2,"Oh Wow this strip mall is Horrible!!! What a dirty, sad, and pathetic dump on Spring Mountain. At least half the businesses are not Chinese, that&apos;s ok. But is it FILTHY!!! I went looking for Dim Sum to go but found nothing! 3rd world construction and cleaning standards. Don&apos;t waste your time."
4,"I have been here probably 3 or 4x when in Vegas. I have been here inside this building with many small shops with my fam and with my folks. This is probably the BEST large complex for Chinese restaurants. Small and large and YUMMY! Boba shops too!

We used to come in here to browse after eating at an eatery in this big strip mall in LV Chinatown on Spring Mtn Rd. There are shops with Chinese goods, travel to Asia agencies, etc. Very clean.  This is a wonderful place to pick up items if you are looking for Chinese goods and services. The lot is full often but it doesn&apos;t take too long to cop a spot as someone is always leaving."
4,"I&apos;ll have to second all former reviewers on this.  After trying out the one Taiwanese restaurant (in the pics), I&apos;ll have to order a different dish than &apos;Stinky Tofu&apos; which was wayyyy overpriced @ $7.99/10 little pieces of no tofu!!!!  Seriously?!  So I took off one star for that over-pricing on 1 of my favorite appetizer dishes.  Yes the sauce was great &amp; so was the spicy sauce but not for $7.99.  

I suppose I wanted an exotic dining experience out here while in Vegas?!  I&apos;ve definitely had more reasonable stinky tofu experience than this one specially in ChinaTown, Las Vegas.  Now that I&apos;ve tried that dish, I&apos;ll pass.  

But other than that, I will still return here for other dining choices as compared to all the time eating inside the hotel you&apos;re staying in.  It&apos;s always best to venture out of the comfort zone;  I couldn&apos;t have felt better about venturing out here to This specific ChinaTown though.  Will return again to dine elsewhere.  Nevertheless, the beef noodle soup that my mom ordered was excellent.  Just pass on the &apos;Stinky Tofu&apos; should do it.

Aside from the Taiwanese deli I got to experiment, i observed while driving that there exists 3 huge blocks of ChinaTown Plazas all along Spring Mountain Rd where you get off from the I-15 North fwy."
3,I just needed a place to waste some time ran into Chinatown plaza in Vegas. It was okay when I went into the mall area it was kind of expensive I didn&apos;t think the prices were good for the quality of the products but it was cool it was fun the food smell great all-around I did not try any of the restaurants this time but I plan on going back to try a couple restaurants in the plaza. If you&apos;re looking for some food and some kind of Asian culture fun this would be the place to go.
3,Chinatown is great for the variety of little businesses however parking at night is a nightmare and there&apos;s not a lot of quality. If you look you might find some gems but it is mostly mediocre spots for not the cheapest you can find in the area.
4,Really fun place to visit in Las Vegas. Fun souvenirs and good prices. Bring cash and shop around before committing. The bakery there is great.
5,"It was definitely a good experience visiting Vegas Chinatown.  I had no clue Vegas even had one until a few weeks before my trip, and it turned out my hotel was within walking distance, so I gave it a go.

You won&apos;t necessarily experience the authenticity like you would in Manhattan or San Francisco&apos;s Chinatown; the Vegas version is comprised mostly of strip mall type buildings.  Still worth the trip either way."
4,"4*Stars overall for having a bit of everything to conveniently accommodate all of us Asian Americans or Tourists - Chinese, Vietnamese, Thai, Korean, Japanese, etc. considering do not expect even any Asian plaza at all out here and particularly just 5 minutes away from Vegas Strip!  

Not a typical Chinatown as one might expect but if in need of something Asian for a change from the Vegas Strip, then this is the place to go to - 99 Ranch Supermarket, SF Supermarket, Paris Baguette, bunch of Vietnamese (pho) restaurants, few Thai, Korean, and Japanese restaurants, along with massage and karaoke places, etc.   

Pretty much 1-2 miles stretch on west Spring Mountain Rd running perpendicular to the the North end of Vegas Strip has all these bits &amp; pieces of Asian shops, including Chinatown itself.  

Also there&apos;s a Chevron Gas Station in same plaza as SF Supermarket if looking for Chevron gas with way cheaper price than CA&apos;s Chevron.  I filled my car up with Regular Unleaded for just $2.99/gallon compared to CA&apos;s current  $3.49/gallon."
4,"This review is so, very, extra overdue. I visit this plaza every time I visit Las Vegas but I have never written a review. So here we go. Las Vegas Chinatown Plaza is probably the most popular area to eat and shop in Chinatown. Perhaps it&apos;s because of the convenient location and spacious parking. We come here for Noodle Pot (my favorite), Diamond Bakery, Volcano Tea, and Great Wall Book Store. Some of the stores are inside so it&apos;s convenient during cold winter to browse and relax. There&apos;s also 99 Ranch Market attached to this plaza. This place can get crowded during holiday season so use caution."
4,"Hold up I see all the Toyota&apos;s, Honda&apos;s, Nissans&apos;s and Hyundai&apos;s in the parking lot. Yup, I&apos;m definitely in the Chinatown Plaza. This is the original plaza that spark the boom in the Chinatown District along Spring Mountain Rd. Most visitors expect to find only Chinese business here. Collectively this plaza contains various Asian restaurants from Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese Cuisine. They have a few Boba Tea shops and your typical made in China souvenir shops. 

Interestingly, this plaza contains the only Chinese Bookstore in the state of Nevada located inside the Chinatown Mall. There is the popular Ranch 99 market that needs a remodel and statues reflecting Chinese culture. Another cool thing is the large framed posters scattered throughout the plaza that contains information on Chinese culture and history. 

On the plus side, the parking lot is large with a lot of open spaces and it can get very busy during the weekends and the Lunar New Year season. It&apos;s worth checking out for any visitor. Do keep in mind, that Las Vegas is growing and Chinatown will continue to grow and evolve. 

FYI: The Asian population in Las Vegas is one of the fastest growing in the United States according to the recent census. 

2017 Yelp Review #88"
4,"Nice little strip mall. A variety of different stores and restaurants. Definitely not the largest &quot;Chinatown&quot; I have been to, but nice nonetheless. 

The stores are fair in price depending on what you are looking for. Some stores are a little on the high side and you won&apos;t find a bunch of bargains. 

I haven&apos;t eaten in Chinatown yet, but heard the food is very good. I am definitely looking forward to trying it. 

There is a large parking lot with ample parking. So that is not an issue."
3,I found this place on yelp and thought it would be cool to stop by and see what was inside. There are a few restaurants and some stores selling a variety of jewelry and small toys. There&apos;s a small bakery as well. There weren&apos;t as many shops as I thought there would be. Most of them had similar items up for purchase. We bought a few items from the bakery. The coconut cake was my fav. Overall it wasn&apos;t the best place but it also wasn&apos;t the worst. It was nice to see a different side of Vegas as opposed to the normal strip shopping and food.
4,I like walking around Chinatown and looking in all the shops and reading the restaurant menus. They gave a big Chinese grocery store that&apos;s a one stop shop for all your needs. It&apos;s hard to pick a restaurant because there all good I like the bakery shop inside the main mall. It&apos;s always clean and safe most of the restaurants are open till early morning.
2,"Serves for a quick stroll. There is an upstairs, but not too much going on besides a higher view of the &apos;Journey to the West&apos; statue. Watched it often as a kid, so I enjoyed that bit."
1,"There is really nothing to get at this Chinatown. I don&apos;t think its even right for them to call themself Chinatown. I mean there are not a lot of Asian stores and especially when you compare it to the Chinatown in San Francisco. How can this be Chinatown? 

Ok maybe its because they have 99 Ranch Market. Well that&apos;s about it. Parking lot is bigger than the available square feet of all the stores added together. You won&apos;t have problem finding a parking. There are plenty or should I say too many. Chinese food in this mall doesn&apos;t even look appealing."
3,"Came here for food and tried two restruant in two days.  the supermarket was very clean with good selections, but, few of the restruant were averaged to below average.  The Taiwanese restruant downstairs opens at 7:00 am, we came here for breakfast, prices were reasonable and food is above average, came back the next day for breakfast.

Parking is plenty; but, forget trying to find shade."
3,"Nice shops &amp; lots of restaurants to chose from. We just did some shopping. Stopped at the bakery but they didn&apos;t have anything appealing (however, it was late afternoon).

We&apos;d go back."
