5,"So much love for this place!

My family and I celebrated my mom&apos;s birthday brunch here at the famous Versailles Restaurant in Little Havana, and it was such a treat! While this place was fairly crowded for a Saturday, we were pleased to see that the tables were spaced out according to social distancing precautions. 

I ordered a midnight sandwich and a cortadito, and they were the best items on the menu! My mom ordered the traditional Cuban sandwich, and I honestly liked the challah-style bread on the midnight sandwich better! I also loved the combination of the ham, pickles, and swiss cheese. 

As for the cortadito, I could go on and on as far as how much I adored it! It&apos;s so small in size, but who knew it could pack such a punch?! I loved the smoky, yet subtle sweetness of this espresso drink that I know have dreams of this.

Other notable items on the menu were the croquetas - they were pillowy soft and I loved how crispy they were on the inside. We also adored their guava and cheese pastelitos and their beef empanadas. The guava and cheese flavor was heavenly, and the beef empanadas had such a delicious beefy flavor! Lastly, don&apos;t skip out on their key lime pie. The crust is the bomb, and the key lime flavor is so tart and had just the right amount of sweetness.

Things that I necessarily wouldn&apos;t order again would be their steak and eggs, as the texture of the steak was a bit too tough to chew.

Our waiter was very friendly, and I would absolutely recommend this place to those who visit Little Havana in Miami!"
5,"In A Nutshell:

-Versailles is the most famous Cuban restaurant in the world.
-I&apos;ve eaten here twice now &amp; the food is still fabolously authentic.
-Their menu is vast, filled w/ daily specials &amp; all things Cuban comfort food.
-They have both indoor/outdoor seating.
-The service is very friendly &amp; kind.
-The food prices are very affordable, so if you have a large group it wouldn&apos;t hurt to bring them here.
-Next door is their bakery in case you still have room or need some food for manana.

Overall, if you are in Miami, you need to bookmark &amp; stop by this popular Cuban restaurant!"
5,"Been coming here for years and will be coming here for more years to come. This place is a Miami staple, if you live in the city you can&apos;t call yourself a true Miamian until you visit, call it a rite of passage if you will. This time around I ordered takeout but to get the official experience you have to eat it. If you do decide to order takeout I recommend checking your food as this place is notorious for missing something in the order (has happened a few times, I&apos;ve learned my lesson). My personal favorite are the whole fried snapper or the vaca frita de pollo, I highly recommend either if not both!"
5,"everything was super tasty and you could tell each dish was prepared with care. 
only thing was we also ordered the chicken versailles and although it was delicious i could not finish it and when i got home i noticed the inside was pink. threw it on the stove for 10 minutes and was good to eat again! would come back :)
also the green sauce that came with the empanadas was AMAZINGGG"
4,"It was a dreary, overcast morning in Miami and we were DYING for some strong Cuban coffee, so we headed down to Little Havana to the Versailles, made famous recently in the movie Chef.

Overall impression is very favorable!  It&apos;s a cool building, with a hopping takeout window and a huge outdoor seating area that used to be their parking lot (note: parking is challenging here.  Uber if you can).  I had both the cortadito and the cafe con leche--both strong, rich and sure to leave you a little jittery for the rest of the day.  I had boring pancakes (it&apos;s vacay--don&apos;t judge).  We also had the Versailles Breakfast--croquetas (plantains?), eggs, perfectly cooked potatoes served with Cuban bread.  I wasn&apos;t sure if this was supposed to be a sandwich?

Overall the food was excellent and it&apos;s a cool little place.  I didn&apos;t give this five stars because our waiter was decidedly rude when my husband asked for a little more cafe with his leche (we were given one small carafe to share).  I do recommend it for a great breakfast."
4,"Must try hands down.

Staff was very friendly and prompt

The menu gives cheesecake factory a run for its money with all the different dishes. Take your time because there is a lot of good stuff in there. Took me a while on what to decide on.

I started with the empanadas and they were OK. Nothing good or bad. I liked the chicken one the most. 

I had oxtail with morro rice. Great dish but a little room for improvement. First, I didn&apos;t feel I got a lot. More bone than meat. I was still hungry after this dish. Also, it could have used another hour or two cooking. It was tender for sure but I made a mess as I had a hard time carving away from the bone.

Then I ordered the Versailles special sandwhich (I think). Ham, spanish sausage, and pork. Tasted very similar to an itialian. I was very pleased 

The snapper was pretty decent.

All in all I left here stuffed and wanting more. I&apos;ll be back again to try more food and I suggest you make a stop here as well"
5,"Being that we had to travel to Miami for some paperwork we needed to take care of, we decided to check what all the hype was about. Ohhh my! This is the best Cuban food I have had after a real Cuban household back from when I lived in California. So authentic and the staff so friendly that we didn&apos;t want to leave. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone that likes bold flavors and a good time."
2,"Lost its luster,maybe? It&apos;s a Cuban LUBY&apos;s cafeteria if you ask me. 

Overly salty foods. Ordered and tried popular dishes minus the Cuban sandwich. We ordered the Ropa viejas, the Classic sampler, and the Lechon Asado...I will say you are greeted with authenticity in the foods, but preparation, freshness and food presentation is why I gave low ratings. A bit overly salty, rather than robust flavors. Most if not all the food we got seemed like it was pre made or sitting under a food lamp and my black beans were room temperature. When I asked the guy to bring me a fresh one, it was still the same. 

A classic case of quantity versus quality. Even though it&apos;s a great price point for what you get, I&apos;d rather get less portions and pay a little more? And still keep it authentic...nonetheless it was pretty disappointing for me. 

Also, despite the high winds the day we dined, we ate outside because inside was freezing cold! But annoyingly, the wind really almost blew the tent away and made these loud metal clanging sounds the entire time we ate...so it was a stressful eating experience. 

I do recommend the bakery and cafe!!! The guava and cheese pastry is a MUST! And pair it with a Cortadito!!!!"
3,"3 stars because the host was completely uninterested in getting my friends name correct and it&apos;s not a complicated one but would effect us hearing it called when our table was ready. That was irritating. We told her Thomas and she wrote Sammie so go figure.... 
Anywho, we finally got seated and we just ordered something quick because the waiter also was uninterested in recommending dishes. We were not very familiar with Cuban food but were very interested in getting cultured but due to lack of interest we just went with what we knew and ordered sandwiches. The Versailles is more flavorful than the Cuban because it has one additional meat in it. We also ordered mojitos which were tasty and pretty. We probably won&apos;t return here but will try Cuban food again somewhere else. Also at this particular restaurant, it would help tremendously if you can speak some Spanish"
4,"If you&apos;re going to Miami, Versailles is a spot you have to visit at least once. 

My husband and I saw it on several YouTube videos and decided to swing by on our stroll through Little Havana. In fact, if you&apos;re planning to walk through the area, start here! 

Honestly, the place kind of looked like a  tourist trap in the videos, so we opted for coffee and pastries only. Good call since we wanted to hit other spots along our journey. 

Cafe Cubano - super sweet espresso. Loved it. It tasted almost exactly like I make my espresso at the end of a fancy Italian meal. Black espresso and tons of raw cane sugar. 

Cubano Latte - delicious. Sweet and creamy. 

Croquettes - not really a fan of these, in general. Versailles was no different. 

Guava &amp; Cheese Pastry - my favorite. Flaky dough. Tangy guava. Creamy cream cheese. Loved it. 

Guava Pastry - thinner version of the above, without the cream cheese. Really good, but tangy. Liked the one without cream cheese better. Needs the balance. 

Pulled chicken empanada - meat is seasoned well, dough is pretty light. 

Overall, this was a good experience and We&apos;re glad we started here and ate light."
2,"One of the most celebrated Cuban-style restaurants ain&apos;t getting any accolades from yours truly. I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s because COVID-19 saw a departure from seasoned chefs and the dip in quality is due in part to replacement chefs, but this was NOT the experience I so very much look forward too.

This is prime example of a tourist trap with an inflated score as most people see a good rating, and it tends to legitimately bias their review.

I always approach something with an open mind to cap any sort of potential bias.

I ordered their famous pollo chicken. Basically the bread and everything else was solid EXCEPT the main course! Their famous pollo chicken royally is a stinker.

The appetizers and side items I could find enjoyment however.

Garlic bread had a lighter texture and spread and cut more thin than other cuban cuisine counterparts.  Served freshly from the oven and onto a plate. I actually enjoyed it. The fried banana plantains and Caribbean rice were generous portions, but I lost my appetite and couldn&apos;t stomach to finish the rest after dealing with the chicken.

The chicken&apos;s skin was sickly oily. It just completely nuked any enjoyment from the skin to the meat. I couldn&apos;t taste any signs of a fresh and citrus like taste throughout any of the chicken. This is the signature trademark of good cuban food. So why didn&apos;t I?

When you carve towards the inner of the chicken breast, I tasted some rawness. This is unacceptable. Instead of lightly frying it, maybe you should bake or grill it. Tasted like garbage and that particular dish shouldn&apos;t be served to anyone to be honest."
3,"Its a 3.49 stars. I was very excited to try this place since recommendations were great but it was disappoint. Food was good (not great), but pretty well priced. The yuca fries were not well cooked. 

Mojitos were mediocre. 

You can&apos;t make reservations but we were seated right away. If you wanted to sit inside there was a wait."
5,"Get the braised oxtail. It was unbelievably amazing. Also loved the empanadas (got the trio sampler appetizer - the green sauce it comes with is awesome). Not as amazing but still good were the mojito and the flan. 

Did NOT like the El Criollo sampler. The ropa viejo was pretty terrible (tough meat plus the flavors weren&apos;t good), the ham croquette was very bland, and also didn&apos;t like the tamale or cassava. The only decent items on the plate were the fried pork and sweet plantains. 

As for wait time, we got there on a Sunday (12/27/20) at 2:50pm and were told the wait was 25-30 min. Got seated at 3:25pm and our appetizers came 3 min later. They bring out the food very quickly!"
5,"I believe this is the quintessential Cuban restaurant. If you are coming to Miami from afar, look no further. 

As you enter the restaurant, it&apos;s like stepping into the movie &quot;Scarface&quot;. The decor doesn&apos;t look worn or tattered, almost as if the 80s Miami nostalgia was preserved.

I don&apos;t know what people expect when going to an authentic Cuban restaurant but this is definitely not a &quot;Foodie&quot; restaurant. BUT if you are looking for the best damned home-cooked Latin meal that your abuelita didn&apos;t make, THIS IS the PLACE. 

EVERYTHING we ordered was just delicious and made with love. That&apos;s all one can ask for no? 

5stars:
Cuban sandwich 
Créeme brûlée 
Stuffed peppers 
Veggies

Y todos hablan español acá así que obtienes todo la experiencia. 

Lo ciento para escribiendo mal, Estoy solo aprendiendo."
5,"Every time we go to Miami Versailles is a must! If you like Caribbean Latin food this is your place! This iconic restaurant makes you travel in time to an &quot;isla caribeña&quot;. I&apos;ll tell you why this place is so cool they have two in one, restaurant  and bakery side by side. The coolest part it&apos;s their pick up window &quot;la ventanita&quot; where you can buy any pastry and the most delicious cortadito or cafe con leche ( expresso coffee with milk foam or coffee with milk), the restaurant has been there since 1971,  there is so many choices on the menu  that you might decide to
Come back after to try all
Of them, one of my favorites is &quot;Ropa vieja&quot; (shredded beef, rice w/beans and platains), their juicy al mojo chicken is delicious, they also offer Fresh fruit juices, the staff was nice and friendly and since we went this last time on a week day it wasn&apos;t that crowded. I want to go back and try more from their menu, this is Latin comfort food like my grandma used to cook! It worth a try my dear Yelpers."
5,"Amazing food and service! 
We loved everything we ordered from the drinks, appetizer, entree to desserts. I do have to say that their portions are big so just keep that in mind. We left super happy but super full."
5,"Amazing food and great prices.  Must try the mojito lots of mint and a great stick of sugar cane to suck on delicious.  I got the Oxtail dish and it was fabulous the flavor also the green olives in the sauce add a nice little extra to it, came with white rice and plantains all yummy.  Ropa vieja was also really tender and tasty.  Must try if you are in the area.  Was celebrating my sisters bachelorette weekend."
5,"I made a pitstop to the popular Versailles while in Little Havana and ordered a cortadito con leche evaparada with a guava pastry. I&apos;m not much of a coffee drinker, but I wanted the experience, and I must say it was a good one. The lady who took our order was very polite and made useful recommendations for first-timers. Their guava cheese pastry knocks Porto&apos;s out of the park."
5,"One of my fav places when I&apos;m in Miami and it never disappoints! Since I was a party of 1 I only waited 5 minutes to be seated. I started with a Cuban style mojito, delicious, well crafted with sugar cane. Then the stuffed plantains which have shrimp, cilantro and pineapple sooooo freaking good. For my main dish I enjoyed the roast pork Cuban style plated with Moro rice and yucca with mojo. If you&apos;re in Miami do yourself a favor and enjoy traditional Cuban food here!"
4,"I&apos;ve never been here and heard so much about this famous Cuban restaurant here in Miami. The service was delightful and the staff were on point with everything from greeting us to getting our food right away. The reason why I gave them a 4 stars and not a 5 stars the food lacked in flavors.. the Moro was a bit dry and so we&apos;re the maduros but they were still delicious so I finished them! Also, the pollo Versailles was my favorite cooked in the mojo sauce. The croquetas are crunchy here and very good! 
Overall, they are the most iconic cuban restaurant in Miami. Come check it out and try it for yourself (:"
