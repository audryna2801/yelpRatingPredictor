5,"My first time having Indian food and I loved it!

Situated in the heart of Coconut Grove, they have indoor and outdoor seating. This place is huge, so much seating inside. The lighting and decor gave me a Vegas vibe and it was loud but super cool.  

Now the food was very flavorful and savory. I ate and ate and ate...We order a couple dishes and shared. 

Channa Masala which is a garbanzo bean dish ordered to whatever amount 
of spiciness you like. That was my favorite as I&apos;ve never eaten Garbanzo beans like that it was so enjoyable. 

Aloo Gobi was the other dish we ordered, It was cauliflower and potatoes. I highly doubted liking this dish as I hate cauliflower but it was another winner for me. So very tasty I couldn&apos;t even realize it was a veggie. This was served with Jasmine rice. 

And the Naan ... well I had to order another round and could&apos;ve gone for a third. Absolutely exquisite!! 

Will definitely be coming back. 

Thank you Bombay Darbar!!"
5,"I absolutely love this place! I order take out from here every so often and it absolutely never disappoints. 


There are so many dishes and so many options yet so little time to try everything. I also absolutely love how they have vegetarian options. 

My favorite is the tikka masala, shrimp Goan curry and mango chicken curry. I love the chutneys as well but which there were larger options. 

All in all I love this spot and will continue ordering."
5,"5-star food, 5-star service, 5-star ambience (hey that averages 5 stars!)  Great food with impeccable service with exotic high-style ambience.

Bombay Darbar is hands-down the best Indian food in south Florida.  Vegetable samosas were just the right combination of chewy and crispy.  The chutneys are homemade and amazingly good.   I admit I am obsessed with their chicken korma, and have tried multiple times to bribe them for the recipe.

Service here is reliably terrific.  Smiling and friendly, they&apos;re always efficient and helpful too.  After a couple of trips, they&apos;ll recognize you and greet you by name, even wearing a CV19 mask.

Ambience here is part high-design, part reference to ancient cultural cues.  The whole effect is beautiful, modern  and ancient all at the same time.  The neighborhood is quite cool too.  Parking trauma is minimized for us (it&apos;s tight otherwise) because we victimize the driveway of a friend in the neighborhood and walk over."
5,"Back to Bombay Darbar again for Indian food dinner and to try the same dishes that we missed a lot
We tried this time The boneless Chicken tekka and it was good but we preferred the last time we ordered the chicken tekka with bones in 
Last time The biryanis was little dry but this time the lamb meat biryanis was outstanding and tasted perfect 
Also we tried their mew Thai style pimento chicken and it was good too
We liked the food here and the spicy dishes and we enjoyed the biryanis big time"
4,"Came on a Friday night and this place was packed!! Literally every table was full, make a reservation ahead of time by calling in. Food came out fast and hot! Service is great and attentive. 

Ordered the Mango Lassi (must order) 
Garlic naan amazing
Veggie samosa was ok a little on the spicy side
Tandoor wings were delicious and the best appetizer 
Chicken Korma was amazing and rich in flavor
Lamb tandoor was phenomenal 

Honestly all the food was great except the samosa they were just OK

Will deff return to try more items!"
5,"Never ever have we ever gone on a vacation and not eaten our favorite Indian food. Located in coconut grove in a very picturesque place, bombay Darbar delivers! The ambience and the food is on point! Here&apos;s what we got:
Tandoori wings: these are amazing! Should have ordered two plates! 
Butter chicken: good and not fake tasting like most places. Only mistake we made was not going 10 on spice level; we went safe and did 8 and found the spice to be on lower side. 
Lamb: this was really good. I would go with lamb curry over butter chicken. 
Lamb biryani: I&apos;m not a fan of biryani but my friends are so they got it; they liked it. The quantity was pretty good so they took some leftover home. 
Garlic Naan: naan were amazing. Crisp and fresh like they should be. 

We topped off the meal with a Taj Mahal. The food came out relatively quick. The curries will come with white rice and they serve papad at the start. Totally recommend you try Bombay Darbar. I would give it a 5 star review if it wasn&apos;t for the lack of spice in chicken; some of it was on us picking a lower bar on the spice level and some on the server."
5,"I haven&apos;t had Indian in quite a long time. This place was amazing. I am big Buddha fan, this place was full of them. I wanted to take one home with me lol  
I order a mango martini  and the chicken and mushrooms. Especially the sauce was absolutely Fucken   Out of this world. Yummmmers  coming back for sure..."
5,"OUTSTANDING! This spot never disappoints. True, authentic Indian food. Reservations are recommended as place does get very full. Go with a big appetite as you will walk out stuffed. My absolute favorite dish is the butter chicken - they allow you to choose between mild, medium, medium hot, hot and super hot (I usually get medium hot which is just right). Lamb biryani is also outstanding."
5,"Visited for the first time this past weekend for a special birthday celebration and we were not disappointed.   Parking was easy, there is a parking garage right across the street.  We had reservations and were seated right on time.  The service was prompt and consistently good throughout the evening.

The food was amazing, the waiter was good with suggestions and descriptions which was important since it was our first time here. We ordered a version of Paneer Pakora that our waiter suggested.  It was the fried cheese, topped with cooked onions and peppers and drizzled with chili oil.  For our main meal, we ordered the lamb tandoori and a shrimp tandoori with some garlic naan bread and a side of white rice. Everything was amazing, it was one &quot;YUM&quot; after another.  The flavors were deep and intense with the right amount of heat (for my taste)

The birthday surprise dessert was two very soft and delicious doughnut balls drenched in a sweet syrup.  If you are Cuban, they resemble fried bunuelos.    I need more of these in my life!  

Thank you Bombay Darbar for an amazing evening.  We will be back!"
5,I was craving Indian food and Bombay Darbar did not disappoint! We started with samosas and paneer and had Tikka Masala with vegetable biryani as an entree. All the dishes were flavorful and fulfilled my Indian food craving! We sat outside and enjoyed the atmosphere. Will go again!
5,"I would give Bombay Darbar 10 stars if I could!  Excellent ambiance, food and service.

I stopped by this restaurant for lunch one afternoon with my family and we were all super impressed. I was a bit hesitant to take my parents to an Indian restaurant at first as they had never eaten Indian food before and they tend to be picky. However, we ordered several dishes to be shared amongst all of us (see pictures) and not one disappointed. My personal favorite is the Butter chicken! 

Our server was AMAZING - my dad ordered a lemonade to drink which they don&apos;t serve and our server went as far as making the lemonade himself just to make him happy! Further the manager and other staff stopped by our table regularly to make sure all was good. 

I recommend this restaurant to anyone looking to have good Indian food!!"
4,"Bombay Darbar is my go to take out Indian food, however their dine in experience is even better! There is a very nice atmosphere with attentive staff! You are seated at the table with complimentary papadum, which is delicious to munch on! I ordered the vegetable samosas, paneer makhani and butter naan - all delicious &amp; well portioned. I went on a Saturday night and it was packed! The tables are seated very close. They have outdoor seating which made me feel more comfortable because the inside was too crowded."
5,"Amazing good and beautiful service by Alejandro. He explain the lunch specials and made me fully aware of
All the delicious food in front of me. I had the garlic naan, daal soup and vegetable panner which all came in the lunch special plus a samosa and dessert (rice pudding). Loved it very minute of it! Can&apos;t wait to visit again. Ps the smell of spices and yumminess circles the block SUPER ALLURING (;"
4,"Everything we ate was delicious. Don&apos;t be too worried about the spice level. We tried medium spice and medium high spice and we were wanting a little more. Of course, we like the spicy stuff. 
Service was really great! Enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere and Indian music playing. Looks a little bigger than it really is. But don&apos;t let that keep you from trying this place. Tikka Masala is an absolute must! I&apos;m drooling just thinking about it again lol."
5,"My new favorite restaurant. I would highly suggest making a reservation to avoid the wait. It is a very popular restaurant so if you do not make a reservation expect a wait. Everyone who works here is extremely friendly and nice. The atmosphere and vibe is also enjoyable. 

I ordered the lychee drink, it was amazing. The garlic naan is also a must, very delicious. I highly recommend the Vegetable samosa as well. If you do not like very spicy food that is okay, you can request mild, medium, or hot. The butter chicken was one of my favorite dishes, I got it mild. It was flavorful and the most delicious. Basmati rice is also unlimited which is a really nice feature. The chicken tikka masala is also an amazing and popular dish. I can&apos;t wait to go back to try more of the amazing food on their menu!"
4,"A couple of years ago, they catered to the wedding of a very very picky friend of mine, so I assumed they were good! I was pleasantly surprised by how good their food was in person when I visited recently for the first time. 

We made reservations and were surprised to see how full this restaurant was (post-Covid). They lose one star because it is SOOO LOUD. It&apos;s definitely not the place to go on a first date unless you want to be screaming at the other person. 

We ordered some samosa for an appetizer, I wanted Lamb korma and the waiter sold me another plate (Lamb Pasanda) saying that it was the same sauce and that he could add the nuts and the raisin to the plate (he completely forgot about this). The nan was great. The drinks - we had some martinis and they were not."
5,"Been to this place (I prefer Coconut Grove location) several times by now. Have Friday reservation again and can&apos;t wait. Butter chicken is there to die for, especially with garlic naan. Their mango martinis are something else!"
5,"What an amazing spot for lunch. Loved it.
Alihandro , our server deserves a special mention. He is an amazingly sweet and happy guy. 

We ordered lunch specials- thali. Butter chicken thali (14.95$) and matar paneer thali (11.95$)

You can upgrade to get a garlic naan instead of butter nan just for an extra dollar. 

Food portion, quality n taste is great. I ordered super hot and it was super hot. I really have high tolerance for spicy. Recommend to all. One of the best Indian food I have had in US"
5,"Whenever I visit Miami, Bombay Darbar is an absolute must! Some of the best Indian food I&apos;ve ever had. I ordered takeout for the first time last night because I didn&apos;t care to go anywhere, and the quality still impressed me! My friends and I ordered: A side of Basmati Rice, Butter Chicken Lamb Vindaloo, Tandoori Wings, and Samosas. Last time I ordered the butter chicken and lamb vindaloo super spicy one and while It was delicious, It was not for the faint of heart. This time I went for medium spicy and It was a lot more mild. The flavors of the sauces are so rich and sit atop the rice wonderfully. The chicken wings are also perfectly cooked and a hit EVERY TIME. You will not be disappointed if you love Indian food because they have so many options and something for everyone! The food we ordered was pretty decent portion for three people. If you&apos;re in a group of big eaters maybe order two or three more entrees and some naan."
5,The food was par excellent. Our server Alejandra was superb. She had the sweetest attitude. Congrats to Bombay Darbar for the great food and drinks. My son was sooo happy will return within the week. New York is cold so we plan to stay more.
