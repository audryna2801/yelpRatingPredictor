5,"The best restaurant I&apos;ve been to since moving back to Miami. Might be the best restaurant in Miami period.

Amazing to dine-in, hard to get reservations so you have to stalk opentable for openings.

Once covid hit we were so happy they were doing takeout, tasted just as good at home.

Every single item on the menu is delicious, but some of our go-tos are brisket, caulfilower, crispy tuna."
5,"The hype is real, and KYU is one of the single best dining experiences you&apos;ll have not just in Miami but just about anywhere. 

Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?

Yes, getting a peak reservation at KYU is damn near impossible, but that&apos;s at least in party because they graciously leave quite a bit of bandwidth open for walk ins. Thus, roll in between 1630 and 1700 and odds are pretty good unless it&apos;s a weekend that you&apos;ll snag a spot for four for at least an hour and a half. Once seated service is excellent. Star. 

Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?

The prices are sort of all over the map at KYU, but there&apos;s certainly good value to be found. Can that value be found with the $45.00 short ribs? Well, no, but they&apos;re worth it anyway and if you&apos;re pinching pennies go with the likes of the Pork Belly Bao and the Crispy Rice. Good stuff good prices. Star. 

Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?

It was all just out of this world. Both the crispy rice tuna and the pork belly bao were among the best I&apos;ve had anywhere, ever, and the short ribs and the stone pot rice were exceptionally unique and will have me gushing for weeks. Brilliant. Two Stars. 

Star 5: Would you be excited to go back?

This is one of the best dining experiences in the city. Star."
5,"Kyu has been on my radar for a while now, and my boyfriend and I finally made it here for dinner on our latest Miami visit! We arrived slightly early to our reservation, but were seated more or less right away, which was great. Immediately upon walking in, we could smell the (yummy) barbecue!

Among the dishes we shared were the below:

Chilled King Crab: I always love when they make the crab error proof, and this one certainly was (picking out the meatiest part of the legs, making it super easy for the eater to extract the meat)! You really can&apos;t go wrong with chilled crab.

Crispy Tuna Tartare: The crispy rice base was the perfect mix of crispy yet chewy. A bit on the sticky side, but it worked well with the equally tasty tuna!

Roasted Cauliflower: This shishito pepper based sauce though!! Yum, who knew cauliflower could be so flavorful! Definitely deserves its reputation as one of the most popular dishes at Kyu.

Whole Grilled Maitake Mushroom: As a mushroom lover, you really can&apos;t go wrong with mushrooms in my book! This guy is super filling - and actually in general, the portion sizes here are quite generous (so be prepared to have a good sized meal...or some leftovers)!

Korean Fried Chicken: Some of the crispiest fried chicken I&apos;ve had, and the sauce was very flavorful too! 

All in all, we had a super satisfying meal at Kyu. This place lives up to the hype!"
4,"Soft shell crab bun ($18 for 2 buns): delicious! The crab was crispy and not too greasy. The meat to bun ratio wasn&apos;t great though. I wish they there was more crab. 

Mussels ($24): the mussels were cooked with toasted garlic, chili and lime. Mussels were on the smaller side and it wasn&apos;t particularly appetizing that they were drenched in oil.

Broccoli ($9): bland and a little too burnt

Beef short ribs, grilled octopus, and bone marrow : Mr A. said these dishes were awesome but sadly I didnt get to try them because I arrived late. 


Bone Marrow: 
Note: 18% gratuity was automatically added to the bill"
3,"WARNING: 18% gratuity already included!! I did not check the bill properly and my husband ended up paying extra money. What was surprising was that the server did not mention it at all. They do not give a paper bill so its hard to check the bill on a device. The place is bit overhyped. The ambience is amazing and the food was flavorful but it had too much salt and the desert was just too sweet. The drinks were ok. The mule was just ok but the &apos;pink&apos; named drink was good. It&apos;s definitely a one time go but would not visit again. 

Our order :Dark Chocolate S&apos;mores Cake, Roasted Cauliflower, Veggie Thai Rice Pot,"
5,"Came here for the 1st time for my cousin&apos;s bday. This is her favorite restaurant and I see why. The food was absolutely delicious. I enjoyed everything that we all ordered. I had the short rib and coconut creamed spinach. The mussels as appetizers. Love the toasted bread it came with. The Broccoli with a hint of ginger on top. Mmm! Had a small piece of the Florida snapper. That brown butter white misco was everything. I normally don&apos;t have space for dessert but That night the coconut cake was worth leaving space for. It was thick and delicious. Not too coconuty. I will definitely be back  i wanna try the fried chicken, bone marrow and cauliflower."
4,"Seating was super simple and the food was delicious. The waiter explained the menu thoroughly, but one dish in particular was not the best. We don&apos;t recommend the fried rice..... wayyyy too much ginger paste. Other than that, the servers were attentive &amp; the place was super chic! Lots of things to do around the area after dinner as well. They picked a great location! Reminds me of artsy industrial Brooklyn NY!"
5,"Came many times. Has become a busy spot, service can be slow bc of it. The coconut cake is incredible. Definitely one of the best desserts I&apos;ve had."
5,"This place over exceeded my expectations.located in wynwood, cute place with outside seating. Unique drinks with a Japanese touch. The food is spectacular, after going a few times. My favorite things on the menu is the cream spinach with crispy shallots wow. The crispy rice is amazing and the roasted cauliflower comes with a sauce that pairs so well together. The crispy pork is such a treat! You have to order that. Lastly all their desserts are amazing but the coconut cake is soooo good, only complaint is the ice cream scoop is way too small for such a big piece of cake. It&apos;s sour from the cream cheese frosting and sweet from the cake and crunchy from the roasted coconut and it could serve up to 4 people! Everything is delicious. I highly recommend this place. The service is rocky, I&apos;ve had good experiences and okay experiences. Depends on the waiter. Bar tenders are always super nice, but the food remains a star. Lastly the pricing is definitely not cheap but you&apos;re paying for an experience. A meal that will surprise your taste buds !!  Highly recommend!"
4,"Solid spot - definitely recommend coming with a group so you can try everything! 

I loved everything but the cauliflower wasn&apos;t my favorite - mainly cause the goat cheese is a bit much"
5,"Do not sleep on KYU. This was the best restaurant we&apos;ve been to in a very long time. You can see the love and effort that was poured into each dish. My wife and I ordered the pork belly bao buns, himachi tar tar, Korean fried chicken and king crab rice bowl. Absolutely f%@$!ing delicious. Every dish had levels and levels of beautiful flavor. We stopped in for a quick snack before dinner and ended up staying. Do not skip this restaurant."
2,"2 stars at best! This is my second time here after i was lucky enough to forget the first time. I wanted to give it another try after more glorified reviews and a huge social media following. Their pics are great but let me assure you the food is not up to par. 

We tried a wide variety of food on the menu with the most notable being the mussels. In a red sauce and zak the baker bread this dish barely kept our experience afloat. 

Do not get the highly esteemed cauliflower its a waste of money. Absolutely no flavor in a sauce of absolutely no flavor either, very bland and tasteless. We ordered the short rib and duck and neither of them were memorable. The duck was tasteless, slightly gamey and too chewy. The short rib was an embarrassment, for a hefty price would expect it to be out of this world. Yet it was barely anything but less than average.

The drinks were a hefty $14 at least which you might expect on the beach for high quality crafted cocktails. We stuck with one and that was the end of it. 

SERVICE: I dont even remember what our waiter looked like. She took no interest in making our experience memorable nor exciting. Simple transactional as my dining partner would say it. 

I wanted nothing more than a memorable and delicious dining experience after driving 45+ minutes to get there, a reservation made 3 weeks in advance and whopping $300+ spent. 

Ps. They have had the same menu for years now. A good restaurant evolves. 

Pss. The 2 stars is for the mussels. Have a nice day."
4,"Love the food here and the vibes! The chef has such a versatile and interesting menu with many vegetarian options. The fish is always fresh, and the drinks are spot on. Hostess staff is the worst. Turn around time between tables is literally 25-30 min to clean up and seat next party. I would give five stars if it weren&apos;t for them."
1,"I&apos;m convinced anyone that comes here does not come for the food, they simply come for the hype. KYU has a loyal following of influencers and foodies who want to dine at hip and relevant restaurants in the prevailing food scene in Miami specifically the Wynwood area. A reason it has been on my radar for some time now which added to my dismay and disappointment. 

I would describe our dining experience as underwhelming and overrated to say the least, a sentiment shared with the two other Yelp elite members I dined with. My review is fair and warranted considering we selected several dishes we collectively agreed on. The infamous cauliflower was by far my least favorite, it tasted uncooked with a bland combination of flavors. The mussels were the only star of the night everything else was questionable. $44 short rib was a modest and salty portion. The duck breast was the least appetizing I&apos;ve ever had. After a bite no one went for more. The cocktails tasted like juice with no hint of liquor. The tuna tartare was misleading. By the time dessert came we were ready for the check. The presentation for dessert was aesthetically pleasing, we opted for both s&apos;mores and the popular coconut cake agreeing the s&apos;mores dessert was significantly better however not appetizing enough to sway our opinions on dinner. 

It&apos;s worth mentioning service was generic and transactional. 

After $300 for a party of the three it&apos;s fair to say this experience was one star."
5,"I really liked KYU :)

My favorite restaurant in Wynwood I&apos;ve went to thus far, and it&apos;s not even close. 

The cocktails are truly amazing, and food is even better! I knew as I was plate watching before my order, that the food was going to be magnificent! Every dish that came out, left me drooling! 

I highly recommend the Korean fried chicken, the Thai basil fried rice, and the bok choy .

I can guarantee you that this isn&apos;t any ordinary fried chicken! I was a little hesitant when our server recommended it, due to the fact I felt like I could get fried chicken anywhere, I&apos;m so glad I got it! The sauce underneath the chicken is everything! Compliments with the chicken perfectly! I will say the sauce, is a spicy butter sauce, so if you&apos;re sensitive to spicy food I would recommend getting the sauce on the side :)"
3,"Visit: first
Food: 
tuna: delish but tiny
Corn: sweet and soft
Rice: liked the flavor and great portion but rice was hard

Atmosphere: open scale, luxury but also family vibe, kitchen was open, lots of seating areas, minimum $$ to sit due to covid, happy hour had a small menu
Staff: young and vibrant 
Tips: try the tuna!

Return:maybe"
5,Had to come back for more after a few weeks of not having this amazing meal! Sasha and Kristin were amazing hostesses and seated my party right away outdoors as we requested. Katrina was an unbelievable waitress just like Diana. The staff is truly amazing here and the food is hard to beat. Some new things we tried was the cauliflower which was so flavorful and perfectly browned as well as the tuna tataki which was delicious. The coconut cake was also spectacular -- you don&apos;t need to like coconut to like this cake. We also received a complimentary order of the hamachi crispy rice which was very tasty. I absolutely love it here - if you&apos;re in Miami you need to do whatever it takes to come here for a meal!
5,"This place is outstanding! Everything sounded amazing on the menu, but decided on the roasted cauliflower, tuna tartare, and Korean fried chicken, everything was delicious. Highly recommend all 3 items. Drinks were spot on, I had a matcha drink with pineapple and it was so refreshing. The vibe and service were awesome. Cannot wait to come back!"
3,"Came here for the first time with my husband and a few girls friends which was recommended by our hotel concierge. The outdoor seating and ambience was nice. The service was GREAT but overall the food  was edible but okay in our honest opinion.

Guess this was an Asian American BBQ fusion spot.

Learned that all of Miami has an AUTO GRATUITY of 18% we are very generous tippers as we are are small restaurant owners but believe tips should be deserved on hospitality of service. We don&apos;t believe in this practice.

We ordered as recommended by the server the Cauliflower, Korean Fried Chicken, and Stone Pot Fried Rice w/crab.

Picked a few appetizers on our own; 
Gyozas/3pieces
Pork belly buns/2pieces
Grilled Broccoli

*The Cauliflower 8/10 wasn&apos;t bad and the green sauce that came with it as everyone&apos;s favorite at the table.

*Korean Fried Chicken 3/10 - so were from LA and we know what authentic style Korean Fried Chicken is if you know Bon Chon/Kyo Chon this place does not even come close to what real Korean Fried Chicken tastes like. 

This dish might have been a little over hyped and we noticed the other servers around us hyping that it was the best fried chicken in all of Miami. 

*Stone Pot Fried Rice w/crab(additional up charge $6) - 6/10

Flavor wasn&apos;t bad, barely any crab that could have been tasted. Found maybe 2-3 strands of rice grain sized pieces.

Not your traditional dry fried rice. This was more of a wet? Styled version (similar to a gumbo consistency/gravy textured.

*Gyoza 8/10
Fairly small bite sized portions that came with 3 pieces, flavor and sauce was on point!

*Pork Belly Bao Buns- 8/10 
2 pieces per plate we ordered a few plates this was one everyone&apos;s favorite item on the raved menu.

*Grilled Broccoli with Ginger candy
10/10 everyone loved this interestingly fusioned dish and sweet and salty flavors especially the garlic and ginger candy!"
5,"This is a definite FIVE STARS!! The food, the ambiance, the service... phenomenal!! Very unique and delicious flavors. Roasted cauliflower- WOW!!  Amazing, the sauce complimented something that is so simple! And the octopus, fantastic. It&apos;s a very cute little spot in Miami, staff was very funny and took their time to explain every dish. Because it&apos;s a scratch kitchen, everything came out one at a time, but it was not a long wait in between. We were a party that was sharing all plates, so it worked very well for us. I would recommend KYU to everyone!!"
