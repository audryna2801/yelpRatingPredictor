5,"Absolutely fantastic burgers. Spacious seating and lots of outdoor seating. The food here is very good, there are so many different options to choose from and the staff is really friendly"
5,"Omg one of the best burgers I&apos;ve had! I got the Frita burger as recommended by the waitress and it was SO. GOOD. The combination of the guava jelly with the bacon and potato stix is the best sweet and salty combo!! It sounds weird, but it is delicious! There is a reason why it is one of the top 52 burgers in the US. The patty itself was juicy and flavorful as well! They seem to be good with taking Covid precautions as well with the contact less menus and social distancing with the tables. Our waitress was so patient as well and helpful with making suggestions on the menu! Highly recommend this place :)"
5,"The service was outstanding, but be prepared to wait to be seated! They have indoor and outdoor seating. 

Food was delicious, fries were my favorite! It was my first time eating alligator, but the way they prepared it, I was able to enjoy it. The sauces were super flavorful as well. A very dope burger spot."
5,"Kush has the best burger in town, period.....

If you&apos;re a burger lover, you know it and if not, you know what to do. I always go for the classic burger that supposed to be simple but their burgers is everything but simple, DeLecious 

You can also find good local craft beer, and we all know that Good beer ain&apos;t cheap and cheap beer ain&apos;t good"
3,"Venue - 2 out of 5. Decor and vibe suited to a niche clientele who value dub beats and second-tier graphic art. Gritty sums it up. Hey 

Staff - 5 out of 5. Helpful, friendly, prompt, and accurate. Kudos to Kush on this one.

Food - 3 out of 5. Tasty enough - get the Johnny&apos;s Utah over the Frita unless you like sweet burgers - and worth a visit, but no need to return again. Although it is a local favorite, I&apos;m good."
4,"This place is definitely a gem in Miami! I&apos;ve been here a few times, very different times of the day and the food is always spot on! I always have the Local burger with sweet potato fries. I also had the staff salad and is quite amazing!
They have an amazing selection of craft beers, always ask about what&apos;s local, they always have something cool!
Keep in mind parking is challenging as much of Wynwood. Also keep in mind this is quite a small place, so there is usually a wait during certain times of the day.
Cheers!"
4,"I just came here for the BEER!!! 
 
Enjoying the Wynwood day vibes and hopping from spot to spot called for a much-wanted tasty beer.  Checked on untappd to see if they had an updated craft beer selection which they did for the most part.  This spot has the real dive bar look and feel to it with a trendy vibe.  Not big at all but has a few tables to sit inside with seating at the bar and a picnic tables for outdoor seating for those sunny days.  

Wait was probably 5 minutes or so for indoor seating, but it did take our waiter awhile to greet us which was a bit of a turn off.  The craft beer selection was fairly good, and I was able to get my hands on some breweries I wouldn&apos;t normally be able to as easily.  As a craft beer lover, I am always looking to try out of state breweries and ones that are hard to come by.  There was one beer in particular I really wanted to try, and they didn&apos;t have it, although it was listed on their untappd menu (All good).  Another issue I had was that I was served an ipa that was outdated and definitely skunked on me.  If you know beers, then you know Ipas many times will lose their flavor profiles after a few months.  This can was bottled about 5 months before it was served to me but sometimes you get lucky and it stays fresh.... clearly, I was not this time. 

 Other than the issues mentioned above, I DIG this place and would definitely come back to enjoy more of their beer selection and food.  It&apos;s a pleasure to enjoy a place that has a wide variety of craft beer selections, good vibes, chill atmosphere, and outdoor seating for those nicer days. On top of that!!!! my server as well as others was super nice, attentive once greeted us and he even took the time out to thoroughly search at the bottom of the beer fridge (or whatever they use) for a can I really wanted.  

BEER LOVERS!!!  I recommend this spot!!!"
4,"Didn&apos;t have the best experience to be honest but still giving it four stars because I can see the potential. I ordered take out and I think that was my first mistake, in my opinion if you don&apos;t eat these handcrafted burgers fresh they&apos;re just not going to be the same. 
   Even though I live really close, by the time I got home either my burger patties turned well done by sitting in the containers for about 10 mins or they just weren&apos;t cooked to be medium rare. Dining in seems to have a really nice vibe especially while ordering from their tap selection which they&apos;re famous for. Anyway, hope to be back and have a better experience."
4,"We visited on a Sunday afternoon and sat outside on the benches.  
Service was very good. Our waitress was extremely professional and very sweet. She knew all the menu items and started off right away with letting us know what the favorite items were. 
The place is located at the edge of the Wynwood area, so don&apos;t be taken aback or confused by the surroundings. You&apos;re good. Parking is right next door in a very indiscreet lot. 
Our party tried the following : 
- Chicken and Waffles- good but slightly soggy on the batter
-Frita- highly recommended. Very unique taste in a burger. Love the guava. 
- Spicky Chicken - good but nothing particularly special. The fries were very well seasoned. 
-Lokal Burger

Overall, we had a good time and found true food, overall, tasty."
5,"Good burger, cold beer, excellent service (Thank You Chris).  
Frits burger was delicious with the different sweet and savory.  Sweet potato fries were perfect.  Even something as elementary as a grilled cheese and tomato soup was great.  Perfectly toasted sandwich and delicious soup.  Chris gave us perfect beer to wash it all down.  The key lime pie hit the spot.  Definitely will be back.  Thanks Kush."
4,"This place was so cute and the waitress we had made for a great experience! I liked their selection of local beers and their grilled salad with lemon chicken was one of the best salads I&apos;ve had in Florida. Also highly recommend their alligator bites. Their Johnny Utah was okay in my opinion, definitely on the heavier side which overwhelmed the flavor of the entire burger.

Overall a great spot to check out if you happen to be in Wynwood and want some classic American food."
3,"5 stars for the food. Great burgers!

3 stars for service. With abundance of 7-8 servers for small restaurant, we felt largely ignored. Bunch of kids working here. 

1 star for only one toilet. For an extremely busy place, they should have more restrooms. I had to wait 20 mins for some dude taking care of business.

1 star for location &amp; parking- Ghetto area. Confusing parking next to the restaurant with signs saying &quot;park at your own risk&quot;. So what TF DOES THAT MEAN?! The simple &quot;We are not responsible for any loss or theft&quot; sign is sufficient enough."
5,"The burgers are so good. I got mushrooms as a side and they are big! Flavor was on point! My partner ordered a waffle sandwich, it was so good. I recommend this place. Definitely will come back here when I visit Miami. Good beer and great service."
4,I now understand the high rating. The staff was friendly. The Frida Burger was on point. Great little spot in midtown Miami. I enjoyed mixing my choice of fries. The burger patty was cooked just right.
4,"I typically do my reviews right after i eat so it&apos;s 100% fresh on my mind but this is about 3 days late. But anyway i got the &quot;Angry chef&quot; burger. I was a little nervous bc i don&apos;t really like cole slaw like that BUT to my surprise it added yummy flavor and just the right amount of crunch. The burger was very good, not blow your socks off elite but yes it is indeed good! 
The sweet potato fries were very dry though and nothing to write home about. I just dipped them in the bbq sauce and ate them like that. I could do without the fries next time. 
Overall, good burger, yes i would return!"
4,"On the outskirts of Wynwood theres Kush! 
We sat outside enjoying all the street art. 

Started off with the Black bean dip and it was phenomenal. Served with chips, carrots and celery for dipping. 

The star for me is the beer!!! I tried a couple and they were all good but the best for me was the Modern Times LÃ¡ser rain. It was like drinking a candy with hints of guava, lemon and somewhat sour. 
I would go back just for the beer. 

The Black bean burger was hearty and very flavorful. Served with a nice helping of fries. 

Would definitely make the trip again especially during the day to enjoy the art. 

Thanks Kush!"
5,"Came here on a whim and I&apos;m so glad that I did. The food was absolutely amazing and the service was great as well. Lucy, my waitress recommended the alligator bites and the frita burger and both items did not disappoint. I look forward to coming back and trying some other items on the menu!"
4,"Exceptional food. However, staff was unaware if there is military discount. She said yes, then Took my id, disappeared for 30 minutes, to come back and say no. Please just advise staff, as taking the of for 30 minutes it&apos;s a bit much."
3,"Great beers but the burger really wasn&apos;t out of this world. I had the Johnny Utah. It had one slice of pastrami that I really couldn&apos;t taste. I had to add salt to the burger to try to bring out some flavor. It was juicy, though, and the fries were great. I wouldn&apos;t be rushing back to eat here but the vibe and the beer selection are good enough to where I wouldn&apos;t be opposed. Just alright."
5,I literally know what the hype is all about! I had the classic burger and it was so tasty. I want to go back and eat 4 of them! This spot is located in Wynwood and the ambience was cool. The French fries were amazing itself as well!
