5,"Excellent food! Very very generous plates. 
Inexpensive, but the ambiance and great quality of the produce makes a for fine lunch/dine experience.
Its my fifth time, I&apos;ll keep coming back! 
No fear of Covid at all.
Very distanced and sanitized! :) 
Sharon took care of me, she new every detail of the menu and made great suggestions."
5,"CVI.CHE105 is among the most and top reviewed places in Miami according to Yelp, and you&apos;d better believe it&apos;s all very well deserved. Over the course of a week in Miami this was my favorite dish. 

Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?

It&apos;s all just great. The location, the atmosphere, the service, the take out options. You absolutely can&apos;t go wrong with CVI.CHE105 for virtually any occasion. period. Star. 

Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?

I&apos;ll admit that I had to steady myself upon seeing that CVI.CHE105&apos;s flaship Mixed Arroz Chaufa came with a whopping price tag of $27.95, but those fears were alleviated upon seeing the absolutely mountain of a portion that this came with. My dish could have easily covered two hearty meals, but I opted instead to eat the entire thing over the course of about two hours. Star. 

Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?

This was sensational. Pure and simple. I obsess over rice dishes, love surf and turf, and this turned out to be one of the single best dishes that I&apos;ve had so far in 2021. The flavors came together brilliantly, and it didn&apos;t need sauce or additional seasoning or literally anything to make it better (although admittedly it would have been nice if the shrimp had had their tails removed). Brilliant. Two Stars. 

Star 5: Would you be excited to go back?

Next to Mandolin this is my favorite spot in Miami. Star."

3,"This place has great food and service .
But me and my hubby got 2 ceviches 
One mixto and one of fish with shrimp .
Sadly the mixto had literally 2 shrimps 
And mine had 3 shrimps ; our ceviches looked like fish soups  if im paying $17 i expect to be given evenly amount of seafood . 
i do recommend the sushi roll el chinito .
And dessert had a piece of hair or cloth ."
5,"Incredible food, super fresh, made my taste buds dance with all the flavors. The place had fun vibes, staff both food servers and bar staff were extremely friendly and welcoming. Bar staff was very knowledgeable about the drinks, food and all around culture of Peru. 
We also ordered a grilled platter in addition to the ceviche but I&apos;m not sure of the name. 
It was phenomenal! So juicy and flavorful! Oh and the sauces- I could bathe in!
After this experience, I&apos;m ready to pack up for a trip to Peru!"
3,Location is being remodeled. Sat in the outdoor seating of Pollos Jarras. Had the ceviche special which was great!!! The service was good and the Passionfruit cheesecake was divine!!! 3 stars because the chocolate cake didn&apos;t taste fresh.
5,"My experience here was phenomenal! We had a nice heater next to us during this cold miami winter (62 degrees) and had an awesome server KENDRY! He was very attentive and accommodating in every aspect. He truely made our experience enjoyable!

I drank the house special sangria which consisted of white sangria, passion fruit and pisco! Very good and strong and i feel like the pricing is not too bad for the alcohol content.

The food is really good I had a Causa and it&apos;s tasted very fresh full of flavor with different sauces."
5,"Staff was amazing here 

Totally went above and beyond 

Food wow soooooo delicious and I mean delicious 

Luis recommended an amazing sushi wow it was just perfect 

Over all 5 stars with staff and amazing food"
3,"Love the ceviche ganador. The locale that is in downtown Miami is not finished and we were seated outside in plastic tables. I do understand that they are remodeling the locale. The three ceviches are really good, the lobster tail and crab tasted bad and it was not fresh. Next time I will order the three ceviches. Server was very nice but was way overwhelmed and had too many tables that he was not able to give us the service we deserved. I give it three stars because of the ambiance and the service was not the best, I also did not like the lobster and crab (really gross)."
5,"This might truly be the best  Peruvian Cuisine in Miami. Currently they are closed as they are  remodeling (3/3/2021). When they do open up again, do yourself a favor  and get a reservation. It&apos;s a beautiful restaurant and you will have a  great experience with the staff and the food. Whatever it is you like,  these people are making it an another level."
5,"LOVED the food! I had the Frijoled con Seco and the portion is huge but it was so good that I HAD to finish it! The drinks and dessert were also very good!
The staff was always helpful and the outside area is very well put. 
And prices are well thought so you enjoy a good meal and don&apos;t end up paying with a kidney.
Will surely come back soon!"
5,"We got the Pulpito a la herradura (not shown) &amp; fuente Pacifico - recommended by the amazing waitress! The dishes were behind my expectations. SOOOOOOO GOOOODD and flavorful!

Customer service is over and beyond! Greeted when we first stepped in and continued service never stopped until we left. I asked the manager where the restroom was, and he directed me where to go. He saw me waiting for the women&apos;s restroom and came over to check the men&apos;s restroom - assuming to let me use it since the women&apos;s was occupied. The lady came out of the restroom and the manager said, &quot;let me check if it&apos;s clean first&quot; prior to letting me use the restroom. WOW!!! CUSTOMER SERVICE i&apos;ve never experienced at any other restaurant. Btw, this place is very clean already. 

Try this place, even if you&apos;re not in the area, it&apos;s worth the drive. :)"
4,"I really enjoyed the food here. Portion sizes are generous and the taste is excellent. However I had a couple of issues with the service when I visited this location for dinner. We ordered three items that were pretty big. A special ceviche, an app, and a main. Because it was the first time us being there, we could not figure out what the portion sizes were. When we asked the waiter, he mentioned we may need one more dish. When we got the items, it was abundantly clear that the waiter upsold to us. We literally were so full after the special ceviche that was so big. Also the orders came out so late they had to comp one of the apps for us. We will be back to try different waiter but I did not enjoy the service as much as the food"
5,"Accompanied by the perfect Pisco Sour, our meal of ceviche, anticuchos, and causa was without flaw. The room was vibrant, filled with celebratory people, even families w young children. Welcoming yet never pretentious. I cannot wait to return."
5,This was my first time ever having Peruvian food and I&apos;ll definitely have some more! My group and myself didn&apos;t really know what or how to order and the server was very attentive and descriptive of each of the dishes and the options that came with them. The fish ceviche was the best with the yellow sauce! I also enjoyed a very unique Waikiki sushi roll. The restaurant is for sure a vibe.
2,"As of -2/05/2021 they are not accepting dine-in. They have not updated their yelp, google, or tripadvisor. I submitted several requests to their online reservation service but got no reply... Finally, I got someone on the phone and she updated me. Guess we&apos;ll be going elsewhere."
5,"From classic lomo saltado to fresh ceviches and quirky pisco based cocktails this restaurant never disappoints. It&apos;s not a cheap eat, but it&apos;s satisfying and good. They even handled the check splitting for a larger group of coworkers. (Because the finance department always has the last say on those receipts....)  pre-covid seating was tight, they are popular so that&apos;s to be expected, and outside seating is on a sidewalk that can be somewhat busy and you can&apos;t control the public, but my last turn through all the servers were masked etc."
5,"I loved this place from the moment I walked in! The service is great, the hosts and servers are super friendly and helpful and the ambiance is just so cool. 

I think I can officially say I&apos;ve become a ceviche enthusiast!!! I love going to different places and trying out their signature ceviches. I can say this is one of the best ceviches I&apos;ve had in my life!!! I just wanted more more and we&apos;ll... MORE!!! I&apos;d recommend that anyone who loves ceviche does themselves a favor and stops by to try their divine ceviches. 

We had the anticuchos as well, but when I go back I&apos;d like to try another appetizer. 

Congrats to everyone at Cvi.che 105, we will be back!"
5,Their food never disappoints! I dream about their lomo saltado when I&apos;m in the mood for FRESH Peruvian Cuisine. Their Aji Amarillo ceviche is also the BOMB! Plus their food is just as good at home if you decide to stay in &amp; deliver. The portions are still the same like the restaurant (1 order of lomo &amp; ceviche fed both of us).
5,"Super delicious food, completely obsessed with the chaufa hawaiano and the ceviche mixto Amarillo. El suspiro was to die for. ZULIANI IS LA MEJOR MESERA GRACIAS"
