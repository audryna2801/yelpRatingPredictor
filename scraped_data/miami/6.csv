5,"Had the pleasure of having dinner here a few nights ago.  Parking is a bit hectic on property so I suggest you find a save on the street.  But make certain that you download the parking app and do pay for your time parked. If not you can expect a citation in the mail.  

Our plan was to try their world famous pizza.  We did. And while it was so good, we also decided to grab a plate of their pasta carbonara. It was better than the pizza.  

How do you top a great plate of pasta?  I&apos;ll tell you!  You order their lemoncello cake!  My goodness!  It&apos;s beautiful and the best food of the night.  Our server was Christopher who from the stories we were told has been at the restaurant since the doors opened.  Spectacular meal, great service and a beautiful atmosphere.   

The restaurant does have a sharing charge.  No big deal. They don&apos;t take advantage of you on the cost of wine.  It was well priced.  

Take a drive down to this restaurant.  They offer outdoor seating as well as first come first serve at the bar.   Covid friendly regulations and a nice atmosphere.  Music was not too loud and the smell of the pizza cooking in the back is so welcoming.  I&apos;d post photos but honestly forgot to take pics before we made a mess of our plates.   Oh, the garlic rolls are like nothing we have ever had.  Huge pieces of warm toasted on the outside warm and soft on the inside covered with garlic sauce.  

We had a great experience.  I can only hope that you do as well.  Happy eating !!"
5,"Crust is amazing! The food is DELISH. I&apos;ve had several pies, and they have each blown away my expectations and hit the spot. I&apos;m from NY and this is NOT NY pizza. It&apos;s just really good artisan pizza! The only entree I&apos;ve had is the eggplant parmesan and it&apos;s great, not too acidic bit also not too sweet--a perfect balance. The portions are family style and large. 

The service is also stellar. When pledging your order they all your distance to make sure the food doesn&apos;t get cold. Of you have to wait they make you feel like they&apos;ve known you for years. They escort you to wherever you&apos;ll be waiting and will often times offer you water. Really warm people.  I&apos;ve never eaten there, only take out--they don&apos;t make your experience feel transactional. 

In regard to Covid, everyone is wearing masks and they ensure that there is social distancing."
5,"Although my nutritionist would give it less :) Crust remains 5 stars for me! Their strong takeout game during peak quarantine helped guide me to said nutrionist with my usual delicious chicken parmesan and the best caprese salad in Miami. That I have 5 pages of photos attests to how yummy the food, and how friendly the service is.

My most recent trip was dinner out with a friend. We sat at the bar and I enjoyed my usual favorite although a much smaller portion. Yes, it is still as yummy as usual with melted cheese, noodles just past al dente and a robust &amp; flavorful tomato sauce. As it were, it was fresh and cleanly prepared enough that Luna  enjoyed takeout leftovers. I also enjoyed dessert - one of their crispy &amp; creamy cannoli with blueberries. Besides, I was going to Spinning the next morning :)

You know how seafood and I don&apos;t get along. My friend ordered their lobster ravioli. It was prepared cleanly enough - and they seem to have a good AC system - that I didn&apos;t get triggered.

Here&apos;s to many more years!"
5,"Great restaurant,  the food is fantastic and our waiter Jose was amazing!!

The portions are family style so go hungry but you will love having the leftovers for days!!

Highly recommended!!"
5,"I have eaten here several times with family and friends. The menu is really a pizza lover&apos;s dream, and the variety of Italian food and pizza, they make is excellent. I have enjoyed their Seafood Risotto, Chicken Parm, and Garlic Rolls.

Most recently I was in with my family, and one of our group was on a tight schedule. The hostess put in the pie order before seating me, and then we ordered drinks after we sat down. We got our Truffle Pizza quickly and were able to enjoy a somewhat leisurely meal before that person had to leave. The waitress and hostess were accommodating, and we didn&apos;t feel we lost out on the experience.

They also have a great drink selection. Definitely a nice place for awesome food and drinks. Excellent customer service."
5,"I love this place! Not the first time I go, I&apos;ve been there more than a handful of times. MUST GO! Amazing service! Make a reservation before going. You won&apos;t go wrong with anything you order. Make sure you share entrees, they are BIG. I&apos;ve had most of their pizzas and I love them all. Their mozzarella cheese is out of this world, the crust salad is my absolute favorite, and their lemon cake is out of this world. 
Must must must go!"
5,"I was recommend this place by my fellow yelper Sergio. We went on a Friday evening a bit early and their was no wait we was able to be seated right away. From the moment I stepped foot inside I felt I was in great hands. The service here was definitely A1. 


Nice brown decor,  dimmed lighting. I definitely appreciate they are still being careful with covid restrictions and are seating patrons far out from eachother. That was an A+ to me. 

The menu is pretty large so I was unsure what to order then I spotted Lobster Ravioli.
I ordered this and it was made with red sauce and green peas. Super yummy. Fresh. And was a very nice size. 

While dining I enjoyed Red Sangria and caught up with my friend. The owners were beyond welcoming and took a moment to chat with me which I loved. It was an awesome encounter over all. I ended the nighy trying their famous cannolis it was awesome.  

I can&apos;t wait to return. I did valet parking for $10 since street parking seemed to be limited."
5,"Highly recommend One the Italian restaurant in Miami
We celebrated birthday dinner  !&quot;
Great service  in Miami  we order garlic roll pizza and Pasta we can only said is Wow !&quot;"
5,"I came here after taking a break from moving into the neighborhood, praying that I would find my go-to pizza spot. It&apos;s safe to say I did. 

Being gluten and grain free is extremely challenging. A lot of gluten free crusts have rice flour, preventing me from eating it. Crust offered a cauliflower crust and they did not disappoint. I ordered the pepperoni and Margherita gluten free pies which were delicious. They do not skimp on toppings and had a perfect balance of cheese and sauce... I&apos;m from New York, I love my pizza. For the Margherita, each small slice of tomato had its own piece of basil on top, and there was plenty of pepperoni on the other pie. 

My server, Bo, was outstanding and should expect to see me here often! He did let me know that the gluten free pasta option is made from corn and rice, for anyone who is sensitive to rice. Add a cassava pasta option and you&apos;ll get 10 stars."
5,"This is the most amazing Italian places I have ever been to. The staff is SO welcoming and sweet, they make sure you feel comfortable being here and answer every question. They are personable and knowledgeable about the menu and history of the restaurant. 
My father in law took me here and the owner personally came over to say hello and remembered seeing him here before. 
The food. I couldn&apos;t say enough praises about this food. The potions sizes are huge and every dish is made with love and care. The food was authentic, fresh and absolutely wonderful. 
I will be returning here and wish I could give it more Stars"
5,So affordable and such a good amount of food! I ate it for dinner the next day too. Totally recommend
5,"One of the best restaurants I have been to in a long time! I&apos;ve been hearing for months how HUGE the portions at Crust are but figured the food would be subpar considering it&apos;s size. Boy was I wrong!!! 

The location of Crust is very nostalgic; it sits on a corner with several Miami staples around it (Garcia&apos;s, Kiki on the River, etc.) Although crust does not have its own parking, they provide valet. There is also tons of street parking around! The restaurant itself is somewhat small and cozy but there is still plenty of seating and you can sit outside. 

To begin with, the employees are incredibly friendly and attentive! The hostess was so kind and had a smile on her face for every customer that walked in. Our waiter, Chris, was a delight to have! He was extremely attentive and made amazing conversation! He was also great with the kids! 

The food...oh the food. When the giant plates of food were placed on the table I was beside myself! Pictures do their size no justice! I ate until I couldn&apos;t breathe and barely a dent was made in my massive plate. I now have lunch and dinner for the next day! I went with the gnocchi carbonara. The taste was an explosion of flavors. The sauce was creamy and garlicy. My boyfriend ordered the chicken Milanese which brought 3 giant crusted chicken pieces and a giant plate of creamy garlic sauce. I tried a slice of my sisters pizza which had honey and walnuts. The taste was out of this world. Such an interesting blend of salty and sweet worked together perfectly. My sisters girlfriend ordered the truffle mushroom risotto; this will definitely be what I order next time I come! The risotto came with a heaping mound of sliced Parmesan, tons of mushrooms and just the right amount of truffle oil (not too overwhelming and not too little). 

I cannot rave about this place enough! If Crust is not on your list of restaurant to try, make sure to add it as your next option!"
5,Love the food here. Great portion size and great flavors! Service is always so nice and friendly! Came close to closing one night and they never rushed us at all.
2,"The food hasn&apos;t maintained it&apos;s quality,  I ordered the Shrimp Francés and I was disappointed, it was the first time that I&apos;ve had any Francés dish with out it being coated in flour, it was bare naked shrimp thrown on top of oily linguini. Another thing that they are doing which in my opinion is deceptive is that when you order through a delivery service the menu prices are much more expensive in addition to a very high service fee. I hate being ripped off and this is the end of Crust for me."
4,"Went here for dinner last night and the food was really good. I did have to make a reservation online because I couldn&apos;t reserve through the website since it was a party of two. For a party of two you have to sit at the bar...no problem. Our waiter was yami (hope I spelled it correctly) she was very nice and observant. For starters we got the pan fried mozzarella and the garlic rolls. The mozzarella was really good with the marinara sauce. My only complaint was the garlic rolls. They need to be cooked a little bit more so they could&apos;ve been softer. I also got the linguine carbonara. That was really delicious, huge portions as well. The pizza was good and cheesy as well. We didn&apos;t even finish everything. We boxed everything to go. Also got a tiramisu to go because due to yami recommendations. All in all I will be coming back there to try different options next time. Thank you"
5,"Phenomenal. I absolutely love the pizza and meatballs from the crust. I&apos;m not even a meatball type of person; but omg and their garlic rolls...amazing! The parking isn&apos;t the best so I do recommend making a reservation to avoid any issues, but definitely an amazing place to at least try once. LOVE LOVE LOVE"
4,"Great pizza, the crust was my favorite part. It was just a little crispy on the bottom but still a little soft on top, perfectly cooked. A good amount of toppings as well. It was hot when it arrived. Thus, we rest the whole day with a tummy full! Thank you so much for the perfect taste you made for our order! Highly recommended!"
4,Love the service and attention you receive when dining here. You must make reservations as this restaurant is very busy and it is difficult to get a table without them. I recommend the pizza (they&apos;re all amazing). Pasta portion sizes are HUGE!! Parking can be an issue but there is valet and pay to park on the street. Definitely one of my favorite pizza spots.
5,"The whole experience at CRUST was amazing. Great ambiance. Bo was our server, he was friendly, attentive, and fun (he even laughed at our bad jokes). I wanted to try the whole menu because everything sounded good, but with Bo&apos;s assistance, I went with the Penne with Mozzarella in pink sauce. Simply delicious and so fresh. We also had the meatball pizza which did not skimp on the meatball along with cheesy saucy goodness and a perfectly crispy crust. The garlic knots were so fluffy and buttery, also they are giant. The Alfredo sauce was creamy and rich. Everything went well with a glass of Chianti and we had a perfect sweet ending with a port. Next time, I&apos;ll save room for dessert!"
4,"I think I am really critical when it comes to pizza because I have been to Europe also had awesome freshly made pizza in various states.  
I would say this is great pizza but nothing memorable for me.  The flavor is average not incredible or unique.  But it is a great pizza."
