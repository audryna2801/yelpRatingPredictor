5,"Being a donut lover, I had to check out this place in Miami that everyone talks about. 

Covid-19: you order from the walk up window and wait outside for your donuts. 

They have 8-10 donuts to choose from. They have both cake and yeast donuts. I am not a fan of cake donuts (if I wanted cake, I would eat a slice of cake), so that took out about half of the options. 

We tried the White Chocolate Tres Leches Donut and the Guava + Cheese Donut. Both of them were great. I think the Tres Leches was my favorite. It was so unique because it was actually moist just like a tres leches cake would be. 

I will say, I&apos;ve gone to a lot of donut places through my travels and I think this one is a bit over hyped. The donuts are delicous though and it is worth a stop!"
5,"After years of shamelessly ordering their donuts and coffee, Salty has a permanent spot in my heart (and life, lol). When COVID-19 first hit Miami, we were all stuck at home in quarantine and Salty was there for us (but really for my sanity). There was a point where I ordered from here more times than in six weeks than I did all of 2019. 

Between their donut drops, yummy coffee, and donut letters, I could not get enough! They allowed me to share with and give to my friends and to celebrate quarantine birthdays.

Even before COVID, I was a hugeeeee fan of Salty. They definitely know how to make their customers happy AND keep them coming back for more. Every other week there&apos;s a new donut! One day you&apos;re like, &quot;okay I need to take a break&quot; and then the week after, they&apos;re dropping a donut with your favorite ingredient. 

I have too many go-to&apos;s but I love their Cinnamon Toast Crunch/Cereal Milk Latte and their brown butter donut. Tres Leches dessert is typically too sweet for me but their Tres Leches donut is SO good. I love my simple lattes so when they released a new vanilla latte, I was super excited!

The staff is super nice and they&apos;ve done a great job in maintaining the shop this year and all the years before. Probably stopping by this weekend to get some coffee!"
5,"Bro... JUST DO IT! 

I&apos;m not big on sweets, but this is a worthy exception! They recently announced a PISTACHIO CANNOLI and I had to get myself one, so I went today after like a years time (probably more). Still SO good, with great staff. 

For this visit I had the Movember Bourbon Caramel Cheesecake, Pumpkin Spice Cake, Pistachio Cannoli &amp; Guava+Cheese. When I arrived to pick up my order they had ran out of Guava+Cheese so they graciously gave me a free drink token, and moments later their donut guru arrived with fresh ones! Still got my G+C and decided to jump on the Matcha Almond Milk Latte I was already considering, which I liked. A must visit in Wynwood if you&apos;re visiting and currently expanding in Orlando and Dallas!

You know you want some, indulge a little! ;)"
5,"My mother had the guava and cheese and she was enjoying herself lol. Big, flavorful and super good.

There will be a long line but it&apos;s worth the wait and the service was fast. I got there at 3:30 ish and was afraid they may have sold out of most things but they did not. Must try!"
3,"10 stars for customer service, 3 stars for the food itself.

Welp Yelp, I was a dummy who preordered to their South Miami location but showed up at Wynwood for pickup. Check your location!

Their team handled it beautifully - refunded the other order and helped place a new one. Great customer service when it was completely my mistake!

Now the sad part - the donuts were...just okay? We tried tres leches, guava, and boston cream (they forgot to include the brown butter, so that was sad). The Boston Cream had nice balance, being salty and chocolatey. But the other two were sickeningly sweet. I really didn&apos;t enjoy them at all (and I love my sweets)

Also bummed about the cinnamon toast coffee. It lacked flavor. It did taste like cereal milk, but not super cinnamon-y. 

For the price and the hype, it was really a bit of a bummer."
5,"Regulars here. You can&apos;t go wrong with any of their cool, fun, delicious donuts. They&apos;re super decadent so about half of one does the trick for me, with their sea salt caramel iced coffee with oat milk. 

Any time friends or family from out of town pay a visit, we try to fit a visit here because it&apos;s a fun spot to make a good donut impression."
5,"After missing out on the donuts the first time we went on Valentine&apos;s Day because they were sold out, we played smarter by placing our order online in the morning later in the week. I totally recommend you pre-order online because they sell out quick; I still didn&apos;t get to try the white chocolate one. Anyhow, here&apos;s what we did get:
Boston Cream: my personal favorite. Custard fill 
Chocolate hazelnut: this was good. I&apos;m not a fan of hazel nut but friends liked it
Coconut macaroon: tied with Boston cream for favorite. 
Bacon one: this is like your traditional maple donut with bacon on top 
Salty butter: this is unique in taste 

We ordered mocha latte and caramel macchiato as well which were highly praised. 

A must visit in Miami!"
5,Order them early and quickly as they sell out I&apos;m told and long lines. Street parking available it&apos;s metered. Cool  surrounding neighborhood.
5,"These donuts were gifts a few times this year at work. I have been wanting to try them for years and never got around to doing so. I&apos;m kicking myself for not going sooner because they were by far the best donuts I&apos;ve ever had in my life! 
Eat the one with bacon on it and you&apos;ll thank me later. 

These go hand in hand with coffee just like smoking and drinking go hand in hand lol! The dough tasted fresh and donuts are bigger than normal so one is enough for you. Looking at all of them is like looking at a piece of art work since each donut looks like it was individually baked with love. I added pictures below so you can see for yourself. 

The glazed one is delicious as well. Trust me on this one and just try them for yourself. There&apos;s nothing else to say here since these were gifts for us and I didn&apos;t go to the venue. I&apos;d give them a 10 star rating if I could..... heaven to look at and heaven in your mouth!"
5,"OMG This just showed up at my door you&apos;ve got to try,
They come in a variety of gourmet flavors the combinations are amazing"
4,"This is a gem of a treat in the heart of Wynwood. Donuts are delicious, light, and worth it for a hunting foodie. With a bunch of great artwork, tiny food spots, and a helluva night life....Salty Donut definitely helps in the dessert game!"
5,"This place is a must any time I am in Miami. Their flavors are so creative and delicious. It&apos;s hard to pick a favorite as they really nail every variety from salted caramel to maple + bacon to white chocolate tres leches. Try their cinnamon toast crunch latte too, it&apos;s out of this world."
4,"Delicious and unique donuts . I had a cappuccino and the white chocolate tres leches donut and I loved them both . To add to the experience they serve the donuts in the cutest to go box with the cutest coffee cups

I am also appreciative on their Covid 19 efforts as they are not allowing anyone inside. Customers can order to go once they arrive or can also do so online.  Their menu is on the counter window but all the flavors of donuts are also displayed behind the glass so you ca see what you are gonna get before you order 

All love for this unique place !"
5,"Not the biggest donut person, but had to try the best donuts in Miami. Your girl is a glazed donut kind of a gal, so it was a must for me to try the Traditional Glazed. My boyfriend got the Brown Butter + Salt donut. With the first bite, this was the best glazed donut I&apos;ve had. It was light and fluffy and not too sweet! It was just perfection. It didn&apos;t leave that heavy donut feeling. My boyfriend though the Brown Butter + Salt donut was the best donut he ever had and put it as number 1 out of the two. It definitelymelts in your mouth! If you ever have a chance to try this place out, I would highly recommend!"
5,"Wow I love this donut shop! I have been going since it was a small retro trailer and then moved across the street and now it&apos;s on the other side of the street (IYKYK). Anyway, besides their amazing success as a small business, they have created an amazing following of donut lovers (like myself). Miami needed this sweet addition to the food scene and I&apos;m proud to support them. 

We like to order a box on Birthday&apos;s and every other Friday at the office lol. We usually get the Traditional and Brown Butter Salt. Those are my absolute favorites. Their seasonal flavors are amazing as well like the Knausberry Farm Cinnamon bun collab! 

Their coffee drinks are delicious like the cereal milk lattes (YUMM). You really can&apos;t go wrong with a donut &amp; coffee any day of the week so do yourself a favor and go!"
5,"I don&apos;t think any review I post can equate to the consistent flavors, service, and sweet tooth savagery that occurs every single time I come to Miami and into this place.  

Get a donut (or 6 like me haha) and go sit outside by those steps that lead to the tree.  Soak up that WiFi.  Get you that sweetness.  Flavor bending,  amazing ness."
5,"This is one of my absolute favorite places in Miami. Is it usually slammed? Yes. Do I mind? No. 

Their brown butter salt donut is unmatched. I tend to visit donut shops when I travel, and I STILL haven&apos;t found one as good as this. If you&apos;re a fan of cake donuts like me, get on it. If you prefer brioche donuts - their guava + cheese &amp; maple bacon are insane. Definitely meant for sharing because they&apos;re huge. Or eat it all by yourself, YOLO. 

Now for the coffee - their Cinnamon Toast Crunch latte is the best. They soak the cereal in milk and then that really gives the latte it&apos;s sweet flavor. You gotta have it at least once.

The Salty Donut is a bit removed from the Wynwood madness so there&apos;s usually parking right out front."
4,"Came here pre covid with my friends. The line was pretty long and it was packed! But long lines = good food. They have some seating indoors but we sat outside- they had a few big picnic tables with umbrellas. 

We tried the guava and cheese, tres leches, maple bacon and Nutella. These were good but we had trouble finishing all 4 donuts among the 4 of us. They are extremely sweet and a little too much for me, personally. I can see why people love these though, the flavors are great! I would come back but would probably share 1 with 2-3 people as a tiny dessert"
4,"These donuts are very good! You can tell that they use high quality ingredients (like legit chocolate) in their donuts. Their coffees are tasty, and gives you that caffeinated kick you need. I&apos;m knocking off 1 star as I had the Boston cream donut and the filling was more of a whipped custard rather than a true custard that a Boston cream donut should contain. It appears they do this across the board for all their donuts, as the churro star donut had a dulce de leche whipped filling rather than a true dulche de leche. Nevertheless, this donut shop is great, other than my personal preferences to certain fillings!"
4,"Founded by Andy Rodriguez &amp; Amanda Pizarro out of an Aljoa camper in 2015, The Salty Donut is considered by many to be Miami&apos;s best Donut Shop, recent expansion to Orlando seeing the duo&apos;s 24 Hour Brioche and unique toppings add another chapter to its story built on 100% scratch production and only natural ingredients.

Part of trendy Wynwood ever since turning brick &amp; mortar, the narrow storefront at 50 NW 23rd Street currently take-out only, it was via online pre-order that six Donuts were secured the day after Christmas, service anything but &quot;merry&quot; from a young man whose disdain for work was visible even beneath a facemask.

Undeterred by the frosty interaction, instead excited to unbox and share a $25.52 load, Breakfast began with &quot;Brown Butter + Salt,&quot; the day&apos;s only Cake round toothsome yet light with bright Vanilla notes while &quot;White Chocolate Tres Leches&quot; pulled off an impressive feat by protecting the bottom from sog while leavened Brioche was complex and moist.

Rarely ordering Maple Bacon after hundreds of previous tastes, though The Salty&apos;s version outpaces most thanks to bitter-sweet balance from Imperial Porter, suffice it to say that Rodriguez and Pizarro&apos;s &quot;Cannoli&quot; is as stylish as it is delicious while the &quot;Vegan Brioche&quot; piped with Cookie Butter was virtually indistinguishable from the version housing Guava Cream Cheese beneath bits of Streusel fabricated from Puff Pastry."
