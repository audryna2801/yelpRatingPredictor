5,"It&apos;s las ways fun to go here. Now you need to check on ahead of time and get a timed entrance due to Covid. This was helpful. I was glad to see the walls
reopened and limited people. There are security people all around to tell
those that do not put their masks on to do so! And plenty of sanitizer around. I love that the walls are changed. It brightens y day when I come here! Brought my family and they had a good time 2!"
5,"We were recommended to stop by the walls by the concierge at the hotel we were staying at and it did not disappoint. Being a big Shephard Fairey and his art from a young age it was nice to be able to see his gallery, murals, and all the other great street art. If you are not too familiar with street artists then it may just look like a bunch of graffiti and murals, but for the fans of artists such as Retna you are in for a treat just walking around. 

There is a gift shop in the middle, different art galleries, and small food shops located on the outskirts. It is quite touristy, and you will see people of all walks of life here. Bring your camera, snap a few pics for insta, and you will be on your way.

I would say it is a must visit if you are not planning on coming back to Miami anytime soon."
5,"I love Wynwood Walls and try to visit as much as I can. There are different art walls that you can see, small cool bars and restaurants and it feels great to be there. If you like art and don&apos;t care about walking in the sun, this is your place and even if you get too hot you can always stop and get a drink or chill for a while. 
There are plenty of parking spots, we&apos;ve stopped on a paid zone, so had to pay for the parking for a few hours but walking around is fun. 
I like taking photos of the art walls, they tell stories and the colors are really beautiful.
I think they update the walls from time to time, but as I am new to Miami, it was new to me and hope next time when I go there will be some new art walls."
3,"They took all the graffiti and put it in a graffiti museum. 
And they charged the people ten dollars just to see &apos;em. 

Don&apos;t it always seem to go
That you don&apos;t know what you&apos;ve got till it&apos;s gone

They took all the graffiti and put it in a graffiti museum
(Ooh, bop-bop-bop-bop, ooh, bop-bop-bop-bop)

5,Had a great time visiting Wynwood Walls. It was very vibrant and spacious. It&apos;s free with rsvp. Do check it out if in the area.
1,They started charging $10 per person. This is not what graffiti and street art is about. It&apos;s a shame. Wynwood Walls belongs to the public and has always been free to the public. The Miami mayor should step in and fix this!!
5,"Excellent street are that&apos;s painted on the walls in an urban area of Miami. There&apos;s an entrance fee to enter the area. However, you can enjoy free art that&apos;s in the area without paying the fee to enter Wynwood Walls."
5,"This neighborhood is everything that I love about Miami. Fantastic food, explosions of color and of course the walls of graffiti. In today&apos;s current social climate, it is a treat to be able to enjoy this unconventional art for. Each wall is unique. Some of the art will make you giggle, there are whimsical creatures and others will make you pause and reflect. There are so many photo and selfie opportunities. Enjoy it on just a fun superficial level or dig into the history of graffiti and it&apos;s social relevance. This area is something special either way."
2,"Just okay. Wouldnt go back. Charge $10 per person to get in and its not that big. If youre an artist and really into art, then I think its okay. Or if youre into getting good photo ops"
5,"Great spot highly recommend. 
Must seeing beautiful beautiful art 

And free entrance what els can u ask for. 

Loved it went twice"
5,"If you are looking to expand your activities pass the beach scene in Miami I definitely recommend stopping by the wynwood walls. Purchase your ticket beforehand, you&apos;ll be given a time to stop by as to avoid overcrowding. Great photo op spot as well."
5,"Wynwood Walls is a must stop in Miami if you&apos;re an art or mural fan. The walls are updated frequently, and keep set open/close hours to prevent vandalism (I assume). 

Shepard Fairey always seems to have something going here, and I love the different styles of the muralists. There are a variety of tours official and unofficial that will talk about the Walls, and next time I&apos;m in Miami I may jump on the one that melds the Wynwood Walls with local craft beer history and stops. Cheers! It&apos;s all happening in Miami."
5,"Wynwood has come a long way over the years. It used to be known as a not-so-great neighborhood but it&apos;s been cleaned up and revamped. It&apos;s now known for its many colorful murals and is one of the city&apos;s most happening districts.

Wynwood Walls is an outdoor museum showcasing art by some of the world&apos;s best-known street artists. The surrounding streets have converted warehouses into breweries, funky art galleries, restaurants, clothing boutiques, bistros and late night bars/clubs.

There is always some type of event happening in Wynwood. We have gone on several occasions and always have a good time. It is free to the public and parking is usually easy to find and reasonably priced.

We like going to just walk around to see what new art is there and to check out local bars and restaurants we haven&apos;t gone to yet. We have gone during the day and at night and both are great times to go. There is a decent amount of walking involved so if you go when it&apos;s really hot (summer months), be prepared to sweat.

Although Wynwood is a hot spot for young people at night on the weekend, you see all ages.

Great area to check out."
5,"An ultra-hip neighborhood transformed from a dangerous warehouse area, Wynwood&apos;s catalyst was the &quot;graffiti&quot; art exemplified by Wynwood Walls.  This supposedly street art is now worth BIG bucks, meaning both for transforming the thriving neighborhood and for selling at hefty prices in the local galleries.  One of the few outdoor things to do in Miami that doesn&apos;t involve the beach, these walls are made for walkin&apos; and well worth an afternoon spent exploring.

This all started, as many Miami neighborhood stories do, with a real estate developer, Tony Goldman.  In the 2000s he started investing in the local semi-abandoned warehouses that were covered with graffiti.  Instead of painting over it, he made it the hallmark of the neighborhood.  He even commissioned Wynwood Walls in 2009 by hiring graffiti artists to paint this central installation, which has become a sort of open-air museum.

The neighborhood took off like a rocket.  Restaurants, galleries, dance clubs and stores of all sorts, even new condos, seem to be already in every space or rapidly being constructed.  Traffic can be gridlock 24 hours on weekends and any warm night will see swarms of youngish club goers spilling off the sidewalks.  To get there, take an Uber or ride a bike if still daylight.  At least once a month my partner and I try to get ambitious and make a pilgrimage from Miami Beach over a causeway on our bikes to roll through Wynwood to see what&apos;s new at the Walls (they repaint regularly).

While you&apos;re there, you can sample the local wildly &quot;out there&quot; galleries, a huge variety of restaurants and just about every type of bar and music venue imaginable.   Part of the  fun is the people-watching: you&apos;ll see club kids stumbling home while you have brunch, pale tourists from out of town trying hard at Miami hipsterdom, and a curious mixture of high-rent/low-rent in the same neighborhood (think Maseratis passing by overgrown ruins).  The Wynwood Walls are a good starting point and introduction to the neighborhood.   Sadly, with gentrification and rising rents, the original 70 galleries are now down to about 10.

The boundaries of Wynwood are a little fuzzy, but it&apos;s generally 20th St on the south, I-195 on the north, I-95 on the west and Florida East Coast Railway on the east.   That&apos;s a generous definition of the neighborhood.  Wynwood has become SO cool that car washes more than a mile away from its boundaries now use &quot;Wynwood&quot; in their name as slightly deceptive marketing (but hey, it&apos;s tough to make a carwash cool).

If you&apos;re driving your own car, the best deal is to use the pay by phone app to self-park, and it makes a LOT of sense even if you have a rental car (5 minutes can save you $50, and the app works most places on the streets of Miami).  The guarded private lots might work in a pinch or late at night for safety, but they ain&apos;t cheap, papi.   The side streets even by daylight can feel slightly dangerous; just stick close to the parts with maximum graffiti plus people, and you&apos;ll still go home with your wallet"
5,"A great way to spend a few hours, and it gets even better...it&apos;s also free!

Where else can you find 40 or so murals all in one place?  I love the vibrant colors! When I visited, it wasn&apos;t that crowded so I was able to get pictures without other people photo bombing my pic.  Yay!

The murals change once a year, so depending on how often you visit, it can be a totally different exhibit/experience.

There&apos;s not much shade to be had, so make sure you wear your sunscreen and a hat!"
4,"In the Wynwood Art District you can see enough art objects at once to remember it for a long time without visiting any special event. All of Wynwood is one of the world&apos;s largest outdoor street art venues.

This part of Miami is always crowded, galleries can be open at night. The Wynwood neighborhood is bounded by North 36th street to the North, North 20 street to the South, 95 to the West and Northeast First street to the East. Art objects are located within walking distance of Downtown Miami."
5,"Looking to take a nice stroll around Miami? Looking for one of the most popular spots in Miami? Check out Wynwood Walls - Where the artwork is vibrant and you get to take in true talent from every angle. I&apos;ve been visiting these walls for many years now and it never gets old. From the sculptures to the huge murals, you get the perfect mix of abstract, contemporary and statement art. True creativity at work here. Check it out!"
5,Must visit cool art great area for drinks and food! Go with friends or family or alone all work!
5,"If your looking for a cool place to check out and hang, this is your spot. Not to far from brickell, it&apos;s their graffiti art district. Compare to Las Vegas and downtown LA, this place seemed to have more to offer. And it&apos;s not as stretched out as LA. There&apos;s so many beautiful artwork spread out throughout the area. Blocks and blocks of artist showcasing their work on walls. Just like the art district where ever, you have plenty of shops and restaurants. 

With it here, there&apos;s lots of gallery that offers one of a kind work form different artists. As well as plenty and plenty of art on walls left and right. There&apos;s tons of restaurants, and gastropub everywhere. Tons of foot traffic and tourists that gathers here daily. The bars are amazing, everything all trendy with a cool vibe minus the snobbish feel. Overall a cool place to check out graffiti, grab a bite and drink. Perfect for cool pictures."
5,"So much fun! Beautiful art both in wynnwood walls and all around the area.  Food trucks, restaurants of all kinds in the area too. Colorful, vibrant and fun place to spend the day! Through the 18th there is free admission to the walls, which is nice. They admit every hr on the hr and have a capacity limit due to COVID. I recommend getting in line 15 min before your reserved time to have the shortest wait."
