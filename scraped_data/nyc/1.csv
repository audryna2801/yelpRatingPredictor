5,My go to for a soothing delicious Matzah ball soup! Their portion is nice and it comes with a really nice piece of challah bread! I really enjoy it and they are very prompt. I always order takeaway for lunch!
4,"The restaurant is not built for comfort - it&apos;s kind of strange, since their first location on 2nd Avenue and 10th Street was super nice...and it started out with just counter service and a few tables. (I was really young then)...Abe, the owner, built it up from nothing to a huge restaurant back in the day, before he was so sadly gun down going to the  bank with business cash receipts on a cold Monday morning.  

But I digress. The place has never been the same (there or in the new location) since his passing.  

Food is still as good as ever, but the atmosphere is missing something BIG TIME. 

With this location on 33rd Street, off 3rd Avenue, I advise TAKE OUT ONLY.  It&apos;s just not comfortably laid out and it is loud, as well.  

Kasha varnish - some of the best I&apos;ve ever eaten...and, while I&apos;m a native NYer, born in Manhattan and raised here on the lower east side, I am Italian and not Jewish...but I DO KNOW great Jewish food when I taste is...and GREAT THIS IS!"

Pastrami on rye: good sandwich; pastrami was tender and juicy, but lacked quite a bit of flavor; rye bread was very standard; that orange sauce (not sure what it was) was a good dip for the sandwich; outrageous price point though, not great value"
3,"Was craving some pastrami and was looking for a deli nearby that served it. Debated between here and Sarge&apos;s and ultimately decided on 2nd Ave Deli. Pastrami was absolutely humongous. Tasty and hit the spot, but i think I prefer the thicker cut pastrami of Katz&apos;s or Pastrami Queen because I think it makes the meat more moist. My roommate ordered the matzo ball soup and loved it so much she orders it almost every other week! We each also got a potato pancake, which was ok, wish they were crispier. Overall a decent neighborhood spot

1,"Terrible, Terrible customer service. Ive bought Cole slaw as I&apos;ve normally done the past 10 years. Today I bought a pint of Cole slaw and when I got home it was sour, I returned it and was told there was nothing wrong with it. 
I said I wanted my money back and was turned away.
The manger  used vulgar language which blew me away.  I will Never go back again after today.
This guy needs to stay in back of the house rather than be up front with the public.. I&apos;m at awe on how they treated me.
UPDATE, just found out I was speaking to the owner."
5,"Pastrami on rye....WOW. I&apos;ve have pastrami before but this is different. It&apos;s stacked high and I was concerned that it may be too much but honestly the meat is so tender and melts in your mouth, it&apos;s a great bite. Not too salty or anything. The rye bread is also great, super soft and holds the meat together super wel. 

Also got the potato knish and that was also out of bounds (Guy Fieri voice). The service was amazing and I can&apos;t wait to explore more for the menu."
3,We ordered delivery from 2nd Ave Deli on a Saturday afternoon since it was too chaotic eat outside anywhere. We were craving pastrami and decided to try it here since it&apos;s located nearby. We ordered a pastrami sandwich and a spinach knish. The order came with a few pickles and a container of mustard and thousand island dressing. The pastrami came on rye bread and it was very flavorful especially with the mustard spread on it. It wasn&apos;t as gigantic as Katz but that&apos;s not a bad thing. The spinach knish on the other had was quite large. I&apos;ve never seen a knish so big. But the dough was only on the top and bottom and it was still raw and thin. The filling had a strange aftertaste too. We only had a few bites of it. I&apos;d order the pastrami again but definitely pass on the knish.
5,Went for lunch today with a friend the service was so great ! Everyone was so friendly and fun and the food was delicious. The make a great burger and really brightened up our day. Thanks guys
5,"Best pastrami sandwich in midtown Manhattan. And its KOSHER for my Muzzie peeps (Muslim folks). All the sandwiches here are great! 

Sandwiches are hella expensive BUT it fills you up(large portions) &amp; they provide you with a bowl of their house-made cold-slaw &amp; pickles so totally worth it. You MUST ask for their Russian dressing which is incredibly tasty &amp; pairs well with the sandwiches. Their mustard is amazing too!

This would be my go-to spot for pastrami or roast beef sammies."
2,"This lace is such a rip off. I paid $57 for 2 plan sandwiches and 1 potato pancake.  They wouldn&apos;t even give me a small side of coleslaw which I asked for and they give you when you eat in.  I have never heard 2 potato pancakes at any deli costing $18.95. Nor have I ever heard of anyone being so stingy they couldn&apos;t give a small side of coleslaw for my sick boyfriend who all he wanted was a sandwich.  I have been coming reluctantly fir years bc my friends like it but never again. I&apos;ll stick to Sarges or Katz.  They are so much nicer and have just as good if not better food. Plus I don&apos;t have to buy cheese to put on my sandwich. 

If you want to spend $60 on two sandwiches with nothing else go for it.  I&apos;m surprised I got mustard.  Which I probably didn&apos;t bc I haven&apos;t checked. 

Waste of money!!! And so rude.  Give a break. We are all struggling.  2 bites of coleslaw won&apos;t bankrupt you and why make me spend $7 to throw it mostly all away.  


I&apos;m done here."
5,"this is one of those rewarding exprrience when you got something so far beyond your expectation and it takes you by surprise. my sister suddenly was dying for Matzoh Ball which was funny since we never had one before and we didnt even knoww what it actually is. Just so happen we were in the neighborhood and thus we decided to give it a go.
it was absolutely divine. I thought I&apos;m not hungry and we shared the soup but i was blown away since the first spoonful. the consomme was brilliant - light, savory, fragrant, and the sprinkles of dill enhance the dish.. i still don&apos;t know what Matzoh ball is made of but boy did we love it! i mean i know it&apos;s some sort of flour mixed with water but how they made it so tasty is still a question for me.

i was tempted to try more food hence I ordered the Noodle Kugel. also recommended my sister to try babka (they served Chocolate Babka). the Kugel taste likee bread pudding but not too sweet with a hint of tangerine. the Babka is the most decadent chocolate dessert I&apos;ve had in a while. very rich andd dense, yet warming too. it was absolutely beautiful 

to top it off, service was top notch. the guy who served us was one of the friendliest person ever. we had a totally amazing dinner! just brilliant! and i completely love it when something exceed my expectation waaaaay higher"
5,"My favorite NYC Deli, the food is absolutely delicious and portions huge! The service is fantastic, shout out to Max!

My friend ordered her usual meat platter, half pastrami, half brisket. It would never have occurred to me to order that, but next time I&apos;m there, it&apos;s exactly what I will get, except all pastrami. OMG, the flavor! It literally melted in your mouth. Dip it in 2nd Ave Deli&apos;s signature mustard and it&apos;s perfection on a plate. 

For my meal I ordered a tuna salad sandwich and then realized, there is no way I could finish an entire sandwich. Max actually heard me saying this and came back to our table to see if I wanted to change my order to a half sandwich and a bowl of matzo ball soup. Why, yes, I would! Much better choice. 

The soup arrived with carrots, egg noodles and a ginormous matzo ball. Max then poured the delicious golden chicken broth over the contents and I dug in. So satisfying, comfort food at its best! Served with sweet, soft Challah bread, it could be the entire meal. 

The tuna salad was delicious, white tuna flaked very thin with mayo and celery. Served on rye with lettuce, tomato and red onion, a half sandwich was plenty!

We left no room for desert but did enjoy the shots of chocolate egg creme that came with our check. Wish I had bought some Rugelach and Kugel pudding to take home. It is prepackaged and lines the deli counter.  Next time for sure!

Prices are high but food is so delicious it&apos;s worth it! Btw, the 2nd Ave Deli is located on 1st Ave."
4,"I stopped by and got a to go order of their 10. Royal 2nd Ave triple decker sandwich for $35.  It was relatively busy with quite a few people waiting for a table.  I wasn&apos;t sure where to order, but eventually a butcher asked if I was being helped and I gave him my order. In return, he gave me several scraps of Pastrami to try while I waited, which were very good.  I didn&apos;t wait too terribly long to get my food.

It came with a bunch of their meats on it, but did not come with chopped liver or any other salads.

I was surprised it came with pickles, after seeing everyone on here complain they they nickle and dime you for them.  It also came with nice deli mustard and thousand island dressing for those who need those.

The sandwich itself was very good. It&apos;s basically the meat mountain that Arby&apos;s offers, but with deli meats.  I think there was flavors being drowned out by the most power meats.  I would go with something simpler next time.  The meat and bread overall was good, but perhaps I agree with the others that it was a lot of money for the amount provided.  I&apos;d still come back to try maybe the #3."
4,"After passing by multiple times, I finally decided to give 2nd Ave Deli a try. Everyone keeps raving about their pastrami sandwich and matzoh ball soup so I ordered the half a sandwich and soup special.

When I placed my order and waited by the deli counter, the staff gave me a few slices of pastrami to try. They said that I was gonna love it and they were right!

The hot pastrami sandwich was amazing. I&apos;m usually not a big fan of pastrami but I enjoyed their sandwich very much. The rye bread was soft and warm. The pastrami was thinly sliced and the outer edges were seasoned just right without being too salty.

The matzoh ball soup was delicious! It was one of the best chicken soups I&apos;ve had in awhile and the tagline Jewish penicillin is right! The hot broth and warm matzoh really hit the spot. Not to mention, the delicious challah bread that comes with it!"
5,"This place has been on our must-stop list in New York since we first tried it a couple of years ago. My husband is allergic to dairy, so the fact that they are a dairy-free establishment is a huge plus right off the bat. Service is always great. I feel like no matter who you are, you&apos;re treated like you&apos;ve been going there your whole life. And of course, the food. It&apos;s a Jewish Deli so of course you&apos;re getting the best, but this really is the best of the best. And such big portions! Not to mention the complimentary chocolate egg cremes at the end of the meal. The prices are a little steep but it is absolutely worth it. No trip to NYC is complete for us without at least one meal at 2nd Ave."
5,"I like to consider this place the underrated cousin of Katz&apos; Delicatessen. My friend and I came here on a Saturday night with no reservation and were seated immediately. While the server was super nice, one small thing that annoyed me was how long it took to get the check despite there being very few people at the restaurant. We decided to order a latke for the table, as well as split a corned beef sandwich and a pastrami sandwich. These together filled us to the brim. The sandwiches come with a free side of pickles and cole slaw; one of the types of pickles was good, but the other type tasted like a soft half pickled cucumber, and was kind of gross.

FOOD:
Latke (5/5) - The latke was perfectly dense and crispy and was also much larger than we expected. Don&apos;t hesitate to order this, it&apos;s definitely a Jewish deli staple.

Corned beef sandwich (5/5) - I think this was my favorite sandwich. The corned beef was juicy and tender and had just the right combination of fat and lean meat marbled together. Mustard paired perfectly with this. The bread was a little soggy, but I didn&apos;t mind because it honestly didn&apos;t even need bread, that&apos;s how good it was.

Pastrami sandwich (5/5) - You have to order this sandwich and put Russian dressing on it. The slices of pastrami were thin but generously piled between two thin slices of bread. The pastrami wasn&apos;t too salty and melted in your mouth."
1,"Update: 3/17/2020. I have no idea why I keep coming back to this place. It&apos;s literally the definition of insanity. However, thought it was my civic duty to warm people, esp during this pandemic: NOBODY HERE WEARS GLOVES! They double, triple checked my food with no gloves and I just sat there in disbelief...even contemplated if I should get my money back and walk out...kinda wish I did as this overpriced sad sandwich isn&apos;t worth getting Corona Virus over. PS - at one point the delivery man was gloveless holding a huge vat of corned beef, I repeat NO gloves, just came back from making a delivery, exposed to any and all outside elements. Cringeworthy!

Update: worst customer service ever.. placed an overpriced order off of their yelp page...ten minutes go by and I get a call from the owner reprimanding me for ordering past 9pm...food for thought buddy - don&apos;t advertise it if you&apos;re not accepting orders. Seamless and yelp cant both be wrong. What an awful experience. Whoever is manning the phones has a lot of aggression...and I thought I was temperamental....
However, if you&apos;re gonna charge $25 for a platter instead of $18 for a sandwich, with the only difference being an added side salad... at least get the order right. 

Called to simply ask that if a delivery man is coming my way, would be great if he could  
drop it off on the way to his next delivery. 
(Even if that meant dropping it off the following day)

After chastising me for ordering via their Yelp page and not directly through them (seriously? Ummm you&apos;re welcome for my business?), the overly aggressive person on the other end of the phone said, they don&apos;t drop anything off for less than $20. BUT, he would throw in a free cole slaw the next time I place a takeout order...really dying to drop another $50+...&quot;do I make myself clear ms.(insert butchered last name here).?!&quot; He proceeded to tell me I spelled my last name wrong .. again, really? I ordered ONLINE, you can&apos;t mess that up! 

Maybe it was his condescending tone or maybe it was the fact that they messed up my overpriced order but..not really dying to spend more money with this place.

Mistakes happen, totally get that...but customer service is everything. Appreciate the credit but check your ego and attitude...do I make myself clear, Lenny?"
2,2nd Ave Deli is your typical Jewsih Deli with notable sandwiches. Food wasn&apos;t bad. The brisket was on the dry side but the pastrami was really good. The bread is fresh and definitely get the fries. The low rating was due to the manager. He was curt and very rude when entering the restaurant and seating us. Our server was great though.
5,"I can&apos;t stress enough just how good 2nd Avenue Deli is. Don&apos;t let the price tag next to some of the items scare you away, I personally think this is the best Jewish deli on the Isle of Manhattan. I definitely recommend doing the half sandwich and soup special. I also highly recommend the matzo ball soup, it&apos;s really fantastic, especially on a cold day. I personally had the hot double: hot corned beef and hot pastrami on rolls and I just had to get mac salad. The corned beef is excellent, perfect pairing with the coleslaw they give you with pickles and hot mustard. The pastrami is my favorite meat here. I love it on the half sandwich, I love it on the roll, I even love it in eggs! Its perfectly seasoned, sliced perfectly, and a true NYC delicacy. While not an every week restaurant and my current financial situation, certainly a treat when I do come in here."
5,"Wow, what a fantastic place to enjoy comfort food in a family friendly atmosphere. We were cheerfully greeted upon arrival late on a Sunday morning...no wait. 

We enjoyed all of the traditional favorites: matzo ball soup, latke, and pastrami sandwich!  When you place your order, they bring you homemade dill pickles and coleslaw. Both are excellent. The soup is a fantastically clear broth with a large, fluffy matzo ball and tiny pasta. The sandwiches are piled high!!  The latke is huge with a very crispy exterior and soft interior. Even the applesauce is homemade. 

We also had some local beer on tap in a very frosty mug--a great way to take the edge off the NY summer humidity!  

The service here is professional and friendly. Worth a visit when you&apos;re in the City."
