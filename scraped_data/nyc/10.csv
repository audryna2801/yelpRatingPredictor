5,"I&apos;ve been to Grace Street twice in the past two years and both times, I&apos;ve left feeling satisfied and impressed by their desserts.

The last time I went, I got the Milk Tea Boba Toast and split it with two other friends. The thai-tea cream lathered brioche topped with boba balls with vanilla ice cream on the side made this dessert a perfect treat after a savory-heavy meal! Splitting it with 3 people made the price very reasonable too, as the dessert is $14.
 
The interior has a nice aesthetic and is a great place to sit with friends or a date, but unfortunately indoor dining was shut down. They have outdoor dining tents, but honestly I&apos;m not sure how much better that is than indoor dining due to lack of ventilation. (Not really Grace Street&apos;s fault though rules are rules) 

All in all, I would definitely recommend ordering something from here if you&apos;re in K-Town and looking for something sweet. Will definitely be coming back here next time in in the area!"
5,"Amazing treats! Covid precautions are definitely in tact. The staff wore masks, checked temperatures, sanitizer was at each table, and they kicked us out because we were there for over an hour. The treats were very good and nice to look at. They have different milk options for the teas and the service was really quick."
5,"I&apos;ve been here pre- and during the pandemic and I have to say, their desserts always satisfied my sweet tooth. We got here early on a Friday night and were seated immediately (which usually never happens) and ordered the matcha beignets,   Matcha waffle, and lavender latte and the portions were huge! Definitely more than enough for 4 people and tasty! Very good go-to spot and date spot :)"
5,"Cute little caf√©! They offer a wide variety of drinks, pastries, and even shaven ice. 

Ordered the Vietnamese coffee (iced) with a chocolate cream puff. Soooo yummy!"
5,"Grace street is uber special. It is definitely a great rival to spot bar, but they have a style all their own. 

Grace street is a large cafe that has all types of desserts. They have delicious ice cream, hotteok, and shaved ice. I think their speciality is their shaved ice. It&apos;s loaded and delicious. I recommend the green tea one with lychee! I&apos;ve had the hotteok as well which is a cinnamon pancake that oozing goodness and decadence.

Lastly, I think I particularly love Grace street because they had the ingenious idea to add viet ice coffee to their menu. Yum!"
4,"4.25/5
Been to Grace Street&apos;s bakery location nearby before and I was a huge fan of their cheesecake. So when I heard they have a full-on shop open of course I had to visit.

Came by on a Sunday night with a friend. You order at the cashier then go find outdoor seating. There are plenty of tables available and they do a pretty good job of maintaining the area so that it&apos;s clean. Service is really friendly and everything came out very promptly.

For our dessert my friend and I split the following:
1) OG Shaved Snow: It&apos;s black sesame shaved snow with some red beans and mochi pieces. It&apos;s a fairly classic combination and you can&apos;t really go all that wrong with it. That being said the shaved snow&apos;s texture was just more icy and clumpy than other places that I&apos;ve had. If you&apos;re looking for shaved snow it will do the job but definitely won&apos;t be my go-to (3.5/5)

2) Matcha Beignets: these are absolutely delicious. Very fluffy just like a beignet should be with a pillowy texture. There is a slightly chewier mochi-like texture that I rather enjoyed as well. The top is dusted with powdered sugar as well as some matcha and then it is served with the side of matcha ice cream. Delicious! (4.5/5)

3) Basque Cheesecake: I&apos;ve had this item before at there side bakery and enjoyed it immensely. I feel like the ones I got this time around were a little bit more under baked but it was still a great contrast of flavors and textures And I could easily eat a whole cake by myself if I&apos;m not stopped... (4.25/5)

Overall I really enjoyed my visit to this little dessert shop. I mostly definitely will be back for more cheesecake. I probably will pass on the shaved snow in the future though."
5,"The matcha beignets are to die for. I love matcha and I love beignets (and powdered sugar). All of this combined was just the best thing ever. It is paired with ice cream as well which tones down the sweetness. 

The drinks are also very good but I think the dessert dishes are the stars here. I would love to try the other items they had too but I was already too full.

The shop itself was super cute inside and a great coffee shop spot to do some computer work or studying."
5,"My search is over for great shaved ice in Manhattan! After having a Korean meal, three of us stopped here for dessert. My friend had the basque cheesecake, which was delicious. I had the OG shaved ice. And my other friend had mango ice. Everything was fresh and delicious. 
They have an outdoor seating area that can get a little cramped, but we managed to keep a covid safe distance.
The prices aren&apos;t cheap, but it&apos;s worth it for the generous portions and delicious combinations."
4,"I can&apos;t believe I&apos;ve never reviewed Grace Street? This is a Koreatown institution, pretty much everyone I know has been and talks about this place!

I&apos;ve really enjoyed visiting over the years and seeing how the menu and staff has progressed over time. The most popular order is, of course, the customizable shaved ice but they also have fabulous sweet drink options and other creative desserts (i.e. matcha beignets, boba French toast). It&apos;s a really great idea and definitely a popular option after dinner nearby.

The wait (pre-covid at least) can be long, they give you a buzzer to wait for your table which seems to be par for the course in the neighborhood. You&apos;re also often intimately sharing a table with another party due to the busyness and space constraints. As for the desserts themselves, they&apos;re a bit of a hit or miss for me--I find the shaved ice a little bland, but appreciate that there&apos;s the option to customize flavors and toppings. Absolutely love the matcha beignets though and would recommend those to anyone. Really depends on your preferences but I rarely hear anything negative about this place and most definitely would recommend a visit!"
4,"Made our own shaved snow with sesame shaved snow with condensed milk, fresh strawberries, and honey boba and man. I&apos;ve tried a lot of shaved snow (not shaved ice, they&apos;re two different things, shaved ice = frozen water, shaved snow means frozen milk + flavor) and this is definitely some of the best in NYC. Its light and floofy like a flavored cloud. I put 4 stars instead of 5 just because of price. With tax, its $15 for that one cup of shaved snow which is definitely kinda steep. I think back to authentic shaved snow in Taiwan where it&apos;s, make sure to hold your jaw, $2 for twice the size. Nonetheless, quality is on point.

In terms of COVID, they have outdoor seating that is seat yourself as well as indoor seating. The outdoor seating is kinda nice because they do have heaters so you wont be freezing but I guess neither will your shaved snow."
4,"Grace Street is a classic place to get desserts in ktown. They have a huge amount of seating even during the pandemic (several tents worth). When it&apos;s not busy you can sit wherever, but after dinner / lunch there is usually someone seating you on these benches. The most popular items are probably their shaved ice and drinks. I&apos;ll usually come with friends after eating in the area.

I ordered their shave ice for delivery and there was quite a large amount. However, I felt that the amount of toppings was fairly limited. The shaved ice still tastes good even if you leave it in the freezer overnight. I&apos;ve tried some of their other items like cream puffs and drinks which are good as well. I would recommend that you give this place a try if you&apos;re eating in ktown."
3,"Disappointing. They deliver late but I would rather them not offer delivery late than them accept orders and send incorrect orders and burnt waffles. Only positive is it came quick and the wrong item tasted okay. 
I ordered Cookie Monster shaved ice with Oreos as topping what I  received instead some other flavor with red beans? In it as well. I know that&apos;s enjoyed by many but it isn&apos;t what I ordered and honestly I didn&apos;t like it. 
The churro waffles tasted like they were fried/cooked in burnt old oil- I threw it away honestly."
5,Amazing desserts and atmosphere! Came here after a meal in Koreatown and was impressed by their offerings! I got the strawberry shaved ice and loved the flavor profile! It was sweet and light and perfect after a big meal! It&apos;s a little expensive but really tasty!
4,Warm matcha beignets were just the right level of sweetness and the dough was not dense at all -- recommend! Not sure how well they would do as a delivery/takeout item though.
4,"Good covid measures! My friends and I came on a Saturday afternoon and was able to get indoor seating. The seats are spaced out and there were not much people inside. 

We ordered burnt cheese cake and matcha cream puff. Cheese cake was so good! Not too sweet and very good texture. It was super satisfying. 

Staff were super polite and all wearing masks. Only downside is that you can only sit for an hour. We were asked to leave after one hour time limit. I have been a regular at this place prior to covid, but this was my first time visiting during covid."
4,"Great after dinner treat! I really liked the OG shaved snow as it was super creamy and rich with a great black sesame flavor. I felt like the topping ratio was off and wish it had more strawberries and mochi and less red bean. The burnt cheesecake flavor was super rich and tasty, but I wish it was more fresh. Overall, really great dessert spot especially after some kbbq!"
5,"Good place to come chill and study or hang out with friends. The place has alot of seating prior to COVID and is a nice murmur in the background. Lots of snacks and sweets to get as well as drinks.

My friend got the lavender latte and I got the rose tea latte. There&apos;s also bubble tea for those of you who like boba. Drinks were yummy and foamy."
4,"Very nice desert and the drinks are very pretty!

We got Burnet Cheesecake which is possibly the best cheesecake I&apos;ve ever had. 

For icecream we got O.G. Snow which had lychee and rose flavored (puree, sauce?) And it was absolutley amazing with the shaved icecream giving it a unique texture and amazing flavor all around. The portion is huge too. 

We got two bubble teas (Lavender and Rose) both of them were just ok, nothing too flavorful to talk about. 

During Covid they have outside seating which was a nice way to enjoy the desert outside.

For the cashier name my receipt says H and I wish I knew who the cashier was, because she was extremely friendly and although it was busy she was multitasking to take customers order, taking trays, and giving orders out at an expert precision and speed."
5,"Milk tea. Boba. Toast. 

&apos;Nuff said. Soft honey brick toast topped with ice cream, sweet chewy tapioca, caramel popcorn, fresh strawberries with a Thai tea drizzle. All the major dessert food groups and textures are present!! I seem to get this at least every 2 weeks  and it has exceeded my company&apos;s expectations

They have indoor seating now! Entire party needs to be present, one person checks in online, and everyone gets temperature check. They have outside seating as well and seem to be building a more weather-resistent wooden hut outside"
5,Basque Burnt Cheesecake is new and great!! A must try!! It has larger size for family sharing!
