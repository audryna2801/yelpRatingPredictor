5,"For review #4,000 (and my 1000th in New York, NY), I wanted to write about the place that I consider myself incredibly fortunate to live in: New York City.

I have been blessed to live and travel to many different places and yet so few compare to the versatility, energy, history, and diversity of New York City. It is a place where dreams are realized and lives are enriched with the splendors of limitless resources across all areas in food, career, culture, and people. Folks will leave the country to see the world and yet the world comes to NYC.

Despite my obvious love affair with the largest borough (#1), I truly believe in all the redeeming qualities that make each of them unique. There is the glitz and glamour of Manhattan, the urban and cultural influence of Brooklyn, the grit and grind of the Bronx, the familial vibe of Staten Island, and the diverse land of Queens. Collectively they make up a city more unique than any other in the US and often have an aura about them that few international cities can match. To all the tourists, Long Islanders, and any bridge + tunnel folks: NYC is all 5 boroughs, not only Manhattan. Pay them all a visit and I promise an adventure will be had. There is never a dull day.

NYC is the true melting pot of the world with a number of ethnic enclaves that offer a glimpse into the cultural confines of any international community. Take for instance, there as many as 6 Chinatowns (#2), multiple Indian / Bangladeshi neighborhoods (#3), numerous Dominican / Puerto Rican areas, multiple Koreatowns and Caribbean enclaves. And of course there&apos;s a Little Poland, Little Odessa, Little Egypt, Little Athens, Little Colombia, Little Guyana just to name a select few. 

It also a unique city where:

* a hardware store, bodega, police station, a pizzeria, taqueria, bagel shop, groceries, nail salon all exist in one street block. 
* multiple languages are spoken with an earshot in any public place.
* street performers might just be better than any onstage act you&apos;ve seen.
* innovation / trends for so many industries begin.
* there are beaches (yes, really) and massive parks to boot.  
* celebrities live amongst (and are ignored by) the rest of society. 
* public transportation runs all day / night. 
* serendipity isn&apos;t just a movie. Unique, wonderful occurrences,  experiences happen at any time here.
* there is world class everything: museums, theater, sports, restaurants, universities, nightlife, festivals, photo opportunities, etc.

There are of course, some drawbacks: It is expensive, taxes are ridiculous, it can be dirty and piled with garbage, it can be wildly inefficient (Hi MTA!), the apartments are too small, the outdoors scene is limited, parking is horrific, the weather is erratic, and income disparity is unbelievable. If you&apos;re able to overlook these things, adapt well and are ambitious, it is a great place to be. 

In spite of all the hardships (natural disasters, targeted attacks, etc.) the pandemic has really pushed the city to the edge. Ultimately I believe it&apos;s the people that make NYC great and that will help the city prevail in the end.

5,"February 27th We land roughly around 5ish and then head to our hotel. Once we arrived at the Pennsylvania hotel in Manhattan, which is lovely placed in front of Madison square. We settle in our room and get some gloves on since the temperature was dropping we headed to check out Time Square. I was amazed by all the light up signs and street performers. One highlight of the night was sticking our heads into the m&amp;m factory and seeing all the cool merch and different chocolates they had.

February 28th: Its showtime! Our second day was full of adventures. We started our day somewhat late at 11 and headed to Penn station. Once we got on we headed towards central park. Once we got off it seemed like we were in a totally different place than the part we were staying in. Seeing central park without leaves set the mood with how cloudy it was. The two first destinations I chose was Umpires rock and Dipway Arch. Seeing history was the best part of walking through the windy cool afternoon. Two highlights at central park is Bethesda fountain and Belvedere Castle. The Castle itself seems somewhat big from the outside but when you entire its small walkways will constrict you. After walking from Manhattan to Harlem we were exhausted. We stopped in a dunkin donuts conveniently places adjacent to the park, we refueled and headed to the subway back to Manhattan. Once we got back we rested and got some water before our Broadway debut. Seeing a live performance was extraordinary, don&apos;t want to give spoilers since they will be on tour if you want to see them next year but shake shake shake senora.

February 29th: Day three was mostly just walking around and looking at the scenery. We visited various places like trump tower, a few old churches, and some smaller parks. After we got lunch near TT, we headed for Rockefeller center. A picturesque scene for sure, the gold statue, the garden leading to the rink, all super beautiful. One highlight I love was seeing the lego store, im a kid inside still! After some more walking we headed back to the hotel to get some dinner and rest for our second biggest day.

March 1st: Our last full day in New York was going to be the biggest. We began our day with a trip to lower Manhattan to get our raids underway in Pokémon go and head towards battery park. We Took a subway to WTC Cortlandt station and began our excursion to battery park. Seeing the new WTC was amazing and just how I had imagined it.  Seeing the memorial pools gave me chills and made me remember what had happened years ago. After leaving we headed south to battery park while we did gengar raids (I got two shinnies from the event!) and past a famous church, Trinity Church Cemetery, which housed Mr. Alexander Hamilton himself. We arrived 10 minuets to late to catch the last ferry to Liberty island, so we settled with just walking around the park which was still nice. We saw a bunch of birds and this one chubby squirrel that kept following us, they eat well up their verses in Florida.

Overall experience was wonderful. Besides the traffic we saw and how humbled we got by riding the subway which was not bad at all, it was nice to be in New York. While we were there we were able to see some snow flurries but not a lot. I&apos;m sure there are better stories of new York, im just bad with writing and better talking in person but  I hope this is nice for whoever reads it. Much love to the yelp community!"
5,"Posting a big shoutout to the lovely people at Sterling Optical, 88th Street and Amsterdam Avenue, where I have taken several pairs of eyeglasses (purchased elsewhere) for repair. Dr. Barksdale, Stephen, and Suzette are all kind, competant, professional, and accommodating. Here every customer is a VIP and receives careful, individualized attention. Even during COVID, their service charge for repair is ridiculously low, and after several encounters, I intend to remain a loyal customer for all my eyewear needs. Currently, there are limited store hours, but call Suzette, and she will set you up with an appointment:

2,"A 4 star city from back in the days when NY had plenty to offer and despite its shortcomings provided a wealth of things to look forward to......history, food, entertainment, sports, shopping. You name it NYC had it.

Now a 1 (0?) star ghost town with the shutdowns and high crime and costs in the city to deal with and thousands upon thousands moving out. 

I would not visit NYC again even if I was given a free trip.

Loved Yankee Stadium, US Open Tennis, Broadway Shows, Times Square, the good eats, FAO Schwartz, Central Park, WTC, did I mention the good eats? Too many restaurants to name that delivered great dining experiences. Nobu was one place we went for our delayed honeymoon, first time I ever had Sushi.

We stayed a number of times at the Times Square Marriott and enjoyed that great location in the city. 

Sad to see it go down the tubes."
1,"Total inequity with property taxes, rising crime and nobody cares, rats and rodents that scare non existent tourists and a corrupt political machine.

Do not be fooled, we are not the center of the world anymore.  

Open the restaurants, Broadway and the classical music venues and nobody will go if the crime situation is not resolved.  Soon. 

The hostility against the rich has been documented but the true injustice is against the hard-working middle class.  Why does a homeowner of a single family unit in Queens pay more than the Mayor does for two homes in Brooklyn that can be rented out?  Our populations are too nice and protest and get angry for the wrong reasons."
1,"I spent 350 nights in NYC from 1985 -2021. It&apos;s a nightmare, it&apos;s not safe anymore, the mayor is a joke, you better watch your back like it was when Dinkins and Koch ran the town. If you thought the subways were safe 7-10 years ago, you are correct, not so much now. 

It&apos;s a zombie town, anybody that could; they left, the remaining people are miserable, it&apos;s not NYC anymore, thank you Mayor whatever you call yourself...

...how pathetic, a city so great, so safe, and one mayor brought it down in a New York minute."
5,"***My 1,700th Review***

My heart bleeds for this little city. And when I  say &quot;little&quot;, I actually mean BIG. The Big Apple! There&apos;s just nothing like it. I&apos;ve always said that if I wasn&apos;t living in California, I&apos;d probably be in New York. I&apos;ve been saying this for most of my life, waaay before I even visited New York as an adult. And now that I&apos;ve experienced the glory, I can absolutely confirm this to be true. 

What is there to say that hasn&apos;t already been said?! NYC is one of the most gorgeous cities in the entire world. Filled with so much history and several prominent landmarks that even people who&apos;ve never visited know about. Land of the freezing white winters and humid hot summers. Delicious Sicilian and thin sliced pizza. The amazing Metropolitan Museum. The state of the art Metro train system. The Empire State Building. The Statue of Liberty. The World Trade Center. Grand Central Terminal. The Rockefeller Center. Times Square. The Brooklyn Bridge. I could go on... and on..?!

So many wonderful landmarks to see and so many amazing things to do in this city. You could never get bored being here. Never. I&apos;m in awe of NYC parks. Central Park, Bryant Park, Washington Square Park. All just so beautiful. There&apos;s a deep sense of culture here that you&apos;ll rarely find anywhere else. It&apos;s one of the most diverse cities in the world. Coming from a diverse neighborhood myself,  I can totally appreciate seeing this in New York. It&apos;s one of the main reasons why I can see myself living here.

Let&apos;s get into the food right quick. Honestly, some of the best restaurants to ever do it. You can get anything that you friggin&apos; want here. The only reason why I wouldn&apos;t get fat from eating in New York is because I&apos;d walk everywhere. The walkability is mind blowing. Still can&apos;t figure out why my state hasn&apos;t jumped on the public transit bandwagon the way that NY has. But then again, the Metro has been years in the making. Like literal decades upon decades. And you know what?! It&apos;s still runs better than our sh*tty new age train system. 

But anyways... damn. I could talk about this amazing city forever. Fell in love with this beautiful city as soon as I touched down and I&apos;ve been madly in love ever since. I&apos;ll always be a Cali girl &apos;til the day I die, but NYC will forever be my muse. I&apos;ve got big love for the big city, and that&apos;s on period."
5,"Yeah, I am a Jersey Boy now, but New York is my city. I can write an 18 book encyclopedia if I wanted on New York, but instead, I give you a few things you can do just to get the flavors of New York.

1.  Try the Halal Guys on the 6th Ave and eat it there 
2.  Have New York Pizza from the East Village or even Joe&apos;s at Times Square
3.  Ride the Ferry to Staten Island and pass the Statue of Liberty
4.  Walk the High Line or the Brooklyn Bridge
5.  Check out Grand Central Terminal or Rockefeller Center
6.  Climb the Vessel 
7.  Do New Year&apos;s Eve at Times Square
8.  Walk from Midtown East to 14th St, Washinton Sq, SoHo and Little Italy and check out all the street Murals on the way.

So maybe you think there are more exciting, and better things to do in New York to get what the City is about, and you be right, so just go do them and Yelp them to spread the word."
5,"Manhattan is the most densely populated of New York City&apos;s 5 boroughs. It&apos;s mostly made up of Manhattan Island, bounded by the Hudson, East and Harlem rivers. Among the world&apos;s major commercial, financial and cultural centers, it&apos;s the heart of &quot;the Big Apple.&quot; Its iconic sites include skyscrapers such as the Empire State Building, neon-lit Times Square and the theaters of Broadway.
Nothing like New York and there food."
2,"New York City is called many things, &quot;The City That Never Sleeps&quot;, &quot;The Big Apple&quot;, etc, but I call it a sh*thole. I&apos;ve been to NYC many times and I don&apos;t get the hype at all. It&apos;s extremely crowded, dirty, there is trash everywhere, and the people here are some of the rudest you will meet. Now I&apos;ll admit, NYC is loaded with great restaurants and there are plenty of things to see. Like, The Empire State Building, Statue of Liberty, Yankee Stadium, Times Square and more. NYC is also home of Broadway and offers many shows. But, it&apos;s not worth going to these places with how bad the city is. 

Furthermore, I suggest not going out at night because the crime is out of control. They&apos;re stabbings, shootings, and robberies almost every night. I recommend going to NYC at least once in your life to see the monuments and eat at the great restaurants, but I wouldn&apos;t stay long or go out at night. In addition, it takes hours just to drive a few miles in this city which is just ridiculous. In conclusion, NYC has many things to do and many great restaurants, but it&apos;s a crime ridden, dirty place filled with impolite people."
5,"Small town Southern girl leaves her entire life behind and moves to the big city.

It reads like an old movie plot or a tired chick lit novel. The thing is, it&apos;s just simply the truth &amp; many others who come to this city. Plenty of people from different places, backgrounds, nationalities, &amp; walks of life come here for a change and find a home. 

Home--it&apos;s what The Greatest City in the world feels like. At home in the middle of a sweltering summer, sunning in Central Park or wrapped in 5 layers during a polar vortex, trudging through snow.  Home--being a late Tuesday night ending with an impromptu concert in a train station with someone you met an hour ago. New York City is home to 8+ million different people. It is alluring and mysterious, with pockets of familiarity for anyone looking. There&apos;s a reason NYC is heavily portrayed in media and talked about, derivatively or with praise, among the 1% to the 99%. It&apos;s one size fits all, if you want it to--and everybody wants it to. 

Truth: &quot;Once you have lived in New York and it has become your home, no place else is good enough.&quot; --John Steinbeck 

Everywhere else has been ruined for me. Pizza will always be better here. The art, culture, stories, &amp; sheer amount of food will always be better here. It&apos;s the best of everything and everyone&apos;s trying their best to make it. I will miss New York when I&apos;m elsewhere, and I&apos;ll always be glad to be back, even if the MTA never stops being shitty."
5,"I would say NYC is more of a 4.5. There is no place like it, that is for sure. I have been there 4 or 5 times, cannot remember exactly. This past visit was the first one where I did not take the beloved subway. I really do not mind taking the subway. I love how the price is affordable, yet you get to your destination super fast. It is always an experience but somehow I missed it when I just went.

The food is awesome in NYC. I ate mostly Italian on this visit. I do miss Carnegie Deli. It was the best. I know there are other great delis, but my heart still misses Carnegie. Plus, I did not run into any cool delis. The ones I saw were wannabes. I would have had to go out of my way. Maybe I was just lazy....

Anyway, clothes shopping is always amazing here. I even bought a really nice skirt at Target for $20. This cute mini Target was across the street from Macys on 34th Street. It must have been built in the past few years because I did not see it the last time I was in NYC. I always find at least ten pair of shoes I love at Macys. Luckily, I have impulse control. It is definitely a great place to shop.

As much as I love it in this one of a kind city, it stresses me out when I am there. Too much hustle and bustle. I am a Native Floridian and am not used to all the go, go, go. I mean, I am always happy to visit. I would go twice a year if I could. I just don&apos;t see it as a &quot;real&quot; vacation with relaxation and rejuvenation. It is an active vacation. I do like how you can spend a lot or a little on food and still get a good meal. I ate great food there. Some was real inexpensive and some was not. All was high quality and tasty.

Special shout out to the police and firefighters. You all are so brave and true heroes. The city is better because of YOU ALL!!"
4,"NEW YORK CITY -- I don&apos;t think there&apos;s another place in the world.  Amazing vibe and energy.  If you are creative and in the arts, this is the place.  Everywhere you look is muse.  Since I lived there for 2 years, I experienced this -- you cannot stay at home.  Life calls your name through the window and says, come outside!

Things to do: 5/5
Safety: 3.5/5
Cleanliness: 2/5

EVERYTHING, ALL-THE-TIME -- On any given night, there&apos;s a billion things to do.  Besides the norm of going to a movie and dinner (for which is the best of the best, see &quot;DINING&quot; below): Broadway shows, Times Square, Shopping, HUGE concerts, best clubs, bars, and museums.  With exception of museums (Paris, Florence), it&apos;s literally the &quot;best of&quot; in every category.  See my list, &quot;Berger knows: NYC&quot; for lots of reviews (https://www.yelp.com/collection/EVW3bKEgE9P6HGlh0gg7sQ).

CENTRAL PARK -- In my experience of travel, this is one of my favorite places in all the world.  This is a &quot;go to&quot;, a &quot;must stop&quot; no matter what else is planned.  843 acres of 100% beauty.  I most look forward to feeding the squirrels, sitting at the fountain, and perhaps mostly -- just walking thru...ssllllooowwwlllly.  The trees in the fall have every color under the sun -- AMAZING.  With the NY skyline surrounding in every direction, take a break from the business of the streets and just breathe.

DINING -- Bagels and Pizza are the extreme best (is it the water, the dough, or the air?).  Yes, true, lots of touristic places, but every category of food, you can find the best of.  Well, not Mexican, but you can find Puerto Rican, Costa Rican, and Salvadorean!  Note: I&apos;m not one to be foofoo all-the-time, a trip to get a couple of late night hot dogs is heaven at Papaya Dog or Gray&apos;s Papaya.

THEATER/PLAYS -- Theater reigns here.  Whether Broadway (big productions) and off-Broadway (smaller), it&apos;s the best of the best.  Biggest budgets and greatest talent.  Go and support!

MUSEUMS -- The Met (Metropolitan Museum of Art) and MOMA (Museum of Modern Art) are the two biggest and most popular, but there&apos;s many smaller ones (as well as amazing galleries): Frick, Natural History, Guggenheim, Whitney, Sex (yes, truly), and many others.

9/11 MEMORIAL -- Built to commemorate the September 11, 2001 attacks, which killed 2,977 people, and the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, which killed 6.  Allow 2-3 hours, but one that shouldn&apos;t be missed and done at least once.

SHOPPING -- Lots and lots and lots.  My favorite: Macy&apos;s on W 34th St.

TRANSPORTATION -- Subway and taxi&apos;s (Uber and Lyft), sure, but it&apos;s also (and mainly) a city of walking.  Depending on how much time you have and the weather, it&apos;s not uncommon to walk 20 or more blocks to your destination.

BEST TIME TO GO -- The weather can be cray cray.  Spring and fall are the best, winter can be cold with ice and snow, summer can be hot and very humid, and even rain."
4,"From the Hudson, Manhattan seems a different place. It&apos;s less the familiar City - an old, burdensome, static pile of buildings, cold and overwhelming - and is instead a welcoming locale, short and spread wide, its structures lucid, each one glittering light onto the river. Manhattan-by-the-Hudson is more accessible and serves more individual purposes, and, seen from that prospect, it&apos;s lovely.

**********
Some prefer to visit Manhattan in the spring, because often, at that time, much as in Paris and Vancouver, the City&apos;s sky is dry and clean, framed by building tops into squares of sunny blue air.

Manhattan&apos;s springtime is filled with colorful, flowered parks; large ones in which people run, or talk, or sleep; and smaller, cleaned-up corners with a bench or two, a tree or two, and sometimes a seated couple, snuggling.

But I like cool weather and the comfort of a good sweater worn against crisp, chilly mornings, so I&apos;ll take Manhattan in the autumn, when Central Park smells good (and so, if you can find them, do roasting chestnuts).

I&apos;m especially happy that Manhattan celebrates autumn as something separate from Thanksgiving and Christmas.

From mid-September until the post-Thanksgiving tree lighting ceremony at Rockefeller Center, a palette of orange, brown and red softly humanizes the City&apos;s parks and windows and streets until Christmas arrives; then the music, aroma and color of holiday time make the town a theme park devoted to The Magic of Big Cities."
4,"Having been to the &quot;Big Apple&quot; at least 10 times over the past 6 years it is time to write about my experiences with it. Most people equate NYC with Manhattan. Let me set the record straight. NYC encompasses 5 boroughs with the largest being Queens. The other 3 are the Bronx, Brooklyn, and Staten Island.

People from out of town normally go to Manhattan since that&apos;s where all the action is. Whether you are flying which is my preferred method, taking a megabus, or train, if you are staying within a walking distance of a subway line, then please don&apos;t drive. Not only is it a nightmare but you really don&apos;t need it.

I generally like to stay in midtown since I have easy access to some of the best features. I&apos;m a Broadway lover so there will never be a trip without me reviewing a show and the theater it houses to go with it. That being said, practically on every street my husband and I walked if I had to go from the Theater district to another neighbor we got &quot;hounded&quot; with people giving us tour pamphlets. Much like Las Vegas we turned them all away.

Times Square is worth a visit but I would suggest you do this in the morning. It is not as hectic and I was amazed that I found on the &quot;peninsula&quot; between the Father Duffy statue and the George Cohan statue a map of the theater district carved into the ground!

Manhattan has many different neighborhoods and a number of different parks to visit. Each neighborhood we saw had its own vibe to it. Whether I&apos;m walking the streets of the high class on 5th, Madison, or Park Ave to walking among myriads of tenements you get a different taste of city life. If you are on 5th near Central Park then check out the window of Bergdorf Goodman. Sometimes during the year they have the most original and innovative displays I&apos;ve ever seen.

Manhattan has something for everybody whether it is a museum along &quot;museum mile&quot; or on the West side to children&apos;s activities in Central or Bryant park to name a few, there&apos;s so much to see and do and so little time to do it. Most importantly this city is very expensive and often times you don&apos;t get more bang for your buck. There are a number of free attractions but you need to do your homework to find them. Course the parks are always free. Central Park is enormous but easy to get lost in even with a map if you are not familiar with it.

Restaurants can be pricey whether I&apos;m dining in Hell&apos;s kitchen, the garment district, or even in the downtown area. Street vendors abound as well as many food trucks. Even Cousin Maine&apos;s lobster is opening soon in Times Square.

Manhattan is also home to some of the tallest skyscrapers. One World trade center is now the tallest building in Manhattan followed by 432 Park Ave. Two other prominent skyscrapers include the Empire State building and &quot;The top of the Rock&quot; at Rockefeller Center. All but 432 Park Ave are available to ride to the top for outstanding views of the city and beyond for a fee. 

Shopping abounds from the more reasonable areas such as Chinatown, the High Line, Cheslea Market to the more upscale shopping between 5th and Park Aves near Central Park where you will find designer fashion that costs thousands

Some of the most beautiful churches are in midtown. St Patrick&apos;s alone is worth a visit and I noticed a church had taken over the spot which I think was once the Mark Hellinger theater but I&apos;m not overly certain on the correct theater since it the building where it is housed appears to be one.

There are many places I want to visit that are on my future &quot;bucket&quot; list. Having been to Herald Square, the 911 Memorial, the Flatiron district, Cheslea, the High Line, Hudson Yards, Turtle bay, part of the upper east side, the meatpacking district, South Street seaport, and of course the bohemian Greenwich Village, I plan to explore other neighborhoods that I&apos;ve never got a chance to go to when I return. It&apos;s been years since I visited the Statue of Liberty and I would like to see Ellis Island. BTW if you plan to go to Staten Island I believe the ferry is still free.

One of my pictures I was extremely thrilled to get was my departure on the runway of LaGuardia as we were taxiing out to our runway.  The &quot;Welcome (heart) to NY sits on the far end of it.

The city that never sleeps can wear you out but it is truly worth an adventure!"
5,"If you can find NYC on Yelp, you know it&apos;s legit.

5/5 stars. No BS - it&apos;s amazing"
5,"If you get caught between the moon and New York City, the best that you can do is:

--eat at Halal Guys
--eat a dirty water dog from a street stand
--eat Joe&apos;s Pizza at Time Square
--ride the free ferry to Stanton Island and pass the Statue of Liberty
--walk the High Line
--picnic at Central Park
--eat a bagel from Essa"
5,"This was my very first time to New York City. I did visit with a group which made it more comfortable and safe if you will. With that said, you can&apos;t go on your own and take your time.

Here are some of the highlights of New York City. I recommend you take a stroll in Central Park. You can admire Yoko Ono&apos;s place (Dakota building). You&apos;re not welcome to stand in front of the building but you can take pictures across the street. Time Square is where the New Year&apos;s Eve is celebrated yearly. There&apos;s also variety of broadway shows that you can catch. You need to try bagels and dirty dogs (hot dogs) from the street cart. Look for A rated carts. 9/11 memorial is a must. I couldn&apos;t venture out to Chinatown but if you visit I hope you do because I think it&apos;s the biggest Chinatown in U.S."
5,"These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you

These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you

Oh I love New York City! There&apos;s so much to do, so much to see. The ice rink in Central Park and in front of the Rockefeller. The Christmas tree in front of the Rockefeller. Time square that lights up the whole city at night. The Empire State Building where you can see the whole city. New York style pizza all around the city. 

There&apos;s so many people walking around and so many cars and so many honks &amp; beep beeps. 

If your lucky you can see some movies filming and famous actresses and actors strolling around town."
1,"We have visited NYC many times before cruises, and before flights out of JFK and EWR, and have always enjoyed ourselves. Usually we stay three hotel nights before cruises and flights.

With the state and local governments unable or unwilling to provide a secure environment, I wonder if we will ever be wanting to visit NYC again in the future!?

What are the leaders thinking?"
