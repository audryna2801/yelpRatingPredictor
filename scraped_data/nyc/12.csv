5,"Came here on a weekend for lunch with outdoor dining (we made a reservation online in advance). The weather was perfect the day we went, in late November -- wasn&apos;t too chilly to eat outside and the sun was out. The whole experience at the restaurant was amazing, the food was delicious and the restaurant had a wooden set up with tables separated by plexiglass. 

We ordered three dishes: the rice cake, kimchi pancake, and galbi, which came with a side of banchan, of course. The rice cakes were tender and the crispy kimchi pancake contrasted nicely with the egg that it was topped with. The star of the show had to be the galbi, which was cooked to absolute perfection and was jam-packed with flavor. It&apos;s a little bit pricey, but the quality and flavor is completely worth it. 

They also have seasonal specials that I would love to try out sometime in the future!"
5,"Love this spot! I&apos;ve only dined during Covid through their DoorDash delivery, but can&apos;t wait to visit in person after I&apos;m vaccinated. The food has always been warm (perhaps a testament to the DoorDash folks) and packed well, so I feel like I&apos;ve been able to have a representative experience. 

Value is great - portion sizes are perfect (if not generous) for the price, quality is spectacular, and the flavors are well balanced. It&apos;s Korean food with a modern twist, without the usual gimmicks of &quot;fusion&quot;. Their black sesame tofu is a stunner, but I&apos;ve also loved the pork belly, bibimbap, dumplings, and complimentary side dishes (ban chan). I order those regularly and have tried them maybe five times now - each time, the taste and quality were consistent.

The only items that I didn&apos;t love were the wedge lettuce salad, as it didn&apos;t travel well and wasn&apos;t particularly exciting, and the bulgogi stew, which I found too sweet. My boyfriend, on the other hand, thought they were okay...so maybe those are a matter of personal taste.

It&apos;s tough to find Korean food that&apos;s great quality for a great price with a creative vision that does justice to tradition. I&apos;m a regular, and this is coming from someone who is rarely satisfied with Korean restaurants having grown up with great food at home. Thank you!!"
5,"COVID-19 outdoor dining review: shocked I haven&apos;t written a review for Her Name is Han yet! One of my favorite Korean restaurants, I have had many, many meals inside the restaurant over the years, but came by for the first time in 2020 a few nights ago, when I was craving Korean food. Their winter outdoor dining setup is basically a railroad-style wooden shed in front of the restaurant. Diners are separated by plexiglass, and wooden doors slide shut on each &quot;pod.&quot; Each personal pod also has a heater above, which is pretty strong - my coat stayed off during the entire meal, and I stayed relatively toasty even though we kept our door cracked open the entire time AND it was below freezing (albeit my feet were completely numb by the end, which is an outdoor dining problem I have yet to solve). 

I&apos;ve had a variety of dishes here, but always get the army stew and the rice cakes whenever I come for dinner. Best in the game."
4,"this korean restaurant has always been on my list and i was so happy when i finally got the chance to eat here! 
-pickup/delivery: you can find them on popular platforms such as grubhub, ubereats, seamless, and doordash. 
-outdoor dining: we made reservations through resy, which i suggest you do. there were glass dividers between each table at the time. i believe they have heaters now? they merged their outdoor seating space with take31, so you can order from both of their menus during one experience! you mark down what items you want on a piece of paper, but i&apos;m not sure if that&apos;s the same procedure they&apos;re using now. another note is that the same dishes for lunch and dinner are priced differently. we came for dinner, so our bill was more expensive than if we had decided to get the same amount of food during their lunch hours. 
-payment method: we paid with card, but i&apos;m pretty sure they accept cash as well. 
-service: waiters were friendly, but not always attentive. they didn&apos;t give us instructions as to whether we had to give them the paper with our order, or if we were supposed to wait for them to take it. we ended up waiting almost 10 minutes after choosing what we wanted and no one came to take the paper, so i just gave it to a worker.
-amount of time waited: our food came out at separate times. i would say it took 10-25 minutes for everything to eventually get to our table after we gave them our order. i appreciated how they gave us complimentary side dishes while we waited, like broccoli, kimchi, potato salad, and spicy vegetables. 

8/24/20
-black sesame tofu: this block of tofu came with black sesame dressing, fried parsnips, and beets on top. i actually expected it to be a warm , but it was actually cold! it was so refreshing to eat on a hot day, and i loved the strong black sesame flavor of it. the texture of the firm tofu and the crunchy toppings was an amazing combination. it was pretty fairly sized for an appetizer. i think it was worth the $9, since it&apos;s a unique dish that i haven&apos;t seen anywhere else before. (4.5/5)
-corn and potato croquettes: this appetizer was breaded and fried on the outside, and filled with corn, potato, and cream on the inside. it came with a side salad and some ketchup too. the texture of the crispy exterior paired so well with the hot, creamy interior. but, the flavor was kind of lacking. it was $10 for 2 small pieces, which is very pricey. i was still glad that we ordered it anyway, since it tasted freshly made and reminded me of japan. (4/5)
-han dumplings: this appetizer came with 4 pieces of dumplings filled with pork, nappa cabbage, garlic chives, and tofu. the chewy dumpling skin was on the thinner side, and there was plenty of filling inside. but, the taste just didn&apos;t stand out enough to me and i think it could&apos;ve used more garlic chives. for $8, i kind of regretted ordering this, especially since the dumplings were small in size too. (3/5)
-small han bossam: this dish is known as the &quot;slow-cooked pork belly&quot; on their menu; it comes in a small or large size. i liked how even the small size came with lots of sides, such as the kimchi and berry wine sauce, jalape√±o soybean paste, and kimchi. it was $12 for 9 small pieces, but was worth it for the high quality. the pork was tender and perfectly cooked; it also had lots of flavor and i enjoyed every single bite. (4.5/5)
-sweet and sour chicken fried rice: this entree wasn&apos;t that large in size, but fairly portioned for $14. the sweet and sour sauce flavor in the chicken and rice was not lacking whatsoever. the scallions on top added a nice texture as well. i didn&apos;t think this was anything special, but it was very tasty. (4/5)
-spring garden dessert: this came with a small scoop of black sesame ice cream with homemade green tea biscuit crumbs and dried strawberry on top. the portion was extremely small for $12, but i still found myself really loving it! the black sesame flavor in the ice cream was delicious, and the toppings added a nice crunch factor. not to mention, it wasn&apos;t overwhelmingly sweet. i would&apos;ve probably rated this a lot higher if it wasn&apos;t so expensive. (3.5/5)

overall, we really enjoyed our experience here! although the taste of their dishes are generally really good, some of them are a bit overpriced. regardless, i can still see myself coming back in the future. 
my favorites that i would recommend you must try are the black sesame tofu and small slow cooked pork belly!"
4,"Her Name is Han has been on my list for a while. I&apos;ve only ever really heard good things about it. So, for dinner one night, we got delivery. The delivery service was fairly quick. The food arrived hot and delicious. The bag was packed very nicely. The delivery wait time wasn&apos;t super long.

Food:
KFC (Boneless) - honestly, it was a little bit on the bland side and it steamed a little bit in the box (but that was expected). I wish it was more like the traditional KFC (or that they had a regular KFC option on top of their boneless)
Budae Hot Pot (Army Stew) - This was delicious, even more so than what I expected...was enough to spread out over two meals and it was like a surprise of goodness. So many good things were in it.
Banchan - these were good and it was awesome that it came with the delivery order. It was unexpected but was super happy about it.

TLDR: totally worth checking out. I can&apos;t wait to dine there in person. I think the KFC will be better in person, but the army stew was amazing and super delicious. The food is definitely delicious."
4,"***Pre-Covid Review***

Overall (4.5/5): New takes on Korean classics sets this place above the rest in the neighborhood. Delicious and comforting! Make a reservation.

Food (4.5/5): Just really solid Korean flavors that could have been made by a welcoming Korean family. The Kimchi pancake was crunchy, kimchi-y, and with a runny egg - perfection. Slow-cooked pork belly with various sauces and the rice cake hotpot were homeruns.

Atmosphere (4/5): Wait staff was very busy and took a little bit to get around to us, but the atmosphere was great and open.

Uniqueness (5/5): Fresh takes on some classics. Loved the flavors.

Value (4/5): A little pricey, but worth it."
5,"Surprised I havent left a review for this spot! The food has been consistently amazing here. Especially love the Kimchi Pancake, its perfect with the poached egg on top. Had the Galbi Hot Pot yesterday and that was great as well! A lot of healthy content in the pot and the assortment of mushrooms were a treat to pick at. Galbi was incredibly soft - texture that I like about galbi jjim. I dont really like salty food so for me their seasoning  is on point. 

Happy they are open with indoor seatings spaced out with separators. The staff are definitely clean conscious. ie yesterday the waitress immediately replaced my spoon without question, when she accidently brushed passed my spoon with her gloved hands. Pretty impressive."
5,"Absolutely incredible outdoor dining experience in the fall! The outdoor tables are all separated by floor to ceiling plastic barricades so you are in your own little room but with plenty of airflow from the street. I was impressed with how strong the heat lamps are and how perfectly toasty our seats got

Stopped by for a weekday lunch without a reservation and got seated right away. Our wait staff was awesome and everyone in the restaurant wears masks properly the whole time. We stepped inside to use the restroom and it was only us and the staff, and masks were perfectly worn. We also saw our waitress sanitize tables after other customers left so it felt very safe.

The lunch specials are an amazing deal as you get a full sized entree and all of the banchan, plus rice and a soup or salad depending on what meal you choose. Each dish tasted incredible and very traditional, like you are in the home of a Korean grandma who is the best cook in her village. The banchan are my favorite in all of Ktown, especially the tofu. I got the Bulgogi hot pot and my mom got bibimbap and we have enough leftovers for another full meal each. 

Wheelchair access: there is a small step to get inside, but most wheelchairs should be able to make it up with a little push. Restrooms are not wheelchair accessible but are on the main level. The outdoor patio is flush with the street and there is enough room to park a wheelchair next to one of the tables. Two tops have less space, but you can access them all in a wheelchair if you can go straight in and don&apos;t need to swivel like a scooter user would need to. I use a scooter and was accommodated at a four top without issue

Wheelchair accessibility:"
4,Great service and delicious food!  The outdoor space is a great find for these winter days!  I love the spicy chicken.
5,"This place lives up to it&apos;s reputation. We had a reservation. Was sat down and greeted with complimentary dishes. (Such a plus) 

I came here on an anniversary date...
The lychee drink was good. The spicy pork was amazing and the chicken is good. I really enjoyed the kimchi pancake. That was my favorite. All in all, great place!"
4,"Her Name Is Han is one of the more traditional Korean restaurants in K-Town, compared to Take31 or Anytime, and the overall dining experience felt like eating a home-cooked meal. 

My friend and I did outdoor dining here during COVID (in 38 degrees Farenheit lol) but that actually made the overall experience more enjoyable! Her Name Is Han does an incredible outdoor setup where every table is separated by wooden or plastic screens, and our waitress served us complimentary barley tea. 

Beef Hot Pot - Any hot pot would be recommended when dining in cold weather, and this was no exception. The dish came in a large, low pot filled with bulgogi, vermicelli, napa cabbage, onions, bok choy, and cabbage. The broth was slightly sweet due to the beef slices. 

Kimchi Pancake - Small plate that came with a poached egg on the side."
5,"We had another amazing visit here, this one in one of their winter covid pods, which we felt totally safe in, and was warm enough that we could take our coats off despite it being 30 degrees outside. We ordered a few of our regulars (the rice cakes, bulgogi, and kimchi pancake), as well as a couple new dishes (the beef bibimbap and small pork belly). Of the two new ones, both were great, but I preferred the pork belly. I don&apos;t think either would stop me from trying something else new next time."
4,"Make sure you reserve at Her Name is Han because this place is so popular and packed! Well, as packed as outdoor dining with tables 6 feet apart can be. While we reserved for a table and therefore had the luxury of picking outdoor dining, some people without reservations arrived a little bit before us but their options were indoor dining or to wait until an outdoor table opened up. It was a relief to see the waiters wear masks, although I don&apos;t quite recall if they offered hand sanitizer to the customers. Enticed by the large order of pork belly, my husband and I split the large order of pork belly. 

I think we made the smart decision because not only was this the perfect portion for two people, but it tasted delicious! It wasn&apos;t too salty, unlike some of the pork I have had at some KBBQ restaurants.

We had a delightful meal, and between the two of us, it only cost $25! Definitely make sure to check out Her Name is Han if you are in the area!"
4,"Had the pleasure of eating here pre-pandemic. Ahh the good old days of eating indoors in Manhattan.

From all the top blogs, expectations were pretty high here. The waiters were super attentive and informative, even with the crazy happy hour dinner crowd.

We literally ordered all the pork. Best for a hungry group bundled up from the cold. What a majestic animal."
4,"At the moment, both Her Name Is Han and Take 31 are teaming up to serve customers. Aka, with your reservation to any of these restaurants, you&apos;ll have access to both of their menus. I was so happy to try items from both restaurants! 

Because of COVID, they are only doing take out, delivery, and outdoor dining. Make sure you get a reservation since it does get packed at night! The outdoor seating booths are clean and well-kept. Each booth is separated by a wall of plexiglass. Staff members are wearing masks and cleaning/sanitizing tables before and after customers dine.

At Her Name is Han, my friends and I ordered the Mama Han&apos;s Hearty Meal for Two ($48). There&apos;s an option to customize what you want in your set which includes a small plate, grill bbq, and small hot pot. It also comes with two bowls of rice! We decided to get the Shrimp Pancake, Spicy Pork BBQ, and the Small Rice Cake Hot Pot.

Like many Korean restaurants, they offer complimentary traditional banchan (side dishes). The banchan was amazing! My favorite was the potato salad/mash potato. My friend really liked their kimchi and they were happy to give us an extra side of it.

Shrimp Pancake - Very crispy and packed with peppers. I personally love spicy food so this was so tasty! However, if you can&apos;t handle spice, I wouldn&apos;t recommend the pancake. The shrimp pancake paired well with the sauce that it came with. I wished we ordered another one.

Spicy Pork BBQ - Super yummy! It was a nice balance of sweet and spicy. My friend who doesn&apos;t like spice was able to handle this. It was her favorite meat dish out of all the meat dishes we ordered. The meat was tender and the BBQ flavor was savory while the spice was very mild.

Rice Cake Hot Pot - Came with rice cakes, boiled egg, fish cakes, ramen noodles, sausages, mussels, clams, and vegetables in a spicy broth. The broth isn&apos;t too spicy as it has a sweet aftertaste to it. I enjoyed the assortment of ingredients in the broth. There were only three pieces of rice cake but it was fine since there was a lot of seafood in the hot pot. One downside was that the hot pot could have been served warmer. We expected it to come piping hot and steaming. It&apos;s important to note that every dish comes out one at a time. Once you&apos;re done with one dish, a staff member will come and replace it with the next portion of your order. 

Overall, I enjoyed my experience at Her Name is Han. It&apos;s a great restaurant for casual dining and small group outings. For its price, I wish the portions were slightly bigger. Otherwise, I&apos;d like to come back soon to try out their lunch menu. I highly recommend this restaurant if you can tolerate spice!"
4,"The Hubby discovered This place through a list of places that u should try so we figured why not. 
We came in &amp; were seated right way, no drinks to start stuck to Ginger ale not bad, They start u off with a few apps none of which we found to be good for us, tasted a few not that great.
Food first up the Steamed dumplings these were good, nice taste with the dipping sauce.  
Next we gave the Ribs a try .. wow they were very good great tasting sauce. Main dishes we had the Fried rice &amp; Garlic Chicken very good fried rice , really great tasting chicken.
Nice size location, Service is good &amp; quick ... price wise not bad over all this place was worth the try."
4,"I ordered takeout from here, and despite my food getting a bit cold, it still made a good impression on me!

Dumplings: These were good dumplings, but $8 for 4 pretty normal-sized dumplings is steep. The filling was snappy and chewy, the wrapper was not too think or thin, and the filling-to-wrapper ratio was perfect. Unfortunately, the dumplings got a bit cold and dry in transit.

Kimchi pancake: Also good, but because I got this to-go, it wasn&apos;t warm and crispy for me (I assume that it normally is supposed to be crispy). The pancake leaned more on the salty and oily side. The soft boiled egg was a nice touch because it toned down the heat from the spiciness.

Sweet and sour chicken fried rice: This was also good and was the only thing that stayed at the right temperature. It tasted just as expected -- chicken fried rice with sweet and sour sauce drizzled on top. Without the sauce drizzle, it would have tasted just like fried rice since the sauce was neither stirred with the rice nor used to marinate the chicken. Even though this dish was nothing special flavor-wise, I would still order this again because it tasted really good.

I don&apos;t know if I&apos;d order takeout from here again, but I would come back to eat in because I feel like the food would be incredible if it is eaten soon after coming out of the kitchen."
5,"Bossam was amazing. So delicious with the sauce and served warm. The decor was really nice too, very woodsy, unique and homey. The bossam doesn&apos;t come with lettuce by the way. My friend ordered the bibimbap and while I don&apos;t love bibimbap, it was still really good and you can tell that it&apos;s a really good rendition - the rice is still a little oily and warm and the vegetables in it (especially the spinach) tasted so good! I think the chef puts a lot of care and detail into her cooking. Service was good and the COVID setup was great - nice outdoor and indoor intimate dining, great for dates too. My only complaint would be that the banchan (side dishes) were really lacking- only like four and sort of mediocre. Overall really impressed and looking forward to repeated visits for their pork belly."
5,Her Name is Han is tucked away from the hustle and bustle of Ktown offering authentic and hearty Korean soul food. Definitely do yourself a favor and make a reservation before going! Their bossam is one of my favorite things to get as well as their army stew! They have an extensive menu of comfort food that&apos;ll hit the spot for all of your Korean food cravings! Prices are on par with quality and quantity of food you&apos;re given. Her Name is Han is definitely one of my go to restaurants for lunch and dinner! You won&apos;t be dissappointed!
5,"AMAZING! WONDERFUL!!
We were here 2 weekends in a row 
Every meal was amazing well maybe all except the noddles( I just thought it was bland)

Firstly just order the Korean beef bulgogi! You won&apos;t regret it!!

The cocktails are good!

I can&apos;t stop dreaming about the food . There was a lot more food but my hands and mouth moved quicker than my brain and phone to take a picture. 

But I definitely definitely recommend."
