5,"No question the best poke bowl in New York City, hands down not even a competition. Highly recommend the tuna/salmon mix with some spicy mayo. Even there chicken teriyaki bowl is fire as well. Fast for pick up/ delivery. Can&apos;t go wrong with sons of thunder"
5,"Sons of Thunder was my first poké experience ever just a couple years back, and I&apos;ve been obsessed with poké bowls since. Of course being in NYC it&apos;s not easy to find a good bowl like it would be in LA, but Sons of Thunder has always reigned as one of the best out there! I&apos;m so glad they&apos;re delivering right now too given that my office location is no longer nearby, and the line at lunch was just always so darn long! Signs of good poké.

First and forecast, the poké is very fresh. I have always gone with the Half and Half, half tuna and half salmon, but I assume the rest of the options are just as fresh as well! And you get plenty of fish - nothing irks me more than a poké bowl where you can barely taste any poké! I love the complimentary toppings that already come with the bowl, and like that I can add on extras at a decent price. A lot of salad places will charge you more to add things like Avocado, edamame and various crunchies to your bowl. And as you can see in my photo, they give you a generous amount! The bowl was quite hefty I actually ate it over the span of 2 days, but it could probably make for one meal if you swap out heavy brown rice for their cauliflower rice (which also sounds delicious btw). 

Even in delivery, my bowl was beautifully presented and tasted delicious. Best poké in Manhattan, and highly recommend if you&apos;re craving a taste of Hawaii in the city!"
5,"I came in here because I was looking for some good poke. I was greeted by the host and was able to order for takeout. I ended up going for the salmon poke, adding edamame and extra salmon. I also try the huli chicken bowl. I was a tad disappointed I had to pay extra for edamame and I feel like it&apos;s missing at least one component without the premium add ons to be a complete bowl. However the product itself was all very delicious and the portions were fair. I enjoyed the chicken bowl also but again it was missing like an extra side component that would make it feel like a complete meal. The cashier was extremely nice and even gave my son some ice cream. I&apos;ll definitely be back but its so close to being a place that I would frequent really often. Anyway check this place out for some quality poke."
5,"This place is a gem! I had their poke bowl for the very first time and loved it. You must get the half and half (salmon and tuna) with steamed rice and spicy sauce, add shrimp tempura for the topping! You&apos;re going to love it! Also, their homemade smoothie is a win, made with soft serve ice cream! You can ask to make it less sweet and it will be just perfect!

Order is quick and staff are very attentive! If you&apos;re wondering about what size to get, the small poke bowl $12 is more than enough."
4,"Wow is this some of the best poke I&apos;ve tasted. The rating is really more of a 4.5 stars than four. Lemme break it down:

- ordered the poke bowl ahi tuna and salmon combo with all the free toppings and spicy Mayo on the side.
- came to around $16 total

Is it a bit on the pricier side for a quick/lunch place? Yes. Is the portion size a tad bit on the smaller side? Yes. But man the quality of the salmon and tuna are really melt-in-your-mouth worthy status. The marinades are fantastic, as is the spicy Mayo.

It&apos;s a bit pricy for every day lunch but definitely a good place to visit once every so often if you work in the area :).

I&apos;ll definitely come back to try some of the other items like the chili and the soft serve too!"
5,This poke place is incredible! It&apos;s so fresh and the staff was so kind! I really enjoyed the flavors and I thought the portion was really great!
5,"I&apos;ve gone 2x within 2 weeks. Fresh. Flavorful. Fast. Friendly service. This time I ate a bit before I remembered to snap a photo. 
Yummy vanilla shake for dessert."
5,"Thank you for the deliciously fresh and amazing poke bowls, chicken teriyaki and salmon bowls to our hospital during the COVID pandemic!! All the medicine residents were beyond appreciative and happy for the meals! I can&apos;t wait to order in person when we start to re-open!"
5,"Easily my favorite poke in NYC. Comparable to authentic Hawaiian poke - fresh, flavorful, and of course delicious. MUST TRY if you&apos;ve never been. Options include brown rice, vegan tofu/beets, and tons of yummy toppings. Staff truly care about the quality of your food and experience. Sons of Thunder never disappoints."
3,"Saturday afternoon, made my way over here to try something different. Interesting menu of hot dogs, poke, and shakes in a bright environment.

No line to speak of, so quickly ordered the Banh Mi Hot Dog ($5) and a Strawberry/Nutella Shake ($7). Got a pager to wait for food, then took a seat in their spacious dining area with a skylight bathing the room in sunlight. Both items come out within 10 minutes, with a station of sauces/utensils to the side after you pick up the food. Shake starts off with a big hit of strawberry flavor and not much else. As you drink it, globs of Nutella comes through the straw and inevitable becomes mostly Nutella flavored at the end. Hot dog is cooked very well, the &quot;banh mi&quot; ingredients are a few pickled veggies and some hot peppers nestled in the bun. A few bites of good hot dog sandwiched between tanginess and pure spice.

Service here is efficient as they are meant to get through the workday lunch crowd. For a quiet Saturday afternoon the music is blaring which tends to keep the turnover high (not a place to relax and have a convo). Next time would try a different hot dog or maybe the poke."
4,"I was overcome with the craving for a hot dog, I don&apos;t do street dogs and so I was on my way to Danish Dogs in Grand Central Station to get a &apos;Great Dane&apos;  But then I remember a coworker telling me that Sons of Thunder has good Hot Dogs, so, why not it&apos;s only a 2 more city blocks walking.

The place doesn&apos;t stand out and I walked right by it,  after which I check out the menu and they have 3 dogs, Chili Cheese,  Chicago, Banh Mi Dog ? and plain to if that&apos;s what you are into.

I went Chicago, and it was good but the tomato and pickle made my bread soggy, and I like toasted buns so it was a downer but the combo was still good and with the taste of fresh ingredients. Plus my craving had been diminished, mission accomplished."
5,"This is one of my favorite, if not favorite, poke spot! And that says a lot coming from someone who is obsessed with poke and a tough critic. The sushi here is so fresh and flavorful. I got the half salmon/half tuna cauli rice bowl and I highly recommend!"
5,"Sons of Thunder really combines two of my favourite things: raw fish and hot dogs... obviously not together on the same dish, though. I ordered a Chicago dog and a small salmon/tuna poke bowl. The Chicago dog was great. The pepperoncinis on top added an extra kick to the dog. The poke bowl was flavourful and had great texture. It felt fresh and light. The ingredient options that they offer for your bowl go well with any type of fish. They are also not heavy-handed with the rice, so there is a great ratio of rice to fish and toppings.
The space is large with ample seating, so I had no problem finding a seat. I definitely recommend Sons of Thunder."
2,"Sons of thunder... great name.... great concept... but very disappointing. 

Nice spin on the current poke trend. Offering poke and hotdogs! They even follow many poke spots with a build-a-poke-your-way type menu

That being said, unfortunately the fish was not very fresh. Salmon had a very &quot;fishy&quot; taste to it. Octopus also wasn&apos;t even close to good. 

The price was much more than any poke place I&apos;ve been too. Typically I get a loaded bowl with 3 different fishes and many many extras. At pokeworks till run me ~$15. Here expect to spend $20+ because almost everything costs an additional amount. 

Overall giving it 2 stars because of originality of concept, also I&apos;ve never had the dogs but pretty hard to mess that up. Alas, would NOT recommend for poke. Way better choices even at your &quot;fast-food&quot; type poke restaurants. Not sure where the hype is here. Very disappointing"
1,Have supported this business through COVID but no longer. Portions are getting smaller as they are priced more expensive. I get it things are harder but customers shouldn&apos;t bare the brunt of it
5,"LEGIT POKE. Go here for authentic Hawaaian style poke.

Skip the crazy add-ons, and get it straight up! Go halvesies with the tuna and salmon. Try the marinated chicken!

The rice and greens are delicious. The rice!!! Wow!!!! I love this rice!!!

Lots of space in the back with a skylight. Staff is great."
2,"Ordered the spicy salmon poke and a Chicago dog. The wait for the food was like 10 to 15 minutes. Which I thought was a little long since we were the only ones there. I mean, how long does it take to assemble a bowl that&apos;s like very close to 90% rice. For $15, You get like 6 or 7 pieces of a small cube of salmon. A little ridiculous. Then the hot dog, I expected the bun to at least be toasted or warmed, nope. The Costco hot dog is 10x better. Not sure what the hype was about this place."
5,Kind staff! FRESH food! So clean and yummy! Spicy salmon actually has a kick (which is so rare to find for me).
5,"I found my new favorite burger place!  Delicious!  I don&apos;t know how I&apos;ve lived in the area for 6 years and never knew the place existed until a couple of weeks ago when I saw something on TV about the owners.  Forget Shake Shack, I&apos;m coming here from now on.

Support your local businesses and try this place out.  Sons of Thunder is clean, the burger and waffle fries are terrific, and the service is fast.  What more can you ask for?  I&apos;ll come back for the poke next time!"
5,I love their ahi tuna poke! Hot dogs are also wonderful. Make sure to add different toppings to your hot dog. Will be back very soon.
