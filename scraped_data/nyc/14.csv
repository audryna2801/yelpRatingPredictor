5,"We enjoyed the restaurant week menu a lot. Steak, salad, and bread &amp; butter was fantastic for 2-person dinner (Ordered only one dish from the restaurant. We just added a bottle of wine by ourselves). I&apos;m, personally, not a big fan of red meats, but my friend said he was impressed by everything, even by a piece of butter(of course, the grilling was at the superb level). It wad a hearty dish. Simple but good ingredients served.

 I&apos;d say that the dish is very very generous for the $20.21 menu, and my friend approved its taste and quality. High quality food, absolutely. The staff was super kind. Thanks.  Thanks to your hospitality, we had a happy dinner. 

* I&apos;m personally more interested in indoor interior, which is full of history. Hope to check out in person later soon. Thanks for superb food and warm friendly hospitality :)"
5,"Been wanting to try their mutton chop for years. Finally I can make it happened on thanksgiving. Booked the place a week before and the only option was outdoor. Which is fine but since it&apos;s my first time i was hoping I can sit inside to see the ambience 

Arrived 30 minutes earlier and the host asked me if I want to go sit inside. I said yes Seated in the &quot;pub&quot; area surprisingly there&apos;s only 1 table filled. Plexy glass all around. 

I quickly ordered. 2 mutton chop ( medium rare ) for 3 with 3 sides : mushroom, broccoli , creamed spinach. The server asked if i would like the kitchen to deboned ( yes please) it was magnificent. Totally on point. Meat so tender and I just ate all around because it&apos;s all different part of the body. Can&apos;t finish the whole chop since it&apos;s super huge 

Hopefully the restaurant will survive during this pandemic. It so weird looking the restaurant is so empty ( 25% capacity for indoor seating )"
5,"What can I saw, the steak here is amazing. It&apos;s juicy, thick and so succulent. The customer service is absolutely impeccable. The server refilled my water the minute it got lower than halfway. My party and I got the porterhouse for 3, with a side of spinach and mashed potatoes, with the thick sliced bacon for an appetizer.The bacon was definitely a bit salty for my taste, but still delicious. The steak was honestly the star. It was perfectly rare, and melted in my mouth. 

All the tables were properly socially distanced, and there was outdoor seating as well. They have a policy of one person using the restroom at one time, so you would have to wait. I really have to give major props to the waiter. He was amazing. It also definitely felt like we were in dining in a museum. There were a lot of small articles, ads and of course, the pipes. There was even a knight&apos;s armor and fireplace next to us!"
5,"Keeping it real out here in Midtown.
There&apos;s something that feels so right about restaurants/businesses that&apos;s been around forever. Ordered 2 orders of the Restaurant Week meals, it was my first time having it and it was done just right right. We got the steak sandwiches, they were done just right, very reassuring for me to get steak to go from an established place. 
Will have an actual sit down meal when the craziness is over!"
3,"Keens was the location to celebrate my 37th birthday. Upon arrival, I was immediately greeted, even outside by an employee, by the three employees who were in the front. I must say the staff here is 100% great, anytime you are in the proximity of a staffer, they would say hello. 

As my reservation was at 630PM and my 8 year old was with us, I wanted to order quickly, so we could kind of get in and get out. Collectively we ordered Lamb Chops, Filet Mignon, Roasted Chicken. For the sides, we had French Fries, Creamed Spinach and Mashed Potatoes. Our desserts options were the chocolate cake, cheesecake and something my daughter had called Bibble. It looked like a parfait/sundae, my daughter didn&apos;t care for it whatsoever. 

Onto the rest of the food, I wasn&apos;t pleased whatsoever with the food. The steak was tender, but just was bland. My daughter barely touched the chicken and she said that it lacked seasoning and she&apos;s 8. I attempted to reheat today, for lunch, but she still didn&apos;t really want it. The mashed potatoes were okay, as was the spinach, but nothing special. 

The location  is wonderful, the staff was exceptional, but the main attraction, the food itself, was very lackluster."
5,"Meets all expectations and more. Rave reviews from coworkers and friends. If you&apos;re a history buff, you would want to go here. Teddy Roosevelt dined here and has a room dedicated to him here. Many historical figures and celebrities have signed pipes here. In fact, the ceilings are covered by hanging pipes, literally. The steak is awesome and cooked well here. They really know what they are doing here at this steakhouse. The waiters are awesome too. They are so knowledgeable about the history of this establishment."
5,Amazing!! Wouldn&apos;t think eating at one of the most iconic steakhouses of NYC on the curb would be as good as I thought it would be! Amazing as always. Went for lunch and was not disappointed! Each table gets its own individual heater. The wind is blocked by the unique structure. Def well built. Service was on point and the food was amazing!
4,"[restaurant week takeout]

The steak sandwich looked small, but was very generous with the steak portion. It was cooked to a rare-er medium rare. It was a simple and well-made sandwich (comes with grilled onions and horseradish cream). There was a hilarious amount of fries, more about three times what I&apos;d expect as a side. 

Takeout was well packaged, the fries stayed warm and crispy. The sandwich got cold but tasted fine.

While we were waiting, the hostesses were very kind and suggested we wait in one of the dining areas to stay warm.

I look forward to eating there one day since their dining hall looks awesome, and from the small encounters, the food and staff seem great."
1,"Yesterday evening we had one of the worst steak house experiences to date, from the beginning we were met by a waiter that was jittery and unprofessional to when he dropped a full glass of water on my fianc√©&apos;s chest. The waiter then scrambled away saying they would remove some of the items from the bill in an attempt to make good on the fact that she was now sitting in a cold room soaked and with a full dinner order on the way. We accepted the gesture as we understood accidents happen, only to be served with a poorly cooked prime rib and full bill. Needless to say I would never recommend it this place to anyone, the service and atmosphere has been on a steady decline in the last few years."
5,"I very rarely give 5 stars to Any Restaurant, but Keen&apos;s deserves each and every star for being exactly who they are. 

One of the oldest &amp; Best steak houses in America. 

This is a national landmark and a part of country&apos;s culinary history. 

Abraham Lincoln use to smoke pipes here after he went to plays off Broadway in New York. 

Let&apos;s start with the obvious, the Ambience is a key factor to the quality of this experience.  

&quot;Look up&quot; , but don&apos;t miss the fresh lobster in the tank and the secrets in the paintings. 

We Got A steak house Classic, Steak and lobster. But this was no steak lobster combo at your local outback. 
This my friends was so, so much more. 
A perfectly prepared Porter house steak and 3 Lbs fresh Maine lobster.  Keens is a steak house but they are known for their Rack of Lamb. 
The sides were large and shareable but the star 

The preparation and execution were perfect. 
 Keens should serve to teach those looking to spruce up a steak house too much to what excellence can be when you keep things simple but keep quality on the front burner. 

Highly recommend if you are in NY you don&apos;t miss Keens, or you will miss out."
5,"Probably the Best filet mignon in NYC. Very flavorful &amp; cooked to perfection.  Great service (Sonny, great waiter).  Very nostalgic interior &amp; convenient to Penn Station."
5,"This steakhouse is full of history, opened in 1885 as a cigar place till nowadays as one of the brand names steakhouses of NYC that you have to attend. 
Booking a dinner could be challenging, so arrange in advance, unless you have some insights or something. 
Once we got to the place, the host greeted us, and the experience begins.
The new rule for this place is 1,5 hours for dinner, so we decided to scan through the menu in advance. 
For the starters, we had shishito peppers, cooked perfectly, and a house salad with balsamic dressing to refresh the palate.
Main course; 
My choice was the famous mutton chop medium rare,  cause this is the only place in the city where you can try it. This meat is not for everyone; it has a specific taste and smell, so I recommend it to someone adventurous and open to strong flavors. As for me, I am not in love, but I liked it: juicy, gamey meat, a little tougher than beef. 
My husband got T-bone prime steak medium rare cooked to perfection. The excellent quality piece can not get wrong. 
And for the sides, we ordered creamy spinach and broccoli +caulliflower, both are great. We had some leftovers cause too much for the two of us, and I wanted to save some room for dessert.
I ordered key lime pie as many people do, and this is a great choice, not too heavy, savory enough bug not too much. Eat it all without regrets."
4,"Keens wasn&apos;t mind-blowing, but it was pretty good. They&apos;re doing outdoor dining right now, and my boyfriend and I made a 6:30 res for a weeknight. We arrived on time had to wait 15 mins for the table; not ideal but not a dealbreaker. The outdoor setup is pretty low-effort in terms of decoration - which is odd, considering the caliber of this restaurant. Tables were well-spaced but the chairs were all plastic and the barrier was super basic with some plants here and there. Again, not a dealbreaker, was just a little surprised because there are less expensive places making way more of a decorative effort. 

On to the food. We shared: 
+ Thick cut smoked bacon
+ Iceberg lettuce wedge 
+ Our legendary mutton chop 
+ Mashed Yukon gold potatoes
+ Creamed spinach 
+ Key lime pie 

Best dishes were the bacon, mutton chop and dessert. Sides were meh. TLDR: Get the meats here."
3,"I ordered the mutton chop medium rare.  It really didn&apos;t have much flavor other than a sprinkling of sea salt.  You had to use the mint jelly to get a decent taste.  The mustard escarole that comes free with the chop was too sour, but when mixed with the creamed spinach it worked very well (think sharp American cheddar). Their house beer is not too shabby either.  The complimentary bread was hard as a rock as if they were recycling it.  Service was just ok compared to other steakhouses.  Overall, I spent $100 after tax and tip.  I should have gotten the ribeye steak instead; more flavor."
5,"We came here for a collective birthday dinner and the service could not have been better. Waitress and hostess were very kind and on top of it. There was lots of room between tables and not too loud in the restaurant. The crudit√©s to start was a great touch alongside the bread basket. 

Though I did a little research on the mutton chop and it sounded unique for a steakhouse, we ended up going with the Porterhouse for 3 for a group of four of us. It was perfectly cooked at medium rare and seasoned well. Prior to the steak we got the ceaser salad and house salad to begin, good to share and the balsamic dressing was nice. For sides we ordered the hashbrown and saut√©ed spinach. Hashbrown was perfectly crispy outside and soft inside and the spinach just contrasted all the meat nicely. 

To finish we ordered the key lime pie which was a great balance of sweet and sour and had a really yummy crust. I would definitely come back for a work dinner or special event."
5,"Classic steakhouse in New York with full of history. My friend and I decided to go here last week since we haven&apos;t visited in a long time. We sat on the second floor surrounded by countless antiques and a ceiling full of smoking pipes. I love the decor - it takes me back in time especially knowing people like a Teddy Roosevelt, Babe Ruth and JP Morgan frequented here. Moving on to the food. We ordered the 8 oz Filet Mignon and Mashed potato. It was magnificent - a carnivore&apos;s heaven. The server was very attentive as well. Needless to say, we had a successful night out."
5,"So good I ordered it again, and this time managed to take a picture. I appreciated that they kept the sour cream and onions on the side."
5,"I&apos;ve been to Keens twice - once pre-Covid and once the day they opened for indoor dining. Both times were outstanding! Extra star for this time, because they did a great job making the dining experience awesome even at 25% capacity. Food was perfection and I felt comfortable and safe. They maintained the ambiance throughout all the changes. 

The first time around was a full, bustling restaurant. We had the mutton chop (I know it sounds weird but you must!) and a prime rib. The second time was during the first day of indoor dining coming back, so capacity was limited but they still had a full menu and everything was like clock work. We had the chateaubriand for two, oysters rockafeller, thick cut bacon and a bottle of wine. Everything was incredible and it&apos;s nice to be able finally sit inside because the decor is what really makes this place special."
5,"Took advantage of the reduced occupancy to come here. Everything was cooked beautifully, the servers were great, just an overall great experience."
5,"Deeeeeeeelish! Nom nom :) I throughly enjoyed the flavors, the use of minimal salt, the texture, the presentation. This place satisfies. I had the lamb chops, creamy mashed potatoes &amp; creamed spinach. Will DEFINITELY order from here again."
