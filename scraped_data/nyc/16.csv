5,"Amazing Korean food ! Tapas styles ! Which I love, it allows me to try different options and eat more of course ! 
I was around the area and was looking for some good Korean food and this place pop up on my suggestions and I&apos;m so glad it did
First of all they are covid friendly, they check your temp and you have to write down your info for traces purposes which I think it&apos;s necessary ! The staff and and service is superb! 
My menu had many options but I asked for recommendations and the waitress was so awesome and recommended two out of the 3 things I got ... I wanted to try the truffle fries and to be honest they were OK, nothing to brag about it I wish I would have had something else from the menu, now she recommended the spicy fried pork dumplings and the fish buns. The dumplings were delicious! Not too fried ! The fried fish bun was my favorite ! It was just an explosion of flavors ! Fried to perfection, crispy outside but soft inside, the spicy sauce was just so flavorful and not overpowering! Can&apos;t wait to come back here and try other options !"
5,"I feel like Korean restaurants usually have very predictable menus but I was pleasantly surprised by my dinner here. My friend and I were able to get seated as a walk-in Saturday evening and the tables were spaced enough that we felt comfortable dining indoors. We ordered perhaps too much food for just two people, but everything was so delicious we still left no crumbs.

You MUST get the Truffle Rice Cake &amp; Cheese. So addictive, we couldn&apos;t stop coming back to it even after the rest of our food arrived. The sweet chewy tteok balls actually make a fantastic substitute in this hybrid mac and cheese. Nacho Belly was another hit. The pork belly is perfectly grilled, with just enough crispy char on the edges to deliver that big kbbq flavor. It is balanced out well with the dressed greens and sweet chili sauce. Crispy Chicken Baos were good, but not a standout. A Galbi Hotstone Bowl rounded out the meal. It&apos;s a decent portion so it&apos;s a good move to fill you up. Again, not mind-blowing but definitely one of the better bibimbaps I&apos;ve had.

Absolutely no disappointments, each dish was yummier than the next, and we left very happy and very full."
5,"Came here for mid week lunch recently before indoor dining shutdown. Take advantage of their lunch special. The fried chicken is a classic, but we were most impressed by the omurice. It was surprisingly flavorful yet light with the eggs cooked perfectly. Somehow that ended up being our favorite of the lot. Cocktails are pretty good as well."
4,"Order:
- Kalbi Plate (5/5)
- Spicy Chicken Plate (4/5)
- Seoul Mule (3/5)
- Drunken Tiger (3/5)

Pros:
- Authentic tasting Korean food
- Large portions 
- Nice service 

Cons:
- Kinda pricey 
- Signature cocktails honestly weren&apos;t that good. I would just stick with the beer or soju 

Overall: Nice spot in K-Town for an authentic tasting but aesthetically please Korean meal."
5,"If I could give more than five stars I would! This restaurant continues to be one of my favorite restaurants in the city, and I have yet to find a place that takes cleanliness more seriously. If I do go out to eat I prefer to sit outside, however, I feel safe eating inside at BJ35 because of how seriously they have taken pandemic safety precautions. There are noticeably less tables inside, and generously spaced out. 

The service continues to be spot on, and the food is always fresh and perfectly tasty. I tried the crispy tofu recently, and it is probably the best crispy tofu in all of New York. Will definitely be adding that to the normal apps I get. I genuinely do not think it is possible to not enjoy yourself at Barn Joo 35! With the friendly and efficient service, and amazing food, this is a must try in Midtown. 

Also a special thanks to Andrew, one of the managers who has treated my roomie and I so well each time we have came here for lunch or dinner."
5,"OMG this place has one of the best Korean fried chicken wings I have ever had. I am usually a picky wing eater who takes the skin off (weird I know), but here I couldn&apos;t resist eating the wings to its bare bone. Seriously the wings were amazing. My favorite between the spicy Korean and the Soy ginger was the spicy one because the spice wasn&apos;t overwhelming. It was just Perfect. The Tuna mayo was also great. The bulgogi tacos were okay. Needed a little more of flavor in my opinion and the Truffle rice cakes were something different and delicious. I really recommend this place. The staff was so amazing. Reservations are recommended as they can get packed."
4,"We came for happy hour. The korean fried chicken and cocktail is good. The seafood kalguksu is ok. 

I would recommend come for happy hour and snacks. The meal is just ok not their normal quality of food. I loved their seafood kalguksu hot pot, but noodle I got is just subpar."
4,"The atmosphere here was great and the wait staff all looked like models. I ordered the hot stone bibimbap bowl, Korean tacos and the fried Tiger roll. The food was all pretty good, but for the price the portions were a bit small. I think this would be a great place for some small bites for a date."
5,"Delightful Korean food in the heart of the city! The aggressive party music was the first thing I noticed, which I didn&apos;t mind too much. We were seated outside and ordered fried tiger roll to start, which was extremely good and loaded with flavor and toppings. We ended up not drinking despite the music enticing us too, and we were fine with the water bottle given. When we ordered, we were actually moved to the covered area which was much warmer to our delight. We both ordered hot stone bowls (forget the proper name!), mine with eel. Our server even offered us kimchi on the house! The bowl was incredible. The eel was cooked to perfection and paired so well with the rest of the flavors, down to the sauce and egg. Clearly I loved the service, and the food was worth every penny."
2,"My experience at Barn Joo 35 was not great.  

My cocktail was fine (Midtown Forsythia, $6 during Happy Hour.)

We ordered a hotpot, the Korean Army Stew, which was very disappointing. I thought it&apos;d be a better version of what it sounded like, but the bowl was really just a hodgepodge of bad/cheap ingredients like pieces of wiener (&quot;pork sausage&quot; according the menu), and what seemed like canned beans &amp; other stuff, etc., along with some veggies and ramen noodles. 

I think we may have ordered the worst item on the menu, &amp; their other foods must be better &amp; possibly worth a try, but at the same time, I&apos;m flabbergasted that they&apos;d serve that &quot;army stew&quot; like that at all. We did ask for guidance on the menu, so I wish the waiter would have steered us away from ordering that hot mess.

Otherwise, service was good. Ambience was good. Food was a joke -- on us."
5,"Barn Joo deserves an award for Best Happy Hour menu in NYC. No, I haven&apos;t tried every Happy Hour but I promise you will be happy if you come here. Their Happy Hour is Monday-Saturday from 3pm-6pm. We stopped by around 5pm and were seated right away.
After staring at their Happy Hour menu for so long, we decided to get one of everything (LOL). We got 10 Wings ($1 each) half soy garlic and half hot &amp; spicy, Truffle Fries (~$5), Calamari &amp; Nuts (~$7), Crunchy Tofu (~$7), and Fried Tiger Roll (~$8).
The Wings are beyond delicious. They are crispy, juicy, and the flavor isn&apos;t overbearing at all. I was a big fan of the soy garlic personally! $1 each may seem like a lot but they are decent-sized wings! The Truffle Fries were super unique because you can taste the truffle in every bite. I think they use truffle oil or something! It comes with ketchup and spicy mayo dipping sauces which were both great! The Calamari &amp; Nuts are battered with wasabi and the coating is actually pretty light. They could have been crispier also, honestly. I didn&apos;t care for the nuts personally but if you like that added crunch, they&apos;re there for you! The Crunchy Tofu has a slight kick to it and is served with caramelized kimchi. The caramelized kimchi is a unique twist and added a smoky/sweet layer to the dish. The Fried Tiger Roll is lightly fried on the outside and filled with tuna, salmon, avocado, and topped with spicy mayo and eel sauce. The fish was super fresh and surprisingly light despite all those ingredients!
All in all, everything hit the spot! I&apos;m shocked that their ENTIRE Happy Hour menu was that good. It&apos;s also super affordable! It came out to ~$20/person which is great for NYC prices. If you haven&apos;t visited Barn Joo 35 and are looking for an American twist on Korean food, do yourself a favor and stop by!"
3,"Came here on a chilly, busy Friday night. Place was packed as expected but many other places were full so it seems you can count on the place because of capacity? Overall the food was alright but overpriced.

Let&apos;s start with the fried asparagus. I believe we got 5. This is when appetizers become a pet peeve. $10 is a bit much for what it is, but NYC. Why give an odd number if the appetizer is meant to be shareable? The next app was the Nacho Belly - pork belly, soy bean paste, tortilla chips and some other things that were pretty much garnish. Better than the asparagus and a more fair price, still I wasn&apos;t overly impressed but nice presentation. Again questionable share-ability if more than two people.

My main entrée were the NY Bites. Strange name compared to some of the other offerings. Not bad. I don&apos;t get the hub bub with everything being truffled though. The entrée was very meaty and I didn&apos;t feel cheated here so this gets a thumbs up. 

Had cocktail which also was pretty good, but more impressed with presentation than the drink.

Overall though with high NYC prices for just passable entrees makes feel like I&apos;m playing tourist coming to a place like this. I&apos;m sure there are more fitting Korean spots. I&apos;d probably come back for the same circumstances - other venues full, out with friends and I&apos;m real hungry but that&apos;s about it."
5,"This spot is great! We came here for the happy hour and the happy hour food portion is decent. The beer and drink choices are also great 

The service is even better! Andrew was our server and he is super friendly and accommodating. The only thing that is missing is the music but due to the pandemic I understand why they can&apos;t have music outside. 

We will definitely come back for dinner and checkout their other items they offer.

3,"Came here for lunch. We went around 1 and the place was relatively empty with only a few tables taken. As we ate it did get more crowded but still not too bad.

The service here is a bit slow and at times felt a little &quot;set it and forget it&quot;. If you eat with two people you get a relatively small table, which can be a bit annoying with larger menu items like the Farmer&apos;s Meal.

We got the crispy chicken buns, the tuna poke and the farmers meal. The crispy chicken buns were my favorite, they tasted like Korean Katsu with the sauce Korean katsu sauce in a bun.

The poke was interesting, it was more of a cross between a chicken salad (the kind you get on a sandwich) and tuna than a more traditional poke mix. My boyfriend called it a &quot;midwestern poke&quot;.

The farmers meal was okay. We got it with kalbi, but they serve it in cubed form and not LA Kalbi form. It was kind of fun to eat at first because of the wrapping but food wise was rather boring.

Cool place but probably won&apos;t be back. Seems like a good place to go for happy hour though."
5,"Walked in 15 mins after I joined the waitlist on Yelp (this feature never gets old) 

They seated is upstairs right away and were very prompt with everything. 
We orderedd to bbq for two - the meat was extremely good quality but it lOoked and was a miniature meal. Tad disappointed with portions.

Tried the fried dragon roll which was extremely  delicious. I could actually  taste every little detail in the roll.

Also ordered their famous buns and the baos just melt in your mouth and the meat inside was bursting with flavors

We got our complimentary sake with check in.  They were so nice they didn&apos;t even associate us to show the check in. The sake was yummy! 

Will defInitely go back and try more things on the menu"
5,"not to be biased but this placed had captured me since the first time I walked in. I almost never did this, but I&apos;ve known this place will rate 5 before I even tasted the food.

ambience was perfect for casual lunch. average noise, not too loud. excellent service - swift, polite, amiable, and nothing weird.. cosy interior. we LOVE it. the menu has a good variety but it all revolves around Asian fusion.. we ordered Korean Taco (Bulgogi) which comes with Truffle Fries, Tri-Color Sashimi Salad, and Crunchy Tofu.

all the food was aesthetically pleasing. Beautiful plating. And comes in real decent filling portion. Honestly I&apos;ve been to way too many overpriced restaurant with portion so small u left the place hungrier than when u came. 

The sashimi salad was uber fresh and delicious! bulgogi was perfectly cooked, tender, well-seasoned, and all the components blend well together.. truffle fries was fragrant. crunchy tofu was incredible, i assume it was coated with sweet gochujang sauce and the batter was cornstarch or potato flour. every single other dish from other tables looked amazing as well. I would love to come back and I highly recommend this place"
3,The tables are kind of small if you&apos;re planning to order a bunch of small plates. The food is okay.
4,"Decent, but a bit small portioned. The soju looks small, but it will get you drunk! I shared these three dishes with my date, and it was decent! I thought the taste of it was on point with the army stew! 

Dishes: 4/5
Environment 5/5 loved the tree and nature feel upstairs
Alcohol: 4/5 decent tasting and surprisingly strong. 

Overall, I had a great time, bur food wise it could be a bit better since we have k-town right next door."
4,"Food was tasty, but for the price the portions are pretty small. Usually when I order army stew from other restaurants it comes in a pot maybe 2.5x larger so that was what I was expecting. Flavor wise, I liked it a lot better than some other places - it&apos;s a bit sweeter and less salty than others. The nachos were good too, just wished the chip to pork belly ratio was better. 

Presentation for my food plus what my friends ordered were of course amazing. My photos don&apos;t do it justice!!"
5,"My first review of 2020 and I want to star it with a 5-star gem!

Found Barn Joo on Yelp while looking for some good eats near the Empire State building on. Saturday night. It was easy to make a reservation on the app while we were walking toward the restaurant 10-15 blocks away. I was surprised there was availability for a part of 5 at around 6PM. The place was packed when we got there and because we weren&apos;t going to grill at the table, they lead us up to the, get this, 3rd floor. I couldn&apos;t believe how many tables they had. 

All the staff we interacted with were welcoming and friendly, from the hostess, the gentleman who lead us to our table, our waiter, and I believe the manager. 

We ordered so much food because everything sounded good. Fried asparagus, crispy tofu, popcorn chicken, veggie pancake, truffle fries, vegetable hot stone rice, and beef cube steak. 

I also tried their sunset cocktail - Suntory whisky, juice, and bitters. 

A wonderful dining experience with delicious food and superb service! Thank you Barn Joo!"
