A great place to grab quick lunch &amp; dinner 

Second time here and I still love this place. If you&apos;re craving for some quick, cheap, decent Korean food, Woorjip is the place for you. Each box is pre-packaged (no longer any buffet) of a certain Korean dish that ranges anywhere from $2 to $7 (ish). They offer soups, rice, tofu soup/stew, pork katsu/chicken cutlet, dumplings, inari, croquettes, japchae, kimbap/rolls, soju, and lots more. Occasionally there&apos;s a rack with 50% off items. Located in the heart of Koreatown, Manhattan. 

Food: Japchae was not very good...it was better the first time I was here...given I got here around 6 pm this time around, so the noodles might&apos;ve been staler since it&apos;s been sitting out for most of the day. The squid roll &amp; seafood tofu soup were pretty good for the price; I would totally get these items again. The other items were decent. We got 6 items for ~$30 + utensils. Don&apos;t expect restaurant-level food. Prices are GREAT for the portions &amp; location.

COVID: They don&apos;t take temperature, but they take precautions &amp; social distancing seriously. No longer any buffet or place to eat inside.
Customer service: Friendly, efficient"
4,"Woorijip is a NYC Ktown favorite - with immediate variety of Korean plates, clean, organized, tasty at reasonable prices. Dishes range from kimchee pancakes to garlic chicken to kimbap to japchae. 

Food is good enough but its major advantage is ready to eat food in an organized manner. Note I went during the pandemic and dining in was not permitted. There was one way direction signs, temperature reader and hand sanitizer available. Workers are helpful as well.  

The place is very promotional. There is a 50% off happy hour at 4pm and 8pm of certain plates. Go to the middle of the store. Note it goes quick because I arrived at 4:25pm recently and it was all gone. If you pay in cash, you get 5% off. Also, if you give your email (over $50 orders) or &quot;Like&quot; on Facebook, you get 20% off, for a limited time. 

I can guarantee there is no place in Ktown where you can get cheaper food."
4,I feel like almost every time I come to Koreatown I make a stop by woorijip. It&apos;s a nice place to come pick up a small bite or grab a bottle of soju for a more affordable price than the bars nearby. The food doesn&apos;t disappoint either!
1,"So sad to see Korean restaurants/stores trying to scam customers for their portion. 

I get it $6 is cheap for pig trotters (jokbal), but they literally put 6 thin slices of jokbal and put bunch of hidden lettuce under to trick customers for their portion.

please DO NOT try to trick people like this. smh shame on you!!!!!"
5,"This has been my go-to for quick, affordable, super tasty Korean meals for over a decade. Whether by the pre-packaged meals or the buffet table, I can always find a new Korean meal or a tried-and-true favorite.

I have never been there, whether early afternoon or evening, and it is not packed with diners. Clearly, I am not the only one that enjoys the comfortable atmosphere and food there.

See for yourself and enjoy."
4,"Great place for grab and go. I enjoyed the wide selection of Korean boxes, cheap as well."
4,"Efficient spot for quick and homey Korean meals. Everything is prepackaged now (they use to have a buffet style) and ready to go and eat. You can find many things from kimchi pancakes, soups, rolled eggs, side dishes, chicken &amp; grilled pork dishes, etc. Located in NYC&apos;s K-town."
5,Such a fun spot to check out in K-town for casual homestyle Korean food. The concept is simple. You walk in and there is every type of Korean comfort food you can think of all stacked up against one side of the store. You grab whatever you want and pay for it. Each item has its own price and they have a good vegetarian selection as well.
4,"I have been to Woorjip so many times in the past for lunch.  This place before covid 19 was a very busy place with limited seating.  You were able to select food from their open buffet plus buy assorted packaged cooked foods. There was so much to choose from.  Now, the seats are gone and so is the open buffet and their menu is limited.  All of their food is now prepackaged and ready to take out.  When you go in you take ur temperature by the wall and use some hand sanitizer.  Then you begin the process of selecting your food.  I got their sweet potato noodles with vegetables, rice cakes with beef and vegetables plus some other dishes.  This is my favorite place to come to for Korean food and now that all of their food is prepackaged it&apos;s easier to just buy as much food as you like and just take it home."
5,This place is sort of perfect for Covid times. All lovely lunch and dinner boxes! Everything has a nice homemade taste to it. They have a thermometer to use when you enter and you must use hand sanitizer before touch anything! They also have a ton of side dishes and other standard korean foods. It is my go to when I&apos;m in the area and in a rush to take back home.
5,Favorite ktown spot. Pre-covid there were seating inside but now there&apos;s only takeout. You can take your temperature when you enter and get a pump of hand sanitizer. Every day they have different stuff but some of the main items are usually always available. They also have soju and beer. People used to pregame here.
5,"Nestled in between its much more expensive KTown restaurant counterparts Woorijip is such an unassuming gem. 

As soon as you walk in you can see how well they have maintained their COVID standards. The store is clean and they have a small area in the front with hand sanitizer and a mounted temperature check. The lines are marked out to help the flow of traffic as well. 

Pre-COVID Woorijip used to have a buffet of food you can help yourself to. Now due to necessary restrictions you can just pick up pre-packaged foods from piles of choices. Prices are very affordable. Though some foods are more basic and just ok there are a few shinning stars. I absolutely adore their kimchi and pork soup. $4 for the delicious broth and toppings. Sign me up! The tofu and seafood stew is great as well. Did I mention the cheap alcohol as well? ;) Lots of different choices to try out but there are some to skip such as the eel sushi. 

All in all, if you are looking for a decently priced quick Korean meal definitely make a stop at Woorijip."
5,"This spot used to have amazing home style Korean food both prepackaged to go as well as an awesome buffet bar where you could pick and choose which Korean dishes/you wanted to try. Only want 2 pcs of kimbap, 2 pcs of dukbokki and other random extremely small portions of basically everything? Not a problem. It&apos;s why I loved it here so much, sometimes you just want Korean comfort food and they basically have everything for extremely reasonable prices, which makes it that much more awesome. 

Well, you wouldn&apos;t want to eat food from a buffet bar nowadays with this deadly virus going on. But they made do with packing various different combinations of items into prepacked lunch boxes. It&apos;s a good compromise. Their establishment has one of the more vigorous safety measures put in place and I have confidence that every precaution and care was taken in making sure the food was handled in a safe and sanitary way. Great job!"
4,"- Stopped by to grab some food
- Hot food bar
- They have lunch boxes that you can purchase with a soup/salad/kimchi/rice for free
- On weekday evenings they will put some leftover items on a separate tray at a discounted price
- Great for pregaming with soju if you want to go out in the area later
- Quick, affordable, spacious"
3,"Such a great grab and go place and the varieties of food they serve are massive! I was standing there for a long while and could not decide what to buy. So many items that I wanna try.
For the food wise I think there are some space for improvement. The veggie and rice inside the kimbap were not good combination. The rice was too firm and flavorless. 
The Japanese fried chicken is not bouncy and juicy. The chicken is not fresh so it&apos;s quite firmed. Guess the oil is not good I had a bit of stomachache afterward. The stomachache only comes after bad fried food intake. So the two items I tried are not good enough I would say."
5,"This place is A+! Not only is it extremely affordable but it tastes amazing!

So far I&apos;ve had 4 dishes there and all of them have been super tasty. I usually experience heartburn with oily food, however, I&apos;ve not had any of that here.

The dishes I&apos;d recommend are: kimchi fried rice with egg ($6), crabmeat pancakes ($6), spicy rice pasta with fishcake and hard boiled egg ($5), and the egg-fried tofu ($6, goes really well dipped in the rice pasta sauce).

Not to mention the level of precautions they are taking with COVID-19. They require you to get a temperature check and sanitize your hands upon entry. On top of that they&apos;ve streamlined the flow of people inside by separating the pick up shelves from the check-out counters. All utensils are packaged individually."
5,"I had lunch here today and this place is well run with delicious food. In these covid times they have an automated self temperature check, hand sanitizing station, all food packaged, place is clean, enforced mask wearing, and not much people I&apos;m assuming because of capacity minimum enforcement. I haven&apos;t seen any other place still like this a year after the start of the pandemic. 

There are so many options for food, food is very affordable and you get a good amount, all food is packaged, all food has time stamps on them for freshness and the price listed on them, all food is fresh, and food that needs to stay hot stays in a heating chamber and cold in a fridge. 

I had soy garlic fried chicken with rice and bottled ito-en green jasmine tea.
Soy garlic chicken and rice were both still warm when I got home a half hour later and the food was good. The soy garlic chicken was $6 for a good amount and a pint of rice was $2 and the bottled tea was $3. 

The staff are friendly and welcoming they make the experience all the better. 

No pictures because I was so hungry I ate it right away.

Very good place to go for lunch"
4,"My boyfriend and I have been here a handful of times and have tried probably half of what they have to offer. This is a great little spot to go in and grab some snacks (or a lighter meal). Most recently, we got the soft tofu and seafood stew (pictured) and okonomiyaki. Both were great. The stew was mildly spicy and the tofu was so soft and silky. The flavor was a bit on the mild side. The okonomiyaki was delicious and had a Korean spin, with crispy cabbage and shrimp. We&apos;ve also tried the spicy and baked mackerel (recommend getting the spicy), seaweed salad, various egg dishes (egg and vegetable omelette and egg with tofu, crab pancake, beef bibimbap, miso soup, kimchi, anchovies, porridge, and probably many other dishes. The best part about this place is the ease of grabbing a snack that looks good (everything is on display and you can see everything by walking in a circle around the shop). It&apos;s very reasonably priced as well. They also have cool deals like a certain percentage off at certain times of the day, and free soup with some of the small meals."
5,"Amazing grab-and-go place if you&apos;re having a busy day. I needed to rush for a train at Penn station and decided to stop just 2 blocks away over here for a bento. Was quite overwhelmed with the amount of options I had, but settled with this fried chicken cutlet box, which also comes with a free side of kimchi or miso soup for your choosing. 

Didn&apos;t get to eat this until an hour later when I got off the train, but even when cold, the food was amazing. The chicken cutlet was very thick for the price and very savory, especially with the kimchi. It also came with a piece of tamagoyaki and some slices of radishes to cleanse the palette. 

Highly recommend for grabbing something quick for work or if you&apos;re arriving from or leaving for Penn station."
5,"I&apos;ve been coming to Woorijip for a few years and it never fails to hit the spot when I&apos;m craving Korean food. I like how it&apos;s a self-service location where you grab whatever you want and pay at the counter. They also have numerous tables and chairs in the front and back but they do fill up fast especially during lunch time.

Some of my favorites are the kimbap, ddukbokki, and garlic chicken. They also have a buffet where you fill your container with food. It costs around $10/lb.

Give this place a try!! It&apos;s seriously one of the greatest spots of K-town."
