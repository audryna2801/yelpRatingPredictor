5,"I really didn&apos;t want to write a review yet because I haven&apos;t tried their omakase but we had takeout because we were craving REAL sushi/sashimi so bad during covid. We actually went when it was a little warmer and ate in Washington Square Park on 14th,  and yes the sushi held up very well. 
Now I don&apos;t know what we ordered because my boyfriend actually went in and ordered it but it was DELICIOUS. (Better than Sugarfish tbh.) 
The fact that you can&apos;t go all the way inside I really like that...leaves a little mystery lol. 
Great place I can&apos;t wait to go back after covid calms down with friends!"
5,"We came for an early Saturday night dinner and were seated quickly. The outdoor space is simple but cozy, 4-5 compartments separated by plastic with 2 tables each inside. While we were there, each group had its own compartments which get very distanced and safe.

The dine in menu is a bit different than the takeout menu. While the takeout has some sushi/sashimi prix fixe options, the dine in only has omakase options for main courses. This time, we chose to order a la carte.

For appetizers, we had the oshitashi and ara jiru miso soup. Both came quickly, were simple, fresh, and delicious. We also had a warm sake - the Naraman which was nice and mellow, just as the server described! The warm sake was lovely to sip on on a cold night.

For sushi, we tried a few pieces including the poached shrimp, fatty toro, golden eye snapper, Spanish mackerel, and white sea eel. We also had cut up rolls of King salmon and toro. The standout was certainly the toro, especially the sushi though the cut up roll was wonderful as well (particularly with the addition of scallion inside). The Spanish mackerel was also a standout. The cut up rolls were a wonderful shape and size - not something I typically notice - but everything was just right. And that captures how the entire meal felt. The flavors were familiar, but somehow so much better. We finished every bite of food with pleasure. Looking forward to coming back for the omakase in the future."
5,"We ordered directly on the website and had to exceed a certain amount to get the delivery. So we just ordered extra sushi! We don&apos;t regret it! Still one of the best and freshest sushi. We got both the Sushi Toku and the Omakase to compare the pieces. Honestly, they were both similar (obviously extra uni, white eel and aji were not in the Sushi Toku option). While the omakase was more than double in price, definitely recommend next time to get the Toku and purchase extra pieces a-la-carte."
4,"I came here for indoor dining in October. It was a cold night so there was no outdoor seating that night. Luckily, I did have a table near the door. I wouldn&apos;t say that they spaced tables 6 feet apart as the counter party and the next table from me was maybe only 3-4 feet away and I could hear their entire conversations.  The restaurant does have very high ceilings so the space does appear more spacious that way. 

As for the food, we ordered some soup and salad for appetizers. They were only OK but the star of course was the omakase. It was fantastic!! I had high hopes since it was  a one Michelin star restaurant and it did not disappoint. All the pieces of fish were fantastic, especially the California uni. I ordered an extra piece at the end of the meal. 

Sushi yasuda used to be a no tipping restaurant but because of the pandemic, they are accepting gratuity for their staff. I am awaiting the day to enjoy a meal here again."
4,"Yasuda has been on my list for ages, and my boyfriend and I finally stopped in on a Friday for dinner. Outside setup is great and the food is super tasty. 

We shared the edamame to start, then ordered a la carte. We tried the Toro cut up roll, which was my favorite thing that we ate, as well as the Spanish mackerel roll, Sockeye salmon roll, King salmon sashimi, Yellowtail - Hamachi sashimi, Eel - Anago sashimi, Octopus sashimi, Blue fin fatty tuna sashimi and Salmon roe sashimi. 

The one letdown for me was that the rice seemed kind of dry in the rolls, hence my giving this spot less than 5 stars. The fish was amazing, though."
5,"Would give this 4.5 stars if I could for outstanding sushi takeout! Our friends picked up food for us and drove it 2 hours. Yasuda was great about packing it and putting in an ice pack so it would stay fresh, and it did. The sushi traveled much better than the sashimi, but all of it was delightful. The miso soup was also so much better than most miso soup you get at a restaurant. If only we were within the delivery range, we&apos;d be eating Yasuda every week!"
5,"Okay so I ordered Togo.

First of all, wow! 

Oshitashi boiled spinach with shaved dried bonito so good 

Hijiki you have to order this

Nasu inakani soy simmered Japanese eggplant DELICIOUS 

Sushi and sahimi combo yum 

I&apos;ll be back baby"
3,"Used to eat at Yasuda when Chef Yasuda was still behind the counter. Had not returned since he left. Decided to give their take out a try today and, while I don&apos;t have any major complaints, I don&apos;t think I will return. I ordered the Sushi Toku and Omakase 12 for pickup. Both were packed nicely and everything needed was included in the carry out bag (even 2 green tea sachets). There was a noticeable difference in quality of the fish in the Omakase as opposed to the Toku. Given the price difference it was not surprising but just bear in mind. The Sushi Toku was akin to what I would expect from a quality sushi restaurant but maybe not what I would want from a place like Yasuda. Still everything was acceptable. The Omakase was &quot;good&quot;. Interesting choices of fish and the rice was nice and firm (although maybe a bit too much rice for each piece). Neither myself or my SO were really wowed by anything. I assume a different experience when dining in restaurant (as I remember always having a great experience) but I don&apos;t think I will go out of my way to find out."
3,"3.5/5
Spontaneously decided I needed a treat-myself meal and booked a last minute reservation for a Wednesday night here. Service was pleasant and very professional. Took my coat, pulled out my seat, very classic Michelin style treatment. The omakase was charged by the piece. I was seated at the bar and had each piece of fish introduced to me which I appreciated.

My meal consisted of the following:
1) Namasu (Seaweed, Cucumber, Vinegar): Just a simple clean rice vinegar taste. A bit sweet and a nice palette cleanser.
2) Sashimi
-Branzino: Soft on the tongue. A very neutral tasting whitefish
-Akami: Flavorful piece of tuna, fairly soft and tender for lean
-Fatty Tuna: Fatty, smooth, but very light texturally
3) Sashimi 2
-King Salmon: Nice clean meaty bite
-Jack Mackerel: The oily flavor really hit in the back
4) Kinmedai Nigiri: The rice went dull so fast taste wise. Texturally it was tough on the outside but mushy on the inside and it had a grainy texture. Fish itself had the perfect amount of salt and acid. Just enough to make it pop.
5) Yellowtail Toro: Really dull. Really wanted something to cut through the fat cause it had a very flat taste
6) Hamaguri (Cherrystone Clam): A bit heavy on the salt but a nice briney taste toward the back of the palate. Really smooth, light, firm texture.
7) Toro Nigiri: A really fluffy fatty piece
8) Anago (Sea Eel): Delightfully sweet and smoky. A really thick stack. More of a mealy texture than smooth. Would&apos;ve liked it served a bit warmer.
9) Kohada: Cured with a nice pickled flavor but a bit on the salty side for me. The skin was also rather tough.
10) White King Salmon: Another fluffy fatty bite but much lighter on the tongue.
11) Uni Tasting
-Maine Uni: Like a cold breath of air with a bit of stink in the back
-Hokkaido Uni: More liquid-y texture but more sweet. The wasabi taste stood out more
12) Seared Sea Perch: The sear gave it almost a nutty taste
13) Ikura: Excellent nori that stayed nice and crispy. It practically melted in my mouth. Ikura itself had nice firm pops. In terms of the marinade it&apos;s on the more plain salty side but the nori&apos;s sweetness balances it out.
14) Seared Toro: Rich piece of fish and the torching brought out another dimension of the fat.

Overall, it&apos;s good high end sushi. But I didn&apos;t really come out feeling like I had a very fulfilling omakase experience. The bill totalled to $179 before tip and honestly I&apos;ve had equally good experiences at half the price. The fish quality is marginally better but flavorwise and even selection-wise, Sushi Yasuda was nothing special. I&apos;m glad I got to try it once but there are other omakases I would rather pay for."
4,"I went to Sushi Yasuda with a few friends after work and had a great dinner, with the caveat that this is definitely not my favorite sushi place in the city. 

Although the fish was extremely fresh and the location was very clean/upscale, I found the sushi a little boring. If you&apos;re looking for very simple sushi, then Sushi Yasuda is the place to go for high quality sushi. However, if you&apos;re like me and like something a little more complex I recommend Sushi of Gari where each piece of fish is topped with something unusual, like tomato or mushrooms, or Sugarfish, where the fish is buttery and topped with a simple sauce. That being said, I can only comment on the sushi combination I ordered, as I have not tried other items on the menu yet.

The service was nice and the decor clean and simple. I may have to try it again and order something different because we saw Martha Stewart while we there, and if she likes it, then I should probably like it more too."
5,"For me, the highlight of a dining experience and what makes it so special is the ability to trust the Chef and be served a delicious meal based on the concept of surprise, which is what omakase is and I LOVE OMAKASE. For those of you who are not familiar, Omakase (Japanese: お任せ, Hepburn: o-makase) is a Japanese phrase that means &quot;I&apos;ll leave it up to you&quot; (from Japanese &quot;to entrust&quot; (任せる, makaseru)).

Sushi Yasuda is one of my top recommendations for omakase and a high-quality sushi dining experience in New York City that will leave you very happy

I love the simple layout and design of the restaurant that doesn&apos;t take your attention away from the amazing pieces of sushi laid out in front of you. Every piece is spectacular. The fish is fresh but the sushi rice is really the star because that is the base for the sushi, much like flour is the base for pasta or bread. It is made with the perfect ratio of rice, vinegar, salt, and sugar. Who knows? Maybe there is another secret ingredient they use. 

If you are ready to have one of the best Omakase experiences of your life and ready to throw down some money cuz this ain&apos;t cheap, then you won&apos;t be disappointed. 

Note: Lighting is on the brighter side so don&apos;t expect this to be your spot for an intimate evening. 

ありがとうございました
Arigatōgozaimashita!"
4,"If you know NYC sushi, you know Yasuda. It&apos;s synonymous with high quality, fresh, top-end sushi. What you may not know is they have an incredible lunch special too. Soup or salad + 2 rolls + 5 pieces for what I believe was $23 or so. 

As always, the fish was incredibly fresh. The sushi chefs here take their craft very seriously. The service is always good and the restaurant itself is clean and modern.

Always a pleasure to eat here and would highly recommend!"
5,"So I am obsessed with Omakase and decided to try two of the most popular restaurants back to back while I was in New York. I had lunch at Yasuda one day and lunch at Nakazawa the next. The verdict? Yasuda&apos;s omakase was by far the better experience.   So Yasuda had a bit more of a casual atmosphere than Nakazawa (since there are plenty of people at the tables and not just all bar seating). I did the omakase so I sat at the bar. The pieces are pricy but I figured I would probably not spend too much... WRONG. The chef kept giving me pieces and I was able to keep eating the pieces and next thing you know, I have devoured some 20+ pieces of sushi with a bill that came out to be 270 ish... whoops.

In terms of the sushi, Yasuda has some of the freshest fish I have ever had. Every piece was deliciously fresh and I ended up liking pieces I don&apos;t normally like. For example, I am normally not a fan of Santa Barbra uni but yasuda has the best Santa Barbra uni I have ever had in my life. I also really liked that Yasuda had a ton of seafood that you do not regularly see (lots of clams, etc). It was a breath of fresh air compared to the same fishes everyone serves at every omakase place. The toro was also so amazing... even the lean toro tasted like a decadent treat. 

Yasuda&apos;s style is very traditional whereas, normally, I like somewhere in the middle of traditional and not. However, the style works so well with Yasuda because their fish quality is so high you really do not need additional condiments or finishing touches. Just let the fish speak for itself! I would highly recommend this place but please be mindful of your wallet!!"
5,"Because of CV19, I suggest ordering the day before sure the restaurant has everything you want. The person who answered the phone was very cordial and explained the different sushi options to me. Everything was packed very nicely as if you were dining in. There was tea packets, plenty of soy sauce, chopsticks and napkins. The fish was fresh. The sushi rice was cooked perfectly. To my surprise, the uni roll was my favorite. If I&apos;d change anything, it&apos;d be skipping the cod. It lacked flavor. And smelled kinda fishy. The sushi is a must. Come check them out. Won&apos;t disappoint."
5,"Was very happy about the take out Omakase order. The selection of sushi was great. They were put in the container with the color order as well. Fresh, good looking and yummy. The seaweed appetizer was very good too - was able to try out a variety of seaweed , as a huge wakame/seaweed lover!"
5,"Food
This is my favourite restaurant in Manhattan. I have been here three times, and have ordered Omakase twice. Every time I come here, I can rest assured that I will be satisfied. Many high end sushi restaurants are able to get the fish right, but the rice would always be a drawback. Not here. When you put the nigiri in your mouth, the rice complements the fish, and the bite is full of flavour and joy. I also highly recommend the fried live soft shell crab, soft moist white crab meat covered by golden crispy fried shell. What a master piece.

Everything else
The bamboo based decor is very soothing and upscale. During COVID, they have both indoor and outdoor seating with 25% capacity. The main waiter alway is in a rush, making him seem rude sometimes."
5,"This is my favorite place for omakase and sushi when you want to treat yoself. The quality of their fish is top tier and every fish is so incredible and fresh. My boyfriend and I shared a bottle of sake and got omakase(mp). The fish is super fresh and the sushi rice complements the fish so well. My boyfriend hasn&apos;t stopped raving about the sushi rice since our visit.   The nogoduro( spelling?) white fish was one of the highlights. It was slightly cooked, warm and soft. It was my first time trying this and being completely blown away. I haven&apos;t attached all the pictures of the sushi pieces but it doesn&apos;t do the experience any justice anyway. the ambience is soothing and calming. Beautiful but simple/clean interior decor. Definitely a must try!!!"
5,"After doing an informal survey of my NY sushi loving friends (Most notably my Sushi Sensei Ben L and Queens CM Jando) Sushi Yasuda has consistently made the list as one of the top, most traditional omakase experiences in NYC. 

After experiencing it for myself I can see why. I love the space - light bamboo wood, and open airy environment where you aren&apos;t packed together like cattle (often so rare in NYC). The service and the sushi is impeccable. I felt like a rock star and this was perhaps the best dining experience of my life. Here are some notable moments:

Drinking tea with my sushi I loved how they literally would change the cup with fresh tea - throughout the course of my meal I was probably given 8 fresh cups of tea before finishing the removed one.

Oyster was lightly grilled adding a complimentary smokiness to the juicy tender oyster that made it kinda mind blowing. So good!

At first puzzled at a nigiri piece with only julienne scallion on top it made sense when followed by a piece of yellow-tail recreating the popular sushi combination. The scallion flavor remained in my mouth after eating to compliment the yellow-tail perfectly.

Sawani, fresh white Sea Eel is the best piece of eel I have tried although the taste and texture is different than unagi you still know you are having an amazing piece of eel. 

Ikura was so creamy and rich with incredible texture to the eggs. Again, never had better elsewhere.

I am happy to had sashimi as part of my first time omakase experience here since it allowed me to try so many different pieces, but I would do only sushi when I return.

I found it relatively easy to make an online reservation (RESY is the service they use). They charge $50 if you cancel at the last minute (within a certain number of hours of reservation time). I love you don&apos;t need to calculate tip - it is all included everyone receives the same amazing attentive service. Truly no need to think about much - just come here and allow Sushi Yasuda to give you an experience you will not soon forget."
4,"Came here for my birthday. The food is phenomenal and the service is amazing. The chefs pays attention not only to food but he also noticed the tea cup is too hot and gave us a tower to cover. STRONGLY RECOMMEND!!! Originally we wanted to order 15 Pieces and we asked the chef if it was enough for us, he kindly told us to try the 12 pieces and if we want we can always add more, it turns out he was right 12 is enough for us (girl). Overall experience is wonderful."
3,"TLDR: High-end sushi restaurant in Midtown East. Expect high quality nigiri with a lot of the corporate card crowd. If you&apos;re looking for a fancy sushi meal, this will fit the bill but if it&apos;s a more intimate omakase - there are probably better options.

So I may be slightly biased because the first time I was able to try Yasuda, it was at Naomichi Yasuda&apos;s restaurant in Tokyo; with Yasuda himself. The restaurant is very minimalist and quite spacious. Took my brother here for his birthday.

My first thoughts were that it felt very institutional, which by this point in time - I guess they are. There is no set menu here, you pay piece by piece.

We sat at the bar and while the pieces were good, it was at a faster pace than I&apos;d have liked. The chef was serving nigiri in 2 pieces per order, typically similar fish but slightly different. For example, lean tuna and medium fatty tuna, etc. I personally felt like this took away from the overall experience. I didn&apos;t feel like I was having an experience with the chef, it felt like I was just eating at an expensive sushi restaurant. Total cost with tax, one soft drink was just shy of $500.

I don&apos;t regret having gone but probably wouldn&apos;t come back. Maybe to try one of their lunch specials. For myself personally, I like an omakase where I can appreciate each piece - know more about what I&apos;m eating from the chef. If you have the money to spend and just want high-end sushi, this will be a perfect fit."
