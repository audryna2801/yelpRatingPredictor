5,"I am so glad that they deliver during this pandemic and the quality remains the same.  Because it is dead of winter and is really cold, I felt like having soup!  So I thought of MOMOSAN where I can have a hearty soup! 

I added more meat which I probably did nit have to.  Fortunately I am home and I could have the rest for lunch.  

The soft shell crab bun was also delicious! I have never had it this way before.  It is quite good.  I chose it to be my appetizer for the meal set with my ramen soup.

I microwaved it a little bit without the egg so I do not over cook the perfectly soy marinated soft boiled egg.  Delicious!  What can I say.  

Good winter food!"
5,"Knowing that this is one of Iron Chef Morimoto&apos;s restaurants, I knew that I would not be disappointed and I certainly wasn&apos;t. My friend and I came for dinner one night around 7:00 and were seated inside immediately. Their COVID19 precautions are great and we felt safe while dining inside. We both opted to get the combo which came with our choice of app and a ramen. I chose the soft shell bao and tantan ramen and my friend chose the gyoza and chicken ramen. When I tell you everything was perfect and spot on, it is entirely true. The tantan broth was so deliciously creamy with hints of coconut and perfect amount of spice! To top it off, I live only one block away so I will be back in person or for take out very soon. This is a must go to in my book!"
5,This was the best experience I&apos;ve had with takeaway ramen. The Tonkotsu was absolutely delicious. It heated up so well and oh my goodness the kakuni bao app just melts in your mouth! Overall very impressed and cannot wait to try more from this spot!
3,"This is a decent ramen shop with good variety, meal sets, which stands out more so for its sake selections. The ramen is good, but largely lacks in flavor. The tonkotsu just doesn&apos;t have the same level of richness that I like, so it leaves me wanting at the end. The tan tan ramen is verrrry rich and creamy, with big sesame flavor. It is a bit hard to finish though because of how rich it is (think drinking sesame broth with the texture of coconut milk). It&apos;s pretty delicious though!! 

I would go here first for sake, and maybe order from the menu if I was hungry. I would not necessarily go here for ramen for my first choice as there are other options close by that I prefer."
4,"The TanTan ramen has been my first fully enjoyable bowl of ramen in Manhattan.
Yes, my first FULLY ENJOYABLE bowl.  

It better be right at this price!
The bowl was a touch smaller as the portion is a touch less than what you typically find at cheaper spots but the quality of ingredients is definitely better.   You don&apos;t have any feelings of doubt with Momosan which is a breath of fresh air especially during the plague put on (or put out by) restaurants during this pandemic.

I loved the packaging of my Grubhubbed ramen! It was in three bowls, the noodZ then another inserted bowl with all the wonderful toppings, and a third separate container for the creamy and delicious broth.   For about $24 you can get the ramen and an app.... that being said, I would have still appreciated the buns to have some pickled veg in addition to the single slab of delicious pork belly, and I&apos;d like a few more noodles to fill me up. (You can pay $2.50 extra for those)"
4,"I came here a while back looking for some warm ramen on a cold day. While the ramen was decent and this is a ramen place, I can&apos;t say that&apos;s the highlight. My friends and I had some of the best appetizers that we wish were full entrees. The ramen itself was a little plain for my taste maybe based on the option I chose. However the soft shell crab appetizer was AMAZING. The portion size was also relatively large for an app. My friend got the ribs I believe which according to her were incredible. 

Personally I like this place a lot for their appetizers. I wouldn&apos;t necessarily come here for ramen."
5,"Overall (4.75/5): My favorite ramen spot. If you need ramen look no further.

4,"8.5/10

Tan-tan ramen: broth was very thick, perhaps a tad too thick, but had a very potent sesame flavor; ground pork and sliced pork added some nice meat flavor to the dish; cilantro also was a good addition, but one of the vegetables was sliced a bit too large, so that was a slight negative; noodles were good, held the thick broth really well; egg is nice; nice amount of spiciness, although could be just slightly spicier; overall, very good bowl of ramen, a bit too thick, but very good flavor"
4,"While the takeout options simply don&apos;t match a hot bowl of ramen during dine in season, Momosan is still an excellent spot for ramen in the city. I appreciate the good packaging for takeout: separation of noodles, soups, and toppings. Unfortunately, the noodles do clump, but nothing that can&apos;t be fixed by reheating 

Standouts: tsukemen combo set with karaage. Karaage is on the saltier side but generously seasoned."
5,"This is an amazing place for a bowl of ramen and bao. The staff is very friendly and efficient. They do not take any reservations and this place fills out pretty fast. We were lucky to get in quickly and were seated at the bar. The server was wonderful with her sake suggestions!
A worth visit!"
5,"It&apos;s always been my dream to come here, not only because it&apos;s a ramen restaurant, but because it&apos;s an iron-chef owned and worthy restaurant. 

I came here for a date night on a Saturday evening and luckily we were able to get seats at the bar around 5-6PM. I really liked the ambiance and atmosphere, probably one of the most chic ramen shops I been to. 

We ordered the following:

House Roasted Duck Tacos - house roasted duck, cucumber, hoisin, apricot, sweet chili sauce, with crispy gyoza skin. I love the display and style of how the house roasted duck tacos were presented. It was clean, crisp, and beautiful. The roasted duck tacos reminded me of having it in the bun with cucumbers and hoisin sauce. I enjoyed this appetizer very much, tasty and crispy!

Roasted Duck Caesar Salad - house roasted duck, spring greens, kale, edamame, radish, Momosan Caesar dressing. This was a delightful roasted duck salad, simple, and rustic. 

Tan Tan Ramen - spicy coconut curry, pork chashu, red miso, ground pork, aji-lama, cilantro. My date at the time ordered this, looked really hearty and tasty. 

Tonkotsu Ramen - pork chashu, aji-lama, takona, kikurage, scallion, toasted nori, garlic oil, soy tare. 90% of the time I go to a ramen restaurant, I often get the Tonkotsu Ramen. I enjoyed the broth here, full of flavor and delicious.

Overall, the experience was great. Our waiter was super friendly and helpful, he even offered us his Instagram for us to follow him. I definitely would like to come back and experience the different food that&apos;s offered here."
5,"Was in the area had just finished watching a movie, came here on a packed night and sat at the bar and had no idea what we were in for. 
We began with an order of the Sticky ribs. Didn&apos;t care to order them but my girl did, and damn I&apos;m glad she did! The meat falls right off the bone, so perfectly fried, not too much fat. Absolutely delicious little appetizer.

Then we ordered the Ramen, my lady ordered the New Tokyo Chicken very good nice tasting noodles the broth was a bit lighter in substance than what I got which was the tonkotsu Pork Ramen. Just like the ribs earlier, the pork was perfectly cooked, no fat which is a huge plus to me. The broth is absolutely delicious! Definitely became my favorite ramen dish, the taste so so unsuspectingly good.

After our meal, is when I realized this resturant is by the world famous Iron Chef Marimoto, used to love watching him on that show! No surprise this place has such amazing cooking. Definitely became my new favorite ramen shop.

We came again and this time sat at the communal tables, which not too much a fan of, tight space to squeeze into as these tables could get packed, by..its still Momosan Ramen, so you do what you gotta do.

We decided to try the Tetsunabe Pork Gyoza Dumplings,  which were very good comes out on a hot iron skillet. The sauce is perfect for dipping. 

My lady tried the Tonkotsu ramen, which is still my favorite one. This time I went for the Tantan ramen, which is a spicy coconut curry broth, which I could see being too spicy for some people after a while. I didn&apos;t finish the broth like I would their other ramens because my stomach would probably regret it later. 

This place is definitely one of my favorite Ramen spots in the city, or in the U.S. honestly. Perfect tasting ramen, perfect spot for a cold rainy soup night. Appetizers here I&apos;ve had so far are great, no complaints, a nice spot to go on a little date, or a small group of friends. Definitely enough options here to please everyone."
1,I checked if this restaurant had reopened on Yelp and confirmed it was so decided to head there for lunch. I walked and I was basically shooed away by the extremely rude manager who told me they were not open. I told him that it says indoor dining on Yelp (see photo) but he continued to shoo me and tell that most restaurants had not reopened... what city does he live in? Reality check  rude momosan manager. You don&apos;t know the first thing about hospitality. If he was polite and hospitable and smart he would have me leave with to go ramen but he just shooed a customer away. And in this case FOREVER. The ramen is overpriced anyways and it is not authentic ramen if that is what you looking for.
5,"If you see it JUST WALK IN!!! 
My first time ever going was 3 years ago and I have been a huge fan. To the point where I make my friends go just because I know they won&apos;t regret it and they thank me later.  Everything you order here is going to be breathtakingly good. Personally I love their lunch menu which consist of 2 options. Ramen and a side dish. I usually pick the tonkotsu of nearly 100% pork bones that are boiled for twenty plus hours. 
If you go during dinner they have the momosan sets and you can pick a ramen of choice and a appetizer of choice. They have a list of things you can get, the Karaage which is a seasoned friend chicken is AMAZING."
5,Best ramen in NY hands down. Please make it through the pandemic. We miss the indoor dining experience: you&apos;re the best!
5,"Momosan -- where do I start? There&apos;s so many ramen places in the city but I think about you often. Haven&apos;t had it since Pre COVID but I do miss it a lot. I&apos;ve tried the Tonkotsu, TanTan and Curry ramen, all were equally delicious. The key to a good bowl of ramen would be the broth and Momosan, you&apos;ve got it going on. We would get a rice bowl with your meal as well and I love getting the salmon bowl.. so stinking fresh. Love Momosan."
5,"One of the best Ramen in this part of NYC. Very COVID conscious restaurant. Attentive and friendly staff. Esquisite food.

Pro: Sunday lunch was no wait. Excellent Ramen.
Con: none

If you love Ramen or haven&apos;t tried you should experience Momosan!"
5,"Delicious, as always. We went for an early lunch at 11am. Walked in, and the staff was already wearing masks that fully covered nose and mouth. We were the first customers there, and felt safe knowing that they were definitely observing all safety protocols and not half-assing it. I love Momosan! Note that the lunch set menu changed slightly. No problem at all, was happy to try new stuff! Duck tacos were to die for."
2,"Pork gyoza is fine. 
Veggie miso ramen is lack of flavor and soup was watery...  the noodles are overcooked, too soft. will never order it again."
3,"I have been a fan ever since I tried out the instant ramen and wanted to actually try the real deal! 

I met with my friend at 6pm and we were seated at a communal table where shoulders were touching each other. It&apos;s definitely a tight space. 

We ordered the Tonkotsu and the New Tokyo chicken. Tonkotsu was decent, noodles were al dente, pork belly could be better charred. My friend didn&apos;t like hers at all, said it needed more flavoring. Service was friendly but that&apos;s where the points were deducted...I understand it was busy and dinner time but they rushed us THREE times by asking if we were done with the ramen. It left such an unsatisfactory dining experience and I&apos;m so disappointed."
