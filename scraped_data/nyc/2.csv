5,"Loved the service here! Their table is according to COVID rules - 6 feet apart! Food was awesome since we ordered almost everything on the menu!

Corn cheese, u-jja myeon, popcorn chicken, fish ball soup, korean surf n turf stew, truffle fries, tako wasabi, fried brussels sprout, kimchi bacon okonomiyaki, bulgogi burger, grilled octopus"
5,"I went for dinner and drinks two nights in a row. Food is really good, but the portions are small since Anytime is tapas style Korean food. I went with a group of 8, and I felt the tapas style portions were a bit small. It would probably be better if you went with a smaller group, 2-4 people.

The cocktails were really good. Food wise, the creamy ddeokboki and brussel sprouts were my favorite. The army stew is a small portion size, so not the same as what you would usually get in ktown. Going during COVID, the waiters were really nice and gave us some free cheesecake at the end since we had ordered a lot of food. Great for food, drinking soju &amp; cocktails!"
5,"We ordered some food for delivery one night for four people. Overall food quality is very good. However i don&apos;t like the popcorn fried chicken, which was one of their signature. We also had pancake, stir fried squid, fried pork with kimchi and tofu. All of these tasted super good. This is the first time for us to try this restaurant. I noticed they have very nice indoor decorations. Would love to visit and dine in once everything gets better"
5,"Tables were 6 feet apart and I felt safe eating here 

Surf n turf stew - 10/10 incredibly filling and comfort food, soothing to the soul, amazing for a cold winter day

kimchi bacon okonomiyaki - 6/10 interesting flavor and very unique, kind of mushy 

corn truffle cheese - 10/10 highly recommend, who doesn&apos;t like cheese fries

popcorn chicken - 10/10 pretty big portions, the gochujiang sauce was really good, worth the price

grilled octopus - 7/10 I don&apos;t normally like octopus (which is why I gave it a 7) But this octopus was pretty tender and their mayo sauce made it taste pretty good 

taco wasabi - 9/10 again I don&apos;t really like octopus but raw and cerviched it was pretty darn good

bulgogi burger - 9/10 according to my friend"
5,"Everything was really delicious! And server was very helpful and nice.
It&apos;s up on 3rd floor. Was quiet and nice. Enough distance between tables. Do give it a try"
5,"Stopped in Anytime for drinks and the jazzy music and so happy we stayed for the food! My boyfriend thoroughly enjoyed the spicy seafood soup, as you can see by his priceless reaction LOL! The Korean Royal Court Stir-Fried Rice Cake was very hearty and perfect on this winter day. The soy sauce broth went well with the rice cakes and sweet potato noodles! The spicy soy garlic wings and bulgogi were also good (though we should&apos;ve ordered rice to go with it). And can&apos;t have Korean food without some soju! Try the apple and peach flavors! Awesome customer service and we appreciated the manager checking in on us to see if we were enjoying the food. We will definitely be back - maybe to try the popcorn chicken that so many have raved about!"
5,"A friend took me here recently for drinks and food. Hidden beneath a karaoke spot on the 3rd floor this place stands out with their bar like menu of unique spins on Korean dishes. They have powerful cocktails in a bag- Capri sun style. Great happy hour special on soju! Excellent service our waiter Shane was a delight! Very helpful with the menu and friendly! The popcorn chicken stands out as an appetizer that could suffice as a meal. Definitely will be going back, the food snd service here is excellent!"
3,"I only ordered the spicy soy fried chicken and okonomiyaki

Was not a huge fan of the taste; could not feel any spiciness or heat from the wings

Okonomiyaki was not very flavorful in the right ways and had a flaky texture (not talking about the topping, but the actual consistency of the pancake)

So their other items may be good, but I was personally not a fan of these dishes compared to versions I&apos;ve had elsewhere. Two dishes is not representative of the entire restaurant but I believe for a restaurant to earn 4 stars, everything needs to be good or at least one of the two things I ordered."
5,"The food is high quality, the ambiance is nice, and the waitors are polite. Will be coming back again."
2,"I ordered takeout from here, and it came in the time it said. My family comes from Korea, so I eat Korean food a lot. Their tteokbokki rice cake itself is not terrible, but it tastes strongly of fish. There was only around 10 pieces of rice cake in a container thats around the size of my head. The kimchi fried rice tastes strongly of pork, so if you don&apos;t like pork, don&apos;t get it. They&apos;re pickled radish is dry and tasteless. Highly dissatisfied. Never ordering from here again."
4,"- Came here for happy hour
- 3rd floor
- Loved their cocktail Jelly bear to the sky!! Once the cotton candy dissolves, the drink turns purple
- We got the tuna bite (small), pork belly (small), beef tartare, and popcorn chicken (huge portion)
- Tapas style restaurant
- They have a slide show of their dishes displayed on a TV
- Good date spot
- Incredibly friendly staff
- I&apos;d go back to try their other dishes"
5,"Great food, service, and staff! Would highly recommend for anyone looking for casual eats!"
5,"Such an amazing time at Anytime with delicious food, drinks and great customer service from Shane!!I will be back with my friends it&apos;s so clean and feels so covid safe!"
4,"My boyfriend and I came here on Valentine&apos;s Day because we wanted a cute casual place. Right in the heart of K-Town it was a nice date spot. We ordered the soju (so good) and one of the &apos;think&apos; drinks - we got the cucumber because she told us it was the least sweet (true, it was really strong!) the food was great.

Definitely recommend the popcorn chicken, Brussel sprouts - we were full after those 2 dishes!! Flavors were so on point.
The Korean surf n&apos; turf was amazing too - the broth was delicious and very light which I love, and the flavors were fresh. 
We also tried the Hamachi Ceviche - it was good I&apos;ve definitely had better."
4,"Anytime has been popping up in a bunch of Yelp collections, and I noticed it was rapidly gaining positive reviews in a short amount of time, so I decided to check it out. Easily made a reservation for a weekday for a friend and I. 

We shared the hamachi ceviche, popcorn chicken and dark night kimchi pancake. The ceviche and chicken were the standouts - I&apos;d definitely get those dishes again. 

The restaurant itself is an intimate, lowkey spot - not massive/hectic like many of the BBQ places on this stretch (which I also love, but it&apos;s nice to change it up). I&apos;d return!"
5,"This place is so cute. Tables are small, but the atmosphere is great. Location is right next to karaoke! The food was wonderful. The popcorn chicken was beautifully flavored. My anytime burger was great and packed. 

I got a drink inside of a light bulb and it actually lit up. It&apos;s a fun place. Portions are very filling. I didn&apos;t get that much but I still couldn&apos;t finish it."
4,"Cuisine: 7
Service: 8
Decor: 7
Value: 7
Overall: 7

Great place for a few shots of soju and a bunch of tapa style Korean dishes to wash it all down with.

Hamachi Ceviche - Excellent flavors with a crunch
Bossom - Not as good as last time, but still very good
Shot Rib - Love the crispy edge and sauce, 
Soup - Fantastic broth consisting of pork &amp; seafood
Pancake - Good but nothing special. Needs crisp.
Grilled Avocado - Yummy mixed with egg and sauce.
Steak Tartar - Really good, nice touch of sweetness
Chicken Gizzards - Not bad but need more gizzards.

Good place to hang out afterwork or before a night of partying in K-town."
5,"Loved the service here and the fact that they actually keep the tables distanced during COVID. Food was also good, we got the chicken wings, corn cheese, and army stew, all of which did not disappoint!"
5,"Stopped by for happy hour and a light dinner with a friend. What&apos;s nice is their happy hour goes until 8pm. Whoo! Anytime is located on the 3rd floor, so make your way up (there is an elevator if you so need one). The space isn&apos;t huge, but it doesn&apos;t really need to be.

The staff are nice and the service is fairly quick. The decor is all in black, but not the slick and shiny pretentious vibe. It&apos;s comfortable and really more like a trendy bar. They do have a kitchy item, which is their cocktails served in a light bulb (I didn&apos;t try one of these).

Their food was fantastic and some of the items (or maybe most were Korean with a twist - it works though). The portion sizes seem small, but their actually perfect. And even though they are smaller, they&apos;re great for sharing or for one.

What we got:
Soju - it&apos;s like all the other soju and priced comparably to other bars, a decent amount of flavor options as well
Beer - it was Coors Light, nothing special, but cheap and beer
Popcorn Chicken (HH special) - Korean fried popcorn chicken, sauced and delicious and crispy (not super crispy, but delicious)
Ttebokki - it&apos;s definitely not like your traditional Ttebokki, the rice cakes were more like gnocchi (amazing!) and the sauce was okay, but got better and had a little bit of a kick the more you ate it. It was served with heavy cream and freshly grated grano padano (yes, we&apos;re being fancy, but so good). seems like a small portion, but there&apos;s actually more than there appears.

TLDR: totally worth check out, especially during happy hour. Their popcorn chicken is delicious and such a great deal during happy hour. I&apos;d say get the ttebokki (especially if you like gnocchi - soft light pillows of rice cake)"
4,"I walked in here pretty easily on a Saturday night for dinner with 4 other friends and had a wonderful time. The restaurant is super casual and a fun gathering spot with friends in the heart of K-Town.  We put our names on the Yelp waitlist and got off it much faster than the initial quoted time. 

The food is meant to be enjoyed family-style. Everything we tried was delicious. A lot of the dishes were traditional Korean dishes with a fusion twist added to it. We tried the uni poke, stir-fried seafood, brussel sprouts, corn cheese, eggplant, pork belly, ddukboki, fried chicken, and stew. We had to order 2 of each dish for some of the items in order to feed 5 people. The food was overall excellent and the service was amazing!

Anytime is arguably most famous for their lightbulb cocktails that light up. They&apos;re super sugary, and I didn&apos;t really taste that much alcohol, but they were super fun nonetheless. 

Definitely worth checking out with friends for dinner or for late-night food."
