5,"TLDR: Jongro is one of my favorite places in NYC for KBBQ and their careful Covid preventative practices make you feel safe to eat out.

Whenever I come I typically get one of the large beef or pork platters. Either way, you&apos;re going to enjoy some good quality cuts of meat. I think what separates jongro from all of the other kbbq places in ktown is the quality of their meat - just go and you&apos;ll be able to tell. Besides the pajeon, I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve had anything else but the kbbq set menus but that&apos;s enough for me to continue being a repeating customer for the last few years. If you like kbbq, give this place a shot!

Once you arrive in the building, your temperature will be taken. The tables are all seated within a safe, social distance away, and all the staff are wearing masks. 

Covid has not affected their service at all. Just like many other Korean establishments, service is of quality."
5,"Jongro is open again for indoor dining! The food and experience was just as I remembered, delicious cuts of meat that the servers cook for you, with lots of tasty side dishes (and unlimited kimchi). We got the beef platter and a large kimchi soup. The drinks were also tasty and of course could not dine there without taking some soju shots!

Highly recommend for anyone with a craving for fresh grilled beef/pork cuts and a large appetite."
5,"Delicious, great service, covid precautions inside and outside! This place doesn&apos;t have many options for bbq veggies but they do have a lot of options for ordering veggie dishes to supplement. They also have a menu that is food sensitive with labels for gluten free and vegetarian. It is pricey but you get a lot of food to share. Our eyes were bigger than our stomachs... we ordered enough food for 4 people and the bill was $210 pre-tip. But this included multiple cocktails, a beef combo set, bbq shrimp, bbq mushrooms, and a kimchi pancake! 

This place is best for table bbq. You can only get the bbq combo sets if you eat inside. But they sit people 6 ft away from each other, looks like more distance actually... and they have multiple floors in this elevator building. They do contract tracing. And they also offer outdoor dining if you&apos;d like more air flow! But they have the outdoor tents really nicely heated and great for keeping you dry under rainy skies...

The food was fresh, authentic flavors, and efficient service. While large groups are seated here, it&apos;s probably kinder to limit your party to 5 people or less out of respect for the wait staff servicing you. That&apos;s right i&apos;m speaking to you finance bros fist bump&apos;n at the table across from us! And also you are not in high school any more so stop talking about catholic school girls... you are old enough to be fathers! ;)"
3,"Food: 3/5
Ordered saeng kalbi for dinner. The kalbi itself was good. The quality was fresh and it was perfectly grilled but I&apos;m rating this place 3/5 because of everything else. I&apos;m used to having more banchan and a jigae with my order but this place doesn&apos;t offer a side of jigae or much banchan in general. Is it just me? Isn&apos;t banchan a staple for Korean dinners? They did offer a steamed egg dish though..

Service: 4/5
The lady who cooked our bbq was very sweet and accommodating. Thank you so much :)

Ambiance: 4/5
Slightly nicer than your average kbbq spot. A bit more dim with a modern flare. A bit more intimate too. Spaces are spread apart and have a personalized feel."
4,"Love Jongro for BBQ in k town! My go-to spot when I&apos;m not sure where to go. Even if they have a wait, it always moves fast because they have such a large space inside. Tables are properly distanced for COVID. Their service is super fast and helpful and food is always delicious! Highly recommend!

4,"Really great food and dining experience! Ordered the Marinated Kalbi, Pork Belly, and Beef Brisket, although I enjoyed the Marinated Kalbi the most and didn&apos;t like the Beef Brisket as much. Since we dined outside, the meat was cooked for us which was done really well. The side dishes weren&apos;t that great as I would&apos;ve appreciated more variety. Service was prompt and the outdoor dining was really comfortable, so I really enjoyed my experience here."
5,I stumbled upon this Korean barbecue restaurant and I&apos;m so glad because now it&apos;s one of my favorite restaurants to go to Korean barbecue food. Even though the restaurant does not have many options on their menu it&apos;s pretty basic do you get different meats but the amount of food you get is crazy. The margaritas are really big and so good I highly recommend coming here if you wanna have a lot of food and get buzzed.
5,"Exquisite stuff. I&apos;m a spoiled SOB for complaining in my last review but we&apos;ve been here 4x since and nothing compares.

Brisky so juicy your heart sinks in despair when you eat the last piece. Love u forever jongrocito"
4,"Came in with a friend last night! I&apos;ve never tried Korean bbq, so this was a new experience for me! Sadly because of covid, you can&apos;t have the whole experience and cook it yourself. Regardless, we had a tasty meal! We ordered the bulgogi beef and split it. We also ordered rice. The bulgogi beef came with all the traditional sides as well! The beef was delicious! They also put glass noodles in it which were amazing! The kimchi was yummy and not overly spicy! The sticky rice was a great complement! 

The outdoor seating is pretty solid. They don&apos;t have heaters at every table, but we were pretty warm until the end of our meal and started getting chilly. The seating is enclosed in a tent. Overall not bad though."
5,"A+++++

I&apos;ve been craving Korean BBQ for some time now and couldn&apos;t be happier to soothe my craving at Jongro. 

Overall, affordable, QUALITY food for everyone (even vegetarians)! We got:

- spicy rice cake (so much yes)
- kimchi pancake
- Kimchi stew
- pork belly
- cow tongue 

EVERYTHING is so so so good and make sure you get the rice to accompany your food. 

Also, all the drinks. Just try them all!"
4,"Went: 2/9/2021
The food was delicious we ate everything. The price for the meat was a little high but it was really good! My only concern was that because we were outdoor there weren&apos;t any heaters for the customers, there was one but not really doing much, you only feel it if your walking by. But if won&apos;t be cold forever! 

Food: 5/5
Price: 3.8/5 
Warmth: 2/5 
Ambience: 4/5"
4,"COVID update:
Very friendly staff! Very tentative with cooking the meat and refills. The meats and food in general here are of good quality - that comes at a price (pun intended lol) though. I would love to come here more often but I probably would need to walk home afterwards since I won&apos;t have money left to pay for the subway fares.
Pre-COVID there is always a very long wait."
5,"It is good to see K-town alive and bustling. I liked how they closed the street. Jongro BBQ had a good set up with the tent. They had their signature old kpop playing on the speaker.

The food was still great, we miss cooking the bbq ourselves... The food is slightly more expansive but I understand that the restaurants are all struggling and we are here to support. We hope Jongro will survive this Covid 19."
4,One of my favorite Korean bbq spots in ktown. They have a tent set up with a huge heater making it tolerable in the cold and they have music so it&apos;s a nice mood. The marinated kalbi is my favorite but expensive ($40.99). The meat is always tender and soft. The staff is also very attentive. Overall recommend!
5,"This review is pre-COVID 19.

Smacked in the middle of Koreantown in midtown is an awesome Korean bbq. Great interior and feel of this restaurant. Awesome food. The ingredients are fresh, so you are getting quality top notch meats. Service is great. 

Guarantee you will leave satisfied. The smell of the bbq will make you want to come back for more."
5,"Cutesy greenhouse setup for outdoor dining to put you in a good mood to start off with first. The staff were friendly. Food AMAZING. The marinated kalbi dipped in bean paste had the perfect taste pairing. The dumpling rice cake with short rib noodle soup tasted light at first but as you dig deeper, the flavor presented itself. I guess the soup base sunk so make sure you stir it real good. Overall, super impressed. NYC KBBQ does not disappoint."
4,"*covid-19 outside seating experience*

We went to Jongro around noon on a Sunday and there was no wait at all. The meat is grilled in their kitchen and then brought down to the tables outside. They no longer have the set options, which is a shame because that&apos;s all I used to get. The meats are definitely overpriced at $30-45 dollars per meat choice (1 person portion). 

As for the environment, the tables aren&apos;t super close together and the street is closed off so there are no car. You can use their bathroom, but you have to get a waiter to swipe you in the building and take the elevator to their store."
5,"Outdoor dining is available at jongro! 

Pros: 

Friendly service, food is still delicious and you can use the yelp waitlist feature still. The workers are all wearing masks and provide hand sanitizer. We got the marinated galbi and green tea cold noodle - both delicious. 

Cons: 

The tables are spaced a bit too close together for my comfort- luckily there are 2 tables for 2 that are on the side walk and far away and we were able to sit there. I suggest either coming as a group of 2 and getting those tables or coming in groups of 5-6 to get a whole row of seats to yourself, otherwise you will be just an arms length away from the next table. They are also not serving their combo meat platters so the menu is a little different"
3,"I came here on a week night with a friend for dinner. It wasn&apos;t crowded. My friend did wait for me for 15 minutes as I was running late and she ordered the seafood pancake. She told me the servers were looking at her because she was taking a table while still not ordering anything else. I thought this was rude tbh. I honestly would have tipped less, but my friend actually decided the tip.

Anyways, food was okay. Nothing spectacular to me. We got the kalbe, the seafood pancake, and the spicy rice cakes. She also got a soju cocktail and a bowl of rice which they charge $2 for. The side dishes could have been better. There was an onion side dish that neither of us touched and some others that were ehh. They also didn&apos;t bring out the side dishes until the kalbe was out which I found strange since the seafood pancake was out already. The kalbe was alright. I&apos;m not a big fan of fatty meats or meats honestly but it was fine. Portion size is small. I guess that&apos;s not surprising. 
The seafood pancake was okay. I wouldn&apos;t get this again. The spicy rice cake had lots of excess sauce. I only ordered this because I have made this personally, and I like eating this. 

Covid wise- it was outside dining. It was warm relatively and there was hand sanitizer on the table already. We were closer to the entrance which was good.

Food and service were fine. However, I feel like they are other restaurants in ktown that are better."
5,I&apos;m happy that they have the indoor dining back again! One of my favorite restaurant in K-Town! 100% would recommend this place
