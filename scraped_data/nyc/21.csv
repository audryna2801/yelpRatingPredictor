5,"I love Vezzos...their ravioli, their pizzas, and their salads are some of my favorites. I enjoy dining and most often, doing pick up. Unfortunately they recently had a fire and I hope to be back in soon. I wish them good luck! Their pizza is AWESOME. Definitely try their raviolis too. The sauce they&apos;re in is delicious"
5,"I&apos;ve heard great things about this restaurant, and I&apos;m glad to say that all the expectations were met! This pizza place specializes in thin crust pizza (REALLY THIN CRUST). I was actually shocked how this pizza was able to support itself with such a thin crust. The ingredients are super fresh. We elected for a medium spicy sauce, which added a kick to it. The cheese used was extremely high quality, but I do wish they used a bit more on the pizza. What I also liked was the fresh tomatoes that they put on top. The outdoor seating was great (was in the shade)."
5,"THIS PIZZA IS AMAZING. I&apos;ve pizza toured NYC hitting all the popular spots but this has definitely made my top five. Crust is crispy and thin (obviously you have to like thin crust to consider this place), sauce:cheese ratio is perfect, and icing on the cake is you can build your own personal pizza if you&apos;re with someone who doesn&apos;t like the same toppings. You can even split toppings down the middle. There&apos;s a happy hour until 6:30 which is also great. I&apos;d definitely order from them in this current situation if they&apos;re accepting take out and visit again to try different types of pizza. I appreciate the kind staff as well."
5,"Love vezzo. Specifically love how paper thin the crust is, I don&apos;t feel like I ate too much or indulged in an unhealthy meal while still enjoying pizza. Whole wheat crust option is the best!"
3,"Needed a quick bite and wasn&apos;t sure at first if they serve individual slices. To my surprise they do! They have a bunch of lunch specials where you can get a slice or 2 with a salad. They are all at different price points depending on what you get.  I got one slice with a small house salad for $7.  It does also come with a small bottle of water. Not bad but the slice is tiny. If you are hungry this deal won&apos;t work for you. This is thin crust pizza so one slice won&apos;t leave you feeling bloated.
The pizza is good but didn&apos;t blow me away. It was kind of oily but did the job. 

I sat in the window and enjoyed my meal. It is quiet in here so nice spot. They also have a dining room for bigger groups. Solid spot but not a pizza I would go out of my way for."
4,"Solely because my co workers enjoyed their food did I give it 4 stars. I was teetering on 3 because I had the lunch special personal pizza and salad and was not at all impressed. It was a house salad and I said hey I&apos;ll just trust them with whatever dressing they thought complimented it. Salad was meehhhh and the dressing a strong no. One of my co workers had a pizza that had shrimp on it. The other had a chicken parm sandwich and the other a salad which they all said was good. 

I had an Arnold Palmer which tasted like sour mix - my co worker who also ordered that agreed.

I am a new Yorker through and through and pizza is very important to me. From the crust to the sauce and the cheese. It all matters. This was sub par unfortunately for me. There was little to no sauce . The texture was like cheese on thin cardboard. 

I really hate when I don&apos;t have a great food experience so I want to go back to maybe try a sandwich and hopefully my taste buds will have a better experience. However, I&apos;m not rushing to do so."
5,Fabulous experience here. Very socially distant friendly with tons of space outside. The wait was about 35 minutes on a Friday night but so worth it. The food was incredible. The pizza crust is thin so you can probably eat a lot of it. The pasta had the perfect amount of garlic. We&apos;ll definitely be back!
5,Best pizza spot in Murray hill along with Norma! Just ordered the shroomtown and pineapple pizza. Got the gorgonzola sauce and lemon basil sauce for dipping and they were both delicious. It also came so quick- in about 20 minutes. Pizza is on delicious thin crust and each ingredient is delightful!
4,My daughter is self quarantined in a small( tiny?) apartment in NYC. Just her and the cat. She is thankfully able to work remotely but I knew she was tired of soup and beans and pasta so I researched pizza places near her. Vezzo was just the place. I did a no contact order and you can track them online.I was able to do the entire transaction via credit card including tip. I did have to make sure she had clothes on!! Lol. It was a surprise to her and she loved it. She loves thin and crispy crust and this hit the mark. She shared with the doorman ( using strict social distancing) because he keeps her safe and monitors her comings and goings. The pizza was delivered hot and fresh. She loved the mushroom side the most. So thanks Vezzo for helping me make my girls day a little brighter!
4,"When in NYC the priority is pizza. Whether I&apos;m traveling for fun or for work my mission is always the same: eat as much pizza as humanly possible. From a prior visit to NYC in May I had a list of over 20 pizza places I wanted to try. Vezzo missed the list but thankfully my buddy Sean L spends some time up north and gave me the tip. 

Pretty popular spot, it gets busy. Service is fast though. I think I was told it would be 20 minutes for a table and I ended up waiting 5. The pizza is super thin, I heard someone say it&apos;s the thinnest pizza in NYC. I can&apos;t validate that claim due to inexperience but I can say it was some of the thinnest pizza I&apos;ve ever had. I very much enjoyed the crispy, crunchy texture. The pizza came out piping hot. 

My only qualm was that the staff need to get a grip on when it&apos;s appropriate to clear the table. I went to the bathroom while waiting for my pizza to arrive and when I came back my table was bussed and my drink was gone lol. Not a big deal, for a refill on my soda. However, near the end of my meal while I was waiting for my check I again went to the bathroom to wash some pizza sauce off my hand, when I came back my pizza was gone. The busser assumed I left and threw the remains of my pizza away before I could box it. That didn&apos;t sit well with me,
I had to be somewhere after dinner so I didn&apos;t make a big fuss about it, just paid the bill and rolled out. 

In conclusion, pizza is good, service needs a little work lol but I like this place"
4,"This is an excellent joint with friendly staff and quality pizzas. There are no TVs so you focus on the great food and beers. Some outside seating is available too. 

On my first visit, the vibe was awesome and inviting, and I thought the pizza was incredible. One year later, I ordered the same thing and thought it was tasty but not as memorable. It was a personal meat pizza for about $15 and it&apos;s extremely thin with a perfectly cooked crust. 

My draft beer was $8 and I was able to relax with a seat by the window. Overall Vezzo is a nice spot to chill out."
4,"I am impressed, Vezzo was certainly remarkable. Despite the location, the prices weren&apos;t crazy. Every thing I&apos;ve tried here was yummy. The service was quick and courteous. Enjoy Vezzo and good luck."
4,"I can see why this spot is so popular! Delicious salads and thin crust pizza! Fresh ingredients and reasonably priced. I highly recommend getting the spinach salad. It was great to share and was the perfect salad to start. We also tried a large Margherita pizza and a personal  parma, this pie has bacon, arugula, apple and is salty/sweet combo. I liked it but felt it was a little too overwhelming. Service was good and I really liked the overall experience!!!"
5,"The pizza (mushroom with truffle oil, classic and chipotle chicken) all amazing. Great service as well."
5,"One of my all time favorite pizza spots in New York!! They have sister restaurants all over the city in convenient locations, which makes it super accessible for everyone. It&apos;s well priced, has a nice, relaxed ambiance and serves some of the best pizza in the city."
4,A few of my friends (true New Yorkers!) recommended this spot. Try the classic margarita pizza! Superrr thin crust and the ingredients are so fresh. Honestly the pizza looked very average but tasted great!!
5,"Pretty tasty thin crust Pizza! Ingredients taste fresh and the crust is just so thin that you could probably eat the whole pie! 
My top 3:
1)Classica
2)Parma 
3)Meat Lover&apos;s

Salads are pretty good too so if you feel guilty about indulging in some pizza, have a salad with it! Highly recommend, go check it out!"
4,"Always a trusted thin crust pizza place! I hadn&apos;t been here in a few years but tonight did a double family date night with toddlers and remembered how perfect this place is for them too. The restaurant tends to be busy and thus loud, which helps mask the sounds of kids&apos; voices haha. 

Tonight we ordered 2 large pizzas - shroomtown and a half cheese, half olive - both of which were great. We also got a Greek salad and the kale and manchego salad and while both were tasty, I really loved the kale one! It had a dressing already on there but the flavor is a little difficult to describe but it was really delicious. It also packed just a bit of heat FYI. Highly recommend.

If you&apos;re looking for delicious thin crust, this place is def a must visit, but just be warned some of the items are a tad on the pricier side."
5,"Amazing pies, cute casual atmosphere, ultra friendly staff. What else could you ask for?! Especially living in Manhattan, we&apos;re always looking for a place to gather with friends that won&apos;t break the bank. Vezzo is the ultimate place to get w couple of pies (Formaggio Bianco and Classica are a must, be sure to add white truffle oil too). Throw in a bottle of wine and you have a great night out!"
5,"Hands down, my new ABSOLUTE FAVORITE pizza place in the city!!! The crust is incredibly thin. I love thin crusts, but the problem is I can never get any toppings on them because the crust would get wet and soggy, and fall apart. Not this crust...it was PERFECTLY crispy from first bite to the last, and I got the meat lovers pizza, which was loaded with meat! The sauce is so good, the thin, crunchy crusts just bursts in my mouth. Every bite is a crispy explosion of flavor. Thank god I do not live near here. I would weigh 600 lbs and be on a TV show about how I can&apos;t stop eating  this pizza. It&apos;s sooooooo good. My mouth and belly are happy. So happy."
