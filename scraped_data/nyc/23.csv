5,"Ilili exceeded all expectations for our last minute girl&apos;s brunch. First off, the interior space is absolutely stunning with sky high vaulted ceilings and vintage lighting that beautifully Illuminated the space. The Lebanese cuisine is a mix of modern and traditional. The food quality and freshness were notable. Our server Lubna (coincidentally my dining companion&apos;s mother&apos;s name!) was very attentive, informative, pleasant and genuine! We much appreciated this.

We ate:
Lamb burgers - brioche bun, syrian air cured beef cooked perfectly
Phoenician Fries - crispy, sumac, parsley, garlic whip
Veal bacon - mouth drool
Brussel sprouts - their signature side, is authentically different with a sweet kick - fig jam, grapes, mint yogurt, and walnuts ( I don&apos;t even like walnuts and this was delicious)
Drinks - Vert, From Beirtut with Passion, Salt &amp; Smoke - mixologist was on point

We dined inside. Covid rules were in effect and adhered to. Temperatures taken at the door as well as personal contact information. Masks were worn by all staff and they went the extra step to hand each person a small bag to keep your mask clean and safe - a really nice touch since I manage to drop mine on the floor while dining out! Great/Central location. Did not charge extra covid recoop taxes. Did ask for a $2 donation to Beirut fund with ordering the Beirut with Passion drink - we happily donated.
Please support this wonderful place you will not be disappointed."
5,"One of my favorite NYC bloggers recommended this spot and we came in expecting it to be pretty good. Pretty good doesn&apos;t scratch the surface, this place was phenomenal!! The inside is beautiful- great spot for a date or celebration. Very well spaced out and covid precautions taken. I didn&apos;t catch our waiters name but he was awesome- he encouraged us to order outside our comfort zone and gave us some amazing suggestions. We ordered hot kibeh, kibeh tartare, babaghanoush, cheese rolls, Brussels sprouts and kafta. Everything was perfect especially with the fresh pita. My favorite was the kibeh  tartare, a must order! Now let&apos;s talk dessert- kunefe. We love kunefe but this was definitely the best we&apos;ve had. Perfect blend of crispy crust, salty cheese and a delicious sweet syrup served with mini sesame pitas. No words can accurately describe the deliciousness. So glad we came here, will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow, I would say a really good Lebanese restaurant!! They offer indoor and outdoor seatings. I really like the ambiance inside too and I must say, the food did not disappoint! Everything I ordered on the menu was spot on. I would definitely come back here again! 

Things I ordered:
- HUMMUS chickpea purée, tahini, lemon, olive oil
- FALAFEL fried chickpea &amp; fava bean croquettes
- WARM EGGPLANT tomato, micro citrus, tamarind molasses
- ARNABEET MEKLE cauliflower, tahini labne, chili, mint
- BLACK IRON SHRIMP jalapeño, garlic, cilantro
- MEKANEK sautéed lamb sausage, lemon, pine nuts
- GRILLED LOBSTER hollandaise, chervil, marble potatoes"
5,"Love this place every time I go. They don&apos;t have a brunch pri fixe but two of us shared 3 plates and a coffee each and paid around $30 each for a really amazing meal. Dinner here is phenomenal as well - but pricier.

Service from the whole team is impeccable and our host was so kind and considerate. He was also helpful in choosing items for our meal when I asked for an assortment of dishes that would be &quot;all around flavorful.&quot;"
4,"The food was so good I&apos;ve come back three different times for takeout. I came for the restaurant week deal and then tried the tasting sample. 

Chicken taouk: solid, but not amazing 
Kafta: one of my favorites of the things I&apos;ve tried. 
Falafel: great
Hummus: Lemony and creamy, consistency was thinner than I expected but still good
Fattoush salad: best thing about this is the dressing
Baba ganoush: tasty, but not particularly memorable 
Mekanek: reminded me a lot of merguez sausage. This was amazing 
Kebab kerez: delicious little meatballs in a wonderful sweet sauce 
Baklava (not pictured): GREAT! 

The only thing keeping me from giving ilili 5 stars was due to one of my takeout experiences. I got a notification that my order was ready 40 (!) minutes earlier than the given pickup time, so when I got the food some of it was already kind of cold. That was very annoying.."
5,"I came here with a friend as I had heart great reviews of the place. First of all, the ambiance of the location is great, from the service to the location design.

The take on the food is unique, with twists on classic Lebanese dishes really taking some dishes to the next level.

We tried the jalapeño hummus, baba ghanoush, falafel, mouhamara, Phoenician fries, and ended with the chocolate fondant. All the dishes were delicious, with the mouhamara and Phoenician fries really standing out for me. I&apos;ll definitely be back to try other dishes!"
5,"I came here with my Lebanese friend during a weekend to celebrate his arrival to America. ilili really shined with all the COVID measurements they were taking. First, you had to check in with the hostess who records your temperature as well as your information for contact tracing. Then you&apos;re brought to your table. We were seated outside which was lovely. The waitress came and informed us that when food or anything is brought out, to put on your masks- which I thought was great. If me taking off and putting on a mask meant reducing the spread of COVID and/or not endangering someone else- then yes I gladly will! 

We ordered a plethora of dishes recommended by my friend. We had the hummus with jalapenos, a raw beef dish, salad, fried beef, cheese rolls, fries, calamari and kanefe. Yes- we ordered A LOT. I&apos;ll rank starting with my top favorites:

1. raw beef dish. 10/10. it reminds me of a tartare which is pretty much raw beef. the flavors were very subtle but the onions + jalapenos and drizzle of the oil added so much flavor. along with the pita bread. chef&apos;s kiss!
2. hummus- it was extremely smooth and so flavorful. this hummus was unlike others. it was also extremely amazing with the pita.

those were definitely my top 2 dishes! however, everything else was just as good. i recommend giving ilili a try and can&apos;t wait to go back again!"
3,I tried to order a shawarma online but it wouldn&apos;t let me add humus.   I walked over to order in person to go and was denied to order in person to go and was also denied to add humus to the shawarma.   I am not sure if this ends up being an insult to the chef but wanted to add the humus.  I wasn&apos;t impressed with the customer service.
5,"Wow, what an amazing way to spend an afternoon dining at ilili! It was our first time eating there and the covid precautions are really nice with everything spread out and bags for mask storage. Our server was PHENOMENAL. I wish I got his name! When asked if we&apos;d ever had Lebanese cuisine and we said no, he passionately took the reigns and ordered our spread for us from appetizers to main dishes. 

By his recommendation we got small sharing plates for three courses and he guided us through the flavors and sauces. The meatballs were a highlight and the pita was unreal. There&apos;s also a mint tea that goes with the appetizer flatbread that was a secret highlight to the meal. What a treat! I would definitely go back."
5,"That was the best Mediterranean I&apos;ve ever had. Everything was so, SO good. It became one of my favorite restaurants. Their falafel is unreal, literally the best one I&apos;ve ever had. But honestly, I&apos;m out of words to describe their Kibbeh Naye Beirutieh. The plate is simply AMAZING. Is creamy, tasteful, fresh...delicious. 
I highly recommend making a reservation ahead to do not wait long. Service was great and the food came really fast. Definitely recommend!"
5,"This place had pretty much everything I look for when dining. Tasty good portions on food , spot on cocktails and amazing , attentive service. A friend took me here a few months back and I neglected to post my review. Now, with a little more time on my hands , I&apos;m finally getting to it. All staff were appropriately masked and all the regulations for Covid were adhered to as far as I could see. We dined outside ( having no choice ) but at least it was during nicer , warmer months. Will definitely return to this place. Kudos to the management team for  your Covid compliance and having staff that truly were delightful to us especially during these times."
4,"Being that my partner and I are vegetarian, we have gotten the Vegetarian Feast from here now a few times. It is quite a lot of food. I especially like the pickles, they are amazing. The pita is very thin and fresh, actually stays fresh for over a week. 

What else is in the &quot;Feast&quot;? Hommus, good but a little too &quot;creamy&quot; for my taste. Moussaka - which is Lebanese Moussaka NOT Greek, so no layers or cheese on top, but really great eggplant. Fattoush - which is a Lebanese salad - and there is never enough. Also Eggplant Tartare, I love it my partner does not. The Falafels are great, I make Falafels sandwiches with the pita. Arnabeet Mekle are really nice Cauliflower florets, unfortunately never enough, this is so good. Also included is Lebanese Rice and very special Baklava.

The food is great and the delivery is quick and everything is very nicely packaged in high quality containers."
5,Sadly I haven&apos;t made it to the restaurant in person yet but I did try ilili during Restaurant Week as a delivery. The $20.21 special was such a great deal and came with enough food for two meals (or one of you are very hungry). I got the kafta for my main and hummus and labneh as my appetizers. Everything was absolutely delicious and a great value!
5,"My favorite restaurant of all time. I think I have been here over 100 times, and went every single week for outdoor dining from July until early December when they closed the restaurant again. I have been craving it so much lately so decided to finally write a review. What is there not to love about this place?! The food is exquisite, there is good variety, the restaurant is gorgeous, they created a spacious outdoor dining area, and the service is always top notch. Everything I have ordered has been very tasty, but my personal favorites are fried Kibbeh, Kibbeh Naya, Tabbouleh, phoenician fries. I should also mention this place has an amazing atmosphere and is great for groups. Can&apos;t wait to be back."
4,"Been here twice, both during restaurant week. There menu changed the second time around, both still a good time. I enjoyed the salmon a lot. I appreciate the versatility and options during restaurant week. The only thing I didn&apos;t like the second time around was our seating, and felt a little neglected. Overall food was good."
5,"Food 5/5
Service 5/5
Atmosphere 5/5

I have been wanting to try this place for quite a long time and finally glad I was able to make it. They have a beautiful outdoor seating area and we snagged a great table for brunch.

They have an a la carte menu but I think the rest brunch deal is the pre-fixe option for $31. You get coffee/tea/juice, a cocktail, an entree, and a side. There were three of us, so we all ordered different things and shared. Everything we ordered was delicious, though beware the lamb was a bit salty!

The service here was excellent. Our waiter was very attentive and did not rush us at all. I am so glad I finally got to make it here. Highly recommended."
5,"Probably one of the best Mediterranean restaurants I&apos;ve tried so far since moving to NYC! Finally a place where I can go to when I want some good tasteful and savory Mediterranean food. The Brussels sprouts are excellent with grapes and walnuts, such a treat. The warm eggplant was a taste of home for me, so good. Riz was even better. The kebab was flavorful and grilled perfectly. I can&apos;t say enough good things about this place except that I will definitely be back for more to try the rest of the menu. 

For dessert we had the Illy candy bar which is the best thing ever. 

I think one of the best things is that this place has a lot of gluten free options which can be hard to find in New York."
5,"We went their for the Resturant week . The ambience is good and the service is nice. 

The appetizers 
1.Phoenician fries are awesome. 
2. Warak enab bil zeit  - grape leaves wraps , if you like eating olives and the tangy taste

Main course 
1. Grilled chicken wrap - was quite filling
2. Prime boneless beef ribeye - was good 

Dessert
1.Ashta - was cream with fruits 
2. Knafe bil jibneh - it was semolina crust with syrup . I loved it"
4,"On Saturday 7pm, I missed my reservation by 30 mins and the hostess did not honor my request. We decided to put our names on the waitlist and grabbed lounge seats near the bar where they provided full service but it was uncomfortable. By the time our table was ready, we were already digging into our meal.

- Falafel: Tasted good but the texture was very dry and crumbly. The lemony tahini was a nice touch but I wouldn&apos;t recommend this dish overall.

- Duck Shawarma: Mouthwatering delicious! It came in 2 decent sized cones placed so that it was easier to eat and the excess fat rendered to the bottom. The meat was juicy and the flavors were balanced from the sweet fig jam and light garlic whip.

- Baba Ghannouj: Very good. It was creamy, nutty and leaned towards the sour lemony side. I couldn&apos;t stop eating it with the fresh hot pita breads they provided.

We also had a prosecco and Almaza beer with our meal which were quite expensive. Besides the unpleasant experience earlier which was notably my fault, I would return for dinner again because the food was good."
5,"Had dinner on their outdoor patio.  Wish they had sidewalk seating year round, it was so chic and relaxing.  I felt like I was in Europe.  I had the mouhamara, kebab kerez and labne paired with a Lebanese rose.  All the dishes were very authentic and delicious.  The staff was attentive and the manager Marco was also very nice and made sure all was going well."
