5,"From start to finish... simply amazing! As indoor dining just opened up, they make you complete a contact tracing form for your entire party and they also take each member&apos;s temperature before being seated. 

The ramen here is incredibly delicious. I got the spicy tan tan ramen and highly recommend it along with their gyoza. Also... save room for dessert because their shaved ice hits the spot and ginormous! Overall, I would visit again!"
5,"Yes, yes, yes! Loved Tonchin New York. My friend and I have been compiling a list of restaurants we been wanting to try since Covid, and Tonchin was the pick last night. We had 8:30 reservations outdoors, and were delightfully surprised how warm it was. Especially since we sat next to the entrance. Service was amazing, no rush, and the FOOD was perfection. Also, the margarita was literally the best drink I&apos;ve had in a while. Please check this place out, just perfect on all aspects."
5,"I made a reservation online for a outdoor seating and my table was ready as soon as I arrived. They have a pretty setup with heaters. Staff is pretty friendly too and they take good precautions. 
I ordered the beef rice ball which has minced beef and shishito peppers. Beef had an amazing flavor of soy and sesame. 
We also got a complementary shrimp tempura rice ball and the tempura was very super delicious with the right amount of done ness. 
I also had the spicy tan tan ramen and by the end of the bowl I was so full! It has peanut based broth, spicy and the meat was one of the best ones I&apos;ve had so far!"
4,"Got takeout. The process was quick and easy. I asked for no ginger no scallion and I actually got a call from the restaurant informing me that there are traces of ginger in the soup, in case I&apos;m really allergic to ginger. Great customer service! 

Quality inevitably suffers because it&apos;s takeout. They include instructions on how you can revive the noodles to make it better... again, nice touch. 

Indoor dining has resumed and when I picked up, there were quite a lot of people eating inside, and they had to turn away some who didn&apos;t make reservations. Outdoor dining is also available, but it&apos;s still too chilly."
4,"8.2/10

Tonkotsu ramen: nice, rich broth, decently thick, good flavor; ingredients are nice; unique thin-sliced pork, distracts from the fattiness, so that&apos;s good; noodles were nice, better than average; scallions were a bit overwhelming, probably would&apos;ve been better if they were cut normally; overall, definitely on the salty side, but a very good bowl of ramen

Spicy tan tan ramen: essentially same as tonkotsu, but spicy; the chili flakes completely nullified the flavor of the broth; I didn&apos;t feel the nuts were very necessary; broth ended up having tons of tiny pieces, which I am not a fan of (7.1/10)

Sizzling gyoza: not your standard thin-skin gyoza, seemed a bit sloppy; good thing is good flavor, nice filling; not enough filling and dough was too thick; not seared particularly well, pretty wet; dipping sauce was really nice (6.8/10)"
4,"Restaurant Week Winter 2021

I&apos;ve had Tonchin on my to try list for a couple of years now. I was really happy to see Tonchin join the game the week of Feb 8 (not sure if they&apos;re staying until the end of the month). It was on my must try list as I was browsing through restaurants again. 

There&apos;s three ramen options and three appetizer options
I got the tonkotsu ramen and chicken tsukune bun. 

It was a surprise to see how well packaged everything was. I like the size and quality of their paper and plastic bag. There&apos;s red tape to secure multiple containers for each dish together and a receipt with my name on it. They separate almost every aspect of the dish. I didn&apos;t realize until after finishing everything that they slipped a sheet of seaweed within that paper with their name stamped (attached to the bowl with noodles). I thought it was just a name tag. 

Ramen
The tonkotsu soup was really thick and rich, maybe a bit too oily. The portion they gave was barely enough to submerge the ramen, which sounds about right in Japanese standards. I would&apos;ve liked slightly a little more. It&apos;s quite rich too, not sure if it&apos;s too salty due to me reheating it. 
I like how large and thick the char siu pieces are. Nice that it doesn&apos;t taste old either. 
The soft boiled egg was my favorite texture, a gel center that&apos;s not too runny. The whole white part has marinate flavor rather than just the outside of the egg. 
The noodles themselves were very smooth. Not sure if they were too soft due to my reheating. It has a slight egg taste that I wish can be even stronger! 

Chicken tsukune bun 
I wasn&apos;t sure which bun to get but this seems most basic. Turns out it&apos;s quite popular too, according to Yelp pics. 
I don&apos;t remember if I&apos;ve ever had a chicken meatball but assume I haven&apos;t, so this texture made me think this was pork instead. 
The purple cabbage is some kind of slaw with a little wasabi added to the mayo. The wasabi was an interesting touch because it cuts through the heaviness. The mayo itself is good for adding moisture to the bun. I wonder if it would be better to use some vinaigrette instead of mayo. 
Very cute how the outside of the bun has their logo seared on. 

Overall very solid ramen place. I feel like eating it at home doesn&apos;t do justice to it, so I&apos;m looking forward to trying again in person. 

FYI their ordering website closes when the store is supposed to close/break. You can&apos;t order in advance either and must have it prepared ASAP. 

PS I was given utensils even though I asked for none. In times like now where we order SO MUCH takeout, I really don&apos;t want to create more trash. Home utensils are sturdier and more pleasant to eat with anyway."
5,"This is the best ramen in midtown Manhattan (in my opinion). Stick-to-your-lips tonkotsu broth, great and affordable Japanese cocktails, a menu beyond &quot;just ramen&quot; (crispy dry wings--get the curry cheese wings!!). The spicy tan tan ramen is solidly the best I have had, with the most unique flavor I&apos;ve had from this style. All wavy noodles (no thin tonkotsu noodles). The pork they put in the ramen is unique as well--it&apos;s almost hammy and cured. 

Not to mention the vibes are great with excellent playlists, lighting, and decor."
5,"Tonchin may just be my favorite place for Ramen in all of NYC. I discovered this place only a few months back and am already eyeing my third trip here sometime in the very-near future. I ordered the classic Tonkotsu Ramen and it was so mouth-wateringly scrumptious that I imagine i&apos;ll get it every time I come here. The ramen was warm and rich, perfectly seasoned, and surprisingly filling. I loved the homemade noodles, the roasted cha-su and all the various vegetables. No one item overpowered the entire bowl, and everything came together beautifully."
4,"We ordered here during restaurant week and everything was perfect. All the soup base and toppings for the same for all the orders. The soup base was a bit salty. And, extra toppings are on the pricy side ranging from 3-4$. The noodles were cooked perfectly. All the appetizers were great, the chicken and fish bun and shishito peppers. Overall, solid ramen spot."
4,"Made a reservation for two outside in their heated area for a Saturday afternoon. Tables are generally spaced apart, though the cold wind can take away from the heat lamps.

Decided on the Spicy Tan Tan Ramen ($18) to go along with a Prime Beef Rice Ball ($6). Both items come out at the same time - the &quot;rice ball&quot; is more of a rectangle, with a layer of shredded marinated beef on top. A bit dry yet easier to go down with the provided soy sauce. Ramen is a large bowl of sof noodles, pork, egg, seaweed, and scallion swimming inside a spicy broth. Loved the overall heat in the dish that&apos;s perfect for the weather. Would have liked to see some more noodles (most of it was gone before I was halfway through).

Despite a few hiccups, the service is solid with multiple waiters helping out. Would make another trip to have the ramen again."
5,"Outdoor Seating // Clean
Spacious // Delicious

There&apos;s a reason why Tonchin has a Michelin star. DELICIOUS savory filling vegan broth, kale salad, unagi rice balls, zesty cucumber... getting hungry thinking about this place. Have been here more times than I can count... Never disappoints.

Strong Suggestion: Order a half portion of soup so you can try some additional items on the menu."
5,"Finally got a chance to try out this popular place and it was so worth it!   I was able to try out the Miso Ginger Ramen while the SO tried the Classic Tokyo Tonkotsu Ramen; Extremely flavorful broth, hearty and very filling.  The aroma was absolutely heavenly goodness and warmed my bellies on a freezing December night.  

Definitely hard to find a better ramen place around these parts and it&apos;ll be a regular pit spot when I visit NYC next time.   Loved it.

Note: Outdoor seating still in action and reasonably covers you from the elements :)"
5,"Came during COVID and their outdoor dining space is cute and large! Overall, The food was amazing! I&apos;ve had it dine in and Togo and every time they were very consistent. The atmosphere is really chill and laid back - great for an outing with friends or a business meeting. 

We got a app sampler which had the shishito, kimchi, and cucumber which I know a lot of people rave about but I think that you can skip it - it tastes fine but it&apos;s pretty small portions. We have tasted the normal tonkotsu which was great and the spicy tan tan which was so so good. The quality of the broth was top notch - it was super creamy which cut through the spiciness which was so delicious. We also got the smoked daishi ramen which was also really good but a tad salty. Overall the food was amazing, the staff were great, and the environment was wonderful."
5,"Fantastic Ramen in New York City!

I have an Air Force buddy who told me when he was in Tokyo, he had Tonchin ramen and it is on point. He just went to the place in midtown and it is still the best he ever had. That&apos;s a bold statement, let me see for myself.

Before the Ramen party gets started, cocktails are in order. I start with the Japanese Old Fashioned. Now call me Old Fashioned (See what I did there) this is my go to cocktail, just something I enjoy. When you make my favorite drink with Iwai whiskey? It&apos;s now party time!

The Ramen choices are interesting, normally I&apos;d chose the Spicy Ramen but there is a selection that sounds pretty interesting. I chose the Smoked Dashi Ramen. What was brought to me was truly a Ramen masterpiece. They start with signature homemade noodles but then add smoked fish oil and freshly shucked clams to the dish. The standard accompanying egg, radish sprouts, tobiko and seaweed are also in this dish. The end result is a smokey Ramen, something I never had before and it was, as we say in New York City: 

Ass Kicking!

Now I love my Ippudo, when you walk in they were singing my name! I think Tonchin ramen with their Smoked Dashi Ramen just took the top Ramen honors. 

5 Yelp stars from me."
5,"The 5 star reviews about this place are all accurate and well deserved. One of the best bowls of ramen I&apos;ve ever had. 

I enjoyed the Classic Tokyo Tonkotsu Ramen (5/5). The broth is so rich, umami, and packed with flavor. The texture of the noodles are perfectly chewy and bouncy. Also loved how the cha shiu pork is sliced thin- everything paired so well together. 

My friend had the spicy Tan Tan ramen which was also delicious. The spice is similar to Mala peppercorn flavor- if you enjoy that definitely give this one a try! 

All COVID precautions were in place - hand sanitizer provided, temperature checks, proper spacing, etc."
5,"Best ramen in the city. I like my ramen spicy, and so the Spicy Tan Tan Ramen at Tonchin is my go to. The only other spicy ramen that&apos;s even close is Ippudo&apos;s. The broth comes spicy, and with another heap of chili pepper on the side to be mixed in. Seriously spicy, but somehow the spice never overpowers the flavor (or umami, if you will). The broth is very rich and almost creamy, so it&apos;s very filling. I had no space left for dessert by the time I was done with the Ramen.

Their curry cheese wings are really good too, and a breath of fresh air. I love buffalo, bbq and korean wings but it&apos;s great to see a unique take on wings. Shishito Peppers are good too, some of the peppers were surprisingly hot.

Overall dine-in experience is casual and very much like an Izakaya. Different from some of the other ramen spots that are packed and rushing you through your meal. The food was presented well too, and service was great. My ramen search has ended, I don&apos;t know why I&apos;d go anywhere else."
5,"Rarely do you find a place where each dish makes such an impression, in addition to amazing service! This place is definitely going onto my go-to list. 

I came with a group of five on a Friday night with a reservation made beforehand. We found the outdoor dining experience very enjoyable with safe physical distance between other parties and us. In addition, they had a live DJ outside in front of the seating area which created a great, lively ambiance.

Food:
For appetizers, we shared the Shishito Peppers and curry cheese chicken wings. I must say that these items initially raised some eyebrows - but we were all very happy that we took the chance. These appetizers knocked the flavors out of the park! 5/5 for both!

For the main dish, I ordered the Tokyo Tonkatsu ramen. It was an extremely rich broth with chewy homemade noodles, pork, egg, and seaweed. Having had a lot of ramen from Japan, I never get my hopes up for ramen elsewhere. However, I was absolutely delighted by these rich flavors and I will definitely order this again. Other people in the party ordered the Smoked Dashi Ramen and the Miso Ginger Ramen - everyone raved about their dish! 

For dessert we shared the strawberry shaved ice and the mango shaved ice. I honestly wasn&apos;t expecting much but woah - this knocks the shaved ice from Grace Street out of the park! I will say I enjoyed the mango flavor more - it is clear that the puree was made from fresh mangoes and had bits of the fresh fruit in it. The honey cream sauce on top of it was delightful as well! One of the shaved ice is enough to share amongst 2-3 people.

Service:
The service was top-notch. Our waiter was attentive and kind throughout our stay. I appreciated how well our dishes were presented and even the utensils that they brought to us. When they gave us the bowls for shaved ice dessert, we noticed that the bowls had been chilled. 

Overall:
I will be ordering all the dishes I had today again and will be excited to visit this place again!"
5,"I think I&apos;ve found my neighborhood go to ramen spot!! We stopped by after a day out and was ready for some warm ramen. We were able to snag the last open table despite not having reservations. I started with the hot toddy which had star anise and yuzu, yum. Next we tried two of the rice cakes, unagi and beef. Both were delicious and beautifully presented but the eel was the better of the two. I decided to go with the classic tonkotsu ramen and it was perfection. Delicious broth, excellent egg, loved the thick bamboo shoots and wonderful noodles. Would&apos;ve loved to try the shaved ice dessert if it wasn&apos;t the middle of winter lol. Nice outdoor setup, most seats are under a tent and heated. We were seated at one of 2 tables out in the open but there were heat lamps pointed at us."
5,"The best ramen broth, both vegan and tonkatsu-wise in my book! The boil-at-home option is perfect for those who are especially covid-cautious, as you get uncooked ramen that you can cook on your own and not have to worry as much about getting infected. I&apos;ve ordered multiple times here in 2020, and my delivery has been 1) secured well with tape and labeled, 2) consistent and 3) delicious every time. I highly recommend the vegan ramen broth (miso ginger) and the Tokyo tonkatsu if you eat pork! Bold, rich, and creamy flavors every time :D"
5,"This place is good. I&apos;m upset it took me this long to try it. Got here around 6:30pm and sat within 20 minutes. Staff was friendly and attentive.

But, now the food...The small bites are 3 for 20 but certain dishes will be an additional charge. I would pass on this. I don&apos;t know why I paid $7 dollars for bamboo shoots. I&apos;d recommend the shishito peppers though - very umami. Okay moving on to the shining star of our dinner - the curry cheese chicken wings!! They also prepare the wing piece so that it&apos;s easier for you to eat, but I still looked like a savage eating it. This was so bomb, we both agreed we should&apos;ve gotten more and skipped the first appetizer. I&apos;m still thinking about it  

My friend ordered the classic tonkotsu, the broth was creamy, rich and porky. I ordered the smoked dashi which had subtle hints of the fish oil. It was perfect for me, but I can see some people who may take it as &quot;fishy.&quot; I thought the oil blended well with the tonkotsu broth. Both broths were not overly salty which I appreciate. The seasoned egg was average, it could&apos;ve been marinated longer. They use wavy noodles here.

Lastly, my favorite part of dinner... dessert! We ordered the mango kakigori. Don&apos;t think of it as the snow cones we used to get in the ice cream trucks. The base is a super milky and fluffy, almost like snow. The cream on top is super light as well. This dessert is perfectly sweet and tart. A great way to end such a filling meal."
