5,"This is and has been one of my go-to spots in the city. The quality is always top notch and it gives you that old school NYC vibe when you walk in. 

Now, you&apos;re probably thinking oh, I&apos;ll get the diner food, corned beef, pastrami, matzo ball soup etc. Yeah, that&apos;s all good but allow me to throw a curve ball and enlighten you on their best menu item.....chopped liver. 

Before you cringe HEAR ME OUT! It&apos;s divine. Seriously. A giant portion of this homemade chopped liver (think almost a pate) between two thin slices of toasted white bread is a absolute masterpiece. 

Order ahead on the app and get 10% off with their code. Get the liver. Your friends will think you&apos;re nuts but you&apos;ll be back next week for it."
5,"This is my second home delivery from Sarge&apos;s. Last week we had the turkey dinner with all the trimmings;
added a spinach knish which was delicious. The turkey 
was fresh cut, moist and flavorful. Adding to a pleasurable eating experience the portion was very 
generous and the condiments were the same as if we ate in the restaurant. 
Tonight we had a dinner entree delivered that the 
manager promised I would thoroughly enjoy, and we
did. It was a roumanian tenderloin steak smothered in 
onions; perfectly cooked medium rare and the length of a large plate. The taste of this delectable tender slab of beef  is as flavorful as an aged t bone but delivers a distinctly different  taste after being marinated and
tenderized for a lengthy time.
Sarge&apos;s is delivering great food even in the midst of 
the pandemic. We hope to eat in there by the spring."
5,"No wonder that Sarge&apos;s has so many positive reviews. Delicious, VERY FRESH, and super kind owner and staffs. It was the best meal during this quarantine. I did pick-up and reheated (microwaved) it at home, and the food was even better than other dining-outs at restaurants these quarantine days. 

We tried the &quot;Monster&quot; - so called NY&apos;s biggest sandwich. I thought it would be the best way to try various kinds of meats. It was also for fun Friday night for my friend. It was so successful. It was so worthwhile walking over one hour for pickup yesterday - a heavy raining NY day...

The Monster was really huge! So neatly packed and thus it was very easy to make a table. Every meat was delicious and artisanal. It tasted very healthy. Also very surprised by the FRESHNESS of veggies, coleslaw, and pickles. Full of flavors without heavy seasonings. My friend was so happy about this surprise and we had a wonderful evening :D I ordered their cucumber salad, which I totally recommend! The owner and staffs were very very very kind too. 

Happy to finally try the Sarge&apos;s. I&apos;ve heard about the Sarge&apos;s as the best NY deli from You-tubers, and now I totally got it."
3,"Corned beef &amp; pastrami sandwich on Rye; matzo ball soup; &amp; NY cheesecake for lunch. The portion size was of the sandwich was pretty massive-could only finish 1/2. That means, i got dinner planned out! 

The broth of the matzo ball soup was flavorful and clean tasting.

The homemade cheesecake was a hunk of a slice too! (Highly recommend treating yourself to this)

Total price came to approximately $43."
4,"7.8/10

Corned beef &amp; pastrami on rye: will make you feel insecure about the size of your mouth, portions are VERY generous :); meat is tender and juicy, definitely prefer the pastrami, but both could be a tad stronger in flavor; bread is very weak, does not hold the sandwich together at all, also gets wet VERY easily, had to eat 95% of the sandwich with a fork; sauce &amp; Cole slaw? Goes well with the sandwich, not overpowering at all; overall, nice sandwich, good meat, bread is not very good though"
3,"This spot was ok, friendly service, and ok deli style food. 

Ambience: I came in for dine-in and they have outdoor seating. But the outdoor seating is on the busy 3rd Avenue, so expect a lot of noise. Overall not an ideal spot If you are trying to have a conversation. I recommend just doing take out if you want to eat here. 

Food: the menu is extensive, you can essentially find anything for anyone here! I ordered the chicken sandwich on a Kaiser roll and onion rings. The onion rings are tasty but so heavy and oily, so only order if you are really hungry and feeling particularly glutinous. The chicken sandwich consisted of grilled chicken, with lettuce and roll- overall a bit dry. Overall, I didn&apos;t find the food particularly spectacular. My friend ordered the steak sandwich and also thought it was just ok. 

Price: personally, found this place expensive for what it offers. My meal was about $25 with tax and tip. 

Service: decent service, friendly staff 

Safety; overall safety precautions were taken- the staff wore masks, so safe for covid purposes"
5,"Ummmm can we just talk about the most underrated item on Sarge&apos;s list?!? Behold, the &quot;blockbuster.&quot; 

For starters, the name is absolutely spectacular. Pure gold.

Secondly, this little slice of heaven mitigates the need to pay for an overpriced Sammy (which is standard at any Jewish delicatessen) bc it hits ALL the spots...it&apos;s customizable and absolutely delectable! 

My boyfriend and I made the mistake of splitting one on our first occasion...we deeply regretted that decision. Never again. Get your own, totally worth it! 

***much better alternative to 2nd ave Deli, in every way shape and form***"

I got a cheese sandwich. I was asked about five times if I&apos;m sure that&apos;s all I wanted. Yes ma&apos;am I&apos;m sure. 

It tasted good. Is there anyone that can mess up a cheese sandwich? 

I saw food exposed for too long on counters. This is never a good practice. Especially during covid this is an awful practice. 

I want to give the benefit of the doubt and say they were busy but it didn&apos;t appear that way. 
An exposed cake looks as though that&apos;s its usual spot. I hope it&apos;s fake. 

A sandwich was being prepared for what looked like a delivery. While staff member waited to collect other food items, she laid the exposed sandwich down on a table at the door next to what looked like some sort of cleaning solution. Hand or counter sanitizer I&apos;m not sure. It didn&apos;t look or feel right to me. Just saying. 

This would rate a one or two for me but I realize folks are all over the place during this pandemic so hopefully this was just a one off lapse in judgement for staff. 

The End."
5,Literally crave it weekly. The pastrami and the corned beef are killer and I get both sandwiches to split because I can&apos;t make up my mind or get both on one. The matzo ball soup is delicious as well as the challah they give on the side. I heard their philly cheese steak sandwich is good too will give it a try next time. In my opinion they are better than Katz and I&apos;ve had people agree after trying them out!!
5,"Wow. At first I thought this was overpriced but no. It&apos;s not. 

It&apos;s delicious. I don&apos;t even like reubens or so I thought. Maybe I never had a proper Reuben. 

But this sandwich is outstanding

The bread is buttered and toasted. 
The meat is nice, hot, QUALITY. 
The sauerkraut is amazing. Not too acidic 
The cheese is nice and melty. 
The side of mustard! Omg it&apos;s heaven. It needs to be bottled and sold. 

This will continue to be on my list of nyc eats."

Haven&apos;t been here in a while, but I was in the neighborhood and remembered their often over salted but absolutely delicious Corn Beef Hash. That certainly bring back some great late night memories. So two of us shared an order of that and a pastrami sandwich.

Well, let&apos;s just say that my memories were a lot tastier than the actual thing. Maybe my taste buds have evolved, or the chef is having a bad day. Either way, the once crispy and salty corn beef hash is now a bland pile of mush that felt like it was from a can. As for the pastrami, it was decent, but nowhere near as good as Katz Deli or David&apos;s Brisket House in Brooklyn.

I will always have my memories, but this visit will likely be my last. It&apos;s time to move on, there are too many great choices around NYC to linger."
5,"This is the real deal ! The best ! Sarge&apos;s Deli &amp; Diner has great food. I ordered takeout &amp; it was fresh, hot &amp; delicious. I love the extra sides - the pickles &amp; coleslaw salad were some of the best ever! I don&apos;t even like coleslaw salad but theirs was so crunchy &amp; fresh. The challah bread was good too.  I was impressed by the generous portion size, the turkey dinner is big enough for 2. It&apos;s nicely prepared &amp; they remembered to include cranberry sauce. Didn&apos;t have to ask &amp; no extra charge. A classic NY style diner with all the favorites &amp; a few surprises! I love derma but it&apos;s hard to find one I like. Years ago, there was a local diner that made a great vegetarian derma, I got hooked on it.  Sarge&apos;s derma is great too, and includes yummy brown gravy. Next I had the Matzo ball soup. Wow wow wow, so good. Perfect taste and texture. For dessert, I got a slice of banana cream pie. Never can go wrong with banana cream pie. Delicious! 

Sarge&apos;s is my new favorite! Everything was very high quality &amp; fresh. That&apos;s the thing about New York City and the metropolitan area (NJ &amp; CT too)  - it offers food &amp; experiences unlike any place else.  I really hope it lasts.  The pandemic has destroyed so much, lost lives &amp; tragedy. Not only here but everywhere. I hope it ends soon &amp; we can recover."
5,"One of the best pastrami sandwiches in NYC. The pastrami is thinly sliced and very moist.  Been to Kats and 2nd Ave and out of the three places, this one is the winner in my opinion."
4,"A classic New York deli serving an encyclopedic selection of sandwiches, entrees, side dishes, and myriad other items, all in ginormous portions.

In fact, I was a bit apprehensive about downing a full sandwich here, because if it&apos;s priced at $20 or more, you&apos;d better believe you&apos;re getting lots and lots and lots of meat. So, thanks to the Yelpers who mentioned the half sandwich / half soup offerings here.

A half pastrami sandwich was just the right amount of meat for me - enough for a full sandwich if I were to make one myself. Meanwhile, a half-serving of chicken consommé was super satisfying. Not at all salty and light enough to soothe your throat as it goes down. I ordered my half soup with a matzo ball, which was ginormous, almost like a super-sized knish. It would all be perfect stuff for cold and flu season, knock on wood. 

Lots of folks have raved about the cheesecake, so I tried a slice of the peanut butter chocolate cup that turned out to be the size of a brick. It wasn&apos;t excessively sweet or rich, but boy, was it *dense*. Fortunately, I was able to refrigerate it because I was full after a couple of bites.

Check out their website for yourself to see how the menu just goes on, and on, and on, and on. It&apos;s great to see that storied New York institutions like this one operating out of a compact venue with seriously old-school décor are still going strong."
2,"Overpriced, and the roast beef was extremely rare and inedible.

Kosher style? In fact, it&apos;s not kosher at all."
5,"Sarge&apos;s has to be one the best diners in NYC. Be warned, their portions are huge! You might need to order one item to share between two people. I did not realize their food was so big and we took most of our food back home with us. 

The interior is a 3/5, as it resembles a basic classical diner with pastries on display. We didn&apos;t get any this time but we might in the future. They looked really good. 

The food is 5/5, tasted amazing! I doubt there is anything on their menu that I wouldn&apos;t order, so we will definitely be going back. They have 2 menus, one is for their rotating specials which comes with either a soup or salad and a drink included in the meal price. I got the boiled chicken with Matzo ball and it was gigantic! If I didn&apos;t also get a side with it, it&apos;s possible I would have finished it but probably not though. I really enjoyed it though. If you love chicken noodle soup as much as I do, then this is perfect.

My finance got the chicken parm. This monstrosity of a sandwich was, in his words, &quot;the best chicken parm [he&apos;s] ever had!&quot; So if you&apos;re like this kind of food, it&apos;s definitely worth checking out.

The service is also 5/5. The waitress who took our order was very kind and adamant about our concerns. Ps, if you order a gift card 24 hours ahead of time, you will get a $5 bonus for every $25 you spend. And if you check in on yelp, you get 10% off."
5,"Sarge&apos;s blows Katz Diner out of the water.  The price points are equal, but you get much more value and aren&apos;t fighting the crowds.

Warning: Portions are meant for 2-3 to share on each menu item.  If coming alone, be prepared to take out leftovers.

If you enjoy nova, lox and bagels... try the Nova Scotia Special ($29).  It feeds 2-3 people and comes with 1 pound of nova cured salmon or belly lox, 2 bagels (4 total halves), olives with pits, onions, tomatoes, and lettuce.  Accompanied by two scoops of cream cheese.

We also tried the signature chicken noodle soup with a large matza ball ($8).  The soup was also portioned for 2-3 people to enjoy.

If coming alone, I recommend the half-sandwich and soup combo for $18.  You can at least enjoy two of Sarge&apos;s signature items: their sandwiches, and their soup.  But the best value for your money still dictates coming with a friend and splitting a meal.

Open 24 hours, we came late at night but were still met with excellent service by all the staff.  Highly recommend this spot for anyone."
3,"Sorry Sarge, good concept but I think I prefer most of your items from a different spot..

We got the potato pancake, strawberry cheesecake, and pastrami and corned beef combo sandwich. The potato pancake was pretty good but you only get one and it&apos;s not that big. The strawberry cheesecake was huge which were happy about! The slice we got was super creamy on one side but not as much on the other for some reason, the texture was a little more crumbly instead of silky smooth. More strawberry jelly than the actual fruit on top too. The pastramini here is sliced very very thinly like deli meat. Under the slice  of bread is a thin layer of coleeslaw and thousand island sauce. A couple pickles and coleslaw comes complimentary  too. I didn&apos;t really care for either unfortunately and usually I love them as a snack.

Service is just ok, staff is nice but not as good as it could be. The pickles should&apos;ve come first but they came towards the end of the meal for some reason. This place is pretty small so I would only recommend coming here with 1 or 2 other people at the most."
4,So I really enjoyed the corned beef. It was a generous portion and tasty. Not too much fat. The knish is really delish. A portion big enough for two. The only thing I did not care for was the matzah ball soup. The soup had nothing in it except the matzah ball. And the broth was a bit too salty for my taste.
4,"First impression of Sarge&apos;s Deli: why are these menu items so expensive.

When my food came: Never mind, I get it now.

Came here for a weekday lunch and treated myself to the Hot Corned Beef Platter (under the Cold Cut Platters for some reason). It came in a gigantic plate with thin slices of corned beef layered on top of one another. At the center was a gigantic scoop of potato salad. Every dine-in also includes two sour pickles and cole slaw.
The portions of this was unbelievable. I had the corned beef for lunch for the next two days.

Since I came during off-peak lunch hours, I waited less than 10 minutes for my food to arrive."
