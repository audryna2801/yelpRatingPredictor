5,I could not ask for a better dining experience. The tables were all far apart for Covid safety reasons but with the decor and incredible service it still felt very intimate. THE FOOD IS AMAZING. They have a pre-fixe menu right now and it is worth every penny. Delicious and fascinating. LOVED it. My husband and I were just thrilled to finally go out to eat after getting vaccinated.
5,"One of the best hidden NYC treasures is open again! Sakagura has set the bar on fine indoor dining. Service has always been great and I&apos;m glad to say they&apos;re still top notch, the food even more so. Incredible focus on quality not quantity. They&apos;re only offering a Prix Fixe menu right now but it&apos;s some of their greatest hits. Hopefully they&apos;ll expand their menu as business returns but what they&apos;re service right is a 5 course meal fit for heaven. Tables were more than adequately spaced, the ambience is intimate zen-like private dining. I can&apos;t say enough about how great of a job they did and I hope more people come to realize that they&apos;re open again. We will definitely be back!"
5,"Sakagura us a solid spot for Izakaya dining in Midtown offering a wide range of Japanese beers that are hard to get. Their sushi never lets us down and their most outstanding dishes are grilled octopus and the pork belly.

If you&apos;re like me, love Asian food you might be shocked to learn the struggles these communities are currently facing. We&apos;ve seen almost 3000 anti-Asian incidents this past year and the number keeps rising.

From physical assaults, to verbal harassment to civil rights violations across 47 states in America.

We need to speak up, show our support and raise more awareness.

It&apos;s time for us to remember the impact these communities have made in our lives.
All we need to do, is love the Asian community the way we love their food.

4,"A true hidden gem. Walking on 43rd street, you wouldn&apos;t be able to find Sakagura out of nowhere. Walking in from an unassuming office entrance, you make your way down the stairs toward the basement where Sakagura lies.

Dining at Sakagura is an experience that feels incredibly intimate and the dim lighting really feels comfortable. Fair warning, after you enter the main dining area there will no longer be any phone service. Without phone use, you know that the main emphasis will be on the food.

For starters, I ordered the maguro tartar - a pleasant tartar that awakened the palette and was very cleaning tasting. The soba noodles and the beef rib finger meat are small portions but deliver with flavor. In my opinion, the best tasting dish was the special mixed rice that had to be ordered in advance. A large bowl arrived and all of the seafood was mixed with the aromatic spices and put directly into our bowls. The taste reminded me of an elevated version of a childhood dish of fish and rice.

Overall, portions are relatively small but the dining experience is one of a kind. I&apos;ll be sure not to walk pass Sakagura next time I&apos;m around!"
5,"I went here on a splurge night with my friends.

I wasn&apos;t sure what to expect because i&apos;m not the biggest fan of sushi, and I&apos;m not the biggest fan of Manhattan.

We chose this place, to be blunt because a close friend of mine is a chef, so we all hung back and let him pick the place, and do all of the ordering.

Let me be clear. Everything here was phenomenal. Starting with the customer service. 

The sommelier was extremely helpful in picking out sake for us, and even explaining the sake making process. She even answered lots of our questions about the nuances of its production.

We ordered a ton of food, and all of it was delicious. What stands out to me is the grilled octopus, as well as the pork belly. The fried chicken was so good that we ordered another round of it too.

I&apos;ll definitely be back the next time I want to show off my disposable income and my good taste. lol"
5,"Sakagura was one of my best discoveries of 2019!

It is an upscale izakaya, great for dates, birthday dinners, or drinking after work with people from your business. There is a very extensive sake list but there are also non sake choices. I tried two cocktails and both tasted pretty good.

All of the food here was delicious. The people serving it weren&apos;t overly chatty but they were professional and attentive. The good came out fast enough.

I had the gomae, the buta kakuni, the special sashimi, a wagyu special, unisoba, ume onigiri, and uni ikura onsen tamago. Everything was delicious but my favorites were the gomae, the wagyu, the unisoba, and the uni ikura onsen tamago. That being said, no disappointments here! There was a lot more I wanted to try but wasn&apos;t hungry enough to... maybe next time!

For dessert, I got the black sesame creme brulee which was delicious and highly recommended! I&apos;m normally not into super heavy cream but this was done just right."
5,"Sakagura is a place to go! They have a beautiful interior space in the basement, the service is exceptional, with every dish and drink explained in detail. They have a sake bar with very high quality sake for all tastes. Their food has very high quality ingredients and with the simplicity of the Japanese food. It feels like you are eating in Japan. I would definitely recommend and it&apos;s one of my favorite places in NYC!"
4,"Amazingly good izakaya

The standouts:

Meatballs: 5 stars, super tender and juicy

Daikon, carrot, burdock root, and sesame oil: 5 stars, I ordered a 2nd one it was so good

Fluke with daikon and ponzu: 5 stars, super fresh and great combo of flavors

Also got the shishito peppers, and sashimi of tuna, amberjack, and abura tuna. All were super fresh and beautifully prepared.

Also loved the squid and beef. Would get the beef again for sure.

I would pass on the chicken karage. Not my fav

Would definitely come back!!"
4,"Hidden (literally) gem in Midtown East! You have to go into the office building and let the front desk know you&apos;re going downstairs to the restaurant. The ambiance does give you a feeling you were warped to a lowkey restaurant in Japan. My party had a reservation and we were seated immediately.

The staff were very attentive; they consistently checked in on us, refilled tea, replaced dishware, etc. They also offer hot tea which was much appreciated after coming from the cold! Dishes came at a comfortable pace. Some highlights from our dinner included:
- Hiyayakko: The tofu was great and the toppings added texture to the dish. The tofu itself was very enjoyable and the consistency was just right.
- Nasu Dengaku: Eggplant lovers must try this! The eggplant is soft (not chewy like some eggplant is) and comes with three different types of miso toppings. My personal favorite was the egg yolk miso. 
- Miyazakigyu Ishiyaki: You get to cook your own beef on a small hot stone (don&apos;t worry, they replace it if it cools off). The beef was tender and cooked very quickly. 
- Nihachi Soba: This is definitely one of the better sobas I&apos;ve tried in Manhattan! The texture is great; there&apos;s some firmness to it and it holds up well even with the dipping sauce. The portion is fairly large so my party shared one order. 
- Black Sesame Creme Brulee: This dessert is a bit pricey for the size and unconventional, but it was amazing! I highly recommend wrapping up your meal with an order of the creme brulee. The ice cream itself was tasty and paired very well with the crispy 

The two dishes that were a bit less impressive included the Chikuzen Ni (assorted root vegetables) and Salmon Onigiri. These seemed relatively standard compared to the other dishes. 

Overall, definitely recommend trying this restaurant for great ambiance and tasty Japanese food!"
3,Honestly wasn&apos;t worth the price. The experience is nice and the dessert was amazing. Both of the desserts weren&apos;t too sweet and balanced out the meal well. The chocolate souffle melted in your mouth and the matcha ice cream paired well. The creme brulee was perfect and sweet which matched well with the ice cream. The sashimi was fresh and a new experience. The steak and the tamago were pretty salty. The udon noodles were pretty good but not your typical noodles (the noodles were thin) (the broth was okay). The overall dining time was over two hours for us so expect to be here for a longer time.
4,"I love how this beautiful city drives efficiency: like taking a utility basement to a generic midtown office tower and transforming it into a pleasantly swarming sake oasis. 

Hot stone beef was spendy but very satisfying. Worth it if you&apos;re in a celebratory mood, or you just roll like that. 

We had much fun trying the sake flights. Would now like to try all of the sake. 

I&apos;m not sure the value to expense ratio is there for it to be a regular haunt, but it&apos;s been some years since I&apos;ve lived in the neighborhood so maybe life is just like that now. 

If not, I&apos;d give other izakaya a look as well. But there&apos;s a lot to be said for the depth of the menu here.

Leaving here I felt educated and improved. I&apos;m grateful for that."
4,"It&apos;s a fun unique experience and would potentially come here again with a small group of friends. 

Food: 3.5/5: I ordered the sashimi with hot soup noodles. I did not like the noodles soup, but the sashimi was solid. 

Ambiance: 5/5: Hard to find, speakeasy-esq environment. Has a strong Japanese theme which I enjoyed. 

Service: 4/5: Pretty solid. Nothing wowed me and nothing ticked me off

Overall, it&apos;s a fun spot, but I would try something different next time."
4,"Sakagura will always have a special place in my heart. I&apos;ve only been to the original location in midtown east and always have a great time there. They did a great job with the ambiance and I actually feel as if I&apos;ve been transported back to Tokyo (if Tokyo were to have more space - because the Sakagura is HUGE). I&apos;ve dined at the table and bar counter and if it&apos;s just an intimate dinner (3 or less), I would suggest the counter. It&apos;s always nice to get sake recommendations on demand  

I mean since it&apos;s an izakaya with smaller portions, I wouldn&apos;t suggest coming here with a big group (4 or less is ideal) unless you want to order 3 of every dish. 

All the food is great and they have the best daikon salad I&apos;ve ever had (we had to order 2). I will be returning again... and again and again"
5,"One of the hidden gem in NYC, it is hard to find, but worth every penny for the food, and services."
4,"Some of my colleagues and I were looking for dinner after a long day of conferences. We made a pit stop to have a few drinks but were looking for something with more sustenance. Someone in my group suggested Sakagura, as she had been there before with good things to say. I&apos;m always up for trying new places, so I was looking forward to checking this place out for myself. 

Sakagura is not visible from the street - 211 E 43rd St presents as an office building at face value (which is probably is); but once you enter and let the guard know where you&apos;re going, there&apos;s a stairwell that leads down the basement. The generic office aesthetics continue until you finally reach the restaurant itself. 

We didn&apos;t have a reservation, but luckily we only waited around 30 minutes (maybe a little less) for a table - a score on a Friday night. The decor of the restaurant is the total opposite of the building it was in. There was a warmer, more natural aesthetic - it read Japanese restaurant without it being too much in your face. 

Sakagura specializes in Japanese cuisine with a focus on providing a vast number of sake. We sampled a few and they were all very food. We also tried some plum wine which was sweet but good. 

The menu has a number of options, and collectively we decided to order a number of small-ish plates and share. Overall, we got the peppers, chicken meatballs, tuna, cold noodles, fried chicken, squid, grilled calamari, and this rice that was topped with accents which we were able to roll into our own sushi. Everything tasted super fresh - I was a bit outside of my comfort zone with some of the dishes but I really appreciated the meal as a whole. We finished off the meal with black sesame creme brûlée and matcha cheesecake which were both good; not too sweet and a nice finisher to the meal. 

Service was great, we were attended to promptly throughout the night and all the food came out at a good pace. Overall, I had a great time at Sakagura; they delivered the aesthetics, the food was good, and the service was on point. I wouldn&apos;t say I&apos;m running back here, but the experience as a whole is definitely worth checking out at least once."
3,"Came here for dinner with a friend, as I had been wanting to try this place for a while and was in the area for a doctor&apos;s appointment. I was mostly disappointed. I got the uni, the market price of which on that day was $21 for small and $28 for large. I decided to go for the large since I love uni, and it wasn&apos;t that fresh tasting and had that weird fishy taste to it. I also got the beef, pork, and lotus root shumai and the grilled eggplant with three different kinds of miso, which were both good. My friend got the steak, which she said was excellent, and the fried chicken, which was okay. Overall the food isn&apos;t extraordinary and it&apos;s really overpriced, because it&apos;s a small plates style restaurant. We spent $115 for two people and we didn&apos;t even have drinks or dessert and weren&apos;t super full from the meal. Service is good. They take reservations but you don&apos;t really need one on a weeknight - there were plenty of empty tables."
5,"An authentic Japanese meal with incredible service from the staff. I brought my relative from Japan here with my parents, and everyone was very pleased from start to finish! Everything we had was truly delicious, but I&apos;d highly recommend chawanmushi, uzaku, and buta Kakuni. Shashimi here was fresh and well presented.

Apologies for the lack of photos, as we ordered many dishes and enjoyed some family time! Note that there was no cell service in the restaurant."
5,"Visit here again on a Saturday night, I know I just went to their new location in east village, but we still come back for a business diner with our guests. 

We came here at 8:30pm, a lot of people waiting in line, luckily we made the reservation couple days ago, love their atmosphere and high quality. See the pictures of our flavor dishes."
5,"Sakagura:
Recommendation:
1.GYUTAN YAWARAKA NI (Beef Tongue Stew)
2.Chocolate souffle
3.KAMO ROAST NEGIMAKI (Chilled Roasted Duck slices)
4.Salmon collar(seasonal dish)
A very popular restaurant!"
5,"This place was actually very difficult to find. It&apos;s located inside an office building on the basement floor. Don&apos;t mistake it for the place at street level that also serves soba. 

Sakagura only serves the lunch set on weekdays, which I&apos;ve been dying to try. I came at 1240 and still had some, even though they limit to 30 a day. Lunch set of the day was hayashi rice, hashed beef over rice. Beef was tender and mushy, quite delicious, almost like a curry. The cold soba with the dip was also fantastic. Lots of flavor in the broth yet still very light. 

I&apos;d highly recommend trying lunch for a very affordable experience that is also filling."
