5,"Love this place, fries are amazing. Definitely more pre-pandemic, but on a nice day the outdoor brunch is great."
5,"NYC restaurants are going through a hard time due to COVID, however this restaurant really provided exceptional service. My best friend and I had no reservations, however I called ahead and was told by manger Teresa I could be seated immediately. When we arrived the wait time was 10- 15 minutes (great wait time for NYC during COVID) Teresa remembered me and seated us herself. . The restaurant&apos;s COVID precaution/ screening was great. We had to fill out the contract tracing electronically, we had our temperature taken and hand sanitizer was available. The staff were friendly and attentive. The food was great. their bottomless mimosas were great (and very bottomless lol) Their outdoor seating is heated and so is the inside. I will be coming back! Thank you."
5,Grabbed a tasty drink during quarantine and I&apos;m excited to try the pancakes for brunch!
5,Loved my brunch. Bottomless for $22 with an entree is amazing. Our waitress was a hoot. Plenty of heaters and the food was delicious.
4,"AMAZING OLD FASHION! the bartenders know what they are doing-- wow!! The service was great too!! 

Food recommendations:

The NACHOS were really good but a small presentation. Super yummy!! Add the buffalo chicken, you won&apos;t be sorry. BUT!!! Watch out for the jalape√±os-- the kitchen generously sprinkles them over the whole dish.

The CAULIFLOWER app is REALLLLLY delicious!! BUT if you&apos;re not a fan of mayo sauces ask for it on the side. The crispy amazing cauliflower morsels are drizzled in this weird mayo like sauce, borderline ruining the dish."
3,"KEY COVID TAKEAWAYS
- all employees are wearing masks 
- did not personally see server wiping down the seats with alcohol or anything or the sort
- plastic dividers between each table 
-alcoholic drinks served in cute plastic bags 


I really wanted to like this place because it&apos;s been on my yelp list of &quot;go to&quot; places in the city.

However, The Flying Cock was at best, mediocre. 
Mediocre doesn&apos;t mean the food was horrible, it just means that for the amount of money I paid for the couple of appetizers and other dishes, I wished I had spent it elsewhere. 

Let&apos;s talk about the food.
Tuna tartare tacos were okay. Crispy outer tortilla, and stuffed with ample amounts of tuna tartare and topped with sauces. I thought it was too salty, but it was one of my favorite dishes that I ordered.

I also got two of the sandwiches(forgot which ones, asked server for recommendation) I don&apos;t have much to say, they were not the best but not horrifying.

Lastly. The bar nachos. The nachos itself were pretty good. The buffalo chicken add on , however, tasted like frozen and reheated Tyson wings. Super dry and rubbery. Definitely do not recommend the chicken.

Overall, I&apos;m not too sure if I would come back here, but who knows! The one server I encountered was super friendly, which gave me a good vibe about the place."
4,"Been coming here for a year-ish now as I stumbled upon the place because it was close to my office in midtown. 

The food is a tad pricey but very good, the service has always been spot-on and they play very fun music! They also have a slew of fun, tasty cocktails named quirkily like the place itself.

The tuna tacos which I just tried are PHENOMENAL! Definitely order.

The only drawback I have really is that my roommate had gotten food poisoning last year (she thinks from the crab dumplings we had).

Otherwise, fun, upbeat place and they currently have COVID-friendly outdoor seating. Grab a friend and try it out!"
5,"I had a great time eating dinner here yesterday. I enjoyed splitting the nachos with the buffalo chicken addition. For only $3, there were so many nuggets added! For my meal, I ordered the hamburger flatbread. They happily substituted Cheddar cheese in place of the American. The result was flavorful and fun :D I also got to try a bite of my friend&apos;s Mac and Cheese, which was divine. 5/5, would highly recommend!"
3,"Came here on Saturday night for drinks. It was a lively bar and had a really fun atmosphere. I ordered the Mr. Big and it was solid, though I wish the drinks were just a bit stronger. Staff was friendly and attentive."
4,"I came across The Flying Cock via a yelp search. Can not talk highly enough about The Flying Cock. The food is magnificent, I tried many items, but Fish and Chips was really great. Crew is very polite and definitely will help you with everything. All around great experience."
4,"Tried coming here a few months ago but the place was slammed on a Saturday afternoon (with a couple hour wait for a table). Came back with outdoor seating now opened up during the pandemic; managing to get a table as two people were leaving.

Brunch menu is fairly small, but has some interesting options, including an AYCD section for $22. Not wanting to go crazy with the drinks, opted for a Margarita ($12) to go along with the Banana Chocolate Chip Pancakes ($14). Drink is served first and is definitely strong; yet enough mixer to not be overwhelming. Pancakes are five medium sized-griddle cakes that are crispy on the outside and soft inside. The chocolate chips are both baked within and topped around the outside, as well as a handful of sliced banana. 

Server came to check on us a few times and had a mask on throughout. They definitely want some turnover on the outside tables, so great for a quick meal for brunch."
4,I made my two friends come here because I booked dinner for us when I was stoned and it has a funny name. One of my friends was really annoyed I made her come to Murray hill but she got over it. We shared the tuna tartar taco and the cauliflower to start. To eat I had the salmon Caesar. Everything was good and the service was good
5,"Food 5/5
Atmosphere 5/5
Service 5/5

This place really is the best bottomless brunch place I&apos;ve been to in the city. Definitely worth the wait. What I really appreciated is that it is really BOTTOMLESS. My glass was never empty the entire time I was there. Servers were on top of refilling your drink before you finished it.  I ordered the shakshuka and my friend ordered another egg dish. Both were delicious and well presented. Don&apos;t expect michelin star gourmet but definitely worth the money. Atmosphere is a bit cramped but it really gives it a cozy vibe. I liked it. Favorite part: every 5 minutes the beat drops and Birthday Cake by Rihanna comes on because someone is &quot;celebrating their birthday.&quot; What a hoot."
3,"My friend and I came to the flying cock for happy hour. I was honestly excited to dine here because a lot of the online reviews were amazing, but I found myself not that impressed or satisfied. I was also dissatisfied with their reservation set up. I looked through their website and yelp and saw that I could make a reservation through Yelp, but I would have to put my card down. Their disclaimer was worded a bit confusing. It stated that there would be a charge if you were a no-show or cancelled before 72 hrs (which is a long time in my opinion ~ most places are 24 hrs). Confused as to what the exact charge amount would be I called the restaurant to ask. When I asked how much the charge would be if we were a no-show or cancelled, the person on the phone had the nerve to say &quot;I THINK it&apos;s $25 if you don&apos;t show up&quot;... YOU THINK?? As an employee of this establishment, shouldn&apos;t you KNOW how much the charge is exactly. Also, I understand with COVID a lot of restaurants were hit very hard and are struggling, but $25 is an outrageous price to charge someone for not showing up to their reservation or cancelling. I can understand this amount if it were a 5 star restaurant, but this is just a bar in Kips Bay...  

Order:
- Buffalo wings (4/5)
- Pork Belly Dumpings (4/5)
- Finding Nemo (3/5)
- A Disney Princess (2/5)

Pros:
- A lot of drink options to choose from ~ beers, wines, cocktails 
- A lot of appetizers/shareable to choose form 
- Food was good 

Cons:
- Not a lot of entree options 
- Cocktails were not that great ~ honestly kinda overhyped 
- Outrageous no-show/cancellation fee 

Overall: I wasn&apos;t all that impressed with The Flying Cock. If you&apos;re in the area and looking for some draft beef and appetizers, The Flying Cock may fit your needs."
5,"I have always visited @theflyingcocknyc for drinks and loved the vibe! Last week we decided to try out the food here and I can say this place has raised the standards for all the bars and bar food in the midtown area!  For appetizers we got the mouth watering bang bang cauliflower with cripsy baked cauliflower bites topped with creamy and sweet-spicy chili sauce and Bar nachos loaded with queso fresco, mozzarella, cheddar, guacamole, jalapeno and sour cream. For mains we I got the Blackened Salmon Caesar which was my fabwith two perfectly grilled salmon fillets in blackening spice, romaine and topped with avocado caesar dressing, marinated tomatoes, warm croutons and parmigiana
Highly recommend!"
5,"- They call you when the table is ready, #FTW
- lit (unlimited) brunch is lit, I&apos;m still feeling the mimosa
- grand service
- pat la frieda burger was great
- waffle burger was great
- the loud construction next door is very annoying"
3,"Came for brunch. The unlimited mimosas were great. The beef burger I got was tasty but my friends got the avocado toast and it was bland, unseasoned, and overpriced. The outside seating was a mess. There was a loud construction crew working nearby and the table we were seated on was right above the cellar door. I finished my burger and got the hell out of there."
4,"My partner and I came here for a Saturday afternoon boozy brunch!
It was around 3pm and the place was PACKED.
Unfortunately, they do not take reservations. Lucky for us, a couple at the bar was paying their tab and leaving as we approached.

Our bartender, Stephanie, was wonderful! She kept the mimosas coming. I didn&apos;t have an empty glass once.

The food isn&apos;t the BEST. I got the brunchy burger and it was mediocre- no seasoning.

My partner got the spinach and goat cheese omelette and that was good.

We will most definitely be back!"
3,"An OK brunch spot. I thought the food was average quality, the drinks were comparable to any other typical bottomless experience ($22), and service was a little slow (although I think that was more due to it being busy, didn&apos;t seem personal). 

I ordered the breakfast waffle sandwich ($17) and didn&apos;t really think much of it. It&apos;s made with fresh seeming ingredients, but I remember it being a little cold.

Overall I didn&apos;t think it was bad per se, but just nothing to write home about. Glad to have tried but not gonna make an effort to repeat unless friends want to go."
4,"A friend and I attended their brunch serving late one Sunday and I&apos;m so glad we did. We had to wait a minute for a seat that wasn&apos;t at the bar but that was ultimately fine as we got seated right next to the bartender in the back. 

Of course it was a Sunday so we opted for the boozy brunch and I can&apos;t praise our waiter/the bartender enough as he never let either of our glasses reach below halfway full the entire meal. To top it off, our meals were both amazing: the fries were crisp and fresh, the breakfast burger was cooked right to order, and the egg which came on it was cooked yet runny, i.e. perfectly.

The vibe was lit: lots of loud music, talking, and people, but that&apos;s obviously to be expected in an NYC boozy brunch spot. Get a reservation if you can.

Absolutely come through, fam."
