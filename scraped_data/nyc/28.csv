4,"I sat outside here when it was just warm enough during Covid and got blueberry pancakes as I haven&apos;t had them in a while and I heard they are excellent. Everything I heard was accurate with a bunch of large pancakes baked with blueberries and also served with a blueberry compote to top and syrup. While I wouldn&apos;t exactly call the blueberry topping a compote as it lacked the sweetness you&apos;d expect (as there was a bit of sourness from some of said blueberries,) overall the pancakes were excellent and they made a good filling brunch/lunch and it was well worth it for the price. There aren&apos;t many spots around here for good American food and this satisfied my rare craving.

Mid/low 4. Good portions for the price and the server was nice."
5,"While walking around my bf and I was looking for a place to grab a quick brunch. This place we passed by casually bc everywhere else had a long wait. We were sat right away in a 4 seater table bc the host said he&apos;ll make an exception for us tehe.

We were greeted by a waiter who was just adorable! He was wearing a leather jacket and was the kindest soul. It was pretty busy but he was still so attentive and kind. He is the reason I rate this establishment a 5/5!

FOOD ORDERED
Penny Egg Sammy: honestly nothing too crazy. It&apos;s a bacon egg and cheese on a croissant with higher quality products, crispy bacon, and scrambled eggs. I didn&apos;t want anything crazy though so this hit the spot for me! 

Penelopes Hangover Bowl: ordered by my bf and he said it was really good. Accompanied by an egg, hollandaise sauce, and a mixture of sweet and reg potatoes. He enjoyed this a lot! 

Coffee was strong and delicious! Endless refills so definitely recommend that as well!"
5,"What an incredible meal! I had bookmarked this place ages ago and finally made my way there for brunch today and I couldn&apos;t be happier. We used the Yelp waitlist to join the queue and were seated as soon as we got there. They have tons of outdoor seating and the tables are comfortably spaced out and all the waitstaff wear masks. 
We started with the peaches and cream Bellini and blood orange spritz and both drinks were delicious. The Bellini is creamy and the spritz was refreshing. For food we had the blueberry pancakes, avocado toast and a side of home fries and everything was tasty. The pancakes are super fluffy, the blueberry compote is tasty and the portion size is huge. The avocado toast was just incredible! The sourdough bread is great, it&apos;s loaded with tons of avocado and topped with pickled onions, beets, quinoa, cherry tomatoes and the perfectly poached egg. This is probably one of the better avocado toasts I&apos;ve ever eaten and I can&apos;t wait to come back for more. The home fries were crispy on the outside and soft inside and perfectly seasoned. 
All in all, a great meal and I can&apos;t wait to try the rest of their menu."
5,We had to wait a while to get in but the wait was worth it! The service here was great and the food was better! They had the best mac and cheese I&apos;ve had in a while. The place itself was super cute.
5,"I don&apos;t understand why this place has such few stores. In these Covid days I will start with the essential comment on ambience: I was in love with the soundtrack of top hits re-recorded as acoustic piano class.

Food overall was very above average but the one friend who got the avocado toast was definitely struggling to finish it

My favorite dish : the blueberry pancakes had actual blue berries baked in and the omelette was ooozing with grueyer goodness. The outdoor seating was very cute and will definitely become a quarantine go to, esp with the local sarabeths closed"
5,"Amazing food. Quick service , ordered french toast , green juice, wagyu burger and cold brew coffee. Customer service is awesome as well. Would recommend for brunch or breakfast to all"
4,"My best friend was in town for a short while and we needed to find a spot that was open early for breakfast. I stumbled across Penelope on Instagram and we decided to try it out. I ordered the eggs anyway with bacon. The dish came with home fries and toast. My best friend got a veggie omelet which also came with a salad and toast. We both agreed that the food was extremely fresh, but we also felt that everything was highly under seasoned. We had to go in for the salt several times. That said, my bacon was exceptionally good and the jam for the toast was excellent ! My best friend also ordered the green juice which she said was really good. 

I would definitely come back to this cafe ! It&apos;s cute and the service is really good. It&apos;s also family friendly so I could also bring my little one for a mommy daughter outing. I was eyeing the cocktails on the menu, but because it was so early in the morning I decided to forego any alcoholic drinks. There are so many appetizing items on the menu so Penelope cafe will be seeing me soon!"
4,"Decent spot with good breakfast options and an overall good vibe. Super harried / slow service, but trying to manage a lot in COVID times. Omelet was a bit bland but pancakes were excellent and avocado toast was great."
3,"We were super exited to try this spot. We got up early, knowing there is always a wait. The tables were definitely not 6 feet away from each other. The food was good but not amazing. I got charged $1 to add a slice of tomato to my sandwich. Also the ratio of egg to pesto, tomato and cheese was very uneven. Biscuits were good but a little crumbly. All in all we would go back but would not wait for a table."
5,Cute spot for brunch. Plan ahead and come early. Lines can be super long but food is worth it.
2,"EH - DECENT

Why does it seem like everytime I have a NYC brunch.. the food gets worse and worse?

NO CHEF - NO BUNS - NO SOUP FOR YOU
The baker that makes their &quot;famous buns&quot; wasn&apos;t there this day.... hence, no buns (protip - work out your glutes so you don&apos;t need to go looking for buns, you&apos;re welcome). 

BATHROOM
disgusting and small. 

NO SALT
My egg burrito thing was bland. The mac n cheese too. Everything bland. I seldom complain about salt... but things could have used a dash of seasoning..

When you arrive, you&apos;ll have to put your name down and then wait like 40min. Goodluck."
4,"Me and my friend had a great breakfast. I was happy that I finally had a chance to visit this place without waiting in line to get a spot. That is one of the few good things about the COVID-19 pandemic. The coffee was ok, but I was happy that I could customize my cappuccino with almond milk instead of regular milk. The avocado toast was next level, lots of fresh avocado, very yummy! Our waitress was nice, and the food came pretty quickly. The outdoor area was reasonable, and we had enough space to maintain distance from other tables."
5,"Staff are well versed in the menu and are on top of recommending great items! Food and drinks came out swiftly, hot, and very photogenic. Great brunch place with friends! Thank you server Leo for the great menu recommendations and attentive service!"
4,"Yummy food in a cute restaurant. They are going for quaint country comfort with the decor, which is kinda cute in a big city like New York. The food was really good! I was a little disappointed in the Bloody Mary. It was as basic as it gets. No garnish and nothing special flavor wise. 

The staff was great. They seated us right away and took good care of us. We also felt like the prices were reasonable. We were glad we popped in and would gladly return here again one day."
5,"I love their menu. They have a delicious espresso martini. I forget exactly what was in it, but it was special one like with caramel and other things. I don&apos;t remember it what it was, but it was GOOD and you should get it. I&apos;ve gotten their avocado toast twice recently and loved it. They have outdoor seating and are worth the wait if there&apos;s a line. Really amazing brunch spot. Friendly waitstaff too"
3,"Good brunch spot but not worth the hype! A bunch of friends and I came for brunch on Saturday and were told the wait was 20+ mins. An hour later, we were sat outside, uncomfortably close to another party. I got the Farm Stand eggs which was simples scrambled eggs, bacon and some toast. The eggs were good but the bacon was barely cooked. My friends got items that looked tastier which made me regret my decision. Didn&apos;t end up taking photos because it wasn&apos;t photo worthy."
3,"We joined the waitlist on Yelp but the wait was longer than suggested on the app. 
Food-wise- we ordered their special pumpkin pancakes and they were truly delicious, melted in mouth; highly recommend!
Penny egg sandwich had too much pesto in it. I never tried eggs with pesto so wanted to give it a try but definitely not a good combo.
Does this place worth the wait?- With so many choices in NYC- I would say No."
5,"Loved this spot for a chill brunch, from the ambiance to the food. I always feel guilty ordering avocado toast when out because sometimes it&apos;s so simple; but the avocado toast at Penelope&apos;s is next level. The bread, goat cheese, tomatoes, quinoa - so delicious. Their cocktails are also great, I recommend the Lavender Ros√© Lemonade!"
5,"THANK YOU for a wonderful Family Dinner! Great Food, Cocktails, Wine and especially Service!
Thank you JUSTIN, Sam, and Andrew for taking great care of our Large Party last night!
NOT JUST a FAMOUS BRUNCH - The dinner menu is plentiful, healthy and delicious as well. 
Thank you again, we will be back again soon!"
5,"Came here for brunch Sunday afternoon. Order the Nutella French Toast -- if you&apos;re a fan of French Toast that isn&apos;t too sweet, this is perfect! Also tried the Hangover Bowl. It was good but not much meat in it."
