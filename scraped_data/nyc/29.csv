4,"Man, I&apos;ve been sleeping on Pio Pio. There has almost always been a location near my apartment over the years, but I always pushed off trying them out. It was mainly out of principle and budget, rationalizing $28 was too expensive for lomo saltado. I WAS WRONG. It&apos;s so freakin&apos; delicious and worth every penny. Plus, the portion size is more than enough for two with a side house salad.

The steak is oh so tender and the sauce is flavorful. During the delivery process the rice soaks up all that good, good flavor and just intensifies the dish. Love the ratio of fries + other veggies + steak. The house salad with their garlic dressing really balances everything out. I&apos;m not a huge iceberg lettuce fan but it was all really fresh and worked together.

We also loved their chicken empanadas which were enormous and could easily be a meal of their own. They were jam packed with juicy, well seasoned chicken and wrapped in homemade dough. A must if you&apos;re an empanada fan.

The prices are all over the place which keeps this from being a five star review. It&apos;s just a bit too expensive to add to my regular rotation, however, I&apos;ll definitely keep Pio Pio on my list for special occasions."
5,"Always Yummy, Their chicken is the best and the sauce is Fantastic!
The fastest delivery in the world, Just love this place!
Their house salad with The Avocado dressing cannot be beat.
Oh, and by the way, you cannot do any better on pricing, very fair and reasonable.
Will always recommend Pio Pio7"
4,"I love Pio Pio. We used to go to restaurant in Hell&apos;s Kitchen but since this is COVID time, we order delivery. Huge portion of everything in combo at very reasonable price. 
Chicken is tender and nicely flavored as well. Only reason I removed one star was because of their order form on website. It&apos;s hard to see and not user friendly. 
I&apos;m not big fan of tostones which I keep forgetting and ordering lol"
5,"I&apos;m writing a 5 star review for a restaurant primarily known for its Peruvian rotisserie chicken and I don&apos;t eat chicken. This sounds a bit absurd on its face, kind of like going to a steakhouse as a vegetarian (except turning around and writing a poor review of that steakhouse would be well, poor judgment) but hear me out. Their long menu of Peruvian classics, including ceviche, maduros, salchipapa, and rice and beans are prepared amazingly well and made even more delicious by their famous green sauce. I recommend calling ahead and ordering a bunch of food to go and eat with a few friends so you can sample a wide variety of dishes. I did just that and had a veritable 5 star feast.

I think I need to dedicate a section of my review to the green sauce. Zesty, creamy, spicy-- aji verde is a beautiful combination of cilantro, onion, garlic, mayo, mustard, and jalapenos. It goes with pretty much any savory food and can punch up even the blandest dish. It&apos;s also developed such a following that they even sell the sauce by the pint, and it is totally worth it. I pretty much douse every bite in the stuff.

I follow a pescatarian diet and was happy to find multiple seafood options on the menu, including calamari and two types of ceviche. I went with the mixto, which included generous pieces of shrimp, octopus, and calamari marinated in a lime and pepper juice. This paired wonderfully with a number of different carb options, which I rotated through, including rice &amp; beans, maduro, and salchipapa. Every bite was better than the last, and I found myself reaching for more food long after I became full.

I&apos;m happy to have been indoctrinated into the Pio Pio cult, even as a non-chicken eater. I&apos;ve been sleeping on the rest of their food, but now that I&apos;m privy to it, I&apos;ll certainly be back for more."
5,"Perhaps the best Peruvian chicken I&apos;ve ever had.

I grabbed a few items for dinner from here including a half chicken, arroz chauffa and some really interesting item called saltipapa. It took about 15 minutes for the food to be ready.

The chicken itself was half shire and half dark meat but the skin and meat were super flavorful and juicy. Far more flavorful than other Peruvian chicken places I&apos;ve been. It didn&apos;t need the green sauce it came with so I used that on the other dishes.

The chicken and soy sauce in rice were good. Lots of chicken in the rice.

The saltipapa is just a bunch of hot dogs cut up and mixed with French fries. I&apos;ve never had it before but this was good. The fries were on the soggier side and the hot dogs tasted similar to the Hebrew national brand.

All in all I&apos;d come back here for the chicken itself and maybe a few sides."
4,"Greatest Peruvian rotisserie chicken with their special green sauce. 
Long narrow space. 
Good for lunch or dinner
The side salad is delicious. 
I always get the rice and beans. 
We never tried it but lots of people get the fries with hot dogs.  He read it&apos;s Nathans hot dogs. 
The food comes out fast 
The guys are very friendly here."
5,"so the first time I came here my friends ordered everything on the menu and boy oh boy did I indulge. I felt sick after eating so much, but I gave it another shot and now it&apos;s my go to take out! The avocado salad and dressing are AMAZING and same with the juanitas white meat chicken. Reasonably priced and always consistent. I love you Pío Pío"
5,Small location with a limited menu. The interior was really nice. Out waitress was nice and attentive. The food was DELICIOUS! THe chicken was so juicy! I&apos;m always skeptical about rotisserie chicken because sOmetimes it cane come out dry. NOT here! It was so flavorful! The rice  and beans were great. The Maduros were so tasty! Everything came out quick and hot. I will definitely be back!
5,"Came for the 2nd time in two weeks and this place is officially one of my FAVORITES. After finishing a movie at AMC Kips Bay, we called to order 2 1/2 chickens and plantains. A five minute walk later, the pick-up was ready as we brought the great post-movie snack home. This could easily become a tradition - catching an AMC Movie, ordering the food as we exit the theater, and ending the night with convenient yummy eats at Pio Pio. For only $10, you get 1/2 chicken with juicy meat and a side of spicy Peruvian green sauce that balances out the sweetness of the skin."
5,"Fun Peruvian restaurant near Times Square. There&apos;s a HUGE dining room downstairs and lots of family-friendly menu options, especially the rotisserie chickens. 

We had empanadas, which are made slightly differently in each South American country it seems, and the Pisco sours were tart and tasty. There are multiple kinds of ceviche to choose from--like at least 6 different types. I recommend the mix with octopus (ceviche mixto spicy). I do not recommend the hot dog and fries, unless you&apos;re like a ten year old. 

The service is very friendly, efficient, and great."
3,"Came here for dinner on a Tuesday evening, we were seated quickly but by the time we left there looked to be a short wait for tables. The location is pretty cramped and there is no air conditioning so it was a little uncomfortable for us on a hot summer day. 

I had the whole chicken along with rice and beans, which unsurprisingly proved to be far too much food so I had enough left over for lunch the next day. 

The chicken was juicy and had a nice flavor to it from the marinade, but it didn&apos;t bring any flavor to the chicken you couldn&apos;t easily find at almost any place serving this kind of meal in the city. to be honest I was expecting more based on the strong recommendations I&apos;d gotten. The quality was more in line with a grab and go type chicken place than a sit down restaurant. 

The portion sizes were pretty generous, and it certainly lends itself to family style occasions. Overall though, I don&apos;t see any reason to come here over the abundant less expensive alternatives available for that type of dining."
4,"This place looks small as you go in but as you walked down a semi long corridor with several seats, you can spot a whole new floor downstairs with lots of open space and more seating. We arrived on a Saturday night at 10:30 pm and the place was pretty packed but there were a few tables open, lucky us! It&apos;s not very lit inside but the food options make your stomach most certainly light up! 

I ordered the anticuchos with papa a la huancaina and chicha morada to drink. Normally Peruvian restaurants serve canchita to snack while you wait but they didn&apos;t have that here. The drink was a bit bitter but it was drinkable. The anticuchos were very tasty, juicy and cooked well. The papa a la huancaina had the best sauce, I just wished the potatoes were peeled but either way I ate everything and left nothing on my plate. 

The waiter was very nice and brought some hot green sauce (my favorite!) but didn&apos;t come often to check if we needed water. I guess he may have been busy but next time, I hope the waiter I get is a little more attentive, given the fact I love hot sauce and my tongue will love some cold water to get the feeling back. 

One con I did see was that the prices were raised by $2.00 on certain things. Lucky me, my dishes were more than what the menu stated. Hope they fix it by my next visit!"
4,"I&apos;ve been dining here over the years and I&apos;ve always enjoyed the food and service. This is my first time eating here in a very long time but I must say that the quality hasn&apos;t changed at all, food and service wise. The chicken is still sumptuous, juicy and seasoned perfectly. The sides are good as well. The staff is always attentive and the food comes to you promptly. Perfectly priced as well. I took advantage of the lunch special. $12.50 for a quarter chicken (you can pick white or dark meat, no added charge) plus a side and drink. Very reasonable living here in NYC. I will be back of course!"
5,"This place has become one of my new routine delivery spots. I was recommended it by a friend and I&apos;m so happy I listened. 

There are multiple locations around NYC, so if this one isn&apos;t close, I&apos;m sure there&apos;s one that is! They keep it simple - chicken, rice, and avocado. That&apos;s it. But there&apos;s really no need to add anything else because the chicken and rice combo is perfection. 

The chicken is extremely juicy and has just the right amount of spice to give it that Caribbean kick. They somehow always provide a perfect avocado. It&apos;s truly remarkable that every avocado is completely spotless, you&apos;d think it was genetically enhanced. 

Anyways, try it out - you won&apos;t regret it."
4,"Excellent chicken! I had the signature &quot;Juanita Chicken&quot; and it was so flavorful and so juicy. The lunch special is a good deal. At $12.50, you get a 1/4 chicken (I got the dark meat), a small salad and a generous side of rice &amp; beans. You can choose other side but I had the rice and beans. I think it was tostones or plantains and a couple of other options. Plus the price includes a can of soda. Service was fast and friendly. I would definitely come back. It&apos;s a small space. So expect a wait during peak times. Yummy yummy!"
5,"How can it be possible that a chain can also be a hole in the wall gem? Go to piopio and find out for yourself. We&apos;ve always been to this location in Murray Hill and will be returning anytime we go to New York for the foreseeable future. Their green sauce is absolutely incredible and goes well with everything on the menu. Come with a crowd because the matador combo can feed four people comfortably, and the table can barely fit all the delicious food (a whole rotisserie chicken, fries with hot dogs=salchipapa, tostones with garlic sauce, avocado salad, beans and rice...). And all of these at an incredibly reasonable price. Also their sangria is super strong and delicious. I really can&apos;t reccomend this place enough!"
4,"I came here for the first time with a friend who said Pio Pio is lit. 

The seating arrangement at this location is a bit cramped, so it was not the most comfortable.

We ordered the sangria to start, which was delicious. It truly was on point. 

I know that Pio Pio is famous for their chicken but the fried seafood entree sounded interesting so we opted for that. It was very good and fresh, but I did not love the pickled tomatoes that were on top. 

The star of the meal was definitely the chicken. It is tender on the inside but the skin is crispy. Wow, mind blown. Also the French fries with sausage were quite good. I would definitely revisit Pio Pio again based on the food."
4,"It&apos;s been forever and a day (probably seven years) since I stepped foot in a Pio Pio. I have so many memories eating here almost weekly when I lived and worked closer to the city. Date night: Pio Pio. Friends getting together: Pio Pio. Family visiting: Pio Pio. You really can&apos;t beat the prices and the amount of food you get.

 Coming back was quite different as some things changed. Luckily, the flavor didn&apos;t -- and neither did the portions which was nice as I was hungry. 

The meals come out pretty quick which is always a plus. The only meh thing I have to say is that there&apos;s only a red sangria option. 

Other than that, the food was great, the portions were nice, and the service was pleasant."
5,The food especially the chicken and the green sauce is so good highly recommend pio pio.
5,"This is my favorite spot for quality Peruvian food in the city! Pio Pio has several locations, and this one is much smaller in size, with a reduced menu. I have been to the midtown west location and the overall ambience is much different here. My two friends and I were able to grab a table at 7:45 PM on a Friday with no wait though.

If you pop on over, make sure to get a hearty portion of rotisserie chicken. The best value is with the Matador combination that gives you chicken, rice and beans, fries &amp; sausage, and a veggie dish&apos;s The chicken is juicy, flavorful, and slides right off the bone - no dryness. The fries are crispy on the outside with a soft, squishy interior and coupled with satisfying, bitesized Nathan&apos;s hotdog sausages.

Definitely douse your meat in the green sauce: it&apos;s delicious! The shop also offers a light menu for drinks. They have assorted beers and a house Sangria that packs a punch."
