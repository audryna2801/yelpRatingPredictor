5,"Grand Central Terminal is still an iconic part of NYC&apos;s landscape from the stunning architecture to the eye-catching artwork to its huge utility to New Yorkers and travelers. that said, it is eerie to see it so empty and quiet during the pandemic.

many of the gems of GCT are easy to access like the giant ceilings displaying the constellations, marble structures, the whispering gallery, and so much more. the lack of people, the buzz of travelers and shoppers, and din of people dining in the food court really subtract from the energy level that we commonly associate with NYC.

the interior looks so clean because of cleaning, the pandemic measures, and the lack of travelers. 

trains do seem to be running on slower schedules, but trains do leave on-time now

drops mic cuz this is the new normal
i out
zzz"
5,"I visited here during COVID 19.  It&apos;s usually bustling, but currently it&apos;s mostly empty.  The architecture here is gorgeous, built in 1913 and restored in 1994.  Even if you&apos;re not going to take a train (which I do recommend), check out the vaulted ceilings decorated with constellations, the marble staircases and columns, and the amazing small details.  There is also a food hall and the facility often has art exhibits, however these were not available during the time I went.  It is worth seeing this famous landmark."
5,"Stunning artwork. Security everywhere. Great signage for the upcoming trains and where to find them. During COVID, the facility is clean and the staff have done a great job to keep it that way."
5,"Grand Central Terminal is one of NYC&apos;s greatest treasures. Saved from the wrecker&apos;s ball by the grace of the gods and some wonderful civic-minded New Yorkers, it stands proudly in mid-town as a blessed anachronism. The vast open space reaches skyward under the stars and reinforces the NYC tourist motto, &quot;look up&quot;. You can see the glory of the celestial painting these days thanks to a thorough cleaning that has revealed all of the original grandeur. To appreciate how dirty the ceiling was, look in the north west corner for the square that was left dirty to remind viewers what was done.

Stand on the steps overlooking the grand hall and watch the hustle and bustle that is the Big Apple. But you don&apos;t have to be taking a train to enjoy Grand Central. There are lots of shops, a fun and free train museum, a basement filled with decent fast food eateries and, my favorite, the Oyster Bar - have a chowder and a beer, you&apos;ll thank me later. There is also a classy bar on the upper level called The Campbell - a holdover from the private apartment of a train executive. 

Walk with your eyes open, looking at the polished fixtures like mail boxes and clocks to be reminded of a time when art and commerce joined hands to celebrate the adventure of train travel.

There are guided tours worth checking out and there is the whispering hall to find and explore. But, for me, the very best thing is the Christmas holiday laser light and music show traced against the sky mural. Fun and free! 

Last thing, this is a Terminal - not a Station. Get the name correct and you&apos;ll be recognized as a real &quot;New Yawk-er&quot;..."
5,"Grand Central Terminal is located at 42nd Street and Park Avenue but underground the station tracks cover to levels between Lexington and Madison Avenues and from 42nd to past 51th Street.

Besides being a train station it also has access the the New York City Subway. It covers 48 acres with 44 platforms, more than any other railroad station in the world. All of its platforms are underground. There are 30 tracks on the upper level and 36 on the lower. However only 43 are used for passengers. The total number of tracks along the platforms and in the rail yards exceeds 100. 

Some things to see

1. The giant zodiac celestial ceiling 
2. The whispering gallery
3. A multi-million dollar clock
4. The beauty of Tiffany windows
5. Statue of the Gods and Eagles
6. Tennis court and club
7. Underground secret passageways"
5,This terminal has so much history and amazing architecture. I could spend hours in here checking it all out. Most of the food area is closed right now but usually it&apos;s hopping.
5,"Not to be confused with Grind Central, which is a butcher shop, or Ground Central, which is where you can buy asphalt. 

Of course, it&apos;s still one of the greatest train stations in the world and the most iconic in New York City. Very different to nearby Penn Station which I use a lot more, which seems underground and less fancy or impressive by a long way.

I&apos;m a huge fan for sure and I think it&apos;s as beautiful as it is memorable as it is unforgettable as it is iconic. And now since they added the massive food court underground with so many different food options including a legendary New York gem in Doughnut Plant, it&apos;s hard not to love it even more.

And if this were where informants and snitches were &quot;persuaded&quot; by the Mafia not to testify, then it&apos;d be &quot;Clammed Central.&quot; Speaking of clammed, I was wondering, if you eat a bad clam, can you get clam-ydia?

I feel like there&apos;s no good information about this out there, it&apos;s all very Clam-destine. If it&apos;s true then we have to clam-p down on it, to stop it spreading. The same way you have to stop your sister from &quot;spreading&quot; when she&apos;s very drunk and hanging out with unsavoury characters. Speaking of unsavoury characters, if you&apos;re a dessert maker who bakes sweets and cakes, then you are by definition unsavoury.

Speaking of Cake, I want a girl with a long... jacket. And there are plenty of girls with long jackets at Grand Central Terminal. And that, my dear... is how you come full circle. If you&apos;d like me to show you again how to come... full circle, then we&apos;ll take care of that after this review.

I can see myself coming back here just for food on many occasions in future, and when it was time to get my citizenship and I came to New York for my lawyer, he&apos;s right across from Grand Central, so I most certainly came over here and I most certainly had a great time exploring the Grand Central food court, without ever needing to catch a train, although I&apos;ve come here on trains on many occasions and will continue to do so in future. Getting a train from here to Boston when I was younger, to fly to England, is a great memory.

If this was where you do last minute exam revisions, it&apos;d be &quot;Crammed Central.&quot; If this was where the Stones, Beatles, and everyone since, hung out, then it&apos;s &quot;Band Central.&quot; 

What I love doing whenever I visit Manhattan, is driving up the long inclined approach road, and through the little tunnels either side of the Terminal along Park Avenue. It&apos;s one of my fave little driving experiences of New York City. I have some personal history in those tunnels too, regarding something I purchased from Blowout Video. Oh the memories.

And if you keep getting junk mail from this station, it&apos;s because it&apos;s &quot;Spammed Central.&quot; 

The other thing I love is going inside. So to speak. Ahem. Not just to catch a train (or an STD if you prefer, what happens in the Terminal Bathroom stays in the Terminal Bathroom), but to marvel at how ornate and stunning the interior and the architecture are. It&apos;s really amazing in here, like stepping back into the posh part of the 1930s or something.

And if you think the applause and laughter you hear when you board a train is fake, that&apos;s because it&apos;s &quot;Canned Central.&quot; 

This railway station is one of the most &quot;Grand&quot; in the whole world, hence the name. American &quot;railroad stations&quot; are not usually much of a big deal. The old ones in Buffalo (abandoned), Boston (very much in use) and DC (also used) are all stunning and palatial and awe-inspiring, but none moreso than Grand Central in NYC.

If you lay on top of a train in summer instead of inside the carriage, you can get &quot;Tanned Central.&quot; 

Even though it&apos;s smaller than almost everything around it, including the humongous MetLife building that dwarfs it from behind. It&apos;s just so gorgeous and ancient and magnificent and palatial looking that it still manages to be the centerpiece of the whole East Side of Midtown Womanhattan.

In this way the Terminal is like my equipment. It&apos;s smaller than everything else, and yet it is still special just because it&apos;s so old looking.

And to be clear, this is where trains come, not planes. Otherwise it&apos;d be Land Central.

I&apos;ve taken trains out of GCT now about 10 times, mostly awhile ago, heading for Connecticut, New England, and so on, where I have some very good friends. I have to say, taking trains in and out of Manhattan is a real thrill. It was a pleasure to become a part of history. I was surprised at how quiet it was on all three occasions, all of which were summer or autumn evenings. I&apos;ve heard it&apos;s one of the busiest train stations in the whole world, but it certainly wasn&apos;t on any of the days I was here. I think it was just a case of timing, though. It&apos;s one of the 2 busiest stations in the USA. The other is Penn Station, which is where all the Amtrak trains come and go from.

And if you&apos;re in the mood to enjoy yourself and don&apos;t have any toys or implements to get the job done, just use your &quot;Hand Central.&quot;"
5,"GCT is a marvel in old world NYC and art deco elements. It&apos;s quiet now with less travelers and it kind of makes it even better for photography.

The ceiling is lit in this beautiful blue green, with a slightly inaccurate depiction of the stars....that really just depends on your perspective. Its Sumer clean for the number of people who pass through a day"
5,"Of all the 3 times that I have been to the Big Apple... I have been to Other famous landmarks of New York City like Empire State Building, Times Square, Central Park, Coney Island and exc... During my past 3 previous trips to New York City Grand Central Terminal was the one place that, I missed due to other fun activies that got in the way!!!

But on my 4th trip back to the Big Apple this time I finally had the chance to go visit The Grand Central Terminal I know that this famous landmark of New York City was used in a lot of movies... As soon as I walked inside with my family...  

All I can say is that this place is huge... And you can easily get lost completely if you don&apos;t know where your going!!! For me I would call this The Grand Central Terminal as a mouse trap!!! Now that I finally got the chance to visit this Historic land mark and all I can say is that I was here!!!"
5,"The opening scene of Gossip Girl was here at Grand Central and ever since then I always wanted to come here. Now I can see why it&apos;s called &quot;Grand&quot;. It&apos;s gigantic and very crowded for pretty much all hours of the day. 

The high ceiling, arched windows, and surrounded with beaming lights doesn&apos;t quite look like the usual train station. It gives me a bit of a museum vibe. Gotta swing by here to see it for yourself if you&apos;re in NY."
5,"I was in New York City meeting a friend, after having met said friend, we separated and I was on my own. I had made a small list of place I wanted to visit, and Grand Central Station was at the top of my list.

I hopped in a cab from my Air B&amp;B and whizzed over to GCC. It is located on 42nd street and Park Ave in the Midtown Manhattan area. There is a big information kiosk at the middle with loads of helpful information. The gal that helped me out helped me find a shuttle that took me to the airport instead of hopping on a train. The inside of the main terminal has lavish pieces of all over it, including on the ceiling. There are huge arched windows all along the top of the terminal that let in natural light. The terminal itself is an artery to the city with veins of trains that let you go mostly anywhere. 

Overall; add it to your list of stops, you won&apos;t regret taking in this beautiful piece of American history."
5,"I&apos;ve been to Grand  Central station twice but have actually ally not ridden on it. You would think you urinate would actually ride a train from this station but it&apos;s more than that. Plenty of people visit this place because it is absolutely beautiful. 

The inside is gigantic with pretty much a  painted mural on top. The lights are also pretty and during the Christmas season, it becomes red and green. 

Plenty of walkways where you&apos;ll find a pretty modern looking food court with different types of cuisine. I have heard the seafood one is pretty good. 

Also inside the station is a bar called The Campbell, so if you want to grab a drink, this is a pretty good choice. 

PS- Walking around at night is less crowded and you&apos;ll be able to take more photos in my opinion."
5,"Grand Central Terminal is a beautiful train station. It&apos;s located at 42nd Street and Park Avenue in Midtown Manhattan. According to Wikipedia, the terminal is the third-busiest train station in North America, after New York Penn Station and Toronto Union Station. Its Beaux-Arts design incorporates numerous works of art. Grand Central covers 48 acres and has 44 platforms, more than any other railroad station in the world.

The first Grand Central Terminal was built in 1871 by Cornelius Vanderbilt. The original Grand Central became obsolete when steam locomotives were banned after a catastrophic train collision in 1902 that killed 17 and injured 38. The new Grand Central Terminal officially opened on February 2, 1913.  The beautiful building with its massive marble staircase, 75-foot windows, and Zodiac ceiling was an immediate hit, and is still admired by millions today. Grand Central Terminal is one of the world&apos;s ten most visited tourist attractions.

If you have a chance to visit, make sure you look up at the Zodiac ceiling, beautiful arches and fabulous arched windows, you won&apos;t be alone when doing this! There is a huge food court on the lower level, with something for everyone. But you better be patient if you plan on grabbing a Shake Shack burger!"
5,"I don&apos;t travel to the city too often these days but when I do, 90% of the time I take metro north railroad.
Grand central is so beautiful. I love all the different food, shop &amp; vendor options. I&apos;ve never had a bad experience... except for the one time when I missed my train... literally by seconds. I was in the platform about to get on and the doors closed. The conductor was there too but wouldn&apos;t open the door. ‍"
4,Due to covid grand central is empty most day even during rush hour. All the trains are operating on off peak time and I love it! Photos you see in movies or people who take at 5am you can now capture at 6pm. I doubt the opportunity will ever present itself again. It&apos;s just unfortunate a pandemic is the reason.
5,"Beautiful Place! Must visit!
Lots of places to eat and a great place to meet. 
Great historic site."
5,"Grand Central is one of those iconic places that every person should have on their bucket list along with the Statue of Liberty, the pyramid of Giza, etc. I&apos;ve been here probably a dozen times over the year give and take a few or add a few. NYC isnt&apos; my favorite city...sorry but I love Boston I cannot lie... 

One of the things I didn&apos;t realize until recently is what a top notch destination this place is for great food. I don&apos;t live in NY so I&apos;m sure New Yorkers all know this...On my most recent visit I attended a private event at one of the restaraunts in here-another thing I didn&apos;t know was the place has fine dining. Wow. What&apos;s next secret passages to Hogwarts and a special entrances for Hobbits? Next time when I&apos;m here for comic con I&apos;m going to look..."
4,"Whether or not train travel is in your plans, Grand Central Terminal deserves to be on your checklist when you&apos;re in NYC.Probably you would have seen it lot of movies/television.

Awesome architectural gem famed for its elaborate details such as the magnificent celestial ceiling mural and the iconic four-faced clock, worth an estimated $10-20 million, in the main hall.

Commuting aside, the depot is also somewhat of a hot spot for food and beverage, with an ever-popular dining concourse filled with only New York-based business such as Shake Shack and Magnolia Bakery, food hall and four fine-dining restaurants.

Pros:
----------
Amazing Architecture
Free Tourist Spot
Lot of Food Options
Great for Photo shoots

Fun Fact: A rocket once left a hole in Grand Central&apos;s ceiling."
3,"This is truly an iconic building, still fully functioning and structurally sound. It makes me sad to see how our Michigan station was left in such disrepair, but Ford will turn it around soon enough. 

The chandeliers in the main hall are still lighted up and beautiful today. It still feels grandeur and such a notable spot for so many movies I have seen over the years.

The shops inside and outside come and go but the building stays serenely sound and gives off the energy to all of the passerby&apos;s of the stories house within the walls of this grand station. It still looks magnificent today."
5,All roads (tracks) lead in and out of Grand Central. It is amazing when you pull in. The first thing  you do  is bring your eyes up to the ceiling. Amazing!!!! The efficiency of how this place is unreal. I have literally never gotten on a train which runs late. When you a stand in the station you are at the crosswalk of seeing and hearing people from all walks of life and from every where in the world. It&apos;s amazing to just stand there and people watch and see how everyone reacts. What a magnificent place. You stand there and the history just permeates every thing there. They have plenty of places to grab something to eat or grab a snack or drink. A really cool place.
