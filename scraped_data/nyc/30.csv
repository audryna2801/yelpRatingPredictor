5,"My wife and I came here during restaurant week since we had been wanting to try this place for a while. Restaurant week menu is fixed. It includes minestrone soup as an appetizer, mushroom lasagna as the entree and dark chocolate chunk cookie for dessert. The minestrone soup was very hearty. The mushroom lasagna was a perfect combination of creamy yet crispy and very filling (perfect option for vegetarians) and did not fall apart. The chocolate chunk cookie was huge! It was soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside. A perfect end to a delicious meal! We will definitely come back again post covid to dine in (the inside space is beautiful)."
5,"Delicious food and excellent service.  We enjoyed the Arctic Char Tartare, Chicken Liver Pate, Pork Loin, and Burger - all were spectacular.

We come for a special occasion and Gramercy Tavern always makes it feel special.  The outdoor space for Covid-19 is nice. It feels safe as the restaurant spaces tables far apart and takes temperatures on arrival.  There&apos;s hand sanitizer on the table that serves as a nice keepsake."
5,"Ordered delivery and had a good experience. The Tavern Bacon &amp; Cheddar Burger and grilled sea bass were excellent, and though it got kind of mushed in transit, the apple crumble was incredible. Obviously it&apos;s not the same as dining in, but I&apos;ll take it!"
5,"Like many people said, Gramercy Tavern is truly phenomenal. It has been on our wishlist, and finally tried it through Restaurant Week 2021. This place far exceeded our sky-high expectation. Everything was perfect. I mean everything- the dish, restaurant ambiance, and customer service. I would like to add more stars if I can.

* Restaurant Week 2021 menu : mushroom lasagna, minestrone soup and a triple chocolate chunk cookie.

The menu doesn&apos;t sound special. But Gramercy Tavern elevated the dish up to the level of art. I expected mushroom lasagna might be creamy and a little bit oily, but it was not a usual lasagna dish. There was nothing like pouring sauces/ingredients. Rather it was dry that I could taste layer by layer. It was crispy, flavorful, and tasted healthy. The soup also had mind-blowing depth of flavor. The cookie was delicious, too - I could sense bittersweet dark chocolate taste. Every food had such deep flavors that it was like savoring the taste of harmony. I&apos;d say the experience was similar to that when we drink a good wine.

The restaurant had a classically beautiful interior setting and cozy ambiance. The staffs looked cheerful. We will definitely visit again for dining. It is a must dine restaurant."
4,"Restaurant Week 

Mushroom lasagna, minestrone soup, triple chocolate chunk cookie 

I&apos;ve always wanted to try Gramercy Tavern but not gone around to. Perfect timing/such a coincidence I found other restaurant week spots on the same street so Gramercy Tavern here I come. 

I read some reviews that the mushroom lasagna is the dry type and some people call it flavorless. I agree to both. It was surprisingly bland. I would expect pesto or something to go with it. 
Mushrooms on the side (or it just felt out oops) tasted more tart than eating the lasagna as a whole. 
The size seemed a bit small for a main course but it works out they give a soup and cookie too. 

Minestrone soup 
This is less tomatoy than other minestrones I&apos;ve had. It&apos;s nice in its own way being very homey and warm (flavorwise). The abundance of beans and chickpeas make this very filling. 
Overall not a personal fave

Triple chocolate chunk cookie 
Omg this. First of all it&apos;s huge, size of my hand. It has a crunchy outside and border with the insides more chewy!!! The outside is slightly too hard for my liking but still good. I feel like they used brown butter with since it&apos;s so rich and has some caramel depth. As for the triple chunk, I wonder how they count that. I think there was just one chocolate piece in my cookie. It was a nice dark chocolate though. It seems like there were small white chocolate bits (not whole chunks) scattered across the bottom. I came across three ish pieces. They were surprise finds. 

But yes as you can tell the cookie sold me. I&apos;m open to trying Gramercy Tavern again for other items."
4,"COVID delivery review. 

I ordered the burger, the mushroom lasagna, and a cocktail. The burger patty was thick and flavorful but the bun unfortunately was soggy when it arrived. The mushroom lasagna I popped into the microwave and then it was delicious. But it was also quite lukewarm upon arrival. The cocktail was listed on the menu as for two but when it arrived it was only one serving which was pretty disappointing. 

I didn&apos;t get the full experience that eating in would provide so I look forward to trying it post-covid and hopefully upping the rating to 5 stars."
3,"As part of our Tavern Burger Competition, my friends and I ordered the &quot;Tavern Bacon &amp; Cheddar Burger&quot; from Gramercy Tavern compared this to Minetta Tavern&apos;s &quot;Black Label Burger&quot;. All of us thought that the latter won by a landslide.

We thought that Gramercy Tavern&apos;s version, although solid, was simply not worth the $32 price point. It tasted like a really good burger but was pretty ordinary otherwise. If I&apos;m paying that much for a burger, it better knock my socks off."
4,"No doubt a top New Yorker restaurant, with impecable service, superb wine list and lavish and comfortable interior( copper pans and flames in  the open part of the kitchen wine ) .
Food was ok. Just expected more from my main course, eggplant parmigiana. Looked more like a lazy Sunday  dish with roughly cut peppers (with skin!) , the last eggplant in the fridge, some cheese on the top. 
(Not a Michelin star dish, in my humble opinion.
The Brussels sprout salad with pears was superb, though."
5,"Still my vote for the best special occasion dinner in NYC. What to expect: wonderful service - always warm, knowledgeable, and attentive - and consistently excellent food and drink, even with a more abbreviated menu than usual during these pandemic times.

We reserved an early table in order to guarantee that we could eat outdoors to celebrate a dear friend&apos;s birthday. A warm greeting from the host was followed by COVID precautionary instructions en route to the table (a small bottle of hand sanitizer was on every table as well). We started things off with a sparkling wine from Sonoma and a half dozen oysters on the half shell. I&apos;m a Mainer, but will show Duxbury, MA some love, these were fairly high in salinity and tasted like the ocean. True love on a plate.

Appetizers were quite good, if unremarkable: a butternut squash soup with broccoli rabe and a brussels sprouts and pear salad. I would have preferred more pear as a balance to the brussels sprouts&apos; natural bitterness, but all was still good and healthy.

Entrees were: a terrific and light - if you can believe it - house-made campanelle pasta with bolognese - and a well prepared grilled sea bass with sweet potatoes, bacon, and napa cabbage. I liked the sea bass and loved the bolognese, which included shiitake mushrooms, the ever present brussels sprouts, and pecorino. We ordered a side of fries, too, just because, and they also hit the spot.

An excellent, fruity and buttery brown sugar apple crumble with a birthday candle completed the meal, along with amaro to sip. Our server, Mackenzie (the name on the receipt, I hope I&apos;m not mistakened), gave excellent guidance on which amaro to sample, matching each of us at the table with a taste most to our liking.

Mackenzie shared that she had recently begun working at Gramercy Tavern - although it seemed like she&apos;d been there forever, offering excellent advice and exuding warmth from start to finish. She made the meal special and other servers and runners showed a similarly thoughtful energy. Each exuded a caring vibe making our presence feel truly welcomed. The restaurant business is a hard one, especially in these days of COVID. As we head into the winter, it is warm feelings like these that make Gramercy Tavern a place to return to often. If you have a special occasion, you can&apos;t go wrong here."
4,"Decent upscale-ish modern American food.

Service is exceptional here, and for my first-time experience, the kitchen gave me some complimentary dishes.

Gramercy Tavern covers so many different tastes, and use a wide variety of ingredients -- a true display of their culinary skills. During my meal, I ate raw fish, duck liver mousse, seafood, and chicken! A wide variety is sure to please anyone who comes here.

Overall, the food is good and leans more on the comfort food side. Although there is a variety of food, I feel like the flavors are a bit inconsistent, and you feel like you&apos;re eating fusion at times. Still, definitely a great place to come if you want to have a taste of NYC&apos;s palette."
5,"If I could only eat at one restaurant for the rest of my life, this would be it.  Going to Gramercy Tavern is one of the best parts of big occasions in my life lol. I&apos;ve been here for quite a few birthdays and anniversaries at this point, and everything is always top notch. Gramercy Tavern completely embodies Danny Meyer&apos;s approach to fine dining: excellent service, casual ambiance and world class food made with seasonal ingredients. I&apos;ve been to a lot of Michelin restaurants in NYC, including 2 and 3 star ones but Gramercy is my favorite because it&apos;s casual but the food and service are as good as they can get.

Their lunch prixe fixe is very reasonable for the experience you get. It&apos;s a 5 course meal, and they usually throw in additional desserts if it&apos;s a special occasion for you. They change the prixe fixe slightly every month or so, and it&apos;s been excellent everytime I&apos;ve been there (probably close to 10 times). I think the free bread is one of the measures of a fine dining restaurant, and Gramercy knocks it out of the park with this. They have freshly baked biscuits and goat cheese at the start of the meal, and it is GODDAMN AMAZING! Over my multiple visits I&apos;ve had a bunch of interesting things, the Smoked Arctic Char and a Poached Hake are particularly memorable - both were the softest and tastiest pieces of fish I&apos;ve ever had.

I&apos;d definitely go for the dining room experience, and not the bar seating. I&apos;ve done that once and it was nowhere close to the full experience you get in the dining room. They&apos;re doing outside seating now and I plan on checking out, but really hoping USHG and Gramercy make it out of this pandemic fine. I know where I&apos;ll be going to celebrate once all this is over!"
5,"5 Star experience for sure! 

We dined here Valentine&apos;s Day weekend for my hubby&apos;s birthday. Reservations were easy to make in advance via Resy, but were limited due to the popularity (and holiday weekend) of the restaurant. Everything is top notch-- from the decor, to the food, to the outstanding service. 

There are a few set menus to choose from, including a vegetarian option. If needed, they can accommodate a swap from one menu to another (just ask). 

The highlights of the night were the Brussel Sprout salad (not on the menu, complimentary with the progression), absolutely delicious rolls with goat cheese whipped butter (to die for!) and the Baklava ice cream dessert. Honestly, everything was really good, but these are the dishes that left me wanting more! 

I added in the Resy notes that we were celebrating my hubby&apos;s bday and they brought out a delicious coconut meringue cake with candle and birthday message-- definitely made our night and the cake was amazing! They even sent us with a to-go treat of banana chocolate chip coffee cake for the next day. 

I would definitely return if in the city again!"
5,"Very pleasant surprise being taken here by a friend! I loved the entire dining experience and glad that we had a formal dinner reservation for the three whole courses.

Interior - GT has lots of modern and traditional art elements going into its decor. There&apos;s a front bar/dining area for casual dining, which can get a bit crowded on Fridays, and a large back dining area for formal dinners. I love that idea of having both! Ambience was amazing, formal yet not uptight.

Service - there&apos;s coatcheck. Our servers were the best couple in town! They were so friendly and cute, and worked really well together. They settled us in, regularly checked up on us to make sure everything tasted right. My napkin was replaced when I left my seat for the bathroom, bread crumbs were swept away in between courses, and silverware was placed the right directions. They did the whole nine. Way to go :)

Food - I am not gonna go into too much detail about the food cuz everything tasted amazing anyways. Just check out the pics. I think this place deserves to be called an NYC landmark and I can&apos;t wait to be back!"
5,"Brought my boyfriend here for his birthday. He had never been, we sat in the main dining room and did the tasting menu. 
From the moment of arrival the hostess was so friendly and they were aware of my allergies. They checked my coat and brought us right over to the table. We had. A great table. 
The food was stellar and the wine was fantastic. This was pre Covid but we plan to go back this weekend for a tavern burger ... one of the best burgers in the city. They are now taking reservations for outside seating!!"
3,"Only stand out dish was the Crudo and peaches were good but it was just cut peaches!
Artic char was bland and pork loin was just ok. We weren&apos;t able to get any service when trying to ask for water or the bill, possibly in a blind spot isolated in corner. Overall food was ok with the Crudo being a stand out but a bit too much sauce"
4,"4 Star experience for sure! My highest rating, always room for improvement.

5,"Yes, Gramercy Tavern truly deserves the rave reviews that it gets. The ambience, decor, and yes, the food are all five stars all around. My friend and I came here and decided to try the seasonal tasting menu. For drinks I got the Orchard Thief which was sweet but not cloying and had the right amount of alcohol in it for lack of better terms. To be frank, all of the cocktails looked amazing. Now, the food in order of which they came in!

Marinated Scallops- I&apos;ve typically had scallops served warm so this was a nice twist since they were served in a cold soup for lack of better terms. The scallops are not your typical diver scallops size and I think are just pieces of them (or any type of scallop) at that. 

Poached Lobster- this dish provided a great contrast to the scallops as it was served warm with this creamy base that I can&apos;t quite describe. It was very flavorful and I think it had saffron in it as well (obviously not sure). Either way, it was very good.

Smoked Trout- I don&apos;t know if &quot;smooth like butter&quot; is the right way to describe fish, but that&apos;s how this trout was. Though the garnishes seemed a bit unnecessary, the trout itself was cooked perfectly.

Tagliarini- I want a gigantic bowl of this dish to-go in every cold rainy day. All jokes aside, the pasta is amazing with the sausage, clams, and tomato (and this is coming from someone who hates raw tomatoes). 

Duck Breast and Confit- to conclude the prix fixe menu, the duck was served last which made complete sense since it had much stronger flavors than the others. An adequate amount of duck was given and albeit everything was given in relatively small portions, since there&apos;s five courses you will definitely be more than satisfied at the end.

On a side note, for dessert the prix fixe menu had caramel pears but we were allowed to choose dessert items from the general menu as well and followed suit. Unfortunately I don&apos;t remember the names of them but one was basically a chocolate bar (I&apos;m so eloquent, I know) and the other was matcha based and had strawberries. Both were very good and big portions as well. All in all, Gramercy Tavern deserves all the praise that it gets and is definitely worth a trip. 

PS- the bread is AMAZING. Yes it&apos;s just bread but it&apos;s so good. It&apos;s hard not to get full just by eating it lol."
5,"People always talk about the bar burger here, so I went and ordered the bar burger. And it is now one of my top 5 burgers in NYC.

It&apos;s simple, but perfect. Melted cheddar, topped with bacon, on a toasted bun. Side of duck fat crisps. In terms of &quot;basic&quot; burgers, it&apos;s a damn good one. At $32, it&apos;s definitely &quot;treat yourself&quot; territory, but it&apos;s bucket list worthy.

A quick note - the bar menu is different from the restaurant menu. They have a different burger at the restaurant. Grab a seat at the bar (they maintain their own list so you don&apos;t need to check in with the hostesses) and bonus points if it&apos;s happy hour (4 to 6). Can&apos;t beat $8 beers and $12 wines/cocktails! The Portside spritz I had was delightful.

The bar staff was also incredibly pleasant and friendly. They took the time to explain the menu items (and to commend my choices). Plus, they got me started with the best foccacia I&apos;ve ever had (basil, sun-dried tomatoes, and Concord raisins). I was tempted to say yes when they offered me a second one, but didn&apos;t want to fill up on bread ahead of the burger.

Was also served a tiny, tiny amuse bouche - Romano salad with eggplant puree. What a wonderful and delicious surprise. They really take care of you here!

All in all, I&apos;m a big fan of Danny Meyer restaurants, and was glad to tick another one off the list. And since it&apos;s USHG, tips are included. So that $32 burger is more like... $29.

Worth it."
4,"We had a lovely meal to celebrate our anniversary. A few very small service hiccups, but overall the service was fantastic and the food delicious.

We were seated at a middle table along a booth, but the corner table had been cleared (but not yet set) so I asked to be moved, which we were. I&apos;m not sure why they wouldn&apos;t have just sat us there from the onset instead of in very close proximity to the neighboring table. We were given complimentary glasses of Prosecco to start the celebration. 

We opted for the seasonal, 6-course tasting menu and ordered drinks (3 glasses of wine between us) off the menu. Warm cabbage broth came out first and it was amazing. We were blown away by the depth of flavor. Fluke crudo was the first course. Flavors were delicious but a few pieces were a tad stringy. We ordered glasses of wine after the first course. The seared scallops were placed in front of us and then our waiter came over to give us wine tastes and chat about the wines. Thought that timing to be a bit odd - he should have come over before the food came so the food wasn&apos;t sitting in front of us while he was speaking to us. The scallops were amazing. 

Next came Arctic char that alone was unimpressive but together as a complete dish was wonderful and packed with flavor.  Squid ink pasta with lobster was next but they also offered a pasta with comte cheese and white truffles for an additional charge. We ordered 1 and were able to enjoy both pasta dishes. Both were perfection. A perfectly seared beef dish brought the savory dishes to an end. It was perfectly cooked and perfectly seasoned. A palate cleanser of apple and pomegranate did just that. 

Poached pears with ice cream was surprisingly good. I thought the texture of the pear a bit odd - more of a crunch than I expected but my husband really enjoyed it. A surprise coconut cake with a whipped merengue for our anniversary was delicious but he doesn&apos;t like coconut so I ate (most of) it. 2 Chocolate truffles and take home mini chocolate chip banana bread loaves (for the morning) rounded out our meals.

Service was wonderful - on top of everything without being obtrusive."
4,"I was excited to eat here after reading the reviews and because I have some friends who swear by this place special occasions. I work for a nonprofit, so eating at Michelin-rated restaurants isn&apos;t exactly a hobby (yet, lol). However, I decided to go with 3 friends for dinner and treat myself for once. 

Food: We split the chicken liver mousse appetizer, which was quite good, if small (only 4 pieces of bread, but you can ask for more...yay?). Those of us who got the grilled pepper chicken main dish found it really juicy, delicious, and just the right size, but my friend who got the cioppino was disappointed (it did look like a very small dish...). We did split a bottle of their riesling, which was AMAZING...and only $56 for a bottle. Service - quick, attentive, and following all the COVID regulations. Temperature check needed to use the restroom. Outdoor seating is especially nice since they closed off the street, so you don&apos;t get any of that fun Manhattan car noise. 

Did I end up having a nice time and good food? Yes! Was it worth the price I paid ($76)...maybe? I think I was expecting more &quot;wow,&quot; but it was a sufficiently fancy Friday! :)"
