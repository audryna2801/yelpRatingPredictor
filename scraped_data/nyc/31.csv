5,"I&apos;ve been to the city many times, but I have always passed by the Empire State Building. What&apos;s special about it? 
First of all, we were staying in the city and happened to be walking by. Seeing that tours were still available, I hopped onto my phone, chose a time within 15 minutes, easily checked out, and got in line. After an extremely short wait, the attendant told us that there was very low visibility. She suggested trying later or on another day. She also said that the time on the ticket was not an issue, and that the passes could be used up to a full year from now. We were grateful for that insight and kindness. 
Later in the day, we came back when it was much clearer out. Our temperatures were checked, social distancing enforced, limited capacity was enforced, and everyone was masked and gloved. All of the employees we met were very nice. The displays were fun, interesting and informative. At the top, there were heaters outside to fight the chill. 
The view was amazing. We were there at the perfect time of day to see the sun set. I can&apos;t believe that I had always brushed off this landmark! 
I would definitely encourage people to come here. It is great for all ages!"
4,"I&apos;ve been wanting to visit the Empire State Building since I was 16 so I finally get to check it off my NYC Bucket List.  

The building is a hybrid of old and new.  Great historical/fun facts and celebrity photos as you self guide through the building.  

I purchased 2 tickets at the total cost of $182.92 for the sunset peak time for both the 86th and 102nd observation decks about a month ahead of time and unfortunately there were a lot of clouds that day.  As the sky got darker and the lights in the city came on it was really great for photos.  I am a little sad there was no beautiful sunset to watch that day.

The 86th observation deck is completely outdoors and there are some heat lamps that emit a red hue that makes your photos look terrible.  The corners have the perfect backdrop for photos but no one helps facilitate the crowds so you&apos;re stuck waiting for extended periods so that&apos;s pretty annoying.  

The 102nd observation deck is a modern addition with unobstructed floor-to-ceiling windows.  You take a glass elevator from the 86th floor to the 102nd floor which very small but you can walk around the perimeter and have 360 degree views. 

I took off one star because the staff was so freaking miserable at all interactions.  The staff for the elevators and observation decks were disgruntled, irritated, pushy and just rude.  You are located at the world&apos;s most famous building and you have to interact with people so this is not the job for you!

Timed ticket entry was definitely a plus during Covid but I won&apos;t be back to visit - once was enough."
5,"I came back to Empire State Building at the end of 2020  after the first visit in 10 years ago, and it was such a fun experience.

10 years ago; it was hours of long wait on the line and crowd of people. No relax space taking pictures.

Now; it might be because of COVID-19, but there are much less people this time and could enjoy the view taking time. So many picture spot and great staffs. 
Only missing was a cafe which was closed because of the situation. I always love to stop by cafe at scenery locations.

I would love to come back again."
5,"I had the good fortune of looking off the top of the then, tallest building in the world in 1968! Before I went up in the elevators(we had to switch back then) the tallest building Id gone up in was probably a few stories.

So, I was impressed by the pressure difference of the air as it changed going up. It seemed fast too. Then, all of a sudden we stopped, got off and I thought we were at the top but, just changing cars, to go all the way up. I&apos;ll never forget how bracing the chill of the air was when I stepped out of the door onto the walkway around the observation deck. I was mesmerized by the giant hooks that were seemingly there to keep me from falling off. I didn&apos;t realize till a few years later they were to keep people from jumping!

It&apos;s one of my best childhood memories and I haven&apos;t been back. Recently, I looked up at the fabulous building as I walked by and wondered briefly, if I should go up but, decided I didnt want to ruin that perfect childhood memory.

However, If you havent been go as soon as it opens back up!!!! Mesmerizing!"
5,"Had a wonderful time visiting the Empire State Building. During the pandemic, tickets were timed to ensure social distancing which was great. I remember visiting the building a few years ago and the lines of tourists were seen in different check points. Glad we didn&apos;t need to spend time waiting in line this time around. I felt very safe as hand sanitizers were also available everywhere.

Temperature was checked. You can also bring personal belongings such as backpack etc. There were scanners just like at an airport. There are many newly renovated and interactive exhibitions throughout the 2nd, 80th and 86th floors. View from the 86th floor is spectacular. Although it was very cloudy the day we went, it was rather a different kind of view and experience. We were literally on cloud 9! 

The most exciting exhibition to me had to be the King Kong. You could feel the vibration...try it out! The art made by Stephen Wiltshire was simply incredible. And don&apos;t forget to check out the gift shop. We also got the group photo which had some nice backdrop. 

Empire State Building is iconic, full of history and a must place to go visit. Did I also mention that the movie &quot;Sleepless in Seattle&quot; is one of my favorites? I kept thinking about the scene where Meg Ryan went to check out the deck and saw the backpack left on the 86th floor. It&apos;s one of the most romantic places to visit if you are in NYC. Happy holidays!!"
5,"I had the opportunity to go on a private VIP tour of the Empire State Building (hosted) at 10AM before the building opens to the public. 

We got really lucky and the weather was amazing &amp; the sky was clear. There are safety measures in place ~ high tech machines in the lobby take your contactless temperature. Elevators indicate where to stand to maintain distance &amp; visitors are limited at this time. 

First we went to the 86th floor outdoor observatory. Here we could see everything from Freedom Tower to the Statue of Liberty. The views are absolutely stunning. From there we went up the cool glass elevator 18 floors to 102 which is a fairly new 360 degree indoor observation deck with floor to ceiling windows. There&apos;s also stairs to go up to the highest outdoor landing that is reserved for special photographers and celeb guests. 

If you haven&apos;t been now is the perfect time for NYers to enjoy a crowdless visit. Iconic is an understatement."
4,"If you&apos;ve never been, now is the time to go. Due to covid-19, the crowds are staying away and you&apos;re at a low risk of infection on the 86th floor&apos;s outdoor space with the wind whipping fast enough to lose your hat over the edge. Supposedly, great ventilation is the key to minimizing airborne infection and you&apos;d need to go to NASA&apos;s wind tunnel to get more ventilation than on the top of the Empire State Building.
We had the entire outdoor space to ourselves and took a leisurely stroll on the top deck and took tons of unrushed pictures. The staff was very friendly and they were all gloved and masked; not that we ever found ourselves within 6 feet of them. 
It was $35 a piece to gain entry, but the price was well worth it considering we felt like we reserved the entire exhibit. 
The view is spectacular and exhilarating. The environment is safe. The price is worth it."
5,"I visited during COVID 19, so I had the whole place to myself.  All of the employees were so kind and helpful, even during this bizarre time.  I went during the morning and the evening.  I bought the express pass (which was not needed at this particular time) for each, but they have a regular pass that is discounted for day and night viewing in the same day.

There were a lot of fun photos, exhibits, and info.  There are also a lot of photo ops, especially the neat King Kong exhibit.  You can learn a lot of history while seeing different views from the 80th floor and the 86th open observatory.  Unfortunately the newest 102nd floor observatory was not open, but the open observatory was plenty enough in my opinion.

I recommend seeing during the day and the night.  They are very different experiences."
4,"The last time I went up the Empire State Building was probably about 15 years ago. It&apos;s just one of those things. If you live in NYC, it&apos;s kind of just there, and you would never really go.

Fast forward to 2020. A friend told me about a &apos;free&apos; photo shoot for Covid couples on the top of the building. I use the word, &quot;free&quot; loosely because while you do get 5 free professional shots, you still need to pay for the ticket to get up there, which ended up costing about $90 for two people. We knew it was kind of a ploy to get people to go, but we decided - how often do you get to have professional photos taken at the top of the Empire State? Plus, it was our wedding day! So it was a pretty easy decision. We signed up for a time slot online. There was an entry time slot and a photo shoot time slot. We were a bit late to for entry, but it didn&apos;t seem to matter. They have the lobby set up very socially distanced - lots of ropes and signs everywhere. We got up there in time for our photo shoot time slot, but was a bit of a mess because I don&apos;t think they anticipated just how many Covid couples would show up. We ended up waiting about an hour, but I would say it was worth it to get some nice photos. They took about 20, sent everything to us a few days later, and we got to pick 5 from which they remove the watermark.

As for the building itself, we didn&apos;t really stick around to explore too much. But I think it was probably because we live here. I&apos;m sure if we were tourists, we would have spent a lot more time there, and enjoyed the 360 views."
5,"Oh, how I miss looking up and seeing the Empire State Building specially at night to see how they did the lights and what colors they used.

I can remember watching as a kid, King Kong on TV and when my parents took to me on a trip to the observation deck and I looking around for the spot where Kong hit, surly he must have made a big hole.

And while there, learning that it was designed to have Air Ships moor at the top of the tower mast for passengers to disembark.

Well today other buildings are bigger with more modern amenities and features. But they never be the building that King Kong made famous."
2,Wasn&apos;t a good experience for me its way too overpriced we paid $98 just to take elevator look around and take a few pictures at the top of the building. Definitely not worth the money. They charged too much.
4,"I have visited the city that never sleeps aka New York City the big apple about 4 times and I have visited the Empire State Building once.... 

And all I can say is that the Empire State Building of New York City has a nice spectacular view... And best time to go and visit the Empire State Building is at night!!!"
4,"I recently went to the 102nd floor of the Empire State Building and it was really cool to see! I have previously done Top of the Rock and I believe the views are so much better than the Empire State Building. However, the ESB is an iconic landmark and it really is a beautiful building both in and out. 

It does seem like it takes so long to finally get to the top (security lines, more lines, more lines, and lines for lines...). It was a bit chaotic and a lot of the employees seemed miserable and/or confused. 

I had a much better experience at Top of the Rock but this was a fun visit, too. I probably won&apos;t ever come back to the ESB but I&apos;m glad I did visit."
4,"Everyone wants to see this iconic building right? And I am no exception - I only saw it from ground level and did not go inside - I will leave that for another visit.

Here are some interesting facts I found out about it..

It stands 103 stories tall (1,250 feet to top floor, excludes height of antennae, which is 204 feet).

The Empire State Building took only one year and 45 days to build, or more than seven million man-hours.

There are observatories on both the 86th and 102nd floors. They attract around four million visitors annually.

Couples can sometimes see sparks when they kiss due to the static electricity at the top of the building.

The building has been featured in several movies such as &quot;An Affair to Remember,&quot; &quot;Sleepless in Seattle,&quot; &quot;Elf&quot; and &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man.&quot;

Visitors can see 80 miles into New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts on a clear day.

The tower lights are turned off on foggy nights during the spring and autumn bird migration seasons, so the lights will not confuse birds and cause them to fly into the building.

It is the tallest Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)-certified building in the United States.

Every year on Valentine&apos;s Day, couples who marry on the 80th floor become members of the Empire State Building Wedding Club. They receive free admission to the observatory each year on February 14 (their anniversary) thereafter.

Over thirty people have jumped to their deaths from the Empire State Building.

The Empire State Building Run-Up is an annual race up the stairs to the 86th floor (1,576 steps).

William Lamb, an architect at the firm Shreve, Lamb &amp; Harmon, designed the Empire State Building.

The contractor was the firm Starrett Brothers and Eken.

The building has 24/7 security.

It is monitored with security technology, such as CCTV cameras.
The primary security screening for visitors is similar to airport security procedures."
5,"At the last minute we decided to go to the observation deck of the Empire State Building during our recent visit to NYC (December 2019).  I went online and got passes to the 86th floor and the 102nd floor - and went with the &quot;express pass&quot; (more on that later).

We started our visit by making our way straight to the 102nd floor and worked our way down.  I have to say they did an outstanding job with this observation deck! I didn&apos;t see it prior to the remodel but now there are floor to ceiling windows and they only allow a small number of guest at a time so it is not over crowded.  From here you can see the entire island of Manhattan!  We went at night and it was simply breathtaking!  You can walk all the way around and see the city from every angle! If you have never visited the city or it is your hundredth time - GO DO THIS!

From 102nd we went down to the 86th floor for the outside experience.  Again, we went at night, it was really chilly and the wind was blowing like crazy!  They do provide heat lamps all around the exterior and it does help, but even if it is not cold at ground level, it is colder that high up!  Amazing views!

From the ground you will take an elevator to the 80th floor, transfer to another elevator to the 86th floor and finally a third elevator to the 102nd floor.

There are historical pictures and a lot of information about the building on the ground level.  Also, at the end they have a big gift shop - lots of touristy items but some cool things too.  We picked up a Christmas ornament for our 2019 tree!

Here is the best information:  Go online first and buy your tickets in advance!  We got the &quot;express pass&quot; with access to both the 86th and 102nd floors.  We went on a Sunday night around 9 pm and to tell you the truth, we didn&apos;t need the express pass.  If you go during a busy time of the year you would need it for sure!  I didn&apos;t mind though because we got on and off elevators right away anyway.  Speaking of elevators - they have a cool video on the roof of the main one that takes you to the 80th floor.  Its cool to watch as you make your way to the top!

We had a great time doing this. It is nothing like the World Trade Center (it would be like apples and oranges) - and I think anyone of any age would love to see the view.  I really enjoyed going at night, but on the next visit we are going to buy tickets for the &quot;sunrise&quot; or &quot;sunset&quot; (only 30 per day and you have to buy them in advance online because they sell out).  We had a blast!"
5,"This is an awesome place and must visit place when in New York. It takes the first place in my list to do in NY. And I did it:)
Plan to go to the top for a picturesque view of the city skyline at dusk. You will see the changing colors of the New York skyline as the evening gets darker. Words are superfluous, look at photos!"
5,"We visited the 86th and 102nd floors as well as the museum on Saturday, Nov. 9, 2019 - 7 years after our first time. No comparison. So much better now!

We took advantage of the Senior prices &amp; purchased our tickets at the kiosk before entering the museum. Everyone had to stand in a long line for the elevator to the 86th floor after walking through the new museum. Look up for a grand video show overhead! Had we known that it&apos;s one way up and then down and out, I would have lingered longer at the exhibits which were quite impressive. 

Before entering the museum, we posed for a photo on green screen. We didn&apos;t have to buy it; we didn&apos;t like it. Husband and I stood in awe watching bits of all of the movies or TV shows on the video wall that included or featured the Empire State Building. I loved interacting with King Kong in one corner of the museum and stepping into elevators from the early days. The movie posters, memorabilia, and videos were amazing. I want to go back and spend more time in the museum. 

The views are breathtaking on both levels. You are outside on the 86th floor. You are behind glass &amp; in smaller quarters on the 102nd floor - accessible by another elevator, after standing in another line for an additional price (paid at kiosk). It was worth it. 

The way down is by elevator or elevator and stairs. We opted for the latter as it was faster. The exit outside is after passing through the gift shop - inexpensive, moderate, &amp; expensive items. We posed in front of the Christmas tree before leaving. We will return. Just not to the 102nd floor. Been there. Done that."
1,"I was so disappointed in my visit. I don&apos;t know new york at all and the staff was so rude.. when i asked questions or about certain bridges, or things you got this negative response, like i was bothering them.  The view was amazing. I wish we could have used the telescopes though. 
Be kind next time."
4,"Had the pleasure of re-visiting the Empire State Building after my first visit 8 years ago. 
Back then, the entrance was on 5th Avenue and the wait was 2 hrs, walls seemed to be still under construction... cement and all.
Well, this time .. November 15th Friday evening.... we had a friend who works in the building, so had the convenience &amp; honor of using the super-Express line!!! 
The view North/West side was quite spectacular with all the new high risers....  Quite a view !!!"
3,"I went up couple of items a few years ago and there were some great views but it wasn&apos;t anything I felt worth paying $38 to go back up for a 3rd time tonight. 

I am glad I did it twice but my husband wasn&apos;t feeling like paying such a high entry to go up so we enjoyed it from the inside only this time around and from the outside looking up tonight. 

It was some good views way up high and it can get unbelievably windy up there as well, long hair turns into a tornado easily up there."
