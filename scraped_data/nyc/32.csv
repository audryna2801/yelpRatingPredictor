5,"You can&apos;t go wrong with Stumptown. Their espresso is so smooth, seriously. It comes down to how they roast their coffee beans, giving them the ideal ratio of sweetness to acidity. 

Easy to miss this location since it&apos;s inside of the Ace Hotel, so definitely keep an eye out when walking down W 29th."
4,"Stay in the queue, and it&apos;s worth the wait. The coffee is rich and fragrant, and the pastries are yummy.

All around excellent coffee. You&apos;ll be back."
1,"Went in to buy hairbender whole bean coffee, and it comes with a free coffee. The last 4 times I&apos;ve bought a bag I was able to upgrade the free coffee to a cappuccino and pay the difference. 
This morning the person behind the counter wouldn&apos;t do it and mocked me for breaking the rules, ending by &quot;I&apos;ll remember you the next time you come&quot; -- almost in a condescending and racist tone. Well, moving to counter-culture coffee from now on."
5,"Best espresso I ever had in NYC. It had no bitter aftertaste, it was very smooth. I&apos;m usually that coffee drinker that needs sugar, but when I ordered my latte I had forgotten to mention to add sugar so I had it judt plain espresso and milk. But I had no complaints IT WAS STILL GOOD. Will be coming back once in NYC again."
5,"This coffee shop is a hidden gem! Not so underrated on Yelp though! Picked stumptown coffee for one of our Tuesday post-work coffee rituals and after having the coffee here I think this is going to be our usual spot! 
Ps: They also have baked goods like chocolate, matcha filled croissants from supermoon bakehouse. So if you&apos;re one of those, who has never got to try them at super moon because they are sold out by the time you can get there, visit Stumptown to try some! And get their amazing coffee too!!!  we tried the rum and raisin latte (which was soooo good! Not very sweet), Non-Fat cappuccino and nitro cold brew. Perfect for this spine chilling weather!  will visit again to try those delicious baked goods!"
5,"Always a great cup. The attention to detail associated with every aspect of the beverage is really second to none. The thing that always impresses me, is the consistency of the drink day to day, regardless of the individual barista. By that, I mean each is extremely well versed in the craft and their passion for what they do comes through."
5,"Still the  best coffee in NYC, but now they have metal drinks stirrers in place of the old disposable wood ones!! I love their commitment to sustainability and hope they continue. Currently, they have a great selection of mugs, travel cups, and cold brew jugs. And of course, the baristas are as friendly as ever, making the dopest coffee art :)"
5,"Came by the other day or breakfast and it was excellent! Located inside the Ace hotel made this a super convenient spot for breakfast!

Ordered a mocha which came out at the perfect temperature! The mocha was a perfect dark chocolate that wasn&apos;t too sweet! The latte art was perfect too!

The ham and cheese croissant was also world class! Light and fluffy pastry stuffed with a delicious piece of ham!

Staff was friendly and even offered a stamp card! 

They take credit cards!"
3,"I got the nitro cold brew and it tasted kinda really watery? I like how strong it is and its foamy taste in the beginning but it quickly disappears into coffee water.

As a disclaimer I don&apos;t drink cold brew that often but having had nitro beers or Guiness or whatever, I know this could be a lot better."
5,"lovely coffee shop.

I&apos;ve been stumptown coffee in portland last year, it was so good. NYC stumptown also great. It feels almost same things. 

Coffee was good and staffs also kinds!"
3,"I got coffee from here on a Sunday at 2PM. No line and friendly service. I got the cold brew with light ice for $4.50 - I am not a fan of the taste. My friend got the espresso for $3.50. The interior is clean. It&apos;s a small coffee shop but the good thing however is that it is connected to the Ace Hotel so when I got my coffee I was able to find a spot in the lobby and catch up with a friend. 

Overall, acceptable coffee if you are going to be squatting in the Ace Hotel for a bit."
5,"This was recommended to us from a lot of friends that have visited or are locals. I can&apos;t lie, they make a really really good cappuccino. The kind that tastes so genuine it brings you back to Italy and you want to taste it forever. 

Not to mention the staff is very friendly and will listen to your needs + recommend other things that may be of interest! I highly recommend this location!"
5,That is a prime example of a place you think twice to Yelp about since you do not want a lots of people to know about it and thus risk of it getting too crowded. I&apos;m glad I don&apos;t live in this area or I&apos;d be broke spending every penny on coffee EVERY morning! Loved all of what we had!  The staff were very accommodating and overall the service was great. Everything was excellent.
5,I stayed upstairs from this place at the Ace Hotel for work and would grab an oat milk cappuccino on my way out every morning. They make it perfectly and it is well worth the wait/money. I&apos;ll be back every time I&apos;m in NoMad.
3,"It&apos;s coffee... it&apos;s a smooth blend. It&apos;s just ok. 
Gold, it is not 
Don&apos;t get me wrong, I love this location and the decor - it&apos;s convenient to just drop by and have a cup before you&apos;re next appointment or grab and go. 

But the coffee tastes the same as any of the following places: Intelligentsia, Blue Bottle, Joe Art of Coffee or Counter Culture. It&apos;s coffee for purists. 

Good coffee, yes. Gold? Platinum? No. 

Plus the staff takes themselves a little too seriously here. As one reviewer mentioned, get over yourselves. 

But three stars for an outstanding oat milk latte."
4,"Delicious coffee, could not resist leaving without a bag of beans.  Very cute place although not much place to sit down and enjoy the cup of joe, I guess that&apos;s the NY style of pick it up and take it to go."
5,"If you want great coffee, this is the place to come to!!  I had a double espresso with a little milk. It came in the little cute cup and taste amazing.  The staff is also very nice and helpful"
5,If you are looking for the perfect pour look no further than stump town. Best baristas in town!! They know how to pour a good cup!
4,Ordered the orange clove coffee and matcha croissant. The Orange flavor permeated the drink but was really light on the clove. I prefer stronger coffees so it wasn&apos;t quite down my alley. The matcha croissant looks pretty unusual given how green the insides were but it was nicely buttery and flaky. Added bonus was the little bit of matcha surprise in the middle.
5,"Easily the best coffee in NYC, with a gorgeous location at the front of the Ace Hotel. Their menu is concise yet interesting, offering seasonal blends and unique varieties of beans. The shop itself is small, but there is plenty of comfy seating and table space in the Ace lobby. The baristas here are highly trained and skilled in their craft, so you are guaranteed to get a perfect drink every time. NYC coffee professionals have a tendency to be rude, but the employees here were refreshingly kind, and genuinely friendly.

The pastry case was abundant even at 3pm, and had one vegan option-a Salted Chocolate Chip Cookie. The delicious cookie was moist and soft, with salty caramelized brown sugar flavor and extra dark chocolate chips. The treat paired perfectly with my wonderfully acidic Small Batch Cold Brew, which tasted delicious with a touch of soy milk. I had the luxury of coming here out of convenience while staying at the Ace, but would definitely go out of my way to return."
