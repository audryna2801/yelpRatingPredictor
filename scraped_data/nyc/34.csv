5,"TLDR: nonono or yesyesyes? great outdoor seating, delicious, rich ramen, tasty skewers and good portion sizes. Just come and enjoy.

Came here with a small group of friends for the lunch experience set which comes with a ramen of choice, the yakitori set, and a soft drink all for under 30 dollars. The ramen broth was thick, rich, and savory and noods we&apos;re all dents. The meats were so tender, juicy and flavorful and the garlic chips and onion on top help cut through the rich broth. I honestly would go back just for the ramen. The yakitori set included chicken breast with scallion, beef short rib with onion, and a meatball. Each of these were cooked well. I come here often just for the yakitori don. Got the ume sparkling water for my soft drink (they were out of yuzu). It was super light.

We sat outside, and unlike many other outdoor seating establishments, each group had their own enclosed space so we felt very safe. Staff wore masks and cleaned often. Great place!"
5,This review is pre-Covid. The food was all amazing and I really wanted to order every single thing on the menu!!!! Every dish was so yummy. I don&apos;t think there was any dishes that we didn&apos;t enjoy. It is a bit small since it&apos;s tapas style and we had 4 people. Ended up paying about $250.
5,"A go-to for a casual dinner spot with friends or weekday food delivery. The quality is dependable, and the menu varied enough to accommodate various types of food preferences.
There&apos;s also a happy hour (ending 7PM), offering sake, which I highly recommend.

I love the yakitori don set, the salmon tataki, and any of the rolls (spicy salmon or spicy tuna are staples). Food delivery is neatly packaged and efficient. For the yakitori options, I&apos;d recommend the thigh, meatball, &quot;oyster,&quot; and shishito peppers. 

Only point to be improved is if they added heating lamps to the outdoor seating setup!"
4,"I love a good bowl of ramen and in NYC, there are endless ramen places to choose from. 

The Pros: the aesthetic is trendy, high ceilings, great lighting. The menu has decent variety. 

The Cons: the ramen didn&apos;t really stand out flavor-wise. It was delicious, but I wouldn&apos;t take a friend or a date here over another ramen place. 

I got the Tantan ramen and lychee martini. The martini was fabulous and I would highly recommend. The ramen was so pleasantly spicy at the beginning, but oddly lost it&apos;s spicy flavor halfway through. I probably would&apos;ve been more impressed if that flavor had stayed throughout (and yes, I stirred it). 

COVID considerations: my friend and I did indoor dining and we both agreed that it felt like we had plenty of space. I mentioned high ceilings and this is excellent for ventilation purposes and there was certainly good airflow through the interior. If you are interested in outdoor seating, theirs was top notch - tons of tables and space and space heaters!"
5,"The food here was quite delicious, and I really enjoyed the Creamy Cod Roe Udon. Definitely worth visiting, but it was quite pricey for the yakitori. The Grilled Salmon Belly was beautifully tender and flavored, and it was a great appetizer. The Shio Paitan was not too flavorful in comparison to the other dishes, but it was good nevertheless. I really liked all of the yakitori (short ribs, thigh, and cartilage), as the charcoal flavor really came through. Every single thing was just SO GOOD, I would definitely come back to try other dishes too.

The outdoor dining setup was also super cute, with the fairy lights and heated lamps. Very very grateful they separated each table, and the heating lamps made a HUGE difference. 100% recommend."
5,"I came here for lunch during the weekday for outdoor dining and enjoyed the lunch experience set! The lunch experience set comes with your choice of ramen, drink and the yakitori set. I chose the Tori Tantan Ramen and iced oolong tea. The quality of the food was good and great value! I highly recommend. Also I&apos;ve been here on my birthday previously for dinner and would recommend coming here for dinner as well!"
4,"This is a review of outdoor dining during COVID.

With indoor dining currently closed, I was looking for a place with heated outdoor dining. nonono currently offers private heated outdoor booths, which is essential given the current weather. I felt safe in the booth and the heater worked well to fight the cold.

My friend and I tried a variety of dishes including the salmon tataki, a variety of yakitori, the shoyu chintan ramen, and the oyako roll. Everything was very reasonably priced. The salmon tataki and sushi were both very fresh. The yakitori was okay, nothing special compared to other places I&apos;ve been to in the city. My favorite was probably the chicken meatball. The ramen was a bit salty but comforting in the winter weather.

They have a daily happy hour special until 7PM including $4 sake (both hot and cold) and $9 highballs. Not too shabby!"
4,"Place built little huts with its warm little heater which was a cute surprise. We came today for our 5:15 reservation, waiter was quiet but very attentive and polite. They served us with meal kits which were covered utensils and hand wipes. 

We decided to share amongst us two and we also ordered a variety of dishes all over the menu. A lot of the specials were crossed out as I&apos;m sure they were affected by covid.

It was a shame the whole two floor space cannot be used with the indoor dining. But overall the quality of food and service were a solid 8/10. 

Happy hour specials are from 4-7 pm so we indulged in two rounds of hot sake for $4 (ridiculously cheap).

Would def come again."
1,"This has likely been my last time visiting nonono for a while until they have some staff changes. I understand business is difficult during the pandemic, and that both restaurants and their employees are under a lot of pressure. But under no circumstance should servers be throwing a tantrum at customers and delivery couriers inside the kitchen. There&apos;s plenty of restaurants that deserve our support right now, and I&apos;m sad to say this is NOT ONE OF THEM.

After my last visit, I decided to order the Karubi-Don bowl again with an additional steak skewer for pickup. Was originally quoted 20-30 minutes, so I arrived at the restautant at the 20 minute mark. The taller server (without beanie) said it would be 5 minutes until it was ready, so I went to wait outside. After 15 minutes, I went back in to check on the status again, and was quoted another 5 minutes. After an additional 15 minutes (30 minutes waiting outside now), I was quoted an additional 5 minutes. 40 minutes into the wait, I was quoted 2 more minutes. I finally received my food 45 minutes into the wait (65 minutes after ordering), which is annoying but forgivable. It&apos;s fine if they&apos;re delayed, but I wished they would just admit a delay and manage expectations a lot better. While rushing, they also got my order wrong, but I was already home by the time I noticed. Forgivable as well. To be fair, the food was once again delicious.

At the end of my wait, a doordash delivery courier re-entered the restaurant and asked if his pickup was ready. The short server wearing the beanie told him no. He then politely asked if they knew how much longer it would be, since he had other pickups on his route that were ready. The same server then began to shout at the courier, saying &quot;I don&apos;t know, if you want the food faster maybe you want to come help us in the kitchen?&quot;. The server proceeded to point at the kitchen area and shouted, &quot;why don&apos;t go go help right there?&quot; Luckily, the courier had a good sense of humor, laughed it off, and replied saying that he wouldn&apos;t know how if he wanted to... In my 10 years in NYC I&apos;ve never seen this sort of outburst when the customer wasn&apos;t also being unreasonable or rude."
5,"Omg what an incredible meal I had at nonono. I&apos;ve been wanting to go this restaurant for years and I think to myself now &apos;what da hell took so long&apos;?? Apparently the menu has been reduced due to Covid but no matter it was still divine. We ordered everything from meat on a stick to salmon tataki, eggplant, mushrooms, to rich flavor ramen, oh and the unforgettable sushi rolls. Every dish was executed perfectly and so fresh!!! The price to portion size ratio is also just spot on. I liked how quickly they served up the food and just left to us to enjoy. Very good set up for Covid. We sat indoors and I felt really safe with the set up and the distancing. High recommend it."
5,"Ate outdoors here in October and it was a great experience. We were able to sit far away from others and the service and food was awesome. I would gladly go back. Love that I was able to try so many different dishes. I think the short rib was my favorite, but the Shishido peppers were perfectly cooked as well. 

I have zero complaints and can&apos;t wait to eat food from here again."
4,"Great spot in the city for yakitori! They just opened their indoor dining and they are closely adhering to all social distancing and safety measures. 

We really enjoyed the array of skewers. Our favorites were the chicken oyster, tamago bacon, yuzukosho nori, kinoko cream, and the beef short rib! 

The yakitori don was a good mix of skewers with a side of rice and miso soup. We also really liked the flavoring of the creamy udon, which was very filling. 

Service was good, and the price wasn&apos;t bad either. Would definitely check this place out!"
5,"Note: This is a great spot to go for outdoor dining during COVID times. There&apos;s a heat lamp in each booth (that you don&apos;t share with others, just you and your guests), and I came for lunch, which meant that we were likely the first sets of diners in that booth area. 

I was a little hesitant because the dishes I loved so much at dinner (pre-COVID) weren&apos;t on the menu, but honestly, it didn&apos;t make a difference. The meal and the service was just as good during lunch as they are during dinner.

My friend got the nonono roll and preferred it without the radish topping. I ordered the Oyako roll and found it to be AMAZING, and the spicy tuna was equally delicious. But the standouts are the yakitori -- the short rib and the chicken oyster (chef&apos;s kiss good), specifically. We also ordered the meatball, but thought the other two were better. While we did like the mushrooms, kinoko, the enoki ones in the small bowl wasn&apos;t as good as the two other roasted mushroom varieties. 

All in all, the food was wonderful, the service was great and the booth was warm enough on a bitter cold winters day. Thankful they were open for lunch and happy to support their business!"
2,"I can&apos;t say that I haven&apos;t been warned, but this place is a nonono for me... Jokes aside, the cream udon was enjoyable and not spicy AT ALL. There&apos;s a layer of thinned out creamy mashed potatoes that really made it filling, making it different from your normal udon. 

We tried various skewers and the steak rice bowl, but those were all very meh. My bf ordered online with a discount, but even for the price I don&apos;t think it&apos;s worth the flavor. 

Maybe they offered more pre-pandemic, but I was quite disappointed."
5,"This was the most fun I&apos;ve had at a restaurant in a really, really long time. I came to nonono for a birthday dinner with two friends and we were beyond starving. We thought the sharing plates were all going to be relatively small so we ordered 9 dishes. The onslaught of trays, dishes, and cast-iron pan that arrived at our table and spilled out to the dining area&apos;s wooden border completely superseded our expectations. Happy to say that we managed to eat everything without leaving leftovers (we didn&apos;t really eat anything for the rest of the day).

My favorites included:
- Cod cream udon - I would consider coming back here just to order this dish alone. I was never a fan of dairy products meshed with traditional Asian ingredients, but I&apos;ve completely changed my viewpoint after this. There&apos;s no fishy taste at all, so don&apos;t be put off by the title.
- Sukiyaki - This should be a mandatory order when you visit nonono. It comes in a cast-iron pan loaded with tender beef, udon, vegetables, and tofu, all simmering in a sweet soy sauce broth.
- Nori Tofu - I was also a skeptic of this small bite, but the nori seaweed paste on top makes it an absolute must-try. 
- Oyako Roll - Salmon roll done 3 ways: roe, filet, and spicy salmon mix.
- Kinoko Mushroom - Mushroom sampler with four types of charred mushrooms. Subtly smokey and a strong umami flavor. 

During COVID, there are three sections of outdoor seating with wooden roofs for rainy days. For ordering, we&apos;re given a paper menu and pen, and we write down what orders we want (similar to dim sum procedure). There&apos;s pictures and more information on the online menu, and you can get there through the printed QR code."
5,"Just went for indoor dining last Friday night. Tried all the yaki tori options and they were all pretty tasty and healthy, just could have used a bit more seasoning options in my opinion. Venue is great, lots of space both inside and out."
5,"This might be my new favorite Japanese place. I haven&apos;t had a meal this amazing in quite awhile. Every pleasurable word, sound and action associated with the enjoyment of food will come out if you dine here. 

One of my most memorable meals was at a yakitori tiny spot in Tokyo where an old-age woman owner just happened to ask us to go upstairs while we were walking by. It was one of the highlights of our trip in Japan. This place took me back to that moment.

Yesyesyes to everything on the menu! We went a little crazy and ordered a whole bunch of Uniq-Kushi little grilled dishes. Here are just some of my favorites:

- Gizzard
- Liver
- Heart
- Chicken Wings
- Chicken Oyster

My son and I love all organ/innards/offals and they grill and season these items perfectly. There was a nice snap to that gizzard. Another must order is their Kani Fried Rice. Not oily, it was fluffy and flavorful. I also loved their Nori Tofu. The tofu, avocado and nori made a lovely combo. My only regret was not ordering one of their desserts. 

Service was stellar despite them being extremely busy. We&apos;ll be back."
4,"A pleasant experience. The outdoor seating was nice.

I enjoyed trying the chicken heart and gizzard skewers!

I also tried the tori tantan but wasn&apos;t a fan. The broth was really rich and coated the noodles, but the flavor was overbearingly nutty for me. I expected chicken, pork, and seafood flavors but felt all I got were nuts.

The cod roe cream udon was tasty but a little too light flavor-wise. The sauce was thick but I felt the taste of roe/seafood was hard to get. The nori and shiso leaves on top were an amazing touch though, added a fresh component to the dish."
3,"Nonono is exactly my sentiment when it comes to this restaurant. I know-- harsh. But it&apos;s not like you&apos;re coming here for the food. The interior decorating is gorgeous; a refined modern aesthetic. It&apos;s a restaurant to sit in with your 3 closest friends and try to live out a Sex and the City fantasy (are people still doing that?).

I&apos;ve been here a total of three times and I honestly can&apos;t remember anything, except that every ramen broth has seafood in it. Which isn&apos;t a problem for me but a girl I brought here is allergic to shellfish. Don&apos;t worry, nothing happened but just a caution. Outside of that, the yakitori uses nice lesser known cuts but that practice is becoming standard."
4,"I came here for lunch on a Thursday afternoon with a friend.  They check your temperature and you have to complete a health questionnaire during COVID-19 times.  The tables were spaced out and there&apos;s partitions if you want to eat indoors.  We ordered the yakitori don set and the nabeyaki udon.  The yakitori don set had a shishito pepper skewer, a chicken meatball skewer, a chicken thigh skewer, and a chicken breast skewer over furikake rice along with a bowl of miso soup.  The nabeyaki udon had shrimp, chicken, vegetables, and a poached egg.  The yakitori don set was delicious and filling.  The yakitori was grilled well. The udon was a bit bland and the egg was not poached so I would skip it.  Service was friendly but slow, maybe they were short staffed.  I would come back and probably just stick to the yakitori.  The teba gyoza (pork dumpling stuffed chicken wings) look good."
