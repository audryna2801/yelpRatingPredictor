5,"Spice Symphony is such a unique combination of flavors, I&apos;m sad I didn&apos;t go for the Chinese Indian menu but I am SO glad I stopped in with my friend. It&apos;s run by Prim was awesome. We got a potato app (chaat, I believe), a fish curry, daal (my favorite) along with naan + dessert. 

They take COVID very seriously, everyone was very distanced. In addition their heat lamps are very powerful and on a cold + rainy day I barely noticed. 

Support local and eat businesses like Spice Symphony! Especially in midtown when there&apos;s so much fast casual corporations, I am so glad to see a spot like Spice Symphony still open! I&apos;ll be back for sure!"
5,"I used to come here during work lunch and the meals were not only great but very reasonably priced. You can get a three course individual meal for 10-13 dollars depending on your entree choice. I always love the lamb saag and chicken tikka. There&apos;s a few options for appetizers too and I always go for the avo chicken kebab which contains 2 decent sizes of white meat chicken. During the pandemic I have been ordering takeout and I recently became a fan of their lamb biryani. 
Tonight we went to pick up the chicken malai kebab and samosa since there was a good deal via Uber eats. The food was fresh and delicious as usual. And we ran into (I think) the owner and he personally thanked me for supporting the business which was very kind."
5,"Great food! I got the lamb Vindaloo on the left and the lamb rogan josh on the right! The meat was tender and everything was fresh!

The only slight issue I would suggest would be the favor.... the meat/sauce didn&apos;t have much flavor and was kind of bland... maybe it needs more salt? 

But other than that it&apos;s great food"
5,"Had a lovely dinner here tonight
-Samosa
-coriander soup
-palak paneer
-veggie korma
-daal tadka
-cheese kulcha

Really enjoyed our dishes. My fave was the daal. Staff as very kind and welcoming. Complimentary dishes included vegetable pakora appetizer and kulfi for dessert. Thank you spice symphony"
4,"I was craving Indo-Chinese food so I came across this restaurant to order from. They have plenty of vegetarian and vegan options to choose from! I ordered the Chinese bhel, Hakka noodles and tofu lettuce wraps. The Chinese bhel was very tasty, however the noodles weren&apos;t as crispy as I would&apos;ve liked them to be. That also might&apos;ve been because I ordered it for delivery so the noodles may have gotten a little soggy. The Hakka noodles were my favorite!! The noodles were cooked perfectly and the vegetables were not over cooked and were still slightly crunchy. The flavors of the tofu lettuce wraps were delicious, but the broth/sauce texture was a little off for me. I think I would&apos;ve liked it better dry. I really enjoyed ordering from here and I would like to try their other items in the future!"
4,"I kept hearing about how Spice Symphony was one of the better spots for Indo-Chinese food in NYC, and finally made my way here for dinner with a friend.

We started with the spinach chaat which was like a spinach pakoda with some tangy chutneys on top. Pretty good but the flavors weren&apos;t so spectacular or anything.

For mains we had the paneer szechuan and veg manchurian. The veg manchurian was excellent - perfect texture and gravy, and paired perfectly with some garlic naan. We were warned the paneer szechuan would be quite spicy, but it definitely exceeded our spice expectations - I have pretty good tolerance, but don&apos;t take the warning lightly!

Since we couldn&apos;t finish much of the paneer szechuan we added a gobhi manchurian dry which was also quite good in the gravy, but the gobhi itself could have been a little crispier I think. In any case the meal was very solid, with some dishes that I might skip next time."
5,"Recently visited Spice Symphony for dinner and it didn&apos;t not disappoint! We stuck to the indo-chinese dishes - Hakka noodles, manchurian, chilli chicken
My fav were def some of the soups - coriander and manchow. They were delicious and perfect for a cold night! For dessert, we ordered the malia kulfi, gajar halwa, gulab jamun and the coconut caramel custard - all 4 of them were bomb.com!!! Make sure to save room for dessert ..totally worth it! The service was absolutely impeccable- the person who took our order gave us some great recommendations (I think might have been the manager as well)!"
4,"As a Bombay girl, finding niche Indian food to please me is really hard. I&apos;ve usually frequented Murray &quot;curry&quot; Hill joints but went to Spice Symphony for the first time while staying at the San Carlos and it was attached to the lobby. Great ambiance and great service at the 50th St. outpost, and the Lexington Ave restaurant, although compact, has the same quality of food. Service is definitely top-notch at the 50th St. location, with Mr. Nisar never failing to make the dining experience an enjoyable one.

Must try: Indo Chinese. Get the salt and pepper shrimp, paneer schezwan, and gobhi manchurian dry. Schezwan sauce is nothing like Sichuan sauce, although it is an Indian derivative. Lots of roasted garlic, red chili sauce, and red chili oil that makes it a great complement to the crispy paneer, which is a kind of Indian cottage cheese.
Skip: Chinese bhel. Rare to find anywhere outside a few Indian restaurants serving clientele largely from Mumbai/Delhi, but it was soggy and didn&apos;t have the spice and flavor needed.

Must try Indian: Lamb biryani and butter chicken. The butter chicken lets you taste that butter, making it the most authentic I have ever had in New York City. It tastes like the classic dish served at Moti Mahal in India, the restaurant which invented butter chicken. The lamb falls off the bone and is spectacular. 
Honorable mention: Yellow dal tadka and jeera rice when you miss home a little extra. For non-Indian origin diners, this is as authentic as it can get for day-to-day Indian food, since most other menu items are only eaten occasionally and not cooked at home as part of a daily Indian diet. If you are looking for a light lunch, order papad and raita on a side to complete the meal. Beans Poriyal (called foogath in some parts of India) is a unique taste of authentic Indian food as well and can be eaten with rice and dal.

The lunch special meals with an appetizer, rice, roti, mains, and dessert are a bang for your buck if you are ever in Midtown and want a sampler of Indian/Indo-Chinese cuisine. It is customizable with unlimited refills on the entrees, so do take advantage of it when dine-in reopens."
3,"One of my go-to Indian takeout restaurants for a nice, fulfilling meal. The menu is very extensive and they are very accommodating of dietary preferences. I would always get the biryani - can&apos;t go wrong with it!"
5,"I&apos;ve never been to this restaurant, but I have been ordering from them via Uber Eats. And now I can&apos;t wait to come uptown and experience dining in there.

The food is always fresh, tasty, and carefully arranged in the plastic containers."
4,"Probably the best indo-Chinese food in NYC. We came to know about them from a list that said this is a favorite of chef chintan pandya (Adda, Rahi). We really liked Adda, so decided to trust the chef! And we weren&apos;t disappointed at all of course!! I ended up going there again on a birthday dinner a few days later, and the desi gang loved it too. Here are the highlights from the two visits.

Must have
-----
Chilli paneer dry- yum yum. Flavors of India on full blast! Spicy, umami sauce that clings to soft milky and fresh paneer. It&apos;s like they are made for each other. Can&apos;t be made better.

Delhi chaat- its so easy to make a good chaat, but most places still mess it up. Not here though. All the flavors in just the right balance, plus the umami of soy sauce for a bit of Chinese kick.

Mango Kulfi- simple but awesome. Full of Indian Alphonso mango goodness. 

Meh
-----
Veg manchurian- the manchurians were kinda soggy.

Salt and pepper prawn- nothing special, wasn&apos;t as light as I was expecting.

Avoid
-----
Gulab jamun- really sweet, and not very milky.

Overall, despite a few misses, they do a great job of cooking up authentic indo-Chinese flavors. Price is a bit on the higher side, but worth going back for the food!!"
5,"Spice symphony had a great menu! I was happy to have my bhindi and my boyfriend got general tso&apos;s chicken. Both Indian and Chinese dishes are served with basmati rice. 

The waiters are very attentive and continuously fill up your water and ask if everything is ok.

The prices were reasonable too. I&apos;ll definitely be back to to this neighborhood gem."
5,"Yummy yummy yummy
Friendly af
Amazing service
Dessert is on point
Will be coming back!"
5,"This was my first time experiencing Indo-Chinese fusion food. Everything was delicious!!! We were served complimentary pakoras while waiting for our food. DELICIOUS!!!!

The ambiance was beautiful and relaxing with an upscale feel to it. The service was a bit slow but being our first time here, I would attribute that to it being rather busy on a Saturday night. 

The dress code here is smart casual. I wouldn&apos;t go there sloppily dressed so use your best judgement.

Tip: Definitely make reservations on the weekends. They have great vegetarian &amp; vegan options."
5,"I don&apos;t mind updating this several times. This is one of our favorite places in the city. Really top notch and consistent quality. Last night we ordered chicken spring rolls, Hong Kong chicken and kadhi pakoras. Kadhi was good but my husband and son couldn&apos;t stop raving about the chicken spring roll and Hong king chicken. We also love their spinach chat, tellecherri chicken. 

We will be  moving to the UES from Kip&apos;s Bay in a month or two and already hoping that their midtown branch will deliver. If you are in doubt, don&apos;t be. Excellent food and value for money."
4,"Came for lunch as a group of 9. Was a bit skeptical about this place from the outside look, but one person insisted claiming that everyone would love it.

Interior looks much, much better than exterior. Nice little bar area and smallish tables for couples that can be moved together to accommodate bigger groups.

For the good parts: food selection is advanced enough for a non-Indian, and decent according to my Indian co-workers. Surprisingly we were not offered a lunch menu and had to ask for it. Not sure if service is slow or someone disliked us - every dish came out at a different time and took a very noticeable amount of time. I sure like cooked-to order food, but probably they&apos;re not used to bigger groups that sit down at the same time and expect to have different dishes at the same time. I&apos;d at least expect appetizers to be prepared faster and delivered at the same time. Server did not took good notes on who ordered what, so every plate had to be called and decided upon on who will have to eat it: very confusing for non-spice eaters. 

I decided to have Manchurian fish and was very satisfied with my choice. Totally new dish for me, and I finished every bite and every spoon.

Overall I will come back to this place as a smaller group and order food to share at the table, and see how my impression will change. Or, maybe come back for dinner and drinks and see how nightly scene goes here."
4,"(Ordered on Seamless)

Spice Symphony serves a tasty, generous lunch special that hits the spot. I got the palak paneer which came with a small samosa, rice, naan, and an appetizer. (I forget which one I ordered, but it was good!) The lunch special had a great mix of flavors, and the leftovers reheated well :)

I also ordered a paratha, which was on the bland side. I found the chewy, thick naan that came with the lunch special much more satisfying. (Side note on ratios: The lunch special&apos;s rice and naan is a good amount of carbs to go with the rest of the food; I ended up with a lot of leftover paratha after finishing everything else.)

Overall, I&apos;d recommend Spice Symphony as a solid lunch choice for a reasonable price!"
5,"I&apos;ve only ever gotten deliver from here, but the food is to die for!!! The chicken lollipops and garlic naan are indescribably delicious. I&apos;ve had 3 different main courses from here and they were all great."
3,This restaurant is a hit or a miss... I have gone there thrice and first 2 times I had had better experience but my third time was disappointing with food.. I am a fan of indo chinese cuisine which I have had better here earlier but somehow their food quality went down this time around..
5,"We always visit the Spice Symphony when we are in New York. They serve a nice appetizer before they even take your order so you don&apos;t get hungry. 

We always order the tikka masala and recently discovered a new favorite: the Tellicherri pepper chicken - soooo good!!! The garlic naan is the best I have ever tasted, period. 

The waiter always remembers us, even though we visit infrequently and even remembers what we like to order...this last time they surprised us with a dessert on the house - a delicious mango icecream that we will definitely order next time! Must try if you are in nyc and like good curry and great service."
