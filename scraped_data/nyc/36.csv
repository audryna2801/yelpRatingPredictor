5,"Went here for date night and I must say their Covid and winter protocol is fantastic. They have seat warmers in addition to overhead heaters and it makes SUCH a difference. All the other restaurants need to follow their example! 

The food was pretty good! My understanding of Korean food is that it is full flavored, but I think that because of the neighborhood they are in they might have to mute some of the flavors due to the clientele. Still, it was great cuisine followed by delicious tea! We had the vegetable dumplings, kabocha pumpkin pancakes with mung beans, zen stone bowl rice, spicy tofu kimchi hot pot, and crispy mushroom in sweet and sour sauce. All great, clean flavors. The lychee Mojitos are delicious! You must have the ginger tea. 

The staff is super friendly as well. Overall it was simply a lovely meal!"
5,"I had heard so much about this place, the ambiance and sit-down meals, but to COVID, this place has a setup near the sister restaurant between 34th and 35th street park avenue. They have an outdoor seating space, and it was brilliantly done. It was warm enough during the winter afternoon to make our lunch comfortable. 

Let&apos;s talk about food. We ordered two starter - combination rolls and baby dumplings. The rolls were excellent. We found dumplings to be ok. It was nothing that we had not tried and were a little cold too. I ordered a cocktail called zen blossom that the server had suggested. It was perfect. The flavor of lychee came through well. For the main course, we ordered zen bibimbap and organic zen noodles. They both were yummy. If I had to choose between the two, I would go with bibimbap since it was warm for the winter weather. Overall I loved this place and would like to go again."
5,"Loved every bit of this experience!

Be ready to take your shoes off, as the other reviewers said- very cool, beautiful aesthetic (also Covid friendly with screens between tables). We got lucky, had a table with a heated floor

The drinks were great, my favorites were Reincarnation and Meditation. Reincarnation is a light pear soju in a Martinee glass- Meditation is mango. 
Our friend also got Mindfulness (?) that was creamier and more of a juice

One main entree is probably enough for two people, this was our mistake. Got both the tofu hot pot and the rice bowl but we were stuffed! Also love everything pumpkin and the pumpkin porridge tasted so authentic"
5,"My friend found this place, and I hadn&apos;t heard of it prior, but WOWW was I pleasantly surprised..

The food was incredible, portions pretty large. 
We tried a whole bunch of dif apps and plates which I would recommend, so that you get to try a bunch of their menu items. Tofu steak was amaaaaazing ..the sauce that came on top was crack. 
The Apple Sake was delicious and they served it in carved out apples.. YUM
Sexy ambiance, mood lighting, very romantic.  
You take your shoes off at the door and they have heated floors which made such a huge difference considering it was 20Â° outside."
5,"The person that left a 1 star review is an idiot and does not know good taste. I agree that the spices are subtle, but the flavor and tastes are amazing. I am a vegetarian and to have the whole menu to choose from is a first for me! The black raspberry wine is delicious. 
Located in the heart of Korea town, the outside world busy, but the ambiance is quaint and quiet, with traditional music playing in the background. They have regular seating available at a table, and traditional seating on low tables with pillows. 
For appetizers we had the stuffed mushrooms, pancakes, and mini spicy dumplings. I don&apos;t normally like stuffed mushrooms, but these were TO DIE FOR, crispy on the outside with a delicious sauce, highly recommended. 
Just come see and taste for yourself."
5,"Such a get of a place in the city, vegetarian korean food! The server was super helpful with the most popular recs. The spicy dumplings and pancake platter were both amazing. We got kimchi stone rice &amp; came with differing levels of spicy kimchi. The crispy mushrooms in sweet &amp; sour sauce with multigrain rice was really good. Loved the rose ginger ice-cram too! Took lychee wine to go!! The lychee &amp; mango cocktails were both amazing and fresh. Will be back to try other dishes, especially hot pot!"
5,This Korean place is awesome. The dumplings   reminded me of one I had is South Korea. The service is nice but there is a long wait to be seated. It IS worth the wait. Very clean.
1,"All I can say is this was really bland food. I asked for it to be spicy, and it was, but somehow still bland and tasteless. 

This was a tremendous disappointment, and I don&apos;t understand how such bland and tasteless food can get so many 5 star ratings. 

I got the Tofu Clay Pot In Ginger Stew... I certainly did not taste any ginger. The veggies in it were totally without any flavor, even the mushrooms were tasteless. Basically a clear tasteless broth. The bland american broccoli was totally wrong. 

I also ordered the Restaurant Week special, and got the Vermicelli Delight (Korean sweet potato noodles with assorted vegetables) this had a little taste, but basically bland and a tiny portion - and I certainly did not see or taste any vegetables. For the entree, if you can call eight small pieces of tofu an entree, I ordered the Crispy Tofu with Sesame Leaf and Seaweed Sauce - served with multi-grain rice. The seaweed sauce was good, but this was a tiny amount of food. The tofu had zero taste, and the multi-grain rice was nasty - like something from my bad memories of &quot;vegetarian&quot; food from the 1970s.

I have been vegetarian for over 45 years, but I need taste. The kimchi was also very bland - just a little hot. 

Expensive for tasteless small portions. Should add that this was delivery."
5,"HanGawi is a very unique Korean experience. Firstly, it is the only all-vegan restaurant I have been to where I leave full and satisfied. Their menu is massive and has a host of different flavor profiles to choose from. I have yet to have something bad here. Secondly, the staff and ambiance ensures that HanGawi is an experience from the moment you enter. You remove your shoes at the door and are seated in your own lowered dining area. Guests are seated on mats at a sunken table. Their waiters are incredibly friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive. This is one of the best places to go for a date on a cold and rainy NYC evening. Their ambiance is unmatched. 

Mini Tofu Ball Sticks in Sweet and Sour Sauce (4/5): This was our first starter. You get three skewers that are easily shared. It was very good but not the best starter we had. 

Skinless Vegetable Dumplings (5/5): This was our favorite starter dish. These dumplings had a crispy exterior and a soft interior. They had plenty of flavor and came with an equally delicious dipping sauce.


Organic Wheat Free Kale Pancakes (4/5): These are a great gluten-free option for those looking to enjoy Korean pancakes. It is a big portion that could easily be split between two, three, or four people. 

Eggplant with Kimchi in Gluten-Free Brown Sauce (5/5): This eggplant dish is packed with flavor. It comes with an assortment of vegetables and the brown sauce gives the dish a sweetness that compliments the savory flavor of the eggplant well. 

Avocado Rice Bowl (5/5): This is my favorite entree at Hangawi. It comes in a heated stone bowl and the dish is mixed with a soy paste that gives the dish a very savory kick. It is one of the most unique, memorable, and delicious items on the menu. 

Tofu with Kimchi and Vegetables in Spicy Sauce (5/5): This is my second favorite entree after the Avocado Rice Bowl. It is not very spicy at all so even those with a sensitive pallet can enjoy this dish. It is a hearty and filling option that is great on a cold day. 

If you want an elevated and pampered Korean experience that caters especially to vegan and vegetarian eaters, HanGawi is an unrivaled option. Even for those who are not vegan or vegetarian will find plenty of options that will satisfy their pallet!"
4,"An entirely plant-based Korean restaurant? Sounds like perfection. I had been wanting to try HanGawi for ages but was put off by the steep prices. Restaurant week (takeout version) seemed like the perfect time to try it - instead of paying $20+ just for vegetable bibimbap, they were offering an appetizer and an entree for $20 total. I took them up on the deal more than once so I could experience as much of the menu as possible. The vermicelli delight appetizer (japchae) was excellent. The spicy baby dumplings were extremely disappointing: four sad little bite-sized dumplings with basically no flavor. They&apos;re supposedly stuffed with vegetables, mushrooms, tofu, and vermicelli, but all I could taste was a little ginger. The only part about them that was actually &quot;spicy&quot; was the dipping sauce that at least made them enjoyable. In terms of entrees, the crispy tofu with sesame leaf and seaweed sauce (served with rice) was a big winner! Delicious squares of perfectly seasoned fried tofu drizzled with a savory sauce. The avocado bibimbap was very good also, although not as much of a standout as the tofu entree. The best part was the fried tofu sliced up to look just like egg! Overall, I enjoyed my restaurant week experiences a lot and I am tempted to go back even after restaurant week is over, but the prices are a little hard to justify. I&apos;m intrigued to try their sister restaurant, Franchia, which seems a little more casual and affordable."
5,"I loved this place. The experience was so unique. The tables are super cool. You have to take your shoes off before you come and you sit in these cool tables. The ambience is so peaceful and I love the architecture and decor. I would bring all of my friends here for a cool experience. 
All the food I had was so good. The pumpkin porridge that came with my lunch bento box was so smooth. The egg plant dish was amazing. I don&apos;t even like egg plant but it was so flavorful. The miso soup was simple but flavorful. The stone bowl was so delicious and I loved that it stayed hot. The noodles were light and delicious. The dumplings were amazing. I wish we got more steamed dumplings. 
The dessert platter was great. The almond icecream was incredible. The tiramisÃ¹ and cheesecake were also good but I wouldn&apos;t say they tasted like what they were supposed to. Super good though and I felt super light and healthy afterwards. One of the coolest places in the city"
4,"I heard a lot about this place and wow as really excited to go for the first time. 
The food was delicious, I really loved the combination rolls and the kimchi stone bowl rice.
However, while everything was delicious, nothing felt too sophisticated or unique, to justify the high prices. 

I wasn&apos;t disappointed about the food, but I think it was overpriced."
5,Omggg I am not vegetarian or vegan. Yet I love this spot! You need to come here for their lunch box! Look at my lunch box and just how much food there is for only $20?!?! And I nearly forgot that I was at a vegetarian spot!
2,"Location was not as listed. I walked to the home restaurant to find that it is currently being hosted at Franchia. The outdoor area is GREAT. Heating lamps, heating  pad on the chairs. All the staff was friendly except for the initial woman who seated me. I asked her if this was the correct place and she stared at me and said yes. So I asked if I could have a seat and she just motioned me to the area. It seemed like I was bothering her. LOL.

The spicy baby dumplings were decent. Served room temperature. I was so hungry so I didn&apos;t bother to return them to be heated more. Silky tofu in clay pot was very tasty however the portion was very small for the price. I left feeling hungry after a $40 meal.

I wouldnt return despite the lovely seating area. Food was not worth it."
3,"I&apos;m trying to figure out why this place has such high ratings. I looked around and it&apos;s because of the experience, the customers take off their shoes and eat on the floor. I wouldn&apos;t recommend this place if you don&apos;t have socks on. Perhaps they willgive you slippers to wear? 

Anyways, I looked around and most of the wait staff arent even Korean (that&apos;s when you know you&apos;re getting &apos;real&apos; Korean food) and the patrons too. Yes, very non-traditional especially since it is all vegetarian dishes. Granted a lot of side dishes in general that Koreans eat are vegetarian. But normally Koreans like to eat meat in their entrees / main dish or soup.  

I&apos;m getting off tangent about the restaurant in itself. So here are the food items that my friends and I ate, the stuffed shiitake mushrooms, the combination rolls, the tofu soup with rice, organic zen noodles, vermicelli soup with rice, and soy cheesecake. Everything wasn&apos;t as great as I hoped and I was surely disappointed after reading the rave reviews. The good part was that you can control your own spice. I ordered for myself the zen noodles and was quite disappointed. Not quite as what I imagined it to taste like as it was very, very bland. I used up two of those spice pots  I would give everything 5 stars if it was based off just presentation. The only thing I enjoyed were the rolls. 

I doubt that I would be going back as I can get better food in different parts of NY without breaking the bank."
5,"I love Hangawi! It is such a unique experience. I&apos;ve been there a few times (pre-COVID 19) and when you enter you have to take of your shoes. The service is excellent and attentive. You can feel the intricacy that goes into the service and food. 

All vegan Korean food is a RARE find anywhere. So happy to have this in NYC. Commonly food with hidden animal products like fish sauce/ dashi / anchovy broth is SAFE here!! Kimchi jigae, bibimbap, tofu stew- all great. Love their dumplings and pancakes too. The kimchi tofu hotpot stew is so yummy. Not bland and flavorful broth- all vegan!

Prices are slightly steeper than typical vegan/ other Korean places. Entrees average $20-$25. Appetizers $12-$15. To me it is worth it. A lot of effort goes into their food. 

I recently got take out from Hangawi and it was equally delicious!! I missed it so much during the shut down. 

You do need to make reservations ahead of time (during non COVID-19 times)."
5,"I went to HanGawi pretty recently with few of my friends and loved their service. With CoVid they took all the right precautions, maintaining the right social distancing. The food was very tasty, I recommend to try out the spicy baby dumplings and kimchi fried stone bowl. Loved loved those!"
4,"Short review:

Recommended
Fried mushrooms (or any of the other mushroom dishes)
Porridge
Pancakes
Teas

Fine
Dumplings
Casseroles

Not good:
Bibimbap/Dolsot bibimbap
Their signature dessert

I went here with another person for dinner. Similar review though with a lot more dishes. I have a feeling that a lot of people give this place a poor review as they stick with bibimbap/vegetable stone bowl rice which isn&apos;t really that good here outside of the good bracken/shrooms/a bit overpriced also.

To Drink: Sparkling Lychee: Was fine though I prefer the teas.

Appetizers
Pumpkin porridge/Hobak-juk: Excellent and always recommended.

Baby dumplings/Mandu: These would be good to share though they are a bit tiny. The shell had a nice chewy outside and the filling was fine. It&apos;s fine.

Spicy rice cakes/Ddukbokki/Tteok-bokki: This is honestly the best vegetarian version of this dish I&apos;ve ever had. Really big portion and a terrific texture to said rice cakes though I would have preferred a wider variety in vegetables. Highly recommended.

Main dishes:
Stone rice bowl with veggies/Dolsot bibimbap: I honestly don&apos;t recommend this much. It&apos;s a bit too pricey for the rather normal bibimbap. 
The gochujang they have there isn&apos;t spicy enough for this dish though this might be because it&apos;s a vegan form of this sauce.

Spinach/mushroom bowl: This dish reminded me of a Chinese casserole. The flavors were fresh though I found the gravy to be a bit one note. Still good though.

Fried mushrooms: Excellent/still my favorite main dish here. A nice wide variety and the texture of the mushrooms is fantastic. Good sauce as well.

Desserts:

Their signature dessert (don&apos;t remember the exact name but it mentioned red bean, dates, coconut, and some other things. This didn&apos;t come out as what I expected. It was more like a parfait topped with a little bit of each topping. Outside of there not enough toppings, I found it not too flavorsome. Very good vegan ice cream as per before. I would not recommend it.

Coconut Blueberry cake: In terms of other places, I wouldn&apos;t consider it to be so special but for a vegan place, I found the texture of the cake to be very good. The coconut topping wasn&apos;t super sweet also. My only issue is that there wasn&apos;t enough of the blueberry filling so some pieces felt a bit dry.

We overall ordered enough food that it turned out that the emperor&apos;s menu would have probably been a better choice. Overall, the food was similarly good as last time though some dishes are still much better than others. While I do think the comparative quality is a bit inconsistent for the prices, but if you are looking for a very unique dining experience, this is a good place. However, if you&apos;re looking for a bit less expensive of a Korean Buddhist style place, I&apos;d go to Franchia instead as they&apos;re owned by the same people. 4.1"
5,"In NYC a city of many options, Hangawi stands out in the vegetarian department. It is one of the very few vegetarian Korean restaurants with probably the largest diversity of options.

One thing I would say is lunch may be more bang for your buck than dinner. But if cost is not an issue than the ambiance at dinner is definitely first class. I&apos;ve attached a picture of the pre fixe menu for lunch. I was very satisfied overall with all the offering but my go to would be the vermicelli appetizer and the kimchi stone bowl.

My absolute favorite thing on their menu is the black sesame soup. They didn&apos;t have it last time I was there so I tried the pumpkin one (it was fine). I recommend at least checking this place out once if you get a chance. You won&apos;t be disappointed."
5,"I will this one five stars ! Has the best of both food and ambience. 

Loved the vibe of the place, great flavors and feel. Picked the lunch pre fix menu during restaurant week and was not disappointed. Very romantic !!!

Highly recommend."
