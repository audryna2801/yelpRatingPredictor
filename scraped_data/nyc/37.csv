5,"Veal meatballs and the Mortadella pizza are still as good as I ever. Also tried the Nutella pizza for two this time and it was solid - the dough was thin and crispy. 

Love the covid setting in the backyard patio. Service was a bit rushed but completely understandable due to the mandatory reduced capacity. Le sigh."
5,"Oh my lord, this place is amazing. 

There was a pretty long line, but surprisingly it went by pretty quickly. There were about 4 parties ahead of us, and we only waited ~20min. 

There&apos;s outdoor seating by the street, but we were shown through the restaurant and to their back patio where they had additional outdoor seating. 

We ordered the Diavola and Norma pizzas. SO GOOD. I am a sucker for spicy salami so the Diavola was my fav. 

Service was a little bit slow but I only really noticed that because I was starving. The atmosphere was really amazing so it&apos;s definitely a cute spot to have some wine and share small dishes with friends.

Definitely recommend and will return again!"
5,"Goes above and beyond to stay true to Italian cuisine! 

Since COVID restrictions are still in place, we saw that the front outdoor seating area was packed and we were immediately thinking of another spot. Nope! Someone ran out and offered our party of 6 a table in the back patio. The patio had cute lights and had a very romantic ambience.

Our server was kind, gave great wine suggestions and was friendly. Bolognese was amazing and the gnocchi cooked perfectly."
5,"Easily in my top 3 best pizza of all time. 
The cotto e funghi is a must try. 
Their arugula salad is also very flavorful. 
Overall an awesome experience in this authentic Italian spot"
2,"So, I really hate to do this but I&apos;m going to have to leave a review. This is something the owner must see. It was my first time here but maybe my friend&apos;s 2nd time? The staff was kind and attentive. The atmosphere was nice, settings were up to regulations and everyone was being safe. But the food... wow... inedible. I think from most all of my dining experiences in New York I&apos;ve sent back/ Not finished my meal maybe 3 times? Ever? The arancine came out nearly ice cold in the middle. sent it back asked them to reheat.. Came back out the outside was heated well but the inside? still cold...The chef needs to properly thaw out the frozen arancine and then throw it in the fryer..  The server noticed we did not finished and we explained the situation again but did not want to bother the kitchen so whatever we didn&apos;t get another. 
Next the pasta. My friend says he always gets the Trapanese but took 3 bites and it was too salty and didn&apos;t touch it again. My dish&apos;s name was so long I can&apos;t remember what it was called but that excited me was the toasted breadcrumbs on the dish. But wow.. Every bite tasted like I was putting a spoon full of salt in my mouth. Went through 2 beers and 3 bottles of water in a flash. Did not finish even a quarter of our meal. The pasta I will have to say was a perfect al dente, the flavors were there but the salt content... wow Our waiter kept apologizing about the food. but we still paid $90 for the meal and left over 25% tip.. because hey it&apos;s not his fault right? He was being very nice.. 

I&apos;m not sure if the chef was having an off day or not. The place looks great (face value) But I never left a restaurant in New York without having at least finishing my food. 
If not for the waiter It would have received 1 star... You&apos;d think maybe i would give 3 at leave to average out but I&apos;m not exaggerating when I said literally we could not eat the food. I seem to be one of the few to have this experience here so I hope it&apos;s just chef having an off day but leaving a restaurant in less than an hour having ate nothing paying over $90 with a 25% tip including tip for the meal... not a good start to the week!"
5,"What a wonderful find! This pizza is by far the best I&apos;ve ever tried! And that&apos;s at a time when it&apos;s so hard to find good Italian pizza as any other type of food, that remained its quality and standards. Here I loved the ambience, despite the place is small, wine was reasonable, pizza was excellent. 
We ordered tomato with mozzarella  and prosciutto with arugula pizza, and omg, it was fabulous. Airy, light, crispy dough, amazing toppings, perfect tomato sauce. 
Service on point, nothing to complain about. 
Make sure you stop by and try some if nearby, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Can&apos;t wait to come back for pizza and a bottle of wine. Or two"
5,"Do you like delicious Italian food? No? Then stop reading.

But if you answered &apos;yes,&apos; you&apos;re in luck. Norma serves up fantastic Italian food at a good price. The gnocchi was phenomenal - the right texture and paired with a delicious ragu sauce. Plus, the pizza was perfect, nice and crispy with the right amount of toppings. Only good things to say about the meal here.

And at somewhere around $20 per dish, if not a little less for some of the apps, it&apos;s a steal in Manhattan!"
4,"Norma&apos;s is highly rated on Yelp and I am not sure where I heard about this place but it was somewhere.  I think I saw it on TV.  Anyway, I kept it simple and stuck with the margherita pizza ($16). I was worried it would be too big of a portion but it was is a personal size. First off the dough was incredible. It had a crunchiness and a lightness to it. The issue was the toppings were kind of soupy.  Another issue was that there was a blandness to the sauce.  I would eat it again but maybe hit it with some parmesan to add some pop to the sauce. FYI, The sicilian slice is the only one sold by the slice at lunch time. I didn&apos;t try it but might stop by next time for it. It did look a little doughy. 

Norma&apos;s didn&apos;t check off all the boxes but it was pretty good. I would go with 4 stars for this pizza."
2,Nice atmosphere. The food was decent. The service was mediocre. We asked for bread multiple times and it was finally brought to the table when we were already done eating our appetizers. The sad part is that they even charged us for the bread (since when Italian restaurants charge for bread?). Leo was our Italian waiter (nice but very pushy--kept trying to sell us more wine).
4,"This spot is doing well during Covid because of their friendly staff, cozy ambiance, and high quality of food. They also seem to be following social distancing guidelines and provide heated outdoor seating. The pesto pasta dish was spectacular, one of the best I&apos;ve ever had. Previously, we have dined at this spot pre-covid and the food has always been great. The pizza fell short for me because the crust wasn&apos;t as well done as I&apos;d like and resulted in a soggy base. The tomato sauce however is very fresh without tasting too acidic or tart. Definitely will be visiting again!"
4,"After leaving the city for 6 months due to the pandemic, I was really craving solid NYC cuisine and for our first meal, we returned to Norma. So happy we did!

COVID info:
They have outdoor seating as well as reduced indoor; I preferred indoor because it was a bit chilly outside. The indoor seating was definitely well spaced apart but without any plexi. I was a little surprised to see they didn&apos;t have a QR code menu and physically handed me not only a menu, but a clipboard and pen to complete for tracing info. I&apos;m glad they&apos;re engaging in contact tracing but wish they were taking more precautions with regards to the way they&apos;re doing it. 

REVIEW:
I&apos;m happy to report that service and the delicious cuisine are still unchanged! We ordered the Arancini Norma, Pasta alla Norma and the Porcini pizza without the lardo since we&apos;re vegetarian. Everything was yummy and we even came home with 2 pieces of pizza for a snack. 

IN A NUTSHELL:
Wear your mask, take your sanitizer and enjoy!"
5,"Awesome authentic Italian food. The prosciutto pizza and gnocchi were both phenomenal. Fresh, perfectly cooked, and just the right serving size. On top of which, the wait staff was attentive, polite and the food came out quickly. Couldn&apos;t have asked for more, drop by and support NORMA!"
5,"Service is impeccable, and food too! 
The waiter was so nice, since there were no tables available at lunch, he offered to bring one outside, but we decided to wait for a table to finish. We had the Arancini al Ragù, which was so huge and flavorful, the saffron risotto with the bolognese sauce were a great combination, totally recomend it. We also had the Prosciutto cotto e funghi Pizza, and it was also generous in size and very tasty. We ordered the Cannoli and Tiramisù for dessert, which tasted great and were also enough to share, and recommend everything we ordered. Will come back to try other menu items. Thank you Norma for giving us great service and spectacular food!"
4,"This really is one of the best pizzas you can get in Manhattan... (YUP. I SAID IT.) 

Here&apos;s the breakdown of why:
1. Light and fluffy crust with perfectly charred dough
2. Slightly sweet and perfectly tomato-y sauce
3. Fresh cheeses 
4. All toppings are 100. Just try them all. 

The pizza portions are also a great size... it&apos;s really deceptive how filling they can be. 

There&apos;s also lovely outdoor seating in the back (and now in the street due to COVID). If you&apos;re craving good pizza in Murray Hill, NORMA is the spot you need to go to."
3,"This is my second time coming here. We were seated in the backyard which has plenty of heat lamps and nice ambiance. 

To be clear food and ambiance is great 4+. The pizzas are great especially the mushroom prosciutto one. The arancine is pretty special, you get one huge one instead of several small balls. Also tried the pasta this time. Not a huge fan of the pesto flavor but the pasta was cooked perfectly and there are plenty of non pesto sauces to choose from. 

I&apos;m taking a star off for the service we received earlier this week. Things started off good, friendly service, nothing unusual. Towards the end, we had finished eating and said no thanks to dessert. We were still chatting and finishing drinks when the server came over and interrupted to basically ask us to pay. There were plenty of open tables so not sure what the rush was. To make matters worse, they use one of those machines where he stood over us, reviewed the bill with us and then watched as we were tipping (hello it&apos;s covid, please distance!!) Extremely uncomfortable and strange. If he had just dropped off a paper bill, great. This also happened last time but it was lunch and we were ready to go so it wasn&apos;t as big of a disruption. Anyways I&apos;m sure this would never happen in Italy. It was a bad end to an otherwise lovely evening of delicious food and drinks."
3,"Updated review: this is usually on of my favorite restaurants in NYC, but today they fell short, WAY short. Our muffuletta was a 10/10, but the lasagna we ordered was cold, flavorless, and was extremely dry. I have had the lasagna from Norma and it&apos;s usually on point, but not today. Dinner was a real disappointment."
4,"I picked up a pizza last weekend from here. I ordered the Margherita pizza and SO GOOD. The crust is soft and flaky, the cheese is amazing, and it&apos;s a decently sized pizza. I noticed the other reviews said the pizza reminded them of pizza in Italy and they&apos;re not wrong! I have pretty high standards when it comes to Italian food from frequent vacationing  (I&apos;m always the &quot;Well, it&apos;s not as good as the pizza I had in Italy&quot; person) and this pizza definitely reminds me of that (aaaand now I&apos;m that person again...)! 

The only reason it&apos;s not a 5 star is because I picked it up, so it wasn&apos;t as fresh as it could have been. But I think if I eat at the restaurant, then the pizza would be a total 5/5! Great spot in Murray Hill--highly recommend."
4,"This restaurant has very solid and affordable Italian food in the Gramercy/Murray Hill area. The restaurant itself is TINY, so be prepared for an extremely cozy dining setting. The servers were also a strange mix of standoffish and overeager, but that was probably because they had nowhere to go since the restaurant is so small. The appetizers are super filling too so if you&apos;re not that hungry, one appetizer could be enough for you.

FOOD:
Norma Arancine (5/5) - I really really enjoyed this dish. The arancine itself is technically considered an appetizer but my friend wasn&apos;t too hungry so just ordered this. The rice ball is actually kind of huge and is served one a bed of mozzarella and cheese sauce. Though the outside of the ball looks tougher the inside is gooey and super soft. The sauce around the rice ball mixes perfectly to make the rice not too dry. This is one of their specialties, and I&apos;d definitely recommend ordering it.

Busiate al pesto Trapanese (4/5) - I ordered a simpler pasta because I also wasn&apos;t too hungry, and I wasn&apos;t disappointed. Though simple, the tomato sauce tasted impossibly fresh and the pasta was perfectly al dente. The pasta felt a little overpriced for me but I did enjoy it a lot."
4,"My dad was a very proud Sicilian American (our people are from Caltinasetta) who loved to cook and loved Sicilian food . He was great at it. He passed a few months ago and so dining at Norma&apos;s brought high expectations and anticipation. It didn&apos;t disappoint. Starting with caponata, then arancini (stuffed rice balls) and finishing with Pasta al Norma, a classic Sicilian pasta dish made with eggplant , tomatoes and finished with ricotta salata i had a perfectly lovely experience. It&apos;s cramped with loud music and even louder chatter (especially one VERY loud Italian lady who literally didn&apos;t stop talking- sitting with the owners) but the food was worth the annoyance of people yelling over their dinners. Dad would have been proud and stuffed   

My waiter Gianni did a great job.  Very good food."
4,"Pizza, yummmm. Torn between rating it 3 or 4 stars so I just rounded up because why not. 

Stopped here with a friend for a little girls date night out on Monday night. Although it was busy, we were seated immediately in the back area which was beautiful! I was surprised to be technically be sitting outdoors on the patio in 30 degree weather-- but with the super hot heating lamps and tent like enclosure we were warm and pleasantly surprised! 

I ordered a glass of red wine (didn&apos;t enjoy it much but eh took a chance) and the prosciutto arugula burrata pizza which was wonderfully tasty. Needed a bit of acid but couldn&apos;t get the waiters attention since it was very busy. 

Would probably come again, everyone on staff was extremely friendly and that counts as an ace in my book!"
