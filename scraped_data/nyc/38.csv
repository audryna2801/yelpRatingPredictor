5,"I&apos;m on the fence about giving 5 stars but it only seems fair because of the pandemic. I ordered from the Nomad restaurant for New Years Eve dinner after seeing ads on Facebook for it. I ordered the Nomad chicken meal which consisted of their signature chicken dish, broccoli and potatoes au gratin, their Brussels
sprouts and popcorn. 

The food arrived a little bit colder than I would have liked but the chicken (which I had never had) was flavorful and overall excellently executed. I wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the broccoli but the Brussels sprouts and potatoes au gratin were very good sides to the decedent chicken dish.

I would not order the popcorn again - it was very expensive and average tasting. However, this was overall an excellent meal and a great finale for 2020."
5,"Been meaning to come here for a while, and finally made it for dinner with my boyfriend the other night! Sadly their roof is now closed, although their &quot;regular&quot; indoor seating has a snazzy vibe, as well. I thought that the plastic dividers they put in between tables actually made the space feel more intimate, which we enjoyed!

The food here lives up to the praise - even starting with the bread! I don&apos;t recall what was in both of the dips, but both were delicious, and the bread was the perfect warm and fluffy texture. To start, we also shared the hamachi Crudo. The fish itself was very fresh, and the sliced apples gave it a nice refreshing touch. 

Given that it&apos;s truffle season, I had to get the tagliatelle with white truffles for my entree! I got the &quot;reasonable&quot; portion of white truffles, which I still felt was a very generous serving. The simplicity of the tagliatelle paired well with the distinct white truffle flavors! 

We also can&apos;t forget dessert - we ordered the &quot;chocolate&quot;, which is basically like a fancy Reese&apos;s Cup with pretzel bits. The rest of the meal was delicious, but the dessert may be in the running to have been my favorite part! Service was also efficient and friendly throughout the night. Well worth a visit for dinner!"
5,"Such a gorgeous setup! Was worried about outdoor dining on such a chilly day, but there was a space heater. The food and drinks were excellent (we had burgers) and the staff was nothing but kind and helpful. Tables were appropriately distanced and hand sanitizer was provided everywhere you turn. I definitely will return to check out the Library once it&apos;s reopened to the public!"
5,"I came here for Valentine&apos;s Day with my bf , the rooftop is beautiful!! , our table was next to the window and in front of the Empire State Building.Perfect view.  I had the &quot; pornstar martini &quot; cocktail to start  it was refreshing and pretty cool. Everyone from the staff is really nice btw. For appetizers we had the oysters and the hamachi. We enjoyed the Hamachi so much we even thought we should have ordered two hamachi instead of the oysters. 
For the main course I had the chicken dish which the waitress told me they are pretty known for it , and she wasn&apos;t wrong it was so full of flavors and juicy ,the portion is good enough even to share , really good. but my boyfriend had the beef tenderloin and OMG it was sooooo delicious ! Even so the portion is quite small the taste is totally worth it. 

I had a great time and probably a Valentine&apos;s Day I won&apos;t forget and that says it all.

Ps : the complementary bread and onion soup is really good too !!"
2,"This review is specifically for the brunch service at the Rooftop. 

I booked their brunch for my husband&apos;s birthday, and was looking forward to a unique experience in their rooftop tent setup. To our surprise, even though we were literally the 2nd table to arrive upon their opening, we were seated in an indoor part of the penthouse floor, next to the noisy prep/kitchen area (not in the tent at all). When we asked the hostess if we could switch to a different table, she said she would have to wait and see if there were any no-show&apos;s, even though I heard another party arrive 10 minutes after us, complain about their seat, and got moved without issues. We had practically finished our mains when the hostess finally followed up to say there were no other tables available. We spent the entire brunch staring at an unattractive curtain for an hour.

Now onto the food. We ordered a coffee and a latte - both were incredibly average. We started our meal with some breakfast pastries (the selection was plain croissant, almond croissant and chocolate croissant) and we chose plain and almond. While the plates they came in were warm, the croissants were not. However, I have to say the almond croissant was super delicious!  Even the plain croissant was buttery and flaky. Sadly, the pastries were the best part of our meal.

When it came to mains, my husband ordered the Soft Scrambled Truffle Eggs on Brioche, and I ordered the Carbonara. We had such high expectations of the soft scramble based on the description and price tag ($33 for eggs and toast!) - but it completely lacked seasoning. We added a side of bacon and that was the only thing giving the dish any salt. As for the Carbonara, I enjoyed the perfectly al dente manfredine pasta but the sauce was actually a little heavy on salt. We ended up using the brioche from my husband&apos;s bland AF dish to mop up the carbonara sauce, and finally macgyvered our own delicious bite.

All in all, I was pretty disappointed that my husband didn&apos;t get a fantastic birthday experience I was hoping for. Everything was mediocre and forgettable, with a $$$ price tag."
1,"I booked for the valentine weekend under the impression that I would be seated in the outdoor area under the heated tent. 
That was the attraction.
I asked the busboy several times if there was any space in the outdoor area - he said no.  

I watched several other parties request to be seated outdoors and they were obliged...

I wish they would have made this accommodation for me because the outdoor area appeared to have ample space."
5,"We went to The NoMad in Sep. 2020 for brunch on the rooftop and I cannot wait to go back to try out dinner. From the moment you walk to the front of the hotel, the staff is kind and the food/service impeccable. If you are looking for a restaurant with luxe ambiance and good food (worth the pretty penny), this is your go-to spot. For brunch, I recommend: the steak and frites, pasta (the one with the egg) and omg the almond french toast!! Sooo delicious!"
5,WOW - one of the best burgers I&apos;ve tried AND old fashion!! It&apos;s inside NoMad hotel and I love the dark-romantic vibe inside. They also give you free bead which was really good and two different kinds of butter (one was a bit salty). The burger was perfectly cooked and automatically cooks it medium rare which was PERFECT. I&apos;d definitely come back again.
1,"If you would tolerate horrible service for good food then nomad Rooftop restaurant is the place  for you.  I can not say anything negative about the dishes that we were served but the restaurants service it&apos;s the whole other story. 
From very rude waiters to border line combative manager who actually in todays day and time categorize restaurant patrons as VIP s and not it was a night to remember .  On a side note this place was not socially distancing their customers, the table behind us was literally behind us not at all 6 feet apart and no plastic dividers in sight ‍Will never go back ."
1,"If I could give this place no stars I would just base on their service. My partner called and made a reservation over the phone. With staff name Cara. She set the reservation for 745pm and send him an email. When we arrived we where told the email was not a confirmation. Which we said it was confirm over the phone before she send the email. What upset me is how the staff shoo us to the side even after we told her it was a special day for us and being that it was an error on their staff part. She said they could only offer us their cold terrace  with a blanket. That when I felt disrespected ,like we should take what they give us. That when I notice the starring eyes and I saw we where the only dark-skinned couple there. U don&apos;t want to believe what happening but I felt our skin color decided our fate.We end up leaving, with a night ruin."
3,"Brunch at The Nomad to kick off my best friend&apos;s birthday weekend in NYC was only fitting. I mean, you can&apos;t go wrong with a place awarded a Michelin star and opened by the same team behind Eleven Madison Park, can you?

I was getting old New York glam vibe with the red velvet fabric from the curtains and seats in the main dining area which was where our reserved table was. There&apos;s seating in the courtyard as well which I thought had a whimsical and casual feel to it. 

Gin-based cocktail to start please! With sweet and tarty notes to wake up my tastebuds, Nod to Nothing prepared me for my meal. For food, first came the Brussels Sprouts fried with cayenne and brown sugar served alongside buttermilk for dipping. I&apos;ve never seen this preparation before and I&apos;m not exaggerating, this has been the best I&apos;ve had yet. A little thrown off, I expected the Chicken Sandwich to be fried. On the menu it says &quot;Chicken Sandwich - brioche, black truffles and foie gras&quot;. Sounds like a winner, yes? Maybe if it was fried. The Carbonara was the one dish I was looking forward to but a shame how underwhelming it was. 

On the bright side, it was only the beginning of a fun-filled celebratory weekend and I don&apos;t have to worry about getting a reservation and spending an arm and a leg at Eleven Madison Park anymore."
4,"So 1 Michelin Star....I get it. We have eaten here before but the experience did not disappoint. Veggie burger and sour IPA for me, Sauvignon blanc and fish for momma K. Very well prepared and quickly presented. I found it yet again a pleasure. 

The veggie burger was a &apos;normal&apos; size, not trying to overcompensate for not having meat. The fries were simple with a wonderful seasoning of rosemary, black truffle and sea salt.

Great lunch at a fantastic hotel."
5,Food is good but no big surprise. The cocktails are definitely amazing. Having food there feels like dinning in a garden. The library is worth to check out.
5,Great service on rooftop given the pandemic. The drinks are exceptional so is the food and service. One of my favorite places to have drinks and a decent light dinner. Very cute date spot as well
5,"Perfect dining experience! It&apos;s such a beautiful restaurant. We stayed at the hotel and the concierge was nice enough to make the reservation for us. Our waitress was great, too. 

We came for brunch and were absolutely stuffed by the end. The eggs Benedict was delicious but the MUST have is the cinnamon roll. It&apos;s huge and the maple drizzle they put on top is insanely good. We&apos;ll definitely dine here again the next time we stay at The Nomad!"
5,"This review is long overdue. 
For those who aren&apos;t interested in stories or explanations, we had reservations, we were sat promptly, the food was phenomenal (we had the roasted chicken dish, some other dishes which were amazing as well as the desserts, seriously...the food is amazing). The service was even better than the food. Go here when they reopen. You won&apos;t regret it.

Our visit was in 2019
Ok as for the details of what made this visit so special...I came here with my friend who had just been diagnosed with ALS and her autistic daughter. We called ahead and asked to be placed in a corner because she was having a lot of respiratory issues and her daughter tends to be a little loud at times (all things that would make us awful customers, I know, but they were warned and were happy to accommodate us).  My friend wasn&apos;t planning on eating since she could only have liquids at that point, she just wanted to take me and her daughter to enjoy the food (she was a total foodie before she got sick). As soon as our server heard that she wouldn&apos;t be eating due to her only being able to eat liquids, she paused mid order and said she&apos;d be right back. A few minutes later she returned and said that the chef offered to make her some liquid only dishes, so she could enjoy multiple courses with us. Her daughter had a couple meltdowns which is normal, but the staff was so incredibly kind and attentive, what could have been a nightmare outing, ended up being a wonderful evening, and what would end up being one of my friend&apos;s last dining experiences before she had to eat exclusively through a feeding tube. I will never forget the kindness and compassion showed by the entire staff here. As soon as this pandemic is over I plan on returning to New York and dining here again to celebrate a wonderful memory and an even more wonderful friend. Thank you NoMad for what was truly an unforgettable experience."
4,"My boyfriend took me here for my 25th birthday which was such a sweet gesture on his part, so I have good memories of this place. However, from a lot of the Michelin restaurants I&apos;ve been to, I&apos;d say this place was less deserving of that accolade (personal opinion). 

They may have changed the menu since I went back in May as I see they have different appetizers, but the main and classic dish is the chicken for two. It is really quite impressive, they go and pick the whole chicken to show you and then they go and roast it. When it first comes out you can just smell that heavenly truffle scent which is infused all throughout the chicken. I would definitely say this chicken is pretty mouthwatering. The other dishes at the restaurant don&apos;t stand out to me too much."
4,"Great Sunday Brunch spot in NYC!

Located inside the NoMad hotel on the bottom floor. It&apos;s dark, brown woods and dark curtains, it&apos;s quintessential New York!

Came here for brunch. Ordered the Avocado toast. Toast was great and crunchy. But lacked taste. Added salt and pepper. 

The Carbonara with bacon was delicious.
 The brussel sprouts were super crispy with a creamy mayo sauce for dipping. 

Super crowded on the weekends so make reservations."
5,"Went here for a late Sunday brunch. Décor was beautiful (would have been even better had it been sunny since the roof is mostly glass), and the food was creative and delicious.

Brussel Sprouts: 4/5
Definitely not your average Brussel sprouts! The cayenne/brown sugar seasoning coating the Brussel sprouts was flavorful, and it complimented the earthiness and slight bitterness of the vegetable well. The Brussel sprouts themselves were also fried to crispy perfection. However, I didn&apos;t like the buttermilk sauce served on the side as much. It did balance out the intense savoriness of the Brussel sprouts, but it was a little too tangy for my liking.

Chicken Sandwich: 5/5
One of the best chicken sandwiches I&apos;ve ever had! I&apos;m not usually one for chicken, but I heard that one of their specialties is the roast chicken they serve at dinner, and this was the closest brunch equivalent. The chicken was juicy and tender, with the black truffle and foie gras imparting a subtle, savory flavor. The brioche was soft, and I appreciated how there was just enough bread to support the sandwich but not too much to overwhelm the chicken and other fillings.

Service: 5/5
Our waiter was attentive and efficient. I was meeting up with two friends I had not seen in a long time, so I appreciated him being patient and giving us space to continue our conservation long after we had finished eating (we ended up being one of the last people to leave the restaurant at brunch that day)."
5,"I have spoken to many a men and women that say they would never shell out two dollars shy of a hundo for chicken....well friends they are dead wrong in there ideology!

If you come to The NoMad you come to The NoMad for the chicken. My good friends and I came to this restaurant for my birthday dinner and we kept smelling some would say almost a magical aroma. After analysis I have concluded it is the smell of the chicken being &quot;shown&quot; to you! That is right after you order the chicken the waiter brings it out to you when it is half way cooked so you can have a look at it! What a magnificent and orginal touch to the dining experience.

The chicken is served in three different plates with three unique tastes to each plate of chicken. The thighs were the most original which I would describe as a flavor explosion.....before I tasted it I was forewarned by one of my buddies it has massive flavor and this was not a lie (I would compare it to the sixth taste bud the unami flavor if I had to compare it to anything).

The other plate of chicken with some of the most delectable corn and garnishments stood out to me. And finally the main course of chicken - I do not normally eat the skin of the chicken but was informed you must as this is accompanied with foie gras and black truffle butter, this was the most moist succulent chicken I have had.

Ordered the $32 Walter Gibson for two, I managed to finish it myself as everyone else at the table opted for a different cocktail and I say it was very good but the pickled vegatables that come with it go light on, I put many in my drink as they gave you a healthy size of vegatables however I think it disrupts the overall taste of the cocktail.

And please, please order the Milk and Honey dessert! Going to be hard to top this birthday dinner although I do have it on my bucket list to try some Seal in Canada....perhaps next year! And as always people SYOY!!!"
