5,"One of the most innovative, well executed, thought provoking experiences I have ever attended... All from the comfort of my own dining room. All via zoom.

Speaking of attending a virtual magic show may sound so silly to say out loud- a few of my friends even laughed at me! I never expected a virtual event to be so engaging, but it really was.  Dan White is an incredible performer and whether you&apos;re into street magic or not, he executes a fine show. 

What&apos;s great is that we didn&apos;t have to fly all the way out to New York, mask up, or bear the winter cold... It&apos;s accessible to anyone and makes for a great date night at home (wherever home may be for you.) 

Is it a pricey ticket? Yes, but it was worth every penny. I&apos;d do it again and would recommend it to anyone!! It&apos;s been a few weeks since and I still stay up some nights thinking about  parts of the show."
5,"Such an amazing show, we had such a good time! I won&apos;t give anything away but this is definitely the best virtual show we&apos;ve attended, hands down. Very interactive and entertaining, and of course we left wondering &quot;whoa, how did he do that?!&quot;  

The box that came with the show was definitely a fun delight, and definitely made the show much more interesting. I highly recommend the show if you&apos;re looking for a special night in, just a word of caution to purchase your tickets EARLY. We waited 2+ months for our show, but totally worth it."
4,"Definitely a fan of The Magician, but was it worth the hype, the price of a pair of tickets, or the anxiety that comes with trying to get my hands on a pair of &apos;em? Absolutely. The show was whimsy, had a loose storyline, and it got us hooked. And without spoiling too much - every time we thought we&apos;ve seen a trick done before, Dan White (the Magician) kicks it up a notch and we were left with our mouths hanging wide open. 

There were a few things that could be improved on though (i.e., having to order all of your food + drinks prior to the show starting and the staff acting as though they&apos;re part of the crowd by loudly cheering and clapping in the back during the show), but I had so much fun that these things are really just insignificant nuisances! Would definitely recommend as a fun date night idea."
5,"The Magician called my date by his name
to establish truth. As cards shuffled through
the night, he announced the numbers that came. 
The dim lighting shuffled our senses. What is true

inside the Magician&apos;s locked wooden box
is also true about the night sky, filled 
with leftover light. Let&apos;s talk about the clock&apos;s
illusion. Let&apos;s talk about air that can build

a nightful of questions. Let&apos;s call it magic.
Let&apos;s call it human longing that hides
in thin air, travels through the heavy fabric
of our coat pockets, and touches the sides

of our fingers. Let&apos;s call it a sleight of time
hiding questions in a voice box, making it chime."
5,"Great magic show. Dan White is a genius at his craft.  I kept saying, &quot;How did he do that&quot; all night. 
Tons of audience participation is happening so no seat is better than the other. Waitstaff is so friendly.  Highly recommend. We had 6 PM tickets. The show started at 6:30 but you really do have to get there at 6 so you have time to order your drinks and snacks.  
He said the comped truffle popcorn was good/interesting.  They give you a second bowl comped for the second act. Theres a 15 minute intermission.  Fun time.  We were out at 8:40."
5,"I don&apos;t want to divulge too much, so I&apos;ll keep this short and simple. You should go see this show. The price tag is high, but this is undoubtedly one of the coolest experiences that you can have in NYC.

Let&apos;s see how much I can explain without giving too much away. Why this was great:

-Mind blowing card tricks and visuals that will have your jaw dropping the entire time. I easily lose interest in things, and I was laser focused for the full two hour duration of the show. It&apos;s just absolutely captivating.

-Dan, the magician is extremely charismatic and charming. He made funny jokes throughout the show and made it a really wonderful experience. He even hangs back to greet fans at the end of the show!

-The show is intimate (probably around 70 people) and there is lots of audience participation mixed in throughout the show. I loved how interactive it was! 

-The space at the Nomad is dimly lit, swanky and the perfect backdrop for the show. Drinks are pricey, but given the setting and price of show tickets this was not surprising. You are also served complimentary chicken flavored popcorn, and the service is really great. 

Because tickets are a little pricey, I&apos;d say this is the perfect pick if you are looking to buy someone a gift for a special occasion and want to impress. Especially if you have someone in your life that is hard to shop for, and really values cool experiences over material things. This was an anniversary gift for my husband and he was super happy with the gift, which was a big win. Just note that tickets are hard to snag. Figure out when the tickets you want are going on sale, and put a note in your calendar to grab them at that exact moment. If you don&apos;t, they will be gone."
5,"A fun-for-all-ages magic show this is most certainly not (I wouldn&apos;t have attended if it were!) What this is is an 18 &amp; over event with nearly-impossible-to-get tickets. The Magician, Dan White, performs in an intimate room that seats about 75 in the well-appointed Nomad Hotel. Gorgeous, pricey drinks are on the menu, complimentary fancy popcorn is served (truffle &amp; chicken for the first act; milk &amp; honey for the second.)

Dan&apos;s tricks &amp; illusions are incredible, many of them requiring audience participation. Dan talked us through a particular trick, which made us feel we, too, were capable of creating magic. His charm, humor, &amp; delivery sets him apart from other magicians; he&apos;s relatable &amp; likable, &amp; that made my party of four agree -- we&apos;d pay to see him perform again. Dan took the time to chat &amp; posed for photos after the show. 

Details: As instructed, we arrived at 10pm for the 10:30 showtime, giving us time to place drink orders. There&apos;s a short 10-minute intermission in between acts. Bring a sweater, as we were sometimes chilly from the air-con. 

A thrilling, enchanted evening of magic. Will try to score tickets for a date night."
5,"If only I could give more than 5 stars! Top 3 best experiences of my life. Everything about the show, hotel, staff, and Dan himself is exceptional. I recommend this for anyone and everyone. He redefined magic for me- thank you for a phenomenal night full of awe, laughter, and kindness. 

Popcorn and drinks were yummy. It was an overall perfect experience."
5,"What an experience. I haven&apos;t been to a magic show since I was a kid, obsessed (back then) with David Copperfield. Fun fact: Dan actually worked for him, years ago.  

From being told to &quot;ask the lady in the white dress&quot; about where to go to attend the show, to the intimate speakeasy-like setting that one can only  find at the Nomad hotel, this was a really fun, genuinely unique way to spend an evening. Dan White is a wonderful performer - he&apos;s funny, he&apos;s relatable and apparently a bit of a mindreader too... 

We kept trying to figure out how he was pulling off all his acts, and I even (a self-proclaimed introvert) volunteered, just because.

We also loved the cocktails, and the bowls of popcorn - savory in the first act, sweet in the second act and the ambiance. The music, I might add, also adds an elegant touch to the event. 

You have to come and know that there&apos;s truly not a bad seat anywhere (oh, and for us early birds, they won&apos;t let you in earlier than 30 mins before the show starts)."
5,"After seeing The Magician a couple of nights ago, I texted a bunch of my friends to gush about the show and tell them to get tickets. I think I just ended up annoying them with the amount of caps and exclamation points I used, but The Magician is that kind of show: you want to tell everyone how amazing it is and share the experience with them.

To get tickets for the date I was looking for, I hunkered down in front of my computer five minutes before 10 AM. When the countdown on the calendar ended, I immediately clicked on the &quot;buy tickets&quot; button that showed up. I don&apos;t know if I was exceptionally lucky or happened to have a fast Internet connection, but somehow, I managed to snag two general tickets for a Friday 10:30 PM show on my first try. I bought them without knowing if anyone would be able to go with me (you can only buy tickets in pairs), but fortunately, one of my friends was game to see the show.

The venue at the NoMad is wonderful and intimate. Although tickets can be tricky to get, I didn&apos;t get the vibe that The Magician is meant to be exclusive. (And anyway, I&apos;m certainly not cool enough to be part of an elite crowd.) Instead, the goal seems to be making the experience as interactive and engaging as possible. The staff were personable as they welcomed us and took drink orders. My friend and I got Palomas, which were refreshing and strong. We also munched on the chicken-flavored popcorn that was included in the ticket cost; this was replaced by milk and honey popcorn for the second half of the show.

I won&apos;t give any spoilers, but the show itself was astounding. Dan White was charming, relatable, and humorous while causing us to scratch our heads as we wondered how he pulled everything off. Time flew by, and I was THAT person who exclaimed, &quot;Wow!&quot; at the end of every trick. (Sincere apologies to everyone who was within earshot of me--my Paloma got to me.)

You don&apos;t have to spring for the pricier tickets to increase your odds of participating in the show. In fact, Dan got everyone to participate in one trick, which was arguably the coolest one of the night. I sat by the wall in the second-to-the-last row, and I thought I had no chance of being picked as a volunteer. However, Dan does a great job of drawing volunteers from all parts of the room, and I actually got to participate in a trick. I was worried I would mess up the act--seriously, that Paloma was potent--but I had no reason to be nervous. Dan is fantastic at leading volunteers through the tricks, and he helped me feel at ease. He also made it clear to all of us that we could decline to participate if we didn&apos;t feel comfortable.

I was very happy with general tickets, and I actually preferred sitting in the back rows. Dan moves throughout the room, and the people seated in the front had to turn around to see him during parts of the show. I did have to crane my neck a little to see the action on the stage at the very beginning of the show, but the visuals weren&apos;t particularly important, and I had no problem seeing the rest of the show.

My friends are tired of hearing me rhapsodize about The Magician, so now I&apos;ve resorted to gushing on Yelp. After the show, Dan shook hands with every guest and thanked them--the perfect way to end. I usually don&apos;t hang onto souvenirs, but I kept one of the cards I was given (everyone gets a few before the show), and it&apos;s a great reminder of an unforgettable night. If you&apos;re hesitating about buying tickets, trust me; at the end of the show, you won&apos;t be thinking about the money you spent. Instead, you&apos;ll be fired up from the incredible experience. I&apos;m so grateful to be lucky enough to have seen Dan. Many, many thanks to his team at the NoMad!"
4,"The Quick: **No spoilers here** magic is real! What a fun and thrilling experience, in the absolutely gorgeous Nomad Hotel! Good for date night or special occasion. 

The Details: what an impressive magician! From the moment you walk into the hotel, so when you leave fascinated, the whole experience is fun and lively. Tickets sell out way in advance, so plan early. The drinks and food are pretty delicious as well, but a tad pricey. Enjoy!

The Damage: I believe tickets are around $100 each, which includes the show and small snacks."
5,"Thoroughly impressive and fun experience! My husband &amp; I were awestruck by Dan&apos;s talent and showmanship. His magic tricks will astound you, and his humor &amp; warmth will charm you. We purchased &quot;reserved&quot; tier seats and were satisfied with the view; I recommend either splurging on &quot;premier&quot; seats or getting reserve. After the show concluded, Dan graciously stayed back to take photos with whomever wanted. Strongly recommend this first-rate, one of a kind show."
5,"Fabulous experience. No photos allowed of the show; they&apos;ll spot you and have you delete. Really an incredible show and almost a comedy with the right crowd. Interactive, fun, easy to follow, unpredictable. 

The only annoyance is you have to order all drinks and food upon arrival for the full show. I didn&apos;t love the first vodka cocktail, but then switched to the &quot;En Maison&quot; - a take on the old fashioned - and absolutely loved it. Exclusive to the bar up at the magic show too."
5,"Dan white is an absolutely amazing magician with the stage presence of a seasoned performer.

From start to finish, the crowd was mindblown and we were constantly being engaged on a personal level, so it kept it very entertaining.

Will gift this to friends for them to check out. Highly recommend"
5,One of the best shows I have ever seen.  Dan White gives your your money&apos;s worth and truly amazes.  The setting at the NoMad hotel is intImate and allows you to see the illusions up close.  Audience participation makes it even better!
5,"I&apos;ve seen shows a Magic Castle several times, and while I prefer that venue to Nomad Hotel, Dan White puts those magicians to shame. He is easily the best magician I have ever seen perform. 

Audience participation is ubiquitous throughout the show. Dan does a superb job of keeping everyone engaged throughout the two hour performance. He has the charisma to match the talent. If you&apos;re looking for a unique activity to do in the city, come here."
5,"Amazing!!! From start to finish. The wait staff is superb!  They were very attentive, polite and efficient. The food and drinks were perfection and Dan the magician was phenomenal!  Best night in NYC. THANKS NOMAD!"
5,One of the best experiences we&apos;ve ever had. Such a fun evening! Mind-blowing! Difficult to get tickets to this popular show so pay attention to the website instructions- tickets sell out FAST- and for good reason! We only had two nights in NYC on this trip so time was precious- I&apos;m SO glad we decided to spend a couple hours of our evening on this- it was amazing and unforgettable! Thank you Dan White and your lovely assistant!
5,"One of the few events you will pay for in your life that you go in thinking, &quot;man...I hope the tickets are worth the money&quot; and leave saying, &quot;I would do this again.&quot;

Dan White is a talented, relatable showman. Non-stop magic that is not smoke and mirrors (although there are mirrors in the show) but more of conversationally mind-blowing (if that makes sense.) You will lose yourself in the show as he continues to amaze you with his abilities.

Just go. Don&apos;t think about the price.  It will be an evening that you will leave smiling and excited you went."
5,"Dan White is the Debil. 

Highly recommended. Worth it.  

Great illusions and he keeps it fun."
