5,"Truth be told if it was up to me I&apos;d be giving 4/5 stars, we did order recently and our cheese fries weren&apos;t delivered, couldn&apos;t speak with anyone from Shake Shack but luckily seamless helped with reimbursement - that aside, my husband is a firm believer this is a 5/5 establishment and at the end of the day, mistakes happen with orders, not a huge ordeal.

Besides the double shack burger, cheese fries, the milkshakes are on point for any milkshake lover.
The holiday shacks (Christmas cookie) taste just as advertised and is super rich and creamy.

If you don&apos;t want to order on seamless for delivery, through the app you can order for pick up to skip the wait on line."
5,"Happened to be in the city today and not too far from here so I had to stop by and pick up cheese fries (I love those crinkle cuts!) and a shake. Yum. Tbh, the only thing that&apos;s gotten me through a rough day. So thanks for that!"
5,"Before I moved to NY, my first ever trip to the city was in 2005 - this was when Shake Shack had this one lone original location, and it was an event to go there.  As in, people planned ahead for it like it was a nice sushi restaurant; something you don&apos;t do often but you&apos;re excited for it all day.  Then it became, you liked going to a certain neighborhood because a Shake Shack opened up there.  Now it&apos;s almost everywhere, every major city - LA, Houston, Detroit, even Istanbul!  

Hence, coming to the original location isn&apos;t so much an event anymore since chances are there&apos;s a location near where you live in NYC (there were two within walking distance where I used to live in midtown!).  But when you do go to the OG, brings back memories of the outside seating, awkwardly trying to find enough chairs for the people in your party, watching kids feed pigeons, bonding with your friends in the seemingly never ending line, watching Karens trying to order food in the drinks-only line in order to skip the longer food line.  So many fond memories.  Your memories of NYC really timestamp the time period you lived there.  For my cousins who lived there before me, they remember the time Magnolia Bakery actually used to be good (hard to believe right?); for me, it was when SS only had 1 location.

Ok sorry, to the food.  The Shack Stack is my go-to when I want to splurge.  It&apos;s a shroom burger (fried battered mushroom with melted cheese) with a beef patty.  It&apos;s their most expensive thing on their menu, but it&apos;s worth it.  Everyone has tried SS already so I&apos;m sure you&apos;ve formed your opinion without the needing my input.  I think what does it for me in addition to the fresh ingredients and good quality meat is the potato bun - you just can&apos;t get that taste anywhere else.

No matter how many times I&apos;ve had SS, no matter where Ive had it, it never disappointed.  For that, and for the memories of the OG location, I truly appreciate.

FYI here is my yelp rating system

5=worth a trip, something you&apos;ll crave
4=worth getting but only if you&apos;re already in the area
3=only worth it if it&apos;s free/discounted, not worth paying full price
2=would not even eat it if free, waste of stomach space
1=the place should shut down"
5,"Always find myself coming back for more at Shake Shack! Super consistent across locations, but this one is my absolute favorite because the ambiance of Madison Square Park is so cute! plus you can get beers. I always order a double Shackburger with fries or the Portobello burger. Sooo delicious!

The OG (original gangster) Shake Shack, how can I not review this? This is the seed that turned into a mighty Sequoia. The little caterpillar that turned into a beautiful butterfly. *This* is where it all began.

Inside Madison Square Park, the line is already bustling with hungry patrons during a lunch rush. I had to get something. Original Shack Burger and a Black and White shake for me. Next time I will get the fries, as I like their fries when they stay hot. I appreciate the smooth and efficient ordering process. I appreciate the staff being patient and smart. I appreciate the approach they take to making this a fun and enjoyable experience, not just a McDonald&apos;s-like atmosphere. Yes, they serve burgers, but beer too, something no McDonald&apos;s would dare put on their menu.

As expected, the milkshakes here are pretty darn good. Sixteen ounces of creamy goodness to complement a tasty burger (sadly, these are too small). The food is pricey, but this is an experience that I gladly will pay for again. 

Whether you are sitting in the park, or walking along Fifth Avenue, it is the perfect treat, if you are willing to pay a bit for it. It might not be something to do daily, but I am happy to do this once in a while, just to remind myself that something that started out in the middle of a small New York City park can taste just as good as something that started out in the middle of a California desert."
5,"This shake shack is within Madison Square Park and is a MUST every time I come to NYC. Yes, I have a Shake Shack back at home but for some reason this one is just always better! This Shake Shack is also the original one. 

I had the Shack burger with double patty. Delicious as always. My boyfriend ordered the Smoke Shack. He said the cherry peppers added a nice touch. We also ordered a side of cheese fries to share. Their cheese fries are my favorite. Overall, this cute original spot is a must when in the area!"
4,"The OG Shake Shack will always be my favorite location.  Nestled in Madison Square Park, nothing is better than nomming on your burger in the beautiful park, gobbling up your concrete while avoiding the vicious squirrels that aren&apos;t afraid to come for your fries.

My favorite menu item is the Shroom Burger, but I recently tried their new Black Truffle Burger which was so delicious, that I&apos;m hoping it becomes a permanent menu item!  Anything truffle makes everything better...so when we are talking about black truffle sauce on top of an Angus beef patty, sprinkled in with some crispy shallots, that&apos;s where it&apos;s at!  It will be offered through the end of the year at MSP as well as select locations.

Knocking off one star cause sometimes from the time you order to when they actually call you for pickup, the food can get a bit cold or you have to wait awhile past the estimated pick up times from a mobile order. 

Staff was friendly and also sanitizing every table after each use. Overall, I recommend visiting, especially in the summer!"
5,I came back again after about 9 months and this time service was 100 times better. Thanks to the owner for the voucher sent. Service is more consistent now and people working were actually very nice. Food and Christmas milkshake were delicious.
4,"I&apos;m such a Shake Shack fan as opposed to In-N-Out. Not like we have much of a choice here in NYC but there&apos;s still no comparison. I used to frequent the location in Madison Square Park because my office was across the street but ever since the Covid pandemic hit, I&apos;ve been ordering a lot for delivery. My order always comes fast, correct and delicious!

Favorite order: SHACK BURGER + LETTUCE WRAP! They use high quality green leaf lettuce which gives it such an awesome crunch! And you can&apos;t go wrong with Cheese Fries of course. I just wish the cheese wouldn&apos;t harden during transit. 

Overall, love love love."
4,"I came here to try the new items that came from the South Korean Shake Shacks: Korean fried chicken sandwich, chicken bites with gochujang sauce, and French fries with gochujang sauce. I also got the Winter Citrusade drink (key lime, blood orange, lemonade). I usually try to use the Shake Shack app since I can just order and pick up. You don&apos;t wait that long. The Korean fried chicken sandwich was okay. I was disappointed that it was not spicy and more on the sweet side.  If you like sauce, it does have a lot of it.  The chicken itself was juicy. The gochujang sauce that came with the chicken bites and fries was also not very spicy and more on the sweet side. I really enjoyed the Winter Citrusade drink though. It was very refreshing and more on the tangy side. I think I&apos;ll stick with the &apos;Shroom burger. It&apos;s still my favorite item at Shake Shack.  I&apos;ll come back to try their new items but nothing can top that &apos;Shroom burger!"
5,"The O.G. Shake shack. The one with the cam that people wait in line for. The one where you can enjoy your burger in the beautiful park on a sunny day. The one that offers gluten free buns and bun less burgers and when I&apos;m feeling bold (celiac) I go for a burger here (so far so good), and now... the one that delivers that tasty goodness to the comfort of your living room. Or your bedroom, if that&apos;s your thing.

Still a great burger delivered. Note NOT to ask for sauce on the side - you&apos;ll get ketchup and mustard and mayo instead of their OG shack sauce! That said... everything else was perfect."
4,"Shroom burger is so good. ! I am a veggie and always go for the Mushroom burger, its crunchy filled with cheese and great sauce. And their curly fries are worth the mention."
4,We visited more than once. The meat is real and tastes like it just has some special ingredients.Food is delicious but this place is the SLOWEST when it comes to service. The food was tasty. I&apos;ll return friends next time. The place has a nice feel to it.
5,"I love this Shack Shack! Being from the West Coast, In-And-Out is still my favorite but I have to tip my hat off to Shake Shack for the super fresh, juicy burgers. The fries are super crispy and kinda remind me of the ones at J.G. Melon which I love. Finished off with a large unsweetened ice tea and I&apos;m a happy girl!"
5,what I love about Madison square park shake shack is that they donate part of the profit to the park. Since they&apos;re struggling with less and less tourists they rely heavy from locals and food delivery services. The black truffle burger was so good I just hope it could be a permanent menu  but it&apos;s only available in selected locations (throughout December only). Winter Citrusade was also pretty good. @katsfoodnyc
1,A Toney MacDonald&apos;s with alcoholic beverages.  A long wait for a fresh hamburger but nothing extraordinary here.  Much ado about nothing.
4,"As a born and bred west coaster, I&apos;m an In-N-Out loyalist so first I&apos;m going to preface there is no better burger - with that said, I can give Shake Shack the fries (especially with cheese), and I think the milkshakes are more or less comparable (although my number one pick is In-N-Out&apos;s Neapolitan. 

So with that said, I love this Shake Shack location. It&apos;s just so lovely to eat in the park and while the line can be long, it&apos;s often fast moving. The process is easy and the food comes out hot and tasty. The burgers are good - not In-N-Out good, but still very good. Love the fries, love the shakes. And while I&apos;ve compared them this whole review, it doesn&apos;t really matter - I&apos;m still eating them both (when I have access to them)."
4,"After hearing this was the original Shake Shack, I had to try it out! This Shake Shack had a super efficient ordering system. Since the line was long, there was a worker who went through the line and took everyone&apos;s orders on a tablet to speed up the ordering process. I really liked the initiative the employees took to get everyone&apos;s food out ASAP. 

The actual food was great but nothing special. Although it tasted good, it was just like any other Shake Shack. The burger was juicy, the fries were crunchy, and the shake never disappoints. 

The main reason why people come here is the ambiance. It&apos;s a cute little area in Madison Square Park with outdoor seating and string lights above. I loved sitting outside and embracing the city vibes as I enjoyed my food. I liked how close it was to the Flatiron Building because it was on my list of things to see in New York! The only downside is that when it rains, there&apos;s no place to take shelter. It started raining halfway through our meal, so we ate as fast as we could, and ran back to the subway station. 

Overall, I&apos;d say this place is worth a visit if you like the city views. The food isn&apos;t anything special, but the restaurant is in a great area to explore!"
3,"Saw a promo on a morning show so made a point to eat there next time we visited NY.
  Ordered the shiitake mushroom and meat cheese burger. The mushroom was fried but was tough and hard to bite and didn&apos;t taste good. Took it off which was better but tasted like an average burger, meat was very thin. Guess I was expecting a special burger from everything I had seen, a little disappointed. 
   On the other hand the salted caramel shake was very good. 
   Staff inside and out were very friendly and the guys outside went out of their way to make you feel welcome and helpful if you needed anything, could say they were awesome.
    Sitting area was very nice with large trees and lights strung over tables. Enjoyed eating outside."
4,"If you&apos;re gonna try Shake Shack, then come here to the OG location. It&apos;s small and outdoors in the middle of a park. Go for dinner to experience all the string lights and city lights. Unfortunately, there aren&apos;t any bathrooms or hand washing stations adjacent to the restaurant and we never figured out where the employees were directing us to. 

Shackburger: pretty standard. The patty was juicy but I think they could&apos;ve had a bit more seasoning. A double was just the right amount of food for me. 

Fries with cheese and bacon: might as well go all out when you&apos;re on vacation. Crinkle cut and crispy. Eat it fast before the cheese makes it all soggy. The bacon isn&apos;t much...they just sprinkle some pieces. 

Chick n Bites: I was expecting something like nuggets but the pieces were so small. Definitely didn&apos;t think it was worth it. Some pieces were dry too. 

It&apos;s hard to be impressed with fast food burgers coming from In-n-out but Shake Shack isn&apos;t a bad alternative. It&apos;s just a bit expensive for what you&apos;re getting."
