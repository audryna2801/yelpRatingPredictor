5,"I ordered the dessert wine tasting with white chocolate which is right up my alley. Ayza Wine &amp; Chocolate Bar also offers bottles of wines as well as a food menu. The ambiance was the main selling point with very aesthetic booths (even during the pandemic) including plant covered walls. 

I liked that the restaurant really caters to different wine preferences since I was able to order a really sweet Moscato D&apos;Asti that I enjoyed. I would recommend that you give this place a try as an change of pace to all the other places near ktown."
5,"Update: still amazing- outdoor seating is beautiful and also warm. Definitely check this place out if you are looking for good appetizers, drinks, and atmosphere. The espresso martini was really good."
5,"Folks we have a winner.......

This past Saturday was a beautiful day to go to Ayza to have a meal in their outdoor space.

I loved their outdoor space - each table is spread out and separated by a glass, there&apos;s floral decor and an overhead covering so you don&apos;t actually feel like you&apos;re sitting outside.  They have music playing that gives you a nice chill feel but the music was not so loud that you couldn&apos;t have a conversation with the person you&apos;re with.

You have to scan their menu onto your phone and agree to their terms and conditions, including to agree to their COVID surcharge (more about that later).  Once you know what you want you have to go back to the check in desk to place your order.  They have an area where you can get water (but you have to get it yourself).  I was surprised about that because everyone has to touch the sprout in order to get water.  They did have hand sanitizer right next to it but I think it would be safer to have someone bring water to the tables the same as they do with drinks.  

You don&apos;t have to wait long for your drinks or food.  My girlfriend and I both ordered the Classic Chocolate Martini.  They came with two chocolate truffles and we were in chocolate heaven.  The martini&apos;s were DELICIOUS and the truffles were even better - a dessert in a glass.  We had two each they were so good.

I ordered the Wagyu burger off the brunch menu, my girlfriend had a goat cheese salad and we shared a charcuterie board of Bucheron and Parmigiano Reggiano cheeses with Prosciutto.

The burger - no words can describe how good it was.  It had caramelized onions, mushrooms, tomato and melted cheese.  It was cooked exactly how I like it (medium) and was absolutely delicious.  It&apos;s accompanied by a field green salad with strawberries and potatoes.  Sadly, the potatoes were cold so I didn&apos;t eat them but the burger definitely made up for it.

My girlfriend&apos;s goat cheese salad looked amazing and according to her, tasted amazing.

The charcuterie board was equally amazing as the prosciutto was really good (not salty) and the cheeses were creamy.  The board also had a few fruits (apricots, strawberries, jam, etc).  Warm slices of bread also come with the board.

My only complaint is that for the restaurant to charge a surcharge, they could do a little more in terms of &quot;customer service&quot;.  No one came to our table to check to see if we needed/wanted anything and the fact that we have to get up and stand on line to place our orders and/or get water makes me feel like then why should we bother to tip if we&apos;re doing the bulk of the work?  I understand that everyone has to operate differently in this age of COVID, but it seems to me to have people waiting on line  while waiters are bringing out food and drinks makes it hard to social distance.

Overall this place is AMAZING and I cannot WAIT to go back."
5,"Solid selection of wines; I had the Torrontes and Verdejo from the white wine list and really liked that they had options other than the usual. Try the Verdejo if you want something grassy. All of the food was great too. I enjoyed the white truffle pizza, chicken lollipops and lamb chops. None of it was incredibly creative, but it was well-executed and I had no complaints. Lamb chops were a nice medium, chicken lollipops were crispy yet well-sauced, the pizza had generous lashings of cheese.

The seating area is also well-sheltered and heated from the elements. Note that you have to go up to the counter to place your order, which is a little disruptive."
3,"This place has been on my list for a while now, and I was so excited to try it. We came here for their happy hour (4-5:45pm)/dinner on Saturday afternoon. They have several different seating options too (indoor, outdoor, covered patio area). For covid precautions - they have you order with the hostess in the front instead of having someone come to your table to take your order, menus are via a QR code, and staff are wearing masks. 

I really wanted to try one of the chocolate martinis, however, I don&apos;t really like when my drinks have milk/cream in them. When I went to order I asked the hostess if the almond chocolate martini is vegan/dairy free (based off of another review I saw it was), she kind of just stared at me for 10 seconds and just said &quot;I don&apos;t know&quot;. It&apos;s fine that she didn&apos;t know but she didn&apos;t even think to go ask someone or confirm whether it was or wasn&apos;t. It&apos;s okay though, so I just ordered the mule for my first drink off of their happy hour menu. This was such a pretty drink, but it was way too sweet for me. We also ordered the avocado fries (wasn&apos;t a fan of, it was mostly the texture for me), hummus (standard), quinoa salad (has so much potential but lacked flavor), and the guacamole (this was good, it tasted like it had ginger in it, which was different!). My husband got the chicken lollipops and the tacos, which he enjoyed. 

We wanted to get another drink, so I went back to the hostess and I asked her if she confirmed whether the almond martini is dairy free or not and she seemed to be frustrated and said &quot;I really just don&apos;t know, I can&apos;t disclose that information.&quot; Someone else heard me ask and she also said &quot;we can&apos;t tell you for sure.&quot; I understand there can be possible cross contamination with other ingredients, but it is just a preference for me, not an allergy. It was all really strange and weird how they can&apos;t disclose ingredients in a drink. Anyway, I ordered it based off of a previous review who said it was vegan. It came out and I really enjoyed it. It was strong but tasty. We ended with the 20 layer cake and the warm chocolate molten cake. I was only able to eat a few bites but they were both delicious! The 20 layer cake definitely lives up to the hype."
1,"Martinis were fantastic- got the chocolate and the peppermint one. 
Appetisers were ok (avo fries and tuna), mains were disastrous (steak and sea bass). Sea bass was dry and felt like the chef left it midway and forgot about it.
Was so disgruntled towards the end that we packed the dessert and left. Not planning on going back."
5,Their outdoor set up is so cute! Insulated but has decent heating still (still not warm enough to take off my coat). They have plant crawlers and lights on the walls so the ambience was great. Had the chocolate martini as recommended by fellow yelpers and it was so good! My friend got the espresso martini which was even better. I got the white ruffle pizza to go and it was delicious!
4,"Ayza is a sinful, indulgent, and fully hedonistic experience. Visually, the seating is romantic and charming, the menu is crafted with wine, chocolate, truffles, strawberries, and other &quot;sexy&quot; foods to make this a perfect date night or girls night restaurant. The first time I visited, we made a reservation and were seated immediately during happy hours. I had the chocolate martini and chocolate manhattan, and a girlfriend described the truffle and manhattan pairing to be better than sex. We stayed here until the end of happy hour and were sure that we&apos;d be regulars at this restaurant. 

I loved it so much that I visited it again within a week&apos;s time. This time, we had an 8:30 PM reservation but were not seated until 9 PM. If your party has any high-risk individuals, AVOID the cute outdoor bus. It is not socially distanced, very crammed (since it is the inside of a tour bus) and the plexiglass virtually does nothing when the windows of the bus are rolled down. We waited a little more and asked them to add a stool to a table that could accommodate a party of two in order to have a properly ventilated dining space. They gave us 2 heaters per table on the sidewalk which kept us toasty and socially distanced with enough open air. 

However, with our 9 PM seating, our orders were put in at 9:05 and our appetizers and drinks were served at 9:30 with a reminder that it is last call and we should put our orders in immediately if we want mains and dessert. The hostess was rushed, and pretty rude once we got closer to closing time despite the servers trying their best. Although the burger was stellar, the chocolate fondue was not even warmed and a very hasty attempt due to the time mismanagement. I do not recommend coming here for dinner on busy nights since reservations will not be upheld due to people staying longer to enjoy their drinks, slow service, and limited capacity.

My tip is to visit this place during happy hours on Thursday/Sunday to enjoy your drinks and meal at a relaxed pace and not worry about the impending 10 PM close."
4,"I first saw this spot on Open table and always up for wine and chocolate. They didn&apos;t have anything open for a friday night but we were able to do brunch on Sat. They had outdoor seating and due to covid, we had to order at the hostess stand but they brought everything out. 

I had a mimosa (and later an espresso martini), avocado toast with fried egg, and split avocado fries and french toast.  Everything was tasty and service was attentive. Place was pretty affordable especially with the $12 brunch specials."
5,"This has been a spot I&apos;ve been wanting to visit for years, but oddly enough finally dined here for the first time during COVID. I&apos;ve since been thrice more. Their outdoor dining is exquisite and warm, and the food is delicious. Came for the Chocolate Martinis but stayed for the unexpectedly wide array of food options! I highly recommend visiting with a group and ordering an array of their appetizers to share so you get to try a bit of everything!"
5,"Such a delicious place and the food and drinks were far better than I had even imagined! We celebrated my cousin&apos;s 21st birthday there and I picked this place specifically because of the perfect blend of classy alcoholic drinks and dishes that sounded yummy. And it did not disappoint! From the beautiful ambiance, to the delicious apps, to the divine chocolate martinis - everything was spectacular. A couple of people in my group got the wine flight and it actually comes with a decent amount of wine for the price in NYC which was a relief. All the meat in every dish was well cooked and I personally enjoyed my vegetarian pasta. I would highly recommend this place to vegetarians and meat eaters. It&apos;s the perfect spot for intimate nights or for group celebrations and gatherings!"
5,"Great costumer service; 
I had made reservations for 5:15, because we were suppose to close early. Unfortunately I had a task that was priority at work. 

We decided to walk in and because it was pack and we didn&apos;t have reservations for the time we showed up. I was told we would have to wait until someone doesn&apos;t shop uo in the 15 minute grace period. After letting them know we made reservations for 5:15. The host decided to accommodate us. 

They proved heating lamps and offer blankets. Just to so you how considerate this establishment is.

I tried the wine Sampler(I love red) so I tried a sweet and 2 other full body wine.

Chocolate wine so it like drinking a sweet red and then biting into a peace of chocolate. I love it 
MONTEPULCIANO was my least favorite 
VALPOLICELLA RIPASSO this was a good choice I loved the notes, but im no Sommelier. 

Food:
I went with 2 apps, the avocado french friend came with 2 dipping sauces. I recognized the Chipotle meyo and just went straight for it. The other one looked like an aioli sauce, but I didn&apos;t try it, sorry. 
2nd app was the white truffle pizza l, I love truffle and white pizza so the marriage was spectacula. 

My friend had the wagyu burger and his eye lit up. It was so funny. He was like the flavors smacked him. He got it cooked medium well and took out the caramelized onions. 

I definitely recommend this place. 

Bon apple yelp ma babies"
5,"Wow! I&apos;m so impressed by the quality of customer service at this place, time and time again.

I stumbled across this place in 2016 and consistently return for their amazing drinks and dessert. ( PS they still honor the yelp deal!!)

In the times of COVID they have a scannable menu on the table.  My friend and I got the sangrias and we both loved the flavor. For dessert this go we got the crepe cake which felt like the layers melted in your month. The dark chocolate fondue is one of my favorites. We especially loved the strawberries with the fondeau. 

Overall, would recommend this place to others! It&apos;s also a great date night spot with plenty of outdoor seating!"
5,"My boyfriend and I came here as a part of our anniversary date, as we wanted some light beverages with dessert. We made a reservation but there wasn&apos;t a crowd so I think you could be seated easily if you come earlier in the evening. 

In order to help with distancing and safety, the hostess will seat you at a table, but you need to get up to the front table/entrance to place your order. They have cucumber water stands throughout the seating, which are self serve as well. Once you order food though, the hostess/server will bring it to your table. 

We didnt try any dishes, we got a few items including blue moon, chocolate martini, and fondue platter. 

I tried the chocolate martini as it was one of their most popular items and I personally didnt like it. Honestly i dont even know why I ordered it I dont like baileys or chocolate liqueur but I just wanted to be adventurous, oops. It did come with a small chocolate bon bon which did help to offset some of the taste of the martini. 

Fondue was excellent, dont really know what else to say about it. Chocolate was melted and creamy while the fruits and other dipping mediums were tasty. Although it was just the two of us, im sure it could be shared amongst a few others. 

The hostess also kindly gave us a glass of prosecco on the house as it was a special occasion for us and it was such a thoughtful gesture. It definitely helped spark up the mood and did not go unnoticed or unappreciated. 

If youre looking for a classy dessert bar i think this is a great spot to try!"
5,"My best friend took me here for birthday lunch, since the temperature on that day was below 30, I was a bit worried if we could stay there comfortably , it turned out we weren&apos;t cold at all there, it was pretty comfortable at out dining table with heater ! 
We ordered French toast , it was super delicious and I totally recommend wine tasting too. Its nice place for girls out also for couples ;)"
5,"This is one of my favorite bars in Manhattan. I&apos;ve come here multiple times across multiple seasons.

The ambience-amazing indoors and outdoors. I love that the indoor environment is warm and fuzzy. The outdoor area is also very nicely lit and it has a nice hum from everyone&apos;s conversations without it being too loud. 

The food- I&apos;ve had their charcuterie which is really yummy, and the fondue, which are all really good. Really good snacks to pair with drinks.

The drinks- I&apos;ve had their chocolate martini which is their signature drinks, very yummy and pretty (comes with little chocolate too!). I&apos;ve also come here other times just for wine, the pour size is good and they also have Ayza brand wines, one of my favorite wines is the torrontes, which is a light Argentinian white wine. In the winter when I was here, they would also give you a small glass of warm mulled wine which is a nice touch. I really like that this place serves mulled wine in the winter just like the ones they makes in the Christmas markets in Europe so I&apos;m a big fan.

This place is great (and also good price), just a fantastic spot to hang out with friends or for a date spot. Check this spot out!"
5,"On a weekend getaway, during the recent indoor dining shutdown, my best friend and I were in search for a cute outdoor dining spot. Ayza Wine &amp; Chocolate Bar has a great happy hour special between 4:00pm-6:00pm everyday! Susa has the perfect cozy winter ambience you are looking for. It is well decorated, sanitary, and heated outdoor space. I thoroughly enjoyed the roasted chicken and risotto.  This appetizing dish was prepared with great care and attention to detail. The presentation and the taste were both perfect. The great service and food alone will have you coming back for more. I highly recommend you stop by!"
5,"Great outdoor sitting with great ambiance during this crazy times! The appetizers especially the truffle pizza was amazing.

Desserts were great too and super friendly service."
5,"Love the happy hour here!! $10 chocolate martini was to die for  

You can also make reservation on open table. they have a decent outdoor seating arrangement and each table is separated with a plexiglass.

However, they are a bit strict on how many drinks you can order during HH. I wish their HH would extend to 7pm because most people can&apos;t get out of work until 6 :(

Also if you check in on Yelp, you will get a free drink too!

Ordering process was a bit interesting - there is no server taking your order so you just have to order with the host but then they will bring you the food. There is also a water station that you can refill your water."
4,"Great place to go after work and great happy hour deal! If you check in on yelp, you get one free drink of either white or red wine, beer, or sangria. It can be a cute date spot too but it is also in Midtown. Love the interior too! 

Things I ordered: 
- AYZA&apos;S GUACAMOLE 
sweet mango, tangy onion &amp; jalapeño salsa with a touch of fresh cilantro w/ corn tortilla chips 
-WHITE TRUFFLE PIZZA
delicate garlic cream sauce, full flavored salt cured beef &amp; truffle drizzle 
- WAGYU CHEESEBURGER
mixed baby field greens, cornichon, beefsteak tomato, caramelized onion, wild mushroom &amp; melted white cheddar (add bacon 3 - add avocado 5)"
