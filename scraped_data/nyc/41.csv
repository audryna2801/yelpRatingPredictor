5,"Favorite dishes hands down: Spicy beef tendon, Spicy baked whole fish, sliced pork in garlic-soy dressing, pork dumplings in chili oil! Decently priced, but packed with flavor. On the top of my list of go-to cheat-spots. Also, got give props on carry-out, food prep is really fast. My order is typically ready for pick-up in 10-15 min! 

Covid update: they have a great outdoor set-up that is somewhat enclosed to keep you safe &amp; comfortable from the elements outdoors.

(My check-ins at Cafe China don&apos;t do it justice...i definitely visit this place or order carry-out more than I remember to check-in)

YOU KNOW I&apos;LL BE  GOING BACK!"
4,"4.5 stars, had to round down due to the price

I&apos;m usually quite generous when it comes to spending money on good food, but the dishes here are truly overpriced. On my first visit here pre-COVID, we ordered the mapo tofu, soft shell crabs w/ peppercorn &amp; chili, and spicy fish fillet. All very good, authentic, &amp; spicy. The mapo tofu was among the best I&apos;ve ever had (comparable to Hu po&apos;s mapo tofu). The crabs were my favorite, but too little meat for the price. 

The second time around I only ordered the Lobster (Szechuan style) for ~$50 b/c I was craving for some good seafood. Spicy &amp; delicious. I miss the good old days where you can spend just $20 on a dish for lobster pan-fried noodles...

Nonetheless, I will come back to (re)try some of their dishes, but it likely won&apos;t be often."
5,"Got a lunch special delivery yesterday - 1) Mapo tofu and 2) eggplant in garlic sauce. Both were good with flavorful and fragrant Szechuan spiciness. Despite of lots of chili oils, the food didn&apos;t taste too oily or too greasy. This place is always satisfying! Lunch specials price was surprisingly affordable, too. The foods might not come in huge portion in comparison to those in other Chinese restaurants, but I like this way - proper amount of food and good/clean tastes."
5,"Whenever my cousins come visit, our first stop on our food tour is Cafe China. 

We love Cafe China so much, last time we ordered 6 items between the 3 of us and one of my cousins had to leave and hurl and then come back. She kept eating. 

Apologies, I know it is TMI. But not much else needs to be said. 

GO SUPPORT THEM! 

P.S. Chungking braised fish stew, spicy cumin lamb, soft shell crab, lobster Szechuan, Chungking spicy chicken are among the favorites. 
P.S.2 They have a wonderful and very reasonable lunch menu."
5,"Absolutely love this place
Their Chinese food is authentic, pure and they Do not use MSG. I Never get a tummy ache after eating like I do with most Chinese food places. 
High quality food 
High quality care
Very nice people
Usually order beef w Green Chile&apos;s and Kung Pao and so so good!!!!!!"
4,"Authentic Sichuanese food with American fine dining restaurant standards, in the heart of mid-town Manhattan. No wonder it has all the buzz and a Michelin star. 

Besides those usual comforting, delicious,  hot and spicy Sichuanese dishes, my favorite dish here is actually the steamed eggplants (also spicy). That&apos;s the flavor from home but few authentic Sichuanese restaurants care to put on their menu. The only thing I&apos;ll try to remember is to ask for less sodium (both salt &amp; MSG) next time because the dishes are too salty to my personal taste."
5,"Over the course of the pandemic my SO and I have ordered from Cafe China at least 10 times. We consistently over order because everything is so great. 

Our go-tos: 
Scallion pancakes
String beans 
Cucumber 
Mapo tofu 

Our sometimes orders:
Veg dumplings 
Shrimp dumplings 
Dan Dan noodles 
Fragrant fish filet 
Kung fu shrimp 
Eggplant in garlic sauce 

It&apos;s not Michelin starred but actually cheaper than a lot of other Szechuan places (and they generally give larger portions as well). Usually we order two veggies, an app, and two mains and it lasts is for at least six meals."
4,"This is the first Michelin star restaurant I visited. 

App: One of best Szechuan style dumplings I have had. The shapes were gorgeous, just the right amount of stuffing and the oil - oh the oil. I can drink gallons of that shit..the perfect combination of sweet and hot.  

Main course: we ordered Spicy cumin lamb and three pepper chicken. Both tasted good, although not distinctively different than other decent Szechuan places. 

Covid specific stuff: outdoor seating is decent and almost wind proof. Heater isn&apos;t strong enough. The street seemed reasonably busy, so expect gigantic trucks passing inches away while you are slurping the chili oil."
5,"Went on CNY. The food was delicious and authentic. Had the fish blossom, tofu fish fillets, pea sprouts with garlic, mung bean jelly, and vege pot stickers. The flavors were beyond this world and there were little outdoor booths in addition to indoor dining. Services were nice. Def a great spot!"
2,"I was so looking forward to this meal as the reviews are so good for Caf√© China. 
I ordered Eggplant with garlic sauce, mild temperature with brown rice. Surprising the order does not come with rice so you pay extra for that. 

The ordering and delivery were quick and easy. 

The eggplant dish was SO oily and it came spicy instead of the mild I had requested online. Definitely a little disappointed. 

I may give it another try but won&apos;t be for a while."
4,"I love cafe china. The shrimps and the fried rice are my go tos! The shrimps is perfectly fried with chilis but is not too spicy. I love that the shrimps are fried in the shell. I eat the shell for a nice crunch! Even without the shell, the shrimps are well seasoned and absolutely delicious. The fried rice is out of this world, you can taste the wok flavor and it is seasoned well and so good. I have also been there for lunch and it is so so so so so so good!"
3,"***Pre-covid Review***

Overall (3.5/5): A bit disappointing in terms of uniqueness, but a solid spot for authentic Chinese in mid-town. 

Food (4/5): Flavors were good, but not mindblowing. If you had brought it home for takeout, I would not have guessed it came from a high-profile restaurant.

Atmosphere (3/5): Dark wood and traditional Chinese decor. Intimate.

Uniqueness (3/5): As a Chinese-American, I was honestly expecting more from a Michelin-starred Chinese restaurant. I think you&apos;d probably find equally, if not better, food in Chinatown or Flushing for VASTLY cheaper prices. 

Value (3/5): See uniqueness, not the greatest &apos;value&apos; if you&apos;re looking for elevated Chinese."
4,"Can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review! I used to frequent here when I worked in midtown years ago, and this place was always packed during lunch and dinner times.

The food is delicious. They are perhaps more famous for their soup dumplings, which can take a long time (around 20 minutes) since it is made to order. The ma po tofu here was really good, so was the pork dumpling in chili oil. The dine-in service was always good. I have also requested take-out, which was also a good deal. Hope this place is still thriving during covid-19!"
5,"One of my favorite spots in the city. My first year of work, I would try to be disciplined with my food intake throughout the week. Then, every Friday I would treat myself to a meal at Cafe China - an extremely reasonably priced Michelin guided restaurant. 

The menu is long and the portions are large, so I recommend eating family-style with a group and trying as many things as possible. My go-to is the dan dan noodles with pork dumplings and chili oil but you can&apos;t go wrong with the entire menu."
5,"I rarely will do a review based on takeout/delivery, but we&apos;ve been lucky enough to be in their delivery radius since COVID hit, and have fallen in love with the place. The dan dan noodles and wontons in chili oil are staples of our orders, as is the shredded beef with green chilis, which my wife loves. The spicy cumin lamb is probably my favorite entree, along with Chungking spicy chicken. I also really liked the mapo tofu.

Some of the best Chinese/Szechuan you can get."
4,"I was sad to see the closure of China Blue in Soho (though the staff told us they&apos;re &quot;cooking&quot; something new that would open around midtown &quot;soon&quot;), so I decided to go to their sister restaurant in midtown for some of their classic Szechuan dishes.

It was my first time trying the snow pea shoots, and while they did taste good and had plenty of flavor the price tag of $18 seemed a bit steep for a bowl of greens.

The mapo tofu ($11) was as good as it gets. I love the numbing tongue feeling that you get from the peppercorns in it. You can add the minced pork for additional $1 and should also definitely pair it with the side of white rice ($2).

The star of the lineup was definitely the cold Szechuan style noodles with vinaigrette and peanuts. I don&apos;t generally enjoy cold noodle dishes but this one did it for me. You won&apos;t understand at 100% until you try it out yourself.

All in all, I really enjoyed the food at Cafe China. The staff were all wearing cloves and masks, and they provided you with hand sanitizer. The only downside of the experience was that there were not heaters at the outdoor seating and the street traffic can get extremely loud and annoying."
3,"Solid 3.5 stars!

I love Szechuan cuisine and grew up eating a lot of it, which means I expected a lot from a place that has a Michelin star. The dishes I ordered here were, unfortunately, not exceptional in any way, especially for the price.

I ordered the following for delivery:

Twice-cooked pork: 
Good! Tender pork belly, cooked well. Makes for delicious leftovers.

Pork dumplings:
On the smaller side with minimal filling. The sauce isn&apos;t spicy but more sweet. If you&apos;re expecting a traditional black vinegar sauce, this isn&apos;t it. 

Scallion pancakes:
Thin and crispy--probably best eaten immediately after cooking, so I wouldn&apos;t suggest ordering this for delivery. (Give them a nuke in the oven if you do.)

Dan dan noodles:
Not a lot going on here. Came with minimal meat and 1-2 strings of veggies. 

Husband and wife appetizer:
Probably my favorite out of the list. The meat was tender, and the flavors were stronger and more on par with what you&apos;d expect at an authentic Szechuan place.

Delivery came right on time, but the portions were smaller than I had hoped. 

Overall, I&apos;d say this place is probably more suited towards an Americanized palate. It&apos;s a good intro place for those looking to start eating more authentic Szechuan cuisine but certainly not the best place to get it."
5,"I have to admit, Caf√© China was simply awesome. I love the vibe. Caf√© China has an amazing Kung Pao Chicken, this was my first time giving it a try here, and I was pleasantly surprised with how good it was. They are very clean and the workers were super polite. Caf√© China... What else could you want?"
5,"So good! Omgoodness I know it was filled with MSG but soooo worth it. The dishes we ordered were are delicious. 

What we ordered:
Baby cucumbers (must get!)- garlicky and refreshing
Mung bean noodles- the sauce from the noodles are addicting, it&apos;s spicy and oily but keeps you going back for more
Fish with tofu (must try!)- spicy goodness, savory and sweet, no chewing needed. Each bite will melt in your mouth. Must get rice with this dish. 
Snow peas with garlic- garlicky and delicious, the vegetable itself is sweet and crispy 
Szchuan style eggplant (skip!)- it was simple and boring, steamed eggplants drenched in oil and soy sauce

Great service! Our waiters came to check up on us and filled our water without asking. Super attentive."
5,"Came here with my now ex-roommates as the last supper together. I chose this spot as a lot of my friends had high praise for this spot and none of us had tried it out yet.

They don&apos;t take any reservations, unless your party is over 6 people. You have to come in and put yourself on the waitlist. They do things very weird as I came in to put myself on the waitlist, hoping to know the wait time so I can remove myself and put myself back on the list as needed. They don&apos;t give you a time, just periodically ask you if your entire party is there. Once my party finally arrived, it was another half hour wait. I put myself on the list at 6:45pm and the entire party didn&apos;t show up until 8pm so this is not an efficient way to use the waitlist in my eyes.

We started off with two appetizers: Spicy Diced Rabbit and the Bang Bang Chicken. I&apos;m telling you this right now, my favorite dish out of the entire experience was the Bang Bang Chicken. The flavoring was something I could not wrap my head around. The peanut sauce and sesame sauce really made me want to keep tasting the chicken, bite after bite after bite. The Spicy Diced Rabbit is good as well, if you don&apos;t mind dealing with the chopped up bones.

For entree, I got the Tea Smoked Duck. The taste is really good the first few bites. When I got to like the sixth piece, I started getting get sick of the taste, so this is something I&apos;d recommend sharing with a group. I got to try some of my friends meal including the Fish Blossom, which I wished I ordered instead of my duck. The Braised Pork dish was very good as the pork is prepared exceptionally well. We split a bowl of Fried Rice with Shredded Duck which we all enjoyed.

Overall, I loved the experience. The food itself is a well earned One Michelin star. Waiting is a pain and the hostess can be a little rude, but I&apos;d still give this place a try just to experience the amazing food that they serve."
