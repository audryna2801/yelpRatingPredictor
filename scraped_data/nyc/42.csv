5,"Yum! the tofu soup hits the spot on a very cold windy night in New York. It&apos;s in the heart of Koreatown (I know, it&apos;s only a block long anyway). Currently has indoor seating available. 
We were served an array of banchan, including mini fried fish. My friend and I ordered the pajeon which is quite large, comes in four cut pieces, with a mix of green onions and seafood, and a good dipping sauce. 
I liked how they give you a generous side of rice in a stone pot for the soup. It came piping hot, and the rice on the bottom and side got to be a really crunchy. We ordered the vegetable tofu soup and the mushroom tofu soup. I think medium spicy is the perfect amount for me, who enjoys the kick but not flaming hot. The vegetarian one has broccoli and other vegetables. I enjoyed the mushroom tofu soup because it has great consistency and doesn&apos;t alter the taste of the soup, and I wasn&apos;t feeling meat at the time. 
Really great dinner, fast service, recommend for nice comfort Korean food."
5,"They really know what they are doing here! The Covid parklet is heated yet has open circulation as they keep the windows open. Service here is notably fast and attentive, even when they are busy. They refilled my side dishes without me even having to ask.

Food wise, was delish! We ordered hot stone bibimbap with beef and pork tofu soup. FYI they take their spice levels serious here! I love spicy so I got my tofu soup extra spicy and almost died."
4,"Been here numerous times before and it&apos;s one of my top go-to places for tofu soup in the NYC area. Prices are on the higher end for tofu soup, but they are consistently solid &amp; delicious. However it isn&apos;t the *best* tofu soup I&apos;ve had. Banchan is provided and the server kept refilling some of the ones that I really liked.

Service: Pretty good, attentive servers...they are quick and direct. 
COVID: They don&apos;t take your temperature. Outdoor dining is available in an &quot;outdoor&quot; house with heat lamps and opened windows. They force you to keep the windows open for air ventilation which I really appreciate since some people wanted to close them b/c it was cold."
4,"Generally pretty good.
pajun(seafood pancake) and vegetable dumpling was good.
But my husband like oyster, so he ordered oyster tofu, but oyster were too small wasn&apos;t that good.
But the severce was so good!  We asked individual banchan for each person( we ordered for four), so they packed for individually! under the pendemic situation it was so great!"
5,I love BCD so I always love coming back here. It was a super cold day and we wanted Korean food so BCD it was!! I got the classic vegetable tofu soup and it was yummm! Their bonchan is also really good and they keep refilling which I love
5,"BCD is my favorite spot for soondubu. It&apos;s their speciality, and they may just be the best. Part of the appeal is the banchan that comes with the meal. They usually bring out six plates!  Many rotate, but the kimchi and fried fish are constant staples. The fish is definitely my favorite. 

I also like that they have combo meals where you can get soondubu and a meat dish. I usually get the kalbi short ribs or spicy pork. It&apos;s an aggressive meal when coupled with all the banchan, but it&apos;s nice to have leftovers. 

Pro tip - Finish one of the small plates, but are craving more? Simply ask your server for another round of the dish. I always get at least two kimchi plates!"
4,"BCD Tofu House is a solid spot for Korean comfort food! They&apos;re known for their soft tofu stew aka soondubu-jjigae. I definitely recommend coming during noon time since lunch is cheaper than dinner. We got the seafood tofu stew and bibimbap! Both were solid options. I love how our meals come with plentiful of refillable banchan.

COVID-19 Side note: If you want water, they only offer BOTTLED WATER (which you will have to pay for). Be sure to bring your own water if possible!"
5,"BCD Tofu House, a staple in KTown, continues to wow even in the quarantine. I can&apos;t believe I&apos;ve gone so long without Korean food; I&apos;m so surprised I made it.

Food
I ordered the LA Spicy Pork and a Beef Tofu Soup along side it. I had forgotten how great Korean spicy pork is, which I didn&apos;t know was possible! The dish was delightfully warm and of course, spicy, with hints of sweet and savory.

The Beef Tofu Soup was actually the first Tofu Soup I&apos;ve ordered and the best way to describe this dish is to say that I&apos;m going to start doing that more! 

Service
The food came incredibly quickly and the staff were friendly as always.

Safety
This is a new category given Covid. They have outdoor seating with nice clear curtain dividers. They pull the curtains closed when the table near you is seated. It&apos;s a nice idea. 

BCD is, was and will continue to be (I hope) a staple in KTown!"
5,"I love this place and have been eating here for at least 6 years. 

Legit Korean flavors run by a bunch of really nice Korean people. 

They have everything I like: Kalbi (yum)!, pork belly, soondobu (all sorts), japchae with beef, seafood pancake (kimchi option also available), and etc. In addition, their white fried fish side dish is so yummy ^^. They also serve a jellyfish side dish sometimes that is sweet and refreshing. Yesterday they had braised beef as well. 

Let&apos;s not forget the soju!!! Peach is classic but they have other flavors, too!

Right now, both indoor and outdoor seating is available. 

Tom will take super good care of you, as will the rest of the wait staff. 

Please go or order takeout so that they can stay open forever!!!"
4,"As the seating is only outdoor seating, there will be a long-ish (around 20 minutes) at around 4:45pm on a Saturday. However, the staff moves fast and won&apos;t waste any time. The out door dining is also set up so well. Big props to the restaurant!

Tteokbokki was solid although I would wish the flavors were a bit deeper but it&apos;s the classic spicy sweetness that you expect to get. You don&apos;t get that much though on the plate as you can see in the picture. However, the rice cakes are chewy and fresh and the dumplings add a good diversity to the plate.

The beef tofu soup really just hits the spot on a cold day in the city, especially as things are outdoor now. It comes out super hot so make sure you throw in your egg then. Honestly, I just taste more of the spicy-ness than any more of the broth and savory flavors which I feel isn&apos;t the exact right balance but it still hits the spot. I&apos;m loving the rice in the stone bowl bc you can scrape the rice off at the end and get a really satisfying crunch. 

Not my first time, and will definitely not be my last. Must try if you&apos;re in ktown!"
5,"I got here on a Saturday afternoon around 4pm. I was the first one on line. I was surprised because I tried coming here with my family on Christmas Eve and the line was ridiculously long. 

My friend and I were seated by the window. They have a nice outdoor dining with portable heaters and plexi glass dividers. The service was excellent! The side dishes were amazing. We both ordered tofu soups. I got the oyster kind and she got the beef kind. I am so grateful this place is open. This place is always bustling!"
5,My best friend is on her vegan month so we come to Tofu house because they have lots of Tofu soup. They also have regular food so it is good for both of us. My friend had Tofu soup and I have oysters with rice special. It comes with choice of soup and side dishes. Service is very good. My friend and i are very enjoy the meal.
5,"I&apos;ve been going to BCD since I was a kid on the west coast and it&apos;s still my favorite place for soondubu jiggae. I&apos;ve probably had every version of soondubu on the menu and everything is good, but I always find myself ordering the original and the curry.  Be mindful of the level of spicy here - BCD &apos;spicy&apos; may be a higher level of spice than most places. Don&apos;t be afraid of the fish panchan just be mindful of the bones and try to crack the egg into the stew as soon as you get it to avoid raw pieces of egg."
4,"7.9/10

I got the beef bulgogi w/ rice and the spicy tofu soup: beef was sweet and flavorful, seasoned well, but could be better, portions were good; onions were a good complement; soup was very good, seafood and beef inside mixed well; negatives were that the egg(s) did not cook after putting it in the soup and that it was not worth the price (although that doesn&apos;t affect my rating)"
5,"Outdoor dining is available. Precautions are taken and will put a wooden stand that has a plastic film between tables. A bottle of hand sanitizer is then provided to you when you sit down so you can sterilize. Staff is wearing gloves and masks. 

Food:// BCD tofu house never disappoints. Great for breakfast, lunch, or dinner! The food tastes amazing and is reasonably priced. 

Staff:// very kind and polite. Checked up on me and offered more side dishes."
4,"Excellent bugogi and even better short ribs. Both entrees came with a hot pot of rice and pickled things kimchi and a lil whole fried fish. 
Outside seating is limited compared to the normal availability."
5,"Truly comforting and delicious food - at anytime you&apos;d like!

There&apos;s not much that is more comforting that a big bowl of piping hot tofu stew. You can add various meats and seafood. Plus it comes with banchan and a small fish appetizer. Service is fast even when they&apos;re crowded, which is often at 4am. I&apos;ve done take out and it&apos;s delicious reheated too. 

If you&apos;re in the area, especially at an off time or after a loooong night out, definitely go to BCD tofu house."
5,"My favorite spot in K Town, hands-down!
Get the tofu soup! Comes with the sides and fried fish (my fav!)."
5,"Came here because we were craving good ol tofu soup, and BCD never disappoints. My go to is usually the tofu soup with pork or dumplings! We also ordered a side of kimchi pancakes which were pretty good too. 

They are always generous with the banchan (side dishes) and the kimchi here is definitely one of the better ones! 

Both indoor and outdoor dining is available right now. The tables are distanced, hand sanitizer is provided at the tables, and the servers wear masks."
2,"I went to the restaurant 5 years ago. It was really good！！！Yummy！！Unfortunately, stuffs were not kind that time......"
