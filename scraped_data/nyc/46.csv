5,"Ai fiori makes killer drinks. Their house special cocktails blew me away. What was even more special was the amaretto sour the bartender personalized for me - not too sweet and topped with a bit of Prosecco. Absolutely divine.

On to the food. I mean it&apos;s a classic French/Italian Michelin rated restaurant so you know that the food is going to be executed without an identifiable flaw. And that was 100% the case. 

We started with two pastas. The squid ink and the spicy crab. Both were delicious.

I loved the steak and the accompanying potato gratin was to die for. Rich but not heavy. The lobster was cooked absolutely perfectly. The natural sweetness of the meat with that perfect tender &apos;snap&apos; in texture was really something special.

The desserts were sophisticated and again, executed flawlessly. I don&apos;t normally love semifreddos, but wow, the one here is worth ordering."
4,"I have heard that Ai Fiori in non-Covid times is a wonderful restaurant.  However, the best that we could muster was ordering delivery.  

We ordered on a night (not sure if it is every night) where for one price you get an app and an entrée (I think there was a desert, too. We got broccoli rabe, arancini, and a risotto dish.  It also came with chocolate cookies.
I was concerned that this stuff would not &quot;deliver well&quot;.  Ai Fiori makes really fine Italian cuisine.  I assumed that we would get mush, but was I ever wrong.

The arancini were absolutely epic.  Good crunch on the outside and creamy/chewy on the inside.  I could have eaten 20 of them.  The broccoli rabe was surprisingly resilient and tasty.  The risotto was excellent.  It was dense and flavorful and definitely not boring.  Although the portions were small for all the items, the arancini and the risotto were very filling.  My wife and I shared the order and were perfectly full after.  

If they can deliver some basics and knock the cover off the ball, I can only imagine what they pull off in the dining room.  I guess that explains the Michelin stars."
5,"Upscale Italian restaurant located within the Langham hotel. Prices are standard and comparable to European fine dining establishments, but the quality of the food and standard of service are also equally high. The speciality sous vide options were fantastic(Astice), and are by far the best items on the menu. Trofie nero pasta was the best I&apos;ve ever had. Very little to fault here if you are after a special experience ."
3,"Went here for a birthday dinner and wasn&apos;t very happy with our four course prix fixe dinner. Most of the dishes were mediocre at best and even though the restaurant was pretty empty, the service was very slow. We watched as most tables seated after us got their courses before us and finished. 

The only dishes worth trying are the Vellutata (lobster soup with black truffle), polipo (octopus with pork belly), and the spaghetti (with blue crab)."
4,"Have made several attempts to eat here and finally able to try it. The food was good and well prepared. The waiter recommended I try the fluke with cavier and glad I did. It was something I wouldn&apos;t normally order, but it was amazing!!

I felt the service was way off the night we ate Ai Fiori. I had to ask 4 maybe 5 times for limes. Everyone&apos;s food dropped but mine. I had to wait 5 extra minutes which is awkward when 6 people are eating. And you would expect a resturant if this caliber to be on point. There were several other things that disappointed on the service side. Hopefully it was a bad night. 

Food was good and might come back. There are many options for Italien food in NYC and will venture out to new options on my next visits."
4,"Personally, I think I might&apos;ve overhyped this place myself, knowing it was a Michelin star. The environment was great and it was quite a lively fine dining noise level. The servers were gracious and introduced each dish. 

The dishes themselves were good. They just weren&apos;t exemplary. Worth a visit for restaurant week&apos;s deals, although I&apos;m not sure I would pay it a visit normally. Enjoyed the bathrooms too!"
5,Amazing restaurant. 2 Michelin star. Came here for lunch during NYC restaurant week. Service was first class and the food was amazing. Everyone was so nice and friendly. Great wine recommendations to pair with our food. Would definitely come back. Beautiful location on 5th.
4,"Alize was our server And after going there for two days in a row I can effectively say I have tried the entire menu. Every time I come here I just grab a seat in the lounge area which is well illuminated has great music and typically awesome service. My favorite part is perhaps the comfortable sitting in the Ready availability of a one Michelin star restaurant experience. It&apos;s perfect for a girls night a date or even a corporate event. The only reason I Docked one star is because the first night I went there I made the mistake of ordering the halibut and the Seabass. 

I will say even just their popcorn with the hint of black pepper in it is something to experience. I don&apos;t drink so I have had the range of their mocktails and the bartender is a genius With taking my preferences in the account and customizing healthy refreshing beverages that complement the entrées. This review really is a shout out to my server on the second night-Alize.

More food specific comments to come"
4,"Of all of Michael White&apos;s restaurants, Ai Fiori has always been my favorite. While the food at White&apos;s Marea is better, the menu at Ai Fiori is reminiscent of L&apos;Impero where we first came to know and love White&apos;s amazing food. The service at Ai Fiori is impeccable and the food, particularly the pastas, is outstanding. Whether for a special occasion or Tuesday night dinner, Ai Fiori is a great spot."
5,I love this place. This is the best Michelin one star place I ever had. The Food is delicious. Service is nice. And drinks are excellent.I will come back again!
4,"Had dinner at Ai Fiori on Saturday night. An impressive wine list, a solid and constantly changing tasting menu, and exquisite service highlight an excellent Italian restaurant.

Quality: Initially I was concerned seeing a Michelin starred restaurant listed on Travelzoo, assuming it either was an indictment of decrease in quality or that we would be receiving a lesser meal because of the discount. Luckily neither of those proved true. Ai Fiori served up an excellent Seven Course Tasting Menu inspired by the region of Umbria. The meal started off wonderfully with a Crostini Al Tartufo, toasted bread with black truffle and sardines. This was quickly followed by the Coniglio, braised rabbit served on beluga lentils with herb salad. Our pasta course involved a thick Spaghetti With Sausage, served in a light gravy sauce. It was a very strong start, that finally hit a snag with the Pan Seared Halibut. The fish itself was fine, but I just did not fall for the mix of beans, croutons, and pomodoro it was served with. The Pheasant that followed was an improvement, but using two courses on dessert was also disappointing. Nothing wrong with Ice Cream or a Chocolate Cake with Caramelized Banana, just too much sweet to end a meal. I do wonder why they did not offer a full dining menu at the start in case I wanted to add any supplements to our tasting.
Quantity: While a few too many desserts, the Seven Course Tasting Menu was still the perfect sized meal.
Value: $160 for a Seven Course Tasting Menu, but we had a Travelzoo Voucher to reduce it to $199 for two. Huge range of prices for the voluminous wine list, but we settled on an Italian Piedmont that cost $85.
Ambiance: Ai Fiori is located inside The Langham NYC in Midtown Manhattan. After entering the hotel, you take the spiral staircase to the second floor. Here you are met with the lobby and large bar, where we spent a little time before our table was ready. The dining area itself is big with well spaced tables. We sat near the window overlooking the street below. This area was a little brighter than the other half of the restaurant filled with beautiful artwork. If music was playing it was too quiet to be heard.
Crowd: Busy, but not packed on Saturday evening. It seemed like the bar area was the more popular section, but the restaurant itself had a good flow.
Service: Excellent service. Our waiter was fantastic, but they had enough staff to make sure we were well taken care of even if he stepped away.
Parking: Valet parking at the hotel."
4,"I&apos;m always excited to try a Michelin star restaurant during restaurant week. My friend and I went to Ai Fiori, which only offers the deal during lunchtime! You can choose a two-course meal for 26 and a three-course meal for 32! 

First of all, this is located in a very nice hotel. The restaurant is on the second floor! Without a reservation, you can only sit by the bar, which was perfectly ok as it was spacious and comfortable! But the dining area did not look busy at all.

I got the insalata, which was good, but a little too sour for my taste. My friend got the poached egg in a tomato-like soup, which she enjoyed, but also found it a little sour. For the entrees, I got the meat which was cooked medium rare with a side of potatoes. It was simple, delicious, fresh and very tasty. My friend got the shrimp dish, which was also phenomenally tasty on a bed of peppers and olives. Her entree was definitely well-seasoned and crafted, but would probably leave the average person still hungry.... I guess when you go to fancier places, the portion size tends to be smaller. 

The cake was also very creatively made, but not sure if I would pay an extra 6 dollars for it though I have to admit compared to their regular price, we certainly got a deal coming for restaurant week.

All in all, I&apos;m glad I had the experience to dine here."
2,"Want to spend $50 on buttered noodles? This is your place! The presentation is pretty, the taste is boring. The price is outrageous. I don&apos;t understand the type.

We came here for a restaurant week lunch special. I got the gazpacho. It was average at best. Basically vegetable juice in a bowl with two small pieces of strawberry and a single crouton. I&apos;m used to gazpacho with a thicker consistency, the taste of fresh veggies and a hint of oil. This had none of that. I also had the upcharged tagliatelle with black truffles. It was pasta that was supposedly house made but tasted box bought. It was swimming in a butter sauce which tasted overwhelmingly like melted butter at the exclusion of all else. There was a sprinkle of truffle on top. That&apos;s it. Nothing else in it. Nothing else with it. The only thing that I could taste was truffle. I would strongly discourage this entree selection.

I also purchased the Toronto whiskey drink (it&apos;s $12, not $10 as appears in their online menu for restaurant week). The drink was perfectly made and delicious.

I recommend avoiding their supposed Michelin rated food. I recommend avoiding this place for restaurant week. I do recommend getting a Toronto whiskey drink and enjoying it at the bar. Two full stars for the drink, zero stars for everything else."
4,"Ai Fiori was really good!

We got the tasting menu, and it was a great choice. Each dish was carefully constructed and delicious. My favorite part was how they plated some of their dishes in the environment where the food was found.

The service was excellent. I couldn&apos;t get my water glass 2/3s finished before someone filled it up. I love that.

The reason I knocked 1 star is because for the price, I expected to be blown away. Their food was great, don&apos;t get me wrong, but for a top end restaurant such as Ai Fiori, I expected a little more in the flavor and complexity.

Still, a very great choice and a wonderful date/celebration spot. Enjoy!"
4,"I visited Ai Fiori for a little belated birthday dinner and it did not disappoint. 

When tasting menus are an option, that&apos;s usually my go to, but here I decided to go for a la carte as I was in a big pasta mood and had to make sure to hit a few that they&apos;re well known for. 

We started out with the Insalata di Pomodoro and Vellutata. The salad was pretty average tbh but the vellutata (a lobster soup) was a fabulous balance of black truffle and lobster. 

For dinner we ordered three pastas: Trofie Nero, Caramelle, and Spaghetti. The show stopper was definitely the Trofie Nero, a squid ink pasta with a pretty exquisitely rich vegetable profile in its sauce. The Spaghetti was also great - blue crab with a little vinegary spice. 

In the pesce category, we also ordered Ippoglosso, a really lovely poached halibut. The fish was cooked excellently with a tasty crisp on top. 

At this point we were pretty stuffed but the restaurant also sent a nice birthday torte for dessert! 

Tldr: Trofie Nero is a must. Halibut for fish. Lobster soup for appetizer."
3,"We came here during restaurant week 2020 so keep that in mind. Overall, I was slightly disappointed. For a Michelin-star place, the food was decent but not Michelin-star level. I think this was likely due to the special restaurant week menu items which are definitely not on par with their regular prix fixe menu. On a more positive note, despite the high occupancy, the service was outstanding and fast! 

Of the restaurant week dishes, I tried the Tartare di Manzo (starter), Tagliatelle and Salmone (mains), and Cioccolato and Torta (desserts). 

The Tartare di Manzo was excellent. 

I was slightly disappointed by the Salmone as the salmon was slightly burnt/overcooked and the cooking seemed a bit uneven. The pasta in the Tagliatelle was superb but the sauce was a bit on the salty side. 

The Cioccolato was outstanding - great flavors and presentation. On the other hand, the Torta was quite underwhelming and dare I say not worth the $6 extra. 

Overall, I would give 3.5/5 stars as the food was a bit below expectations for a Michelin-starred restaurant. This is probably because of the Restaurant Week menu. I will definitely return to try the regular prix fixe menu."
3,"It pains me to give Ai Fiori only a 3-star rating, considering that my party spent $600 on the 4-course prix fixe menu and also the fact that it&apos;s a Michelin-starred restaurant. 

Overall, the food was decent; there were some dishes that were better than others but again, for the price point and reputation, everything should have been done to perfection, if not exceptionally.

Below is what I ordered for my 4-course meal: 
- Lobster Bisque: very tasty; one of the better dishes we had. I do wish it came with a little more lobster than just the three baby pieces though.
- Fusilli with Pork Shoulder Ragu: decent pasta dish, but I wouldn&apos;t say it&apos;s anything special. 
- Anatra (Long Island Duck Breast): this is the one I was most disappointed in. The flavors were pretty good; you could taste hints of wine which pairs well with the shallot confit and pear. Our waiter recommended to get this prepared medium rare, which I usually enjoy; however this was just a tad TOO rare as there were pieces that were impossible to cut through because of the tendons that have not been cooked down. This also unfortunately gave me an upset stomach later... really not an enjoyable experience.
- Affogato: yummy! But it&apos;s hard to mess this one up.

Service-wise, I was also a bit disappointed. We had to ask for Sparkling Water a few times before we finally received it mid-way through our meal because our waiter seemed to have forgotten it. Someone in my party also asked for more bread and never received it. Finally, we had left our card at the front desk to pay for the tab in advance, but there must have been some miscommunication since we still received our tab in the end to pay for.

All that being said, I think these are small problems that have easy solutions so I look forward to seeing how Ai Fiori can improve on the food and the service to live up to their name."
3,"Ai Fiori was an incredibly underwhelming dining experience. It is so unfortunate that I have to write such a review for a Michelin star restaurant.

While the main entrees were not a highlight of our night, the appetizers surely were. We enjoyed the grilled octopus (polipo) and the fluke crudo e caviale. 

The pan seared sea scallops were a delight. While the rest of the entrees were nothing spectacular or what we would&apos;ve expected from a Michelin star fine dining restaurant. We felt our other entrees consisting of the halibut (ippoglosso), lamp chop and branzino were less than wow. There was no wow factor and we were all very disappointed these dishes represented a Michelin star establishment. 

Our side orders of crispy marble potatoes and broccoli rabe were never properly forwarded to the kitchen. Towards the end of our entrees, we followed up and they notified us that the order wasn&apos;t put in. We understand it&apos;s a minor mistake - but at a fine dining establishment? And it went unnoticed by our server? We kinda wished we never got the broccoli rabe, it tasted like it was sautéed with a liter of alocohol. 

Anywho, the desserts were delicious and the gift for the birthday girl was a lovely and thoughtful touch!"
3,"Not sure because of the restaurant week or just bad choice, the beef was tasteless and so chewy. My friend and I had the same and we both didn&apos;t enjoy the steak at all which is disappointing because I was telling my friend how great this restaurant was... I had much better food before but I couldn&apos;t prove it. However the service and ambiance are always good. Wish they served better food"
5,"This place is definitely a special occasion place. The food is delicious and the presentation is excellent. The service is impeccable and everyone just treats you so well. If you haven&apos;t been then I would highly recommend  you check it out.
