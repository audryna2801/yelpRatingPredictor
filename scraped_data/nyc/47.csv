4,"If you want to relax in a park and enjoy the day, this is the place! There are plenty of seats and many avid readers having a beautiful time! Life is good!"
4,"There&apos;s no place like the Bryant Park Reading room where you get to read the latest periodicals for free without having to go to the library and still enjoy the luxurious outdoors.  I&apos;ve recently started bringing my lunch here and spend time reading through the NY Times or Washington Post. I like that there is a Reading Room coordinator who oversees the area and actually cleans the tables. A little maintenance definitely makes the place a little more enjoyable.  They also have a rack of books, both old and new, that you can peruse. I was pleasantly surprised to find a series of Harvard Law Review books there today. 

Side Note:  I&apos;ve noticed every time I checked into Bryant Park via Yelp, there&apos;s always the same one or two Yelpers who always &quot;like&quot; my check-in (or in fact, like all of my check-ins). Not that I&apos;m against them for doing it but what&apos;s the point?  Just curious...and please respond if you are the one or two of those Yelpers who happen to be reading this. Thanks. :)"
4,Manhattan being more kid friendly in the heart of Midtown?  I wouldn&apos;t believe it unless I saw it with my own eyes through my kid.  Bryant Park has always been known for great area to buy lunches and eat during the business week and of course Bryant Park Grill one of the best happy hour places to people watch.  Now the park has a little area for kids with a merry go round.  Little tables with books.  Just be careful of those idiots that give you dirty looks because your kid is making noise.  Um....let see you choose to sit in a children&apos;s area DON&apos;T give me looks like why is your kid having fun and making noise.  BTW the merry go round is a bit pricey for the small ride but again....you are in the heart of midtown.  People traveling with kids nice place to entertain them while enjoying Manhattan.
5,Does anyone know if it is still open in October or what month it closes? And are there power outlets?
5,"Totally awesome idea. Free books and magazines to read on the premises, no library card required!
It&apos;s designed as a place for the homeless and others with no permanent address to enjoy reading. But lest you think it&apos;s going to be full of homeless folks and no one else, I found the crowd diverse, including local business people.
The Reading Room also hosts authors for readings and book signings, which I happily attended. The sound system was ideal for the open-air area, loud enough for everyone to hear without being annoying to others at the park at the same time (and Augusten Burroughs&apos; prose isn&apos;t for everyone, so that was good!).

Very cool concept in a BEAUTIFUL setting."
5,There is nothing like enjoying your lunch surrounded by books and readers. A wonderful place to stop and enjoy the weather and a good book!
5,Great area to nap since everyone else is reading.  =D
4,A quiet nook to read a book.
3,"A warm-weather, &quot;open air library&quot; featuring free books and magazines to read on the premises. It&apos;s open daily from 11AM-7PM in most months without an &apos;r&apos; in them (and even some with). Unfortunately when you pull this up in search, Yelp has the hood as &apos;East Village, Alphabet City&apos; - erroneous, but likely because it somehow interprets &apos;42nd St and 5th Ave&apos; as TSqP rather than BP."
4,"Such a great amenity, and a great idea,  with all different kinds of people reading and minding their own business.  Love the atmosphere, the handsome steps and walls and the big trees.  You can get a bus to Newark airport from here, but I have not figured out exactly from where--see them going by, curious about where they pick up."
4,"Bryant Park Reading Room is probably one ot New York&apos;s best kept secrets. Outside with lovely tables under shaded trees, anyone can come, have coffee, sandwiches, whatever and browse the free library filled with newspapers, magazines, and books. Run by the city on the honor system, most people are like me--- happy to have a great spot to comfortably lounge, relax and quietly enjoy.  Coffee is half price at the nearby Witchcraft kiosk between 3- 6 pm, and people watching is top notch.
Don&apos;t leave NYC without checking this out."
3,"A very airy and bright space. I attended a creative writing workshop here...really in the middle of the urban universe of nyc. A lovely place to read, write, eat, think....They had white tents up because it had been raining earlier. The only problem or perhaps a good thing is the buzz of the city all around. I will come back here for events."
4,"this is a lovely place to find yourself in, particularly when you&apos;re in the reading mood, or even just for some few moments of solace. you don&apos;t really need to read the books from the movable shelves in the area. you&apos;d see children all the time, with their parents and nannies/mannies. you&apos;d also see corporate types, plus those you think look like they&apos;re leading artistic lives. but why would i care about the on-the-surface pretensions? i just love this place, period. i also love availing for myself the wifi internet service, though it can be unstable at times."
