5,"This location reopened recently. The hostess greeted us warmly and promptly took our temperature before we were seated by G.

High ceilings give an air of spaciousness, decor was simple, yet elegant. Tables were spread reasonably apart but can accommodate 6-10 people. 

Now for the meat. First, we ordered the steak medium-rare to medium-well. Absolutely the best we have tried in our collective memory!
So good in fact, we had to order more at medium-rare temp and will continue to do so in future.
Garlic mash is a must, along with mushrooms and asparagus. 

Service is impeccable. G is outstanding and makes phenomenal drinks (do ask for recommendations). John, the manager, and the rest of the staff followed up regularly to make sure everthing was in order. Totally WoWed, thanks to G and the crew. 

Chocolate souffle was the perfect ending!"
5,"had dinner at benjamins for new years eve and it was by far the best/my favorite meal in nyc. everything was so fresh &amp; delicious, the service was quick &amp; phenomenal. they took every covid precaution to make sure everything was safe &amp; sanitized as well. such a perfect way to end a not so perfect year."
5,"Just had dinner here tonight. Given high ceilings, attentive staff and spacing, felt very covid safe for being indoor. We had the jumbo shrimp and oysters to start, then I had. A rib eye and we shared the lobster Mac and cheese. Everything was amazing- great service as well"
5,The best thanksgiving ever!! Thank you Benjamin. This is the best customer service ever!! Sean was amazing with his team. Thank you for having me and sister. We will come back again.
5,Took my husband for birthday lunch! The service was incredible. Ari was  our server and was extremely accommodating. The food was delicious. My husband had a lunch special and I had oysters with lobster roll. Overall just really good. We will back back!
5,"My wife and I had a phenomenal experience at Benjamin&apos;s House. It started with them quickly agreeing we could move our reservation up an hour. To be fair, it could have been they were experiencing a drop in patrons due to coronavirus, but their pleasant demeanor was pleasant nevertheless.

The food was phenomenal. I had perhaps the best NY strip steak ever, and on a couple of occasions the waiter moved a sizzling morsel of heaven from the serving dish to my plate to save me the muscle strength of doing so myself. The crab macaroni and cheese was phenomenal. A mouth watering delight. And the lobster bisque? One word...phenomenal!

To add icing to this phenomenal cake, when I booked on Open Table I indicated we were celebrating my wife&apos;s birthday. So when I was waiting impatiently for the check, having now forgotten I mentioned this on my reservation request, they came out with a phenomenal creme brûlée birthday desert for her, complete with candle and happy birthday mini-sign in it.  

Suffice it to say, this level of service was...you got it...PHENOMENAL!"
5,"Steve was our server today.  Terrific service as always and got to see my old friend Victor.  Loved the steaks and lamb and tuna...crusted in peppercorn  and cooked lightly.  Delight.  

I highly recommend this place!!!"
5,"Terrific experience over all. Had their lump crab cake, lobster bisque, ribeye with steak fries &amp; creme brûlée for dessert. Pure perfection. 

Impeccable service, out of this world food, classy ambience. Upscale &amp; perfect for a date night. Pricey but absolutely worth it. 

A couple of my friends are coming from out of town in a few days can&apos;t wait to take them here."
4,"tldr: ok food, great service, good atmosphere 

My roommate and I came here for the last dinner for our graduation trip in New York. We loved the food and the service. She got the porterhouse steak, which arrived cut and portioned. The meat was tender and perfectly cooked. We also ordered the house fries which turned out to be roasted potatoes. The Benjamin salad was very good, but a little salty. 

My one fault with this restaurant was that my ribeye was overcooked. The inside was medium-well when I asked for medium rare. It was still tasty but a little dry due to this.

For some reason, our waiter switched halfway through, and our second waiter John was very nice! He was quick and attentive and really made me enjoy the meal. 

Lastly we ordered the creme brulee for dessert because it comes free with a check in. It was also really good, but we were too full to eat it. All in all, it was a great experience and I would recommend it to my friends, but do not get the ribeye."
4,"Benjamin and Benjamin Prime are brother and sister locations with the former having a more classic steakhouse atmosphere and a more diverse menu. The breads (onion bread rolls and whole wheat dinner rolls) were great. The porterhouse for two was a great steak. Maybe slightly chewy, but a great steak. The taste and texture were all superb. The sides were also terrific especially the creamed spinach."
4,"Came here for dinner on a random Wednesday evening and the place was positively packed. Not as famous as the old NYC stalwarts, but clearly Benjamin&apos;s is doing some brisk business with the Midtown crowd. 

My boyfriend and I shared the steak for two with sides of mushrooms, hash browns, and creamed spinach. Everything was on point, though not particularly memorable one month later. Porterhouse was a perfect medium rare, and came on a hot plate to further cook it to our liking. Our cocktails were classics done well - I had a negroni, while my boyfriend had the old fashioned.

Would definitely come back if I were in the mood for my annual serving of red meat."
5,This place was amazing! The steak was so delicious as well as all the food that we were served. The key lime pie and cheesecake were delicious. And our waiter Ari was so nice and patient. Great place would recommend. We will be backs soon.
4,"I came here this week for breakfast.  B-fast at a steakhouse? What what??

Yes, breakfast at a steakhouse and no I did not have steak.  It was a meeting with colleagues that go here on the regular as it is reliable - good food, good service and not super busy.  All good things when you are on a schedule and need to have a business meeting.  

I was fearful that the portions would be steakhouse scale-massive.  However, it was not what I feared.  It was all very sensible.  They had a pretty full menu selection.  I got an omelet that was made from 2 eggs, so it was a good size, along with roast potatoes and a small salad on the plate.  It was just the right size for breakfast.  We had our meeting, ate some food and we were off to tackle the rest of the day."
5,"Excellent experience. Went there before the pandemic. We got Caesar Salad, Crab Cakes and Porterhouse Steak. Everything was very good, cooked just how I like it. And trust me, I am very picky in regards to the meat. Also, the customer service was on point."
4,"Started with two slices ($6.50 each) of Sizzling thick cut Bacon which is like a &quot;Pork lovers delight.&quot; 

Porterhouse Steak for 2 was perfectly cooked &quot;medium&quot; and was served french service at the table. The waiter pointed out the fillet and made sure each of us got slices of it first. Plenty of great steak for two hungry guys. Love the bone. Rolls were nice and fresh. Split a large baked potato ($8) and sauted mushrooms ($14).

For a major steakhouse in NYC the bottle of Rodney Strong Cabernet at $49 is a very good price and it went nicely with the meal. 

The GM Mario came over to say hello and he was very friendly. He saw that it was my friends birthday and comped us two glasses of Malbec. Very nice, Thanks.  

Tiramisu and Grand Marnier were great and the waiters and nearby tables sang Happy Birthday to my old college roommate.  

The only thing that prevents a 5th star is the restaurant is kind of dark, the walls could use a coat of brighter paint and the tables and chairs need a revamp. Noticed lots of cameras on the walls (?) and hanging wall phones at the front reception desk. 

They should consider closing for a week during a slow period and taking care of these EZ to fix dining atmosphere problems."
4,"Benjamin&apos;s is solid but I had to give it four stars because some things were a complete miss for me (though the vast majority was a hit). Being a Peter Luger alums was definitely a more than adequate reason to visit this place in my mind, and I&apos;m happy I did. I recommend getting reservations, especially on a Friday night since by the time we left the place was packed. Before getting to the food, I do want to say that the ambience and service of this place are on point. It&apos;s serious old-school steakhouse vibes all around with pictures of famous celebrities near the entrance and on your way downstairs to the restrooms. As for the service, let&apos;s just say the waiter&apos;s witty response to my date&apos;s rather dry remark about &quot;are you guys a steakhouse because I don&apos;t see a porterhouse&quot; was much appreciated. PS- the porterhouse is the &quot;steak for two.&quot; Now, the food!

For the appetizers he got the tuna tartare and I got the sizzling Canadian bacon. The Canadian bacon...cut extra thick...and a ridiculously large portion, please do yourself a solid and get this.  Like even if you don&apos;t like bacon or pork I feel like it&apos;ll be a disservice to not get this. I promise you, it is as juicy amazing as the pictures posted show it is. Now, the tuna tartare- unfortunately this was a complete miss for me. Not only was the wasabi mayo and the bread off, but the tuna tartare itself just didn&apos;t do it for me. There wasn&apos;t anything inherently terrible about it but it just didn&apos;t taste that fresh IMHO. I&apos;m sure it was though, this is just how I felt and it&apos;s also nowhere near the same quality as let&apos;s say STK&apos;s tuna tartare. Ironically, Benjamin&apos;s steak was way, way better than STK&apos;s.

We got the porterhouse for two but neither me nor my friend who&apos;s well over six feet could finish it. There&apos;s a lot of meat and oh, it&apos;s good. I&apos;ll be honest though, I&apos;m usually more inclined to filet mignon but I preferred their tenderloin a lot more. The filet mignon wasn&apos;t bad it was really good actually, but, again, there are better *cough Keen&apos;s cough, and yes I&apos;ve been comparing Benjamin&apos;s to nearby steakhouses.* Again, the tenderloin really was something else though- medium rare, juicy, and melts in your mouth- my kind of meat for sure.

For dessert we got the creme brûlée which was actually on the house if you check-in on Yelp (so do so)! It wasn&apos;t anything spectacular but it wasn&apos;t bad at all either. A bit too sugary for my liking but hey, it didn&apos;t cost anything so can&apos;t complain. All in all, would I go back to Benjamin&apos;s? Yes. Would I be more choosy in what I pick to eat? Also yes."
4,"Yum yum!!!
Very impressive about the quality of the steak. We ordered the steak for two and it smelled so yummy when served. 
We ordered the medium and it turned out be medium well  because of the hot plate. Otherwise it&apos;s perfect medium when served on table. 
The onion soup is ok option may not order again. But the mushrooms is flavorful, fresh and yummy. 
In all I would say it&apos;s a go to steak hOuse and definitely would come for another visit next time!"
5,"Absolutely FABULOUS meal! We came three of us and got the porterhouse as well as filet with sides of lobster mac, shishito peppers, truffle mashed, and everything was to die for! Server Ari was very welcoming too. This is by far the best steakhouse in Manhattan!"
5,"Came here for a work lunch. The hostess was quick to get us settled in with our reservation. There was a coat rack to hang up our winter coats and leave our bags, they&apos;ll give you a card number to retrieve your items on the way out.

The ambiance was great, perfect for casual lunches, a nice dinner, or business meetings. Thought it would be really prime and proper for a high end steakhouse, but the experience was enjoyable and had a great atmosphere. It wasn&apos;t too loud inside either, which is always a plus.

They started us off with a bread and crackers basket with butter and olive oil dip. The basket had plain dinner rolls, mini herb bread loaves, breadsticks, and sesame crusted crackers.

The service was a bit slow, took a while for our waiter to notice our table, but it&apos;s great that they don&apos;t rush you at all, which is great if you come here for meetings and need that extra time for privacy. 

I ordered the French Onion Soup and the Prime Rib Eye Sandwich. Once we ordered, the food was quick to come out. The soup was a perfect balance of sweet and savory with the caramelized onions and the melty cheese. (4.5/5 rating)

The Prime Rib Eye Sandwich is big! It came with a handful of thick cut steak fries and pickle slices on the side. The sandwich is layered with lettuce, tomato red onions and the rib eye. The steak cut is relatively thin, but cooked to a perfect temperature of your choice. Only issue I had was there were certain bites that had a bit of a chew since the fat wasn&apos;t rendered out enough. Despite the thickness, the bread was surprisingly soft. Overall, really filling and worth trying. (4/5 rating)"
5,"Last night my husband and I went to 
Ben&apos;s Steakhouse to celebrate my husband&apos;s 80th birthday.  I couldn&apos;t have made a better choice.  Not only was the dinner fantastic, the service spot on, I was most impressed by the warm hospitality.  Everyone showed that they truly cared to make this occasion special.
I would like to thank them all."
