5,"Simply wow.

Best Japanese restaurant I&apos;ve been to so far. 

Overall really impressed by their menu selection but also with how finely detailed every single item on the menu is. Really an&quot;Hand-crafted&quot; feel to every dish. Top notch quality and the portions are great for each dish.

The apps were excellent and definitely stood out from each other. If you&apos;re sharing it&apos;s great to order many smaller dishes which provides a platter for tasting.

The Nabeyaki udon was my favorite. The broth was amazing and rich and the Udon noodles were perfectly prepared. As for the apps, my favorite was the Geso Kara a deep fried battered mini octopus with this garlic buttery sauce that goes really well with the texture and taste of the battered octopus.

Overall definitely excellent for quality and experience. Only caveat is the door on the outside is kind of small which makes the restaurant somewhat tough to locate.

Highly recommend this place for Japanese food. Everything was excellent and pleasantly surprising. The interior seating setup is perfect and the ambiance is also great. All covid precautions were strictly followed.

Will be going back without a doubt."
5,"One of my favorite Japanese spots.  Everything here is delicious and affordable.  Before covid it would be pretty long wait for a table but with the outdoor dining and some indoor dining opened the wait is not too long.  

The kimchee cream udon is a must order here, a fun Japanese Korean fusion dish.  The cream croquette has this delicious cream filling and when it comes out fresh it is hard to beat!  The tako wasabi is one of my favorite beer snacks so if you have never tried that would highly recommend.  I also love the okonomiyaki soba, like omurice but filled with yakisoba instead!  This place also has the frozen beer which is always fun to drink but I also love their cocktails here.

For a great, casual Japanese spot near K town this is your place!"
5,"Came here before COVID and recently. Both times the food did not disappoint. They did a great job with COVID guidelines and staying open during these tough times. They had dividers separating between groups. Staffs were wearing face mask and gloves. For outdoor seating, they merged with the Korean restaurant next door (Han Bat). So seating was limited. We had reserved a table online but still had to wait about 15 minutes before getting seated. 

The food was served quickly. We came for lunch time so the meals were served with a salad side The omu soba portions were shockingly big. I wasn&apos;t able to finish. The sauce was not too heavy and the soba was really chewy. The kimchi udon was a bit spicy and delicious. I definitely recommend the MEW chicken (soy garlic chicken) as a side. I would definitely comeback to support their business."
5,"This is such a great spot -- amazing flavors, interesting dishes, and affordable!! 

You scan the QR to see a menu with pictures and then you mark off what everyone is getting on a small paper menu. 

Drinks are pretty inexpensive -- the house Sake is only $5! I will say the don&apos;t have the frozen beer right now. 

MUST TRY:
Creamy Kimchi Udon: amazing flavor, comfort food, large portion
Fried Octopus balls: seriously so good!
Ramen: full of flavor, large portion
Ribs: fell off the bone, amazing
Fried chicken: perfect seasoning and crunch 

JUST OKAY:
Garlic Rice: as a side is fine but it doesn&apos;t have much flavor on its own

My friends also got a bunch of rolls that they said were all pretty great!

I would definitely come back. Great date spot!"
4,"Was craving izakaya and this place looked promising so we gave it a shot. They have private heated outdoor booths for the pandemic (that can slide closed) so that was a good start. I will say they were tricky to find because I thought they were a different place when I walked past so just pay a little more attention than me when you&apos;re barreling to your destination -- difficult for a New Yorker, I know. 

They served barley tea, cool and then hot as the evening progressed, which was a good sign for me because I adore barley tea. It&apos;s so nice and refreshing. We both ended up getting the kimchi cream udon and a draft sapporo. In the spirit of izakaya, we also got two appetizers to split -- the salmon sashimi and the takoyaki. The food came out pretty quickly and all at once, so we got to intersperse entree and appetizer and beer. I was expecting the salmon sashimi -- the carpaccio -- to just be a cool palate cleanser but it was actually seasoned and sauced, which was interesting to me. Takoyaki was crunchy and oozing in all the right ways but it&apos;s hard to go wrong there. And of course, I could see why the kimchi cream is a crowd favorite. The two dominant flavors actually conplemented each other quite well, going down with a chewy slurp. Was not disappointed in my pick from the menu.

Overall, no complaints. Simple and did the trick, satisfying our izakaya craving. I&apos;d say nothing was too particularly standout (though I did enjoy that I had enough of my portions for the creamy kimchi udon to have leftovers because I&apos;m not going to mind eating that dish again) but it&apos;s a solid go-to for izakaya, with prices expected of midtown."
4,"I&apos;ve been here a few times but decided to order in due to COVID. They are really good and I&apos;m so happy with my multiple experiences with them. My go-to staple is definitely the creamy kimchi udon. Everything else is usually good but I like to switch it up a bit. I&apos;ve had their sushi and karage and other menu items, which is usually tasty. A few times, they substituted some sushi ingredients which I don&apos;t like and which is why they fit dinged a star. 

Overall, the experiences and solid and I will order from them when in the mood for some izakaya food!"
4,"This is a review of outdoor dining during COVID.

Izakaya MEW offers heated private outdoor booths which are perfect for the winter weather. Interestingly, they seem to share this space with the Korean restaurant next door and both menus were offered to us when we were seated.

The food is definitely Japanese fusion (emphasis on fusion). If you&apos;re craving more traditional flavors, this is not the place to go. But if you&apos;re willing to try something new, this is worth a visit!

My friends and I tried omu soba, kimchi cream udon, and sweet chili chicken. The omu soba was delicious --- yakisoba noodles wrapped in an omelet and topped with okonomiyaki fixings, so essentially a fusion of yakisoba + omurice + okonomiyaki. Who knew that it would work so well? The kimchi cream udon was also unique, although I personally would have liked it even more if it was even spicier and more kimchi forward. The fried sweet chili chicken was only okay... I&apos;m sure there are other dishes which we should have ordered instead.

Service was reasonable given the outdoor set-up. Everyone was friendly although was a bit on the slower side. 

Definitely worth checking out if you&apos;re looking for heated outdoor dining!"
4,"I have been wanting to go to this place for a very long time but never manage to make it here. I was in the area and decided to grab lunch here. I definitely felt extremely safe since they took numerous COVID precautions - including having little &quot;huts&quot; with heating lamps that fully separates all the different parties. Since I did come during lunch hour, I got to take advantage of the lunch pricing. 

We decided to get the Kimchee Cream Udon which everyone raves about and I must say it is definitely worth the hype. It was super flavorful and creamy - unfortunately  there was only two pieces of shrimp but besides that it was super tasty and I highly recommend this dish. The next item that we got was the Nigiri set which was also very tasty and definitely fulfilled my craving for sushi. Everything tasted super fresh and you definitely have a variety of different items on there. Since it was the lunch combo - both dishes came with miso soup and a side dish. The last item we ordered was a soft shell crab roll which was also delicious and super crispy. 

The staff was extremely nice and efficient here and I cannot wait to come back in the future!"
4,"Given that I particularly love carb-y Japanese meals, I really enjoyed this restaurant. The katsu don was my favorite dish - super flavorful pork with the perfect amount of spring onions and seaweed. Had the right balance of dry and wet with the sauce, egg, rice, and meat. Yum!

Also ordered the kimchi udon (meh) and the omu soba (delicious!). The barley tea they serve with the meal is a great addition too.

Only downside is that it was really difficult to get service, though it was a weekend lunch. Our waitress works at the Korean place next door so she couldn&apos;t answer questions about the menu either. 

Overall a great spot and I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to come back to try more of their rice bowls."
4,"6 years later, and the creamy kimchi udon is still good as ever! Could have used more shrimp (there was only one) but it&apos;s definitely not a dealbreaker. 

I ordered via GrubHub for takeout. I got there a bit early but my order was still finished before the quoted time frame. They have indoor dining and separated partitions, and they take temperatures, but I&apos;m still not comfortable doing indoor dining, so I just got it for pick-up. This time, we had the kalbi, tan shio (beef tongue), katsudon rice with chicken, and Mew special roll. The kalbi was flavorful and tender (for the most part). It came with some cabbage and a side salad, so that was nice. On the other hand, the beef tongue was pretty chewy and it was pretty bland. The katsudon was good - no complaints there. It was nice to have some of that rice with the kalbi. Mew special roll is another go-to but for take-out, it isn&apos;t as good because I think the heat from the seared salmon ended up cooking it the rest of the way. 

I&apos;m glad this place survived the pandemic because I need to come back again for that creamy kimchi udon!"
4,"Small plates are bomb! We ordered around 6 -7 small plate with two main dish, and was super satisfied after the meal. 

Some highlights are
- Tuna Tartare Dome: Tuna and avocado are the best combo. The creamy taste of avocado mixed with slightly salted tender fish. Super delicious, highly recommend 

- salmon tataki: this dish is bomb. Salmon slightly seared, paired with sour cream and wasabi brings a complex and innovative taste. This is one of my fav 

-age kodako: juicy deep fried baby octopus! DELICIOUS! 

-tonkotsu yakisoba: I never imagined this is so delicious because it looks like an ordinary dish. But who could have thought stir fried noodle can be this good! Gotta try

-garlic fried rice: they master this dish. So simply yet so delicious and elegant 

Overall this is a great casual spot for friend hangout."
3,"4 stars for the kimchi cream udon take out that I got. I ordered on Doordash for pickup and it said my order would be ready in 30-40 minutes, but when I got there around 20 minutes, my order was already done. The flavor was mildly spicy, kinda tasted like alfredo sauce plus kimchi. It&apos;s nothing extravagant, but probably the only place that has this around the area, and I recommend to try this.

Taking off 1 star because this place is located in a basement and when I got there I waited for 5 minutes before being noticed. The guy then proceeded to ask me for my name, grab my order, and hand it to me all without a mask. I get it that no one is around, but please wear a mask when approaching customers especially during this time."
4,"A few weeks ago, my family and I came here for lunch. We had takowasa, tonkatsu teishoku, tonkatsu ramen. and kimchi cream udon.

Takowasa was good. Salty, slimy, wasabi, and surprisingly not icy. Everywhere I go, takowasa has some ice particles in them and I never enjoyed that.

Tonkatsu teishoku is like a tonkatsu lunch box. Tonkatsu ramen was a bit salty (it&apos;s ramen duh) but the noodles were a bit doughy for some reason. 

The highlight was kimchi cream udon because its creamy consistency was on point. Sour salty kimchi synergizes with cream sauce really well.

I&apos;ve usually been here at night to get takowasa and beer but never for lunch like this time. Lunch is nice too. Portions felt a bit small but I have a big appetite."
4,"Wow okay, so I came here with friends after nearby dinner plans fell through. I would have to say this was one of the best spontaneous, last minute dinner plans I&apos;ve ever had. 

They have plenty of outdoor seating with appropriate spacing/barriers in between diners, which meant wait times weren&apos;t crazy long. We were quoted about 20 minutes, which was enough time to round the block, get a boba tea and come back.

We got sake, sashimi salad, creamy kimchi udon, sweet chili chicken and octopus. 
The octopus I wasn&apos;t too crazy about, but the kimchi udon and chili chicken were *chef&apos;s kiss*. The sashimi salad was also also very tasty, and made with quality fish. 

Service was great even with the COVID restrictions. Can&apos;t wait to dine with them again."
4,"Came here on a Sunday night without rsvp (literally last night before indoor dining ends :( !!) we waited for about 30 mins for a table.

We ordered a few items to share btwn the 3 of us. The Tantan Men was alittle bit too salty for us.. that was probably the only dish i wasnt fond of.

The hamachi tataki did taste abit &quot;sea-ish&quot; but nothing the red onions couldnt cover. The hotate carpaccio is good, tasted sweet too! If u like scallops u should def get it!

Really really liked the volcano roll and the aburi salmon nigiri was okay.

Saw another table ordering a frozen sapporo so i got it just for fun!

Decor and service was great. Mask required, plexi glass inbtwn each table, outdoor seatings available (I think i saw them have latched doors on my way out)"
5,"Great food!! This is a tiny entrance that is easy to miss but once you head down the stairs, you will see the restaurant. The service is fast and we had take out for COVID-19 reasons. The Kara age is fried chicken that is good but is not any different from any other Asian style fried chicken. The udon cream noodles are by far the best dish. So creamy and satisfying and has a nice blend of subtle flavors. Def recommend"
4,"Pleasantly surprised by this inexpensive &amp; great quality Japanese spot!

We ordered via UberEats on a weeknight. Wanted to sample a lot so we shared:
- Omu Soba (never tried anything like this before and it was a totally worthwhile new experience; creamy, smoky &amp; savory with hits of sweetness)
- Yellowtail Carpaccio (YUM! super fresh and well-balanced flavors)
- Tuna Tartare Dome (liked the taste but not the texture, would&apos;ve like a bit less mush more chunks...I think if you spread this on tortilla chips or crispy rice it would be awesome)
- Salmon Sashimi Tacos (delicious, crispy, creamy, fresh YUM)
- Volcano Roll (reaallly liked this!)

I&apos;m amazed that the prices are what they are for the quality of the food. Really inventive, creative dishes beyond the normal sushi joint standards. I will order from here again and again!"
5,"THE BEST GEM IN NYC !!! kimchi udon noodles WILL change ur life, fried chicken BOMBBB, fries amazinggg, I love this joint! Price is decent too, food comes out fast :)"
5,Best sushi place I&apos;ve been in NYC. Try the yellowtail or salmon carpaccio as a starter. They have a fatty tuna sashimi that is incredible.
5,"Low Key Japanese food spot. Very cool and informal environment in the city. Food is really good! I have been many times and the service is nice and quick. Depending on the time you are going the waiting time can be short or quite long. 
I will keep coming back!!!"
