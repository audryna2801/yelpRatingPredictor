5,"Don&apos;t sleep on this incredible gem in herald square! We came on a busy Friday night and were seated indoors very quickly. The ambiance? Phenomenal. The vibes? Immaculate. The food? Delicious. The drinks? Strong. The service? Impeccable. 

I ordered the veggie fried rice and it was hot, fresh and flavorful. For drinks, I had the sangria (a little too sweet for me) and the basil martini.

Definitely recommend it here!! 10/10"
4,"Huge fan of music? This is the place for you. The interior design of this snug joint on the outskirts of KTown hits it right out of the park. The walls are lined with old records, musical instruments, album covers &amp; remnants from the hey day of Jazz. Even the bathrooms were sick. It&apos;s dimly lit and has that good ole date night vibe.

Twister reminded me of the onion bloom from state fairs but more elegant/refined. It&apos;s a spiral shaped potato on a skewer (French fry lover this is for you) that&apos;s seasoned well with a dusting of Parmesan then drizzled with spicy Mayo &amp; ketchup. 

Kimchi fried rice was 10/10. I got the bacon version and you could taste the bacon fat living in the shadows in this dish. It added that extra oomph. The sunny side egg broke like a dream when I started mixing it with the rice. I also love kimchi and the kitchen does a great job of ensuring it&apos;s not that wicked spicy kimchi flavor we all know, but more of a complement to the dish. 

Having spent time in Texas, I enjoyed the corn very much as it reminded me of of my second home and the Mexican cookouts I got to attend. Delicious. 

COVID-19: tables seated apart, masks worn, temperatures taken and all guidelines were followed. (Side note: these pics are from before indoor dining was closed again)"
5,"This is the restaurant where I had my first dinner with my boyfriend:) He seduced me by saying that he knew where to find the best KFC (Korean fried chicken) in NYC. So we came here just after 1hr we first met.
We are both leaving New York now so I came to this memorable place again to order take out. Very happy to see they are still attracting customers during COVID pandemic. Will miss the the chicken combo, the lychee drink and the good vibe here!"
5,"Wayyyyyy better than BonChon, waaaayyyyyy better than Pelicana. This has been our go to spot for amazing, crispy, flavorful, candied crunch Korean Fried Chicken.

We always order the wings half spicy, half soy sauce flavor. Switching between the two flavors is the only way to do it. 

We&apos;ve been here a bunch of times and all of their other food has been really good. The portions are generous, the quality excellent. 

Love the space here, surrounded by thousands of records, jazz photos and music. Unique concept for a KFC spot. 

Their cocktails are also strong and delicious. ;) 

Love you, never go away!"
4,The best wings I&apos;ve ever had !! I love the soy garlic it&apos;s literally so good. The vibe is very vintage and full of music-related things. They also have really good cocktails. I love coming here for a date night or just to order some takeout
5,"Turntable is my favorite KFC-joint! I would go here often before the pandemic and was really missing those twisters and soy garlic wings... We ordered for takeout on Ubereats and it tasted just the same!

The packaging was great and they listened to our instructions for extra crispy soy garlic/hot wings.
I also enjoyed how the twisters came with sauce on the side so they wouldn&apos;t get soggy on our way back. The dumplings (soy garlic/hot) were also good, but got a little soggy I guess due to condensation.

Can&apos;t wait to order from here again until we can dine in/out!!"
4,"Decent fried chicken spot! My date and I were seated immediately on Sunday around 7pm. We had the Potato Twister and Fried Chicken Combo (drums &amp; wings) with half Hot Spicy and Soy Garlic. Drinks, especially soju, were expensive compared to the other Korean restaurants. We stuck with draft beers.

The potato twister came quick but luke warm. It was soggy half way but still tasted good. The fried chicken came after. It didn&apos;t take as long as I expected. They were sweet and savory, moist inside with a nice crunch on the outside. The spicy ones had a nice kick and the heat creeps up on you later. 

Although the batter was slightly too heavy for my liking, I think this was one of the better fried chicken place near Ktown overall. I could see myself returning."
2,"Went here on a Monday night with a group of about 10 people! They take reservations for groups of 8+, so it was convenient for our rather big group. However, wasn&apos;t the biggest fan of this place- maybe my Korean fried chicken standards are too high after having it often in the motherland, but it was okay. The chicken itself was juicy and meaty, but the flavoring of it was rather bland. I couldn&apos;t really tell the difference between soy garlic and spicy, both tasted pretty similar. Overall, I felt like the place was overpriced for what is is. Alcohol was expensive too- $19 for a small soju from what I remember...

The interior of this place is decorated well and very cute. They play jazz in the background and it is a cute little place. Their beer towers are a crowd pleaser with all the dry ice spewing from the top. Maybe their other foods are good, but wasn&apos;t too impressed overall."
5,"Randomly stopped here for dinner because the food smelt amazing while we were walking by. The staff was super friendly and even gave us a dish on the house. We had the shrimp skewers, chicken fried rice, chicken skewers, and chicken stir fry noodles and they were all great. My favorite was the chicken stir fry noodles. I loved that they had the option to make most things spicy. I love spicy so it was perfect. We ate outside because of Covid but they have a cute set up and bathroom access. I hope to come back when the inside is open since it looked really fun! The decor is awesome and they had great music."
5,"Really nice place with a great menu. Most of it is with a Korean flair.
Drinks were strong and great.
Potato round things were really good.
Caution the hot stuff is really hot. Pickles yes hot pickles.
Service excellent,price good for NYC.
Go and enjoy."
4,"Wasn&apos;t expecting much from a place near K-town as they all seem to taste the same over time but I actually enjoyed the food here. My girlfriend and I ordered the fries, wings, and kimchi fried rice with bacon.

The fries were fresh and I loved the spicy dipping sauce it came with. Added a nice kick to the fries.

The kimchi fried rice was surprisingly good considering I&apos;ve been disappointed mma my times at other locations. Most places have bland rice but this one has some heat to it and the bacon wasn&apos;t overpowering. 

The wings were just alright though. We got the half and half but there was barely any sauce on them. They seem big but there&apos;s actually a lot of air in the wings. 

Overall it&apos;s a nice place with decent korean food for a night out with friends."
4,"This feels textbook four stars. There was nothing wrong with it, and the service was quite attentive and friendly. The food was also pretty good, and I think I would come back if I was craving a bunch of fried stuff; however, in this day and age of eating healthy, I don&apos;t think there is anything on the menu for vegans or people trying to be health-conscious.

Good thing I&apos;m neither!

We ordered the fried chicken, which a few at our table refused to get unless it was boneless. The boneless wings were tasty, although I think I have a slight preference for the ones at BonChon.

We also got the corn, which was very good. And we ordered the spiral potato. Pro tip: get two of them, because people will fight over one if you only order one.

The other dishes were not all that noteworthy. The fried rice was so-so, and the rice cake that we ordered was nothing to write home about. 

What I really loved about the place was the decor and the interior design. It felt like you were transported back in time to...a speakeasy? Or a turntable? Or a jazz bar? I can&apos;t quite put my finger on it, but it was really cool."
4,"I came here upon a friends recommendation. I arrived about 15 minutes after opening and was surprised to find the establishment empty! The waiter was super courteous and attentive (thanks Kihoon!)

I ordered the small spicy boneless breast fried chicken, and I loved it! It was a little difficult to cut with the knife but if I had eaten it like finger food it would&apos;ve been perfect! There wasn&apos;t TOO much breading which was a plus and it was just the right amount of crispy/crunchy. I was expecting it to be a little more spicy, but nonetheless it was a great dish. 

I have explored too many restaurants in Koreatown but this one has a great vibe for group meals! Would come back again!!"
4,"Amongst the many restaurants in K town, this restaurant has probably the best vibes in the whole block. The interior decor is lined with old fashioned albums and vinyl records. At the back of the restaurant, there&apos;s a &quot;dj booth&quot; where I believe is where they play their music selection! Essentially, this place is a fusion of a modern jazz club that serves korean fried chicken! Unfortunately it can be loud and you do have to yell to hear conversations when it&apos;s busy, but it&apos;s all vibes!

We ordered the large size of half spicy and normal korean fried chicken. I split these with two other friends and it&apos;s a bargain for ~$27! The crunchiness and flakiness of the skin is some of the best in NYC. The kfc (korean fried chicken) is super juicy and some of the best high quality. It does take approximately 30 minutes for the dish to be prepared, but that&apos;s how you know it&apos;s legit! As far as taste, the spicy wasn&apos;t spicy and I didn&apos;t think it was too spectacular. The normal was great, nice sweet and savory sauce with a little tang at the end! It doesn&apos;t really remind of the KFC sauce you taste in Korea, but their interpretation of it is amazing! Pelicana gets the sauce right, but they&apos;re a chain in Korea so not surprised there. Overall, the vibes, good food and cost is a great place to hang in K town. But warning, it does get packed very quick during prime hours and weekend."
4,"Korean Fried Chicken is my thing and I had to stop by to try out their chicken. First of all, the place is very hipster. Not very Korean-like as you would imagine a Bonchon would be. The setting is dark inside and there are a lot of memorabilia. 

We decided to get the pancake and the kimchi fried rice as a start. The kimchi fried rice is a must. It has the nice and authentic kimchi flavor to it. It&apos;s topped with an egg and scallions. It was my favorite starter. The pancake was underwhelming. It comes with like the soy sauce to give it flavor but nothing too special about it. 

The Korean fried chicken, which is the main specialty is what I rated this place, a 4 out of 5. While the chicken looked plump, what could&apos;ve given it a better rating was the flavor. There was hardly any flavor to it - the spicy wasn&apos;t spicy at all and you couldn&apos;t even taste the soy garlic flavor. Everything else was good about it but just a bit more flavor to it would put it the best."
5,Our go to spot every time we come to visit my bf&apos;s family. Great selection from drinks to food. Way better than Bonchon. 10/10
5,"The best part of Turntable Chicken Jazz has to be the decor and the vibe of the restaurant. The lighting is dim and the walls are filled with unique decor such as old vinyls and music players. The restaurant is pretty loud but it fits the vibe of being an old jazz club and it&apos;s a great hangout spot with friends. 

I came here for lunch right when the restaurant was open so there wasn&apos;t a wait to be seated. I came in a group of 3 and we ordered the large Korean fried chicken combo (half soy and half spicy) and the spicy rice cake. It was enough for 3 people and we were all pretty full. The Korean fried chicken took some time to come out and I would recommend ordering other dishes as well so you can eat while waiting for the chicken. I liked the portion sizes they give and how the drum sticks were really large. I do think more sauce can be added to the fried chicken and the flavors could be stronger. I loved the spicy rice cake and I added cheese to the dish."
4,"Decent place for drinking and chicken wings. 

We ordered large wings, dumplings, and swirled potatoes. All food are great, but because the wings are a little bit slow, so we had all other food before the wings, which filled us already. We only finished half of the wings."
4,"Got KFC?

5,"I love everything about this restaurant, from the decor to the fantastic fried chicken . We came on a Saturday afternoon around 3 pm and drove all the way from Brooklyn as we were craving some delicious KFC and heard amazing things about Turntables.

Their menu features a choice of wings or drumsticks or a combination with 2 flavor options: soy garlic and spicy. We opted for the half soy and half spicy and also chose the cole slaw for a side and the ranch dipping sauce. The fried chicken is made to order and was prepared in 20-30 min which our server had informed us upon ordering.

Now about that chicken, it was simply glorious. I am confident that it is the best korean fried chicken I&apos;ve ever had and I&apos;ve tried a handful of places including Bonchon and Mad for chicken in flushing. That first bite of tender, crunchy, spicy goodness was everything. The soy garlic was so savory and the spicy flavor offered just the right amount of spice for a good kick but is not so overpowering like at bonchon that you cannot enjoy your food.

The vibe and ambiance was super groovy and showcased walls upon walls of old school radio sets and classic vinyl records. I felt like I took a step back in time and We thoroughly enjoyed our meal with retro jazz music playing in the background (I haven&apos;t felt this relaxed dining out in a long time). We will be back soon and often."
