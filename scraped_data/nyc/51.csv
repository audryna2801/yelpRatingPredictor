5,"Ugh!!! I just... I can&apos;t. I can&apos;t believe you. Bryant Park, why are you so effing amazing?! Just happily sh*tting on most, if not all of the other parks that I&apos;ve seen and/or been to in my lifetime. Is THAT how you&apos;re gonna do me though?! Because honestly, I understand. Something this beautiful can only be located in NY... right?! If I&apos;m wrong, then you tell me why Cali doesn&apos;t have parks like this on the street? Because TRUST me, we&apos;d take it. In a heartbeat. Period.

Damnit... now I wanna go back. How cute is this park?! Just sittin&apos; pretty between skyscraper buildings like it&apos;s nothing. This is how you&apos;re supposed to do a local park. In the wintertime, gimme that ice rink, that bar, those food vendors, that hot chocolate, those vibes. I want it all. I saw it all. I loved it all. Little Bryant Park, comin&apos; in stuntin&apos;.

This park truly has something for everyone. Tables and benches for the lounge scene. Hot cocoa for those chilly winter nights. The most adorable damn ice rink for kids, families, adults... basically anyone who enjoys a good ice skate (I&apos;m terrible at it, so I&apos;ll stick to the people watching). A beautiful space that houses local food and alcohol vendors. Music, holiday spirit. What more?! I mean really, what MORE?! I went at night and it was magical. Just imagine what it looks like during the daytime. 

This park isn&apos;t too far away from Times Square and the Rockefeller Center, so it poses as a great little chill spot if you&apos;re on your way to or from the area. It&apos;s family friendly which is always a plus. During the winter and holiday season, they deck this place out in the most festive decorations. If you don&apos;t want to visit the local street vendors, there are plenty of restaurants and shops nearby that are within walking distance. Plenty of tables for a nice little picnic. The area seems pretty safe, even into the wee hours of the night.

They have all kinds of actives going on here and sometimes even live performances and concerts. The Metro station is conveniently just steps away. Who wouldn&apos;t love this adorable ass park? Well... I&apos;ll tell ya this much; I do."
5,"I haven&apos;t really spent time here since the pandemic hit. It&apos;s as beautiful as ever in its skating rink and winter village of kiosks. It was pretty empty but it was a stormy, rainy day. The rink had outdoor transparent pods available for small groups (probably heated) and  with a lovely view of the park. I was soaked from the rain and didn&apos;t linger, but promised myself I&apos;d get a hot beverage there over the winter."
5,"My fav time to visit this park is during their annual holiday market! Soo many cute stalls and food vendors to try! There&apos;s also an indoor lodge they set up near the ice rink with things like hot cocoa, cider, pierogis, etc. Super festive and gets you into the holiday spirit! 

The stalls are super unique too. You can easily find gifts for friends and family that you may not find anywhere else!"
5,"All NYC parks are pretty great; Bryant park is no exception. There are ping pong tables and cafes, a fountain, and in the winter there&apos;s the Christmas village in all its tented glory. There&apos;s free ice skating, though skate rental prices are astronomical so if you don&apos;t own your own you may not want to partake. 

I&apos;ve also done a free screenwriting workshop here, met up for a march, and etc etc. It&apos;s a great place to kill some time and depending on the season or the event, sometimes a destination in itself."
5,"Just moved to the city and this guy I used to date named Carlos took me here for my first time. Very beautiful park, with an ice rink and had some drinks while on my date.

Little did I know this would be the last date I ever went on with Carlos... sadly he is no longer with us... 
No, not because he is dead. Although I did search the obituaries since not hearing from him was out of character for him and his Tinder profile hadn&apos;t shown him online for a week. 

Oh no no no. His location on Tinder eventually updated which confirmed he had indeed ghosted me.  

PS: again, f*** you Carlos for ghosting me and leading me on."
5,"Amazing Spot !

  Not crowded , you can actually enjoy the park with all the amenities !  The Ice rink is open and you can sit and watch your love ones fall or skate.

The park has vendors so you can enjoy watching their art. Beautiful lamps, drinks, dog treats, food and many more things.

 The winter village is beautiful , the decorations are gorgeous and the amenities are great.

 Bathrooms are clean .

Is a good spot to come with your family, partner or even alone and enjoy the Christmas spirit !."
5,"Review just for the ice skating rink. The rink was free as long as u have your own skates, everything was timed to limit capacity, we were 4 min early and the staff didn&apos;t let us in which I guess is a good thing overall. Still thought the rink was a bit crowded with all different skill levels. Unfortunately the staff does not allow u to use your phone within the rink, I guess for safety reasons. Plenty of food choices in the Bryant park &quot;winter village&quot; area as well. Great to visit"
5,This park is so beautiful. I have been here multiple times and I have loved it each time. But I definitely loved it a lot during the Christmas season. It was so amazing to see people celebrating Christmas in the winter and seeing a lot of these kids go ice-skating. I love these little kiosk that they have where they sell food and also great beverages. You could also find some people sell some pretty cool items that are for clothing or for accessories.
5,Great park with an amazing atmosphere. Love to hang out there and in this area. Â Great food and cocktail spots. The library is a cool thing to do if you are visiting the city. Enjoy.
4,"Of all of my last 4 previous trips to New York City which is the City that never sleeps... When I was here which was last in June of 2019... Bryant Park was not in my list of place to go to!!!! But when me and my family just finished visiting the United Nations!!! 

So from there we wanted to go visit another new place so from there we decided to head on over to Bryant Park... As soon as we got here and this park was really nice to take a walk and enjoy yourself while being on vacation!!!"
5,"We were in NYC for our honeymoon and we were able to visit Bryant Park for the Christmas Market! The Winter Village at Bryant Park was fun and festive! There were many vendors for crafts and gifts as well as food stalls. I happily drank mulled wine and hot cocoa (it was VERY COLD!) and I snacked on...Fried Pickles! It was very busy even when we were there after Christmas. 

The skating rink was very busy and central to the Park itself. There was a very impressive, beautifully decorated Christmas tree. The skating rink was full when we were there. So, we decided to people watch and walk around the market. It was a wonderful atmosphere and very enjoyable time for me and my husband. 

Bryant Park at Christmas time is beautiful and a fun place to be. Just remember to bundle up and to wear winterboots!"
5,"Great place to chill if you&apos;ve been walking around the city and need a break.

The park is enormous and reminds me of a European Plaza. Plenty of seating, tables. If you&apos;re into people-watching, this is the place for you.

You can also sign up to play table tennis, which I thought was really cool. I don&apos;t know where you sign up, but there&apos;s an informational poster next to the tables to tell you. 

Nearby, there are also petanque courts, but no one was playing. I&apos;m not sure where you go to get the playing balls or if you have to bring your own. 

If you want coffee, a pastry, or a quick snack then visit one of the food stands surrounding the park. There&apos;s also a cafe and a Whole Foods across the street. There is also a public restroom at the park...however I didn&apos;t visit so I couldn&apos;t tell you if it&apos;s clean (yikes, beware)."
5,"I visited Bryant Park at least 4x last year as I was traveling for work at the time, and typically have a lot of meetings in Manhattan. I absolutely love Bryant Park. It can be very hard to find a spot to just sit down with your laptop and catch up on some work in New York City- but Bryant Park always had some spots available! They even offer wifi! I can&apos;t wait to come back, once traveling is safe again!"
4,"Enjoying the winter &amp; Christmas @ Bryant Park 2019. 

As usual, for the couple of years, it is sooooo crowded not only due to the ice rink but also the Christmas Market. 

Great stores to feel the holidays, and my favorite one I frequent is &quot;No Chewing Allowed - Just Let It Melt in your Mouth&quot; chocolate store to buy the presents."
4,"I was on 42st and 1st yesterday and I was able to go to Bryant park such a Beautiful place especially during the holidays, winter time with there winter village going on,and a night time the lights and decorations are so beautiful.so many different little vendors to choose from for food or trinkets winter gear. Or just site seeing 

I also got a chance to see their awesome Christmas tree. It may not be the tree in Rockefeller center. But it is a really cool looking tree .this was really my first time exploring the whole entire park ,all around .from reading about the history of William Bryant on his monument statue he has in the park ,not to far from there really from the Christmas tree. Very historic statue with him sitting down in a chair. Then you have a statue of him standing up in the front of the park near the entrance .dont for get to check out there water fountain statue that is very beautiful. 

I also was able to see the parks very nice ice skating rink. It was larger then I thought ,and alot of people were skating .this kind of scenery was great for picture taking .this kind of stuff is what newyork is made for.so if you are a romantic type of person and you are in a relationship this is the perfect place for you. The atmosphere is so serene.

You also have friendly pingpong matches all year long right inside the park. For all you pingpong fans .I have seen some really good matches over there in the summer time with my wife ,after a day of shopping on 42st .coming to this park is a past time for me and my wife. But this was the first time I was able to see the whole park .note the lines are long at the bathrooms. 

So if you are 42st come to Bryant park it doesn&apos;t cost you anything to just sit down and converse or to take a nice stroll ,enjoy the experience that is apart of your nyc experience."
5,"Happy Holidays my Yelp family! I&apos;m so obsess with the holiday season especially in my favorite city NYC. If you live here or planning on visiting this time of the year (Late November or all of December) then I&apos;d recommend spending a few hours in the evening at Bryant Park Winter Village: 
1Around this time of the year, you can find tons of vendors here selling the cutest holidays gifts for an affordable price.
2There are also a tremendous amount of food vendors...I&apos;m a sucker for their fried pickles and roasted marshmallow.
3My favorite bar is the urban lodge bar, where you can enjoy the most delicious hot chocolate or a tasty mulled wine to warm you up a bit. 
4They also have an ice skating ring where you can rent skates and skate your life away or just hang out and enjoy the atmosphere.
5I totally love the carousel and fountain located in the center of the park."
4,"I love this park and I&apos;ve always loved to come here and to hang out with my friends. Very suitable outdoor place for such occasions, there are lots of sittings and space. Before the outbrake the park was always full of people doing different things. It brought some cheer to the atmosphere. Now, of course, the situation is different and it makes me sad...Sometimes I go out to breath a fresh air and to have a sandwich or coffee in a park on a bench. The flowers are in full bloom, it&apos;s beautiful, but it&apos;s crowdless. And it&apos;s even more sad to watch the carousel be tented and closed because of this bloody virus. I can&apos;t wait when everything gets back to normal and there are children having fun and companies sitting and chatting with any or no reason. Stay safe everyone."
5,"Such a nice gathering place in the city! If you want a spot to take a breather from sightseeing or simply want to people watch, Bryant Park is a lovely option in midtown. It&apos;s next to the gorgeous New York Public Library and boasts an upscale public bathroom- seriously! It has attendants, flower bouquets, and high tech toilets. 

The park itself is dotted with places to eat, sit, and a central spot where you can see an event or ice skate in the winter months (they were setting this up when I visited in October). This isn&apos;t a massive, wooded park but more of a convenient open space to meet friends, rest your feet if you&apos;ve been exploring, or try a new food stall. Worth a stop when you&apos;re in the area!"
5,"Such a wonderful park to visit despite the fact I came in November where they already set up the ice skating rink and the little shops. It was chilly, but not too cold. The park is surrounded by nice skyscrapers and beautiful beaming lights - located close to Times Square and the NY Public Library. You can also see the top of the Empire State Building light up from a distance. This is definitely a place to relax and enjoy yourself at with friends and family. 

The shops were selling many different items from scarves, hats, gifts, souvenirs, food and definitely hot chocolate. Such a plethora of items, so get a chance to check it out during this time. 

Highly recommend this place and would most likely visit this park again during the spring/summer seasons."
5,"Bryant Park is one of the most utilized outdoor spaces in NYC and a  true gem of a park surrounded by the chaos and din of Midtown. easy to get to via subway: F, B, D, M, and 7 trains

between Fifth and Sixth Avenues surrounded by 40th to 42nd Streets, Bryant Park is awesome and has seasonal programming year round from the holiday markets + ice skating in the winter to group yoga to large screen movie viewings &amp; Broadway events in the summer. for quiet / solo activities, there&apos;s the Bryant Park Reading Room where you can borrow books and magazine to read in the park as well as a variety of writing centric workshops. for the kids--don&apos;t forget about the Carousel! and the Bryant Park is an Instagram pic snapper&apos;s dream. 

in terms of eats, there are options within the park like Le Pain, Wafels &amp; Dinges, or the Bryant Park Cafe. there are ton of casual and fast food places blocks from the park if you want to do takeout and park yourself at the various seating options within the park. UrbanSpace food market is located next to the park. and, of course, there&apos;s the fine dining option of the Bryant Park Grill (make reservations). 

outside of the location, convenience, all the seasonal programming, etc. Bryant Park rocks because it is so well-maintained and the staff here is superhelpful and are all about promoting NYC and being outside in new ways. 

drops mic cuz i am parked for the day
