5,"Having lived in the neighborhood for over a decade, we&apos;ve eaten at Wolfgang on multiple occasions, but have never thought about take-out... until these strange times.  High end steaks do not exactly lend themselves to delivery, particularly through 3rd party delivery companies.  However, we really fancied something different for a special occasion so we gave it a go.  All I can say is that all of the food was absolutely spot on.  Steak for 2 was perfectly medium-rare and still piping hot, the sides were all also hot and all-in-all, it was 95% as good as eating in the restaurant, no mean feat.

Well done and thank you to the staff for their efforts.  Let&apos;s hope Wolfgang&apos;s manages to stay afloat through these difficult times and that we&apos;re back to eating in very soon.  Anyone in the neighborhood should give them all the support we can."
5,"Could this be the world&apos;s most beautiful take our restaurant? It could be because the vaulted ceilings were designed by the same guy that did
Grand Central. While we experience the pandemic, I cannot think of a more perfect place to get a fantastic meal. Granted, I am within walking distance, but that doesn&apos;t really matter. 

Mike, the manager makes everyone feel special. And, yes, it&apos;s expensive. But so is a Porsche. Or a Mercedes. Or a Lamborghini. But, when you want a great steak, this is the place to go - during a pandemic or, hopefully when life becomes life again. You want an awesome steak? Call Wolfgang&apos;s and speak to Mike. You will be happy. Oh, one more thing: the spinach is unbelievable. Which is crazy because, it&apos;s spinach!!!!"
5,"Went here for a friend&apos;s birthday. Service, food, drinks, and ambience was perfect. We definitely ordered a lot for a part of 6. We got the porterhouse for 4, burrata, Caesar salad, mashed potatoes, creamed spinach, tuna tartare, and onion rings. The steak was absolutely delicious and cooked perfectly. 

For apps, the burrata was worth it. For sides, the mashed potatoes and veggies were really great and essential for the steak. Overall, great experience and we left full and satisfied."
5,One of the best steakhouses I&apos;ve been too. The steak was cooked to perfection and HUGE PORTIONS. The service is impeccable. Would totally come back. We got the lobster Mac and mushrooms and ribeye. The bacon is a must as well!
3,"I honestly had higher expectation towards this place. My boyfriend and I came here to celebrate our one year. We ordered two bacon, porterhouse for two and fries. We got bread and butter, the butter was cold and was not able to be spread on to the bread easily. When the bacon came, the server put it faced up and left. After taking the first bite it tasted a bit burnt and when I flipped it over the entire bottom was burnt. ( picture for comparison of my bacon and my boyfriends bacon). The steak was nice and delicious served on a warm plate. However we did asked for medium and the steak came out rare. The fries was perfectly salted and crispy. Lastly, the service was not the best."
5,"Wow!!! The atmosphere of the bar and the restaurant are exactly what makes me love NYC!! There&apos;s even an area for more intimate dining. 

The seafood towers are on-point!! 5 stars
The steaks are superbly presented and prepared!! 
We had a large group of people so we tried all of the sides...everything was wonderful!

I&apos;ll definitely be going back again."
2,"Let me start by saying this used to be my second choice if Peter Luger is fully booked.  But now I can wisely I&apos;m no longer going to this location.

My expectations are very high since it is in Tribeca. The place is great, waiter was nice.  BUT the steak was 2 Stars this time.  We ordered Dry aged Porterhouse for Three- medium rare.  It was supposed to be in sizzling hot plate and really hot steak which we did not hear.  And as the waiter served each of our plate. Me and friends made the same comment at the same time. This is not medium rare.  The waiter said it is.  It looks medium well.  And believe it or not once we started cutting the steak, definitely medium well.  On our first bite, it was not tender and it was definitely not juicy but instead dry.   Also it was a bit cold.  I am an expert Steak eater, in my opinion, the plate and the steak has been seating in the kitchen and that was the reason why it was not sizzling anymore, came out medium well and cold.  

I hate to compare but for the 7 to 8 times that I&apos;ve been to Peter Luger, the quality of steak never changed and they never failed my expectations on how I want my steak.

From this point, I will not come to this Tribeca location and probably explore the rest of the Top 10 Best Steakhouse in New York."
5,Delicious food! Mac &amp; cheese &amp; mash are definitely a must try! Portions were also good. Very good at maintaining distance between tables. Will return!
5,"Great steakhouse in NYC! This is the oldest of the franchise and has been around for about 15 years. I have heard this is the best location, as there are several other branches in Manhattan. A steakhouse that rivals Peter Lugers!

The Food: 5 out of 5
Amazing Porterhouse steak! We got it medium rare and it was so well prepared and super juicy. Got this to share with my wife and we were both stuffed, and could only finish half of the sides. We enjoyed the creamed spinach and the German potatoes. However, the potatoes were a bit too salty in my opinion. Passed on the bacon today, but will probably get it if we get a chance to come back. 

The Service: 3 out of 5
Our main waiter was neither good nor the friendliest, and was very brief in his interactions with us. However, we had a couple other waiters come by to bring us the food and check in on us who made the dining experience better. 

The Space: 5 out of 5 
When you walk in, you can definitely tell by the decor and the dimly lit atmosphere that it&apos;s a legit steakhouse. When we got there at 6:30 pm on a Saturday there were still a lot of seats, and we were saying we probably didn&apos;t need a reservation. However, it really started filling up around 7 pm and you&apos;d definitely want to call ahead and reserve if you plan to come around this time. 

The Price: $$$

Worth it? On the pricey side, but worth it to splurge once in a while."
4,"I came here with my brother and had a wonderful meal! Its located right off the 33rd street 6 stop so easy to get to from uptown or downtown. I ordered the filet mignon, cooked to perfection. The service was very attentive too. It is a little overpriced but overall would recommend!"
5,Above and beyond. Even though we were in a box the staff made sure to comfort your needs! I can&apos;t imagine how it would be if circumstances were different!! Ps I howled like a wolf after the steak!!!!!
4,"I met some friends here for lunch and a had a great time. This spot is a friend of mine regular for drinks.  We sat at the bar and had great service.  

My friends ordered the burger and fries.  I treated myself to a medium plus well done petite  filet mignon with mash potatoes and creamed spinach which was part of their lunch special.  My food was delicious and I ate everything on my plate.  

Service was great and the restaurant had an old school feel and decor. It is dimly lit and wasnt too crowded. However,  I have walked by this location after work a few times and the place is packed, especially the bar area. Overall,  great experience."
4,"I have been longing to go to the Wolfgang steakhouse for a long time. Now, I got the chance. We had weekend lunch here.  Place is surprisingly quiet while we dined there. 

We had seafood appetizer, filet and rib eye steak along with their free bread. As we finished our lunch, we absolutely stepped into food coma.  
We love food here. Everything is fresh, tasteful and juicy. 

Service: accommodating. 
Price: yeah you know it&apos;s a four $$$$ restaurant. 

I can&apos;t wait to bring my family here to enjoy a weekday dinner. I bet it would be epic."
5,"First off not sure where it start the service was
Top notch! Class act. Definitely a mans tavern with many working class men, excellent choice for a business meetup.

Excellent menu with eloquent food selection and portions. Everything here is flavorful and mouth watering goodness

Steak is the way to go here paired with an enormous lobster as the main course with potatoes, make sure you come hungry. 

Crab cakes and shrimp cocktail (jumbo sized) made for an amazing appetizer that won&apos;t disappoint. 

Extensive wine list that doesn&apos;t go unnoticed.

The decor of the place is old timely, with a lovely bar. Great atmosphere. 

Will be back for more as this was a wonderful experience."
4,"Craving steak so I stopped by here on a Saturday afternoon. I had eaten at the Wolfgang&apos;s in Miami previously and had already formed a good impression as a straightforward, no nonsense good steak.

Ordered the bone in ribeye, Wolfgang salad, and lobster mac n cheese. The steak looked like a perfect cut with the right amount of char. The meat was flavorful and well marbled.

Given the heat that Luger has been taking lately, Wolfgang seems like a satisfying option for a tasty steak."
3,"This was not my favorite by a long shot. Perhaps my expectations were a bit high from all the reviews. But, I was very underwhelmed. The food was average; a three on a five scale. The ambience was dark and rather dingy; not worthy of a four dollar sign spot. And the service lacked a bit. 

Maybe we&apos;ll give it another shot. Maybe we&apos;ll take the loss and simply find a steakhouse that&apos;s more inline with the quality and high-end experience once expects for the money we paid."
3,"I was told that the Park Avenue store was the best in the Wolf Gang, so I called and booked a table, but there was no table, so I was kept waiting, and then I was led to a table at the end without an apology.
But the amount was large and the taste was good"
4,"1. Oysters were great and fresh
2.wolfgang salad was nice and light
3. Bacon was tasty
4. Spinach was too salty
5. Mushrooms was a good, basic
6. Onion rings were great, I&apos;ll order again because there&apos;s not much better but was also, crispy
7. Steak for 4 was more than enough for my family of six. The steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare. The steak was so soft and tender. I would recommend the steak over peter luger.
8. For dessert, we ordered tiramisu, cheesecake, and apple strudel. All 3 cakes were okay nothing special.

Overall I would eat here again just for the steak. But, it&apos;s sad that the spinach was too salty because it would pair perfect together."
5,"The most consistent steakhouse in NYC. Porterhouse always has that perfectly salted char. Sides are some of the best for a NYC steakhouse. Drinks, ambiance, service always on point. After Lugers, would recommend Wolgang&apos;s to a visiter. I personally also love Smith and Wollensky&apos;s cajun ribeye but not for everyone. 9 out of 10"
5,"This was my second time dining at this place.  First time was quite a few years back and I remembered the bacon and the steaks being really good.  This time I wanted to bring my 2 sons to experience NYC steaks.  We tried for a reservation at Luger&apos;s, but the timing just didn&apos;t work out...so I decided for the next best thing.  Overall, they had a wonderful experience.  
I booked via Opentable for 8pm on Sunday evening.  We found the place to be packed.  We were seated within 30 seconds of arriving.  We were seated next to the kitchen, but we didn&apos;t mind.  We were treated professionally throughout.  Water was served and refilled timely.  We never felt rushed.  We ordered 1 bacon, porterhouse for 2, and lobster Mac n&apos; cheese, and cream of spinach.  The boys thoroughly enjoyed the bacon.  It was perfectly cooked and had the right amount of fat.  The steak was cooked perfectly medium.  The boys were impressed by the presentation and the service.  The mac n&apos; cheese was ok, lacking lobster.  The cream of spinach did not impress them.  I was hoping for a dessert or something for my birthday son, but the waiter just overlooked it.  We were full anyways.  
All in all a wonderful experience.  Great atmosphere.  Perfect steakhouse experience."
