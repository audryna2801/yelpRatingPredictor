5,"Wow, had the pork belly sandwich.  The bread is warm and toasty, the pork belly is flavorful and soft with most of the fat rendered off."
5,"Ricky Martin did a weird song called SHE BANG
And I used to get frisky every time HE RANG
But lately he&apos;s been iffy when it comes to letting ME HANG
Maybe it&apos;s because I never invite him to NUM PANG

I usually charge for men, but I&apos;m gonna do a FREE GANG
A menage-a-plenty if you prefer to use PARIS SLANG
I like it cause there&apos;s up to 30 men giving ME WANG
And afterwards I&apos;m hungry so I head down to NUM PANG

Anyway the first time that I had it, it made ME SPRANG
It was a bigger secret than the lifestyle in PYONGYANG
It was tastier than the stuff in Houston&apos;s DUN HUANG
It was sleeker than your mid-life-crisis Daddy&apos;s MUSTANG

I kept coming back, until they nicknamed me the BOOMERANG
I ate so many sandwiches my tummy&apos;s got an OVERHANG
I bought 15 sarnies at once, like a Banh Mi GANGBANG
All this because I f***ing love the food at NUM PANG

Joined a choir, some members just mumbled although SOME SANG
Dracula kept trying to come and bite me with his DUMB FANG
I said &quot;bring it on&quot; he said &quot;it&apos;s already been DONE BRANG&quot;
So we shrugged and went to eat our lunchie munch from NUM PANG

WHAT

This is a really enjoyable sandwich spot, with spectacular Cambodian sandwiches (much like Banh Mi, but Kampuchea style, Phnom Penhyer than a Viet wich).

So they&apos;re pretty big and they&apos;re cheap, very unique and original on the Manhattan food scene too, and all of these elements make NP really stand out. To have authenticity, originality, a good portion, great taste, and be dirt cheap, and all of this in Midtown Manhattan? Well there&apos;s no way I wasn&apos;t going to give 5 stars for that.

And for that reason I really have to give them 5 Stars, besides the fact that I had absolutely amazing service on my most recent trip from a girl here, to the extent that we exchanged snapchats and numbers (hi bae). I mean she was covered in amazing tats (as are several employees) and really into me so how was I not going to take it to the next Cambolevel?

Having said all of that, if they weren&apos;t cheap and if they weren&apos;t in a city full of expensive stuff and if they weren&apos;t good value and if it weren&apos;t for good service, I might give a 4 because I didn&apos;t love these Cambodian sandwiches as much as I do my fave Banh Mis around the country. But I certainly like them, and I would certainly have them again, that&apos;s for sure.

So it&apos;s time to be clever, not dumb
And eat food that&apos;s not made by your Mum
And if you want to fatten
Yourself in Manhattan
Then do it at the Pang that&apos;s Num."
3,"I was walking by Num Pang and saw this sign with &apos;Grilled Peaches and Bacon&apos;. What you say, HaHa that&apos;s ridiculous it&apos;s so absurd who would eat that ?

Duh, I better try it.

I was planing only getting the sandwich but the girl at the counter was nice and talked me into getting the Watermelon juice and the Grilled Corn with Coconut + Lime. The Watermelon juice was OK, but it had something else mixed in it I couldn&apos;t make out.  The Grilled corn was good didn&apos;t taste like Coconut. There was a slice of Lime but it was completely covered in sauce and I was not about to get it on my hands too.

I open the sandwich and took a piece of Peach and Bacon and it tasted  OK and interesting and was not overly sweet. Maybe their was about 3 half slices of Peaches and 2 to 3 Bacon strips it was hard to tell with all the sauce and garnish of  Cucumber, Pickled Carrots, and lots of Cilantro.  

Well now I took a full bite and it hit me, the sign said nothing about the Jalapenos. it was spicy hot and my tongue was burning. I had to stop eating the sandwich after my third bite and could not really enjoy it anymore. I ended up having a few scoops of ice cream before toungue stopped burning.

Next time I see some interesting food on a sign I will keep on walking."
3,"Rate 3.5/5
Decent amount of food but slightly pricey.  
Ordering is easy and pretty quick service.  
We ordered the lemongrass braised short rib rice bowl and the duroc pulled pork sandwich. The sandwich is very similar to a banh mi. Definitely prefer the sandwich over the rice bowl. The rice bowl has roasted veggies, the short rib was okay in flavor but not my go to. But there wasn&apos;t really anything that stood out."
5,"A fellow Yelper recommended Num Pang Kitchen to me for lunch. It was literally just around the block from my office and was quite busy.

I ordered the grilled steak salad with house dressing and no bell peppers. The mix of veggies were all very fresh and crispy, and the addition of Thai basil and cilantro made it more Asian-fusion. Grilled steak was juicy, tender, and well-seasoned, and there&apos;s a good amount of protein in the bowl too. House dressing is basically fish sauce and it did a good job bringing all the ingredients together. It&apos;s an umami bomb that&apos;s both savory and tangy!

Overall, I thought Num Pang Kitchen is a solid place to grab lunch. The staff is friendly and I got my to-go order in no time. I will come back when I&apos;m visiting NY in the future!"
4,"Saw that this place had over 1,000 reviews so of course I had to check it out to see myself! I got there around 12:30 pm and it didn&apos;t see too packed, by the time I got my sandwich and left there was already a decent sized line forming outside. Seating wise, there&apos;s some high chairs by the window but definitely a more grab and go sandwich place for working professionals in the area. 

Looks like in addition to sandwiches, they have bowls and salads as well. I ended up getting the pork belly sandwich. It&apos;s a decent sized and filling sandwich. The bread was toasted and crispy. They loaded the sandwich up with a lot pickled shredded carrots. The pork belly was tasty, juicy, and had a lot of flavor. Surprisingly the juicy pork belly didn&apos;t make the sandwich soggy since I had a 10 min walk back to the office. It does get tricky to eat, so I&apos;d recommend grabbing a fork as well so you can make sure you eat all the toppings that fall off. 

Really like the sandwich, knocked off one star because I personally think it&apos;s a bit overpriced. I got one sandwich and my total came to about $11. Getting Asian sandwiches in midtown always pains me because I know I could get it somewhere else for a fraction of the price...

TL,DR: Small grab and go sandwich place with tasty sandwich and bowl/salad options. Little bit over priced imo but that&apos;s the midtown tax for ya"
3,"Tried this small placed because nearly 1000 reviews on yelp. Also tried the recommended 5 spice pork sandwich and a side of butternut squash. 

The side was very small, and not completely cooked through. However, if done right it was flavorful. 

The spicy pork belly sandwich was packed with flavor however also quite small in size. 

Overall good for taste but for $15 on lunch, it can be better severed elsewhere."
5,"I absolutely love the story of Num Pang Kitchen. Num Pang means &quot;sandwich&quot; in Cambodian

These two guys who were working in the food industry bumped into each other after years out of the same college (Clark University) and decided to start making Cambodian sandwiches. I was accepted to Clark several years back so my cousin brought it up when she was touring the school with me. But aside from that, I have to say, these are AMAZING sandwiches. The sandwiches are filled with an incredible mix of various spices and sauces that really make each sandwich packed with flavor. It is definitely a step up from your typical Vietnamese sandwich. 

The menu feels a lot like those fast-casual restaurants popping up throughout America. I&apos;ve ordered the coconut tiger shrimp rice bowl/sandwich, five-spice glazed pork belly sandwich, and roasted chicken &quot;chimi&quot; sandwich. I&apos;ve ordered the shrimp sandwich the most just because I love seafood, but I definitely recommend the five-spice glazed pork belly. Who doesn&apos;t love pork belly? I also highly recommend giving their Cambodian Iced Coffee a try. It is crisp, fresh, and not super strong. 

In my opinion, this location is fairly empty or maybe it&apos;s because I went 10 minutes after the store opened. It is unlike the Brookfield Place location. 

Price wise, I feel like it is reasonable. Around $15 for both a drink and a sandwich. It is expected especially for lunch in the city."
5,"Wow wow wow. I&apos;ve heard great things about this place and how popular it is with the general population but WOW. I came here to grab a bite for lunch and finally saw what the noise was about. This place has become one of my favorite sandwich spots by far. I ordered a pulled pork sandwich to go.  I loved how it came in a little paper box that way my sandwich is secured and won&apos;t get smushed as I transport it. It came in a baguette that was toasted perfectly. The outside was so crispy and inside was soft. The pulled pork was done so well that the fat just melted in my mouth as I took a bite. The cucumber just added a refreshing tastes and the spicy mayo and pickled carrots just added to the amazing flavor. I will definitely be back for more!

P.S Don&apos;t let the appearance fool you! It&apos;s 10 times better than it actually looks."
3,"i tried the pork belly sandwich, however opted for no carrots. the sandwich was suddenly empty af  

prices are a bit high, dont think ill be returning."
5,Amazing Cambodian sandwich with all the right flavors that reminded me of my time in Cambodia. Big filling sandwich and lots of yummy options. I got the five spice glazed pork belly sandwich and loved it! I also really like the pickled asian pear that added an extra zest to the sandwich and differentiated itself from other SEA sandwiches like Vietnamese banh mis although they have similar vibes. The carrots were seasoned and the cilantro and cucumbers were so fresh and the quinoa baguette was firm outside but also soft inside. Would highly recommend
4,"Pretty solid place to grab lunch in the area. If you&apos;re a big fan of Vietnamese banh mis, then you&apos;ll definitely love this place. Num Pang offers sandwiches and bowls that are full of flavor and texture. I had the chicken chimi rice bowl and it was delicious. The chicken was flavor packed and tender, the rice was fluffy and aromatic and the cilantro gave the entire meal a nice earthy aftertaste. The pickled carrots and daikon added a nice crunch. Drizzle some Sriracha over everything and you have perfection. 

The staff were friendly and efficient. This isn&apos;t really a sit down venue since it is small (aside from a few tables), so I&apos;d recommend bringing your lunch back to your office."
3,"As a huge fan of banh mi and similar sandwiches, I was pretty hyped about trying Num Pang, especially considering all the rave reviews they got on Yelp.

The sandwiches weren&apos;t bad, but they were far from the best I&apos;ve had in New York. I tried both the pork belly and the BBQ brisket sandwiches. Both were decent but nothing to write home about. I had the chili soy instead of the chili mayo because I&apos;m not a fan of mayo, and it tasted kind of off. The meat was also a bit tough. But the vegetables were very fresh and flavorful and the baguette was great and toasted perfectly.

I&apos;d go back if I was in the area but wouldn&apos;t go out of my way just to eat here when there are plenty of great banh mi places around."
4,"Excellent lunch spot in midtown.  Their line is efficient for those lunch hour crowds and they have some delish sandwiches and other options!

I ordered the shrimp sandwich and it was wonderful, and also the perfect amount of food for lunch!  But they also have options for bowls and salads. 

Small spot, so don&apos;t expect to sit in house.  Great to take with you to the office!"
4,"I&apos;ve walked by Num Pang and have tried it many times that it&apos;s time to finally write a review!

My friend and I walked around town and made an impromptu decision to pop in here as we walked past. Since they had some healthy options, I decided to go for their Num Pang Chicken Chimi Salad which came with grilled chicken over a nice bed of whole grain. I loved every bite which came with a good amount of flavour for a healthy dish. If you feel like it&apos;s lacking a little bit of spiciness, they have Sriracha available as their condiment. If your palate is more on the savory side, this will be perfect for you. If you&apos;re looking to feel extra full when you leave, I&apos;d go for one of their Banh Mi sandwiches (all of which are amazing.)

What&apos;s great about this place is that they don&apos;t skimp out on their portions and their staffs are also friendly, knowing how to treat their customers right. Although there isn&apos;t much room to sit, you&apos;ll probably to able to snatch a a seat along the wall if it&apos;s rush hour when lines are out the door as all your corporate guys are trying to get their food and go back to work. 

Pop in here for a quick bite if you&apos;re tired of your mainstream sandwich shop. Be adventurous and try something new for a change! ;)"
5,"Pang specializes in Southeast Asian-inspired sandwiches, bowls, and soups. As soon as you walk in you will notice the graffiti art on the walls and the hip hop and reggae music playing from the speakers. The man at the cashier was very nice and offered me a small cup of hot apple cider because I had the sniffles. Very kind and thoughtful! 

Moving onto space, service and the most important food. The place is small and cozy; it&apos;s a nice sit down for lunch. Service was very quick even though the place is known for having long lines. Guess it was my lucky day!!! The Coconut Tiger Shrimp sandwich was absolutely mouth-watering and fulfilling. Next time I will try having the bowl. 
For drinks, I had their most common drink, blood orange lemonade which was not my favorite; not a fan of sour drinks :/ Otherwise, everything was great!"
4,"Num Pang serves up some pretty good sandwiches and bowls. You can&apos;t really go wrong with any of them. The soups are just okay to me, but I think it&apos;s just my palate.

One particularly notable thing about this location is how friendly the staff is. Last Sunday around lunch time, I stopped in for a chicken bowl, and the staff were super cheerful and helpful. Kudos to the management for great hiring at this location!

FYI, this particular location has only a few bar seats, so it&apos;s predominantly a take away spot."
4,"This is my first time trying it and although the service was okay, the sandwich was not that great. The bread wasn&apos;t that soft, the sauce was a little sour, and the whole meal was super sweet when I thought it was something savory. Gave it a 4/5 because the people were nice, but I wouldn&apos;t come back"
3,"This place probably is best for the professionals working in the area who are looking for quick meals. It&apos;s a solid 3 stars for location, general speed (gets crowded during regular weekday hours but the staff move quickly), and being so-so in terms of fusion food flavors. However, it doesn&apos;t even come close to banh mi joints in Chinatown and outside of the city, in terms of both price (where my $4 banh mi&apos;s at??) and quality. 

Quick thoughts:
- Meat (both pork belly and beef brisket) has been overcooked 5 out of 5 times now. This is not how authentic Asian-styled pork belly tastes, folks. 
- Shrimp bowl / sandwich is my favorite, but again the shrimp came out overcooked a few times. 
- Veggie toppings on banh mi&apos;s are usually, but not always, fresh. The sandwiches are not nearly stuffed with toppings as they should be, particularly at this price tag. 
- Veggie tofu bowl is pretty to look at but could do with, well, more veggies.

All in all, it&apos;s fine for what it is. I&apos;ve been here multiple times for the convenience factor alone, and probably will continue to order takeout on days I&apos;m not feeling picky."
3,"I&apos;ve seen some people say this is the best sandwich in NYC. Ridiculous. It still amounts to a good sandwich though.

I ordered the pulled pork sandwich. I&apos;m not sure how the pricing for it works, because I was charged less than the menu said I was supposed to pay. The sandwich itself was decent, but the bun wasn&apos;t heated or anything. In addition, the sandwich had everything continually falling out, so it was a pretty big mess in general.

I also tried their ginger lemonade, which was a little expensive but still pretty good.

I don&apos;t know what else to say about it, other than it was a decent sandwich."
