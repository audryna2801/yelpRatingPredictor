5,"This is where you go when you want to impress someone that might enjoy craft beers. The selection is great, but even better are the bartenders who carefully guide you through their menu.

Would recommend this place also for business meetings. The day hours are less crowded naturally. The drinks help lubricate deals!"
4,"Midtown can be dicey because it&apos;s such a mixed bag on spots. Most are sports bars, overrun with tourists, commuters and like-minded ilk. Case and point, people like me. But when you get a spot like The Ginger Man holding a spot in this area, with a billion beers on menu (none of which are your standard Corona&apos;s, etc). you get to pay a little closer attention to the area. Because there are places worth going to. 

At the time of this writing, I&apos;ve been here twice, and both for big group gatherings, which it is great for. Just make sure you ask for separate checks before everyone orders because it was hell the first time we didn&apos;t do that. The first time I was there I had their mule, which was fantastic. I asked this second time around and they don&apos;t sub the vodka for anything (I asked because a friend doesn&apos;t drink vodka and wanted to try it) 

I love that this bar is so spacious, we never felt on top of one another, and their bar bites that we had tried were pretty great. Service was here and there, but, we were big groups - understandable. The music wasn&apos;t too loud so you could actually converse with people - a shocker!

Being in midtown, it&apos;s a great meetup spot for friends coming in every direction and easy to find."
4,"I was recently in NYC and sought out The Ginger Man, as they had a beer I wanted to try on tap. It was a Tuesday afternoon, and we found plenty of empty tables. A server quickly came to greet us and take orders. We ordered beers to start, and then we did some snacks and flights. The beer menu is good stuff; there are a variety of options, and they break it into categories to help you find what you like.

We all enjoyed our beers, and service was great. The space is quite spacious, even with a lounge-type room in the back. The pub vibe made it casual and welcoming.

I&apos;m only docking it a star due to the minimal food offerings. We wanted to stay longer, but we needed more sustenance than what the apps here could provide. At least there is food, but the main draw here is definitely the beer and environment.

I would definitely go back here! What a great spot!"
4,"One of the legendary craft beer spots in the city. The menu is extensive.

You can flight up any 4 5oz beers for $15.

They also do have food. The pretzels are ok. They could be a little softer but the beer cheese they come with is pretty good. 

All seating is first come and first serve but there is wait staff u til about 11pm.

Come early as it gets busy by 7pm."
4,"This place is quite large and their beer selection is HUGE. Came during the afternoon and it was pretty empty, which means attentive waitstaff!!

They have old school decor with table seating. They also have bar seating as well as couch/lounge seating in the back. 

For drinks, I would recommend their &quot;Grimm Both Sides Now.&quot; It&apos;s a BA sour ale with peaches, raspberries, and apricots."
4,Central location: space is vintage in the true sense of the word. The drinks and food are good. Must try the ice cream sandwiches super tasty and definitely to be enjoyed. The waiters are so attentive and thoughtful quick with the orders and done with a smile. Great for a date or with coworkers or group of friends for a drink to cap the night or start off the evening.
4,"What a gem! I had a whole itinerary planned based on places I researched before the trip. We visited this place on a whim. I&apos;m so glad we did. The option for beers, bottled, canned, lager, IPA, stouts, blondes, darks, casked, were endless.

The IPA&apos;s were fantastic. Every new one I tried was better than the last. &quot;Did we just become best friends&quot; and the &quot;Scorpius&quot; were my personal favs. The draft IPA&apos;s were great, but the canned ales were so much cooler. 

Service was fantastic, and the atmosphere is very pleasant. A lot of intriguing art work and memorabilia throughout the whole bar. Highly recommend a stop here for a drink, or two, or however many you fancy."
5,"I&apos;ve been to The Ginger Man a few times over the past several years and each time I have been impressed. The service is spot-on; they have a large assortment of beers, both local and out-of-state; and the place invites a sort of upbeat social atmosphere.

It&apos;s a great spot for happy hour, drinks with friends, first date...etc. I&apos;ll be back!"
4,"Good beer + good food + good company = good night. 

If you have a big group or just want to find a place a little less crowded and loud, head to the back section and find couches and armchairs galore. You can actually hear each other speak - always a plus! (Sometimes a plus?)

While my boyfriend was jazzed for the beer, I was taken with their soft pretzels and turkey + brie sandwich (both fantastic). I&apos;d definitely recommend the sandwich if you need more than just a snack. melted brie and warm turkey on soft bread - yum. 

For drinks, I started off with one of the ciders. Not too sweet. Next I had a dark coffee stout. I think... I honestly know very little about beer and am doing this review from memory, does dark coffee stout make sense? Well I think that is what I had and, even though it was very good, it was very heavy. I could only drink half a glass. 

Head over for a laid back night."
3,"Great bar to belly up to or grab a table.  Beer and whisky/whiskey selections are large and very good, plenty of good stuff for different tastes.  Service was good and staff were friendly.

The negative - the food really is BLAH and severely marked down my score.

Highly recommend for drinks and would gladly make the trek for a return visit, food either eat before or after a visit."
4,"Wide selection of drafts at this elegant bar with beautiful interior and lighting. 

I was here this past Saturday (late evening). The beer menu is really impressive. 

I opted for their flights for $15, which gives you the opportunity to try 4 beers for a reasonable price. 

Some beers are beyond extravagant. 

I had a great time and would totally go back. 

Recommended."
4,"Yummy palomas.
Refreshing ginger beer.
Filling and savory stuffed potatoes.
Pretzels, in which you get to choose toppings and dips.
Go for it.
The vibes are very chill."
4,"New York...A City so big but I found it hard to find a place that serves the variety and quality of beer that they do on draft. Mostly everywhere in Manhattan unless I&apos;m looking at the wrong place sold the typical big chain brews. The place has a distinct character to it and was quiet which I enjoyed (went around noon on a weekday). They also had a food menu, which I didn&apos;t get to try. Their take on what New York bar food would be, Reuben sandwiches, hot dogs, etc. Service was great, would definitely come back. Especially when the train dumps you at Penn Station which is a few blocks away."
4,"Love the Ginger Man. Been here a few times. 

If you come here, get the Cinnamon Sugar Soft Pretzel for $4.5. You won&apos;t regret it. Also, very diverse offering on the beer, wine, and spirits. 

This is one of the bars in NYC where you won&apos;t feel like you are in NYC - it is actually spacious! 

It does get crowded, but generally,​ some seats are available. There is also another section/room in the back.

The bathroom is relatively​ clean."
5,"Great bar with a really nice atmosphere for a few drinks with friends! The selection of on tap ales, brews and lagers was really wide and included none of the big common brands so allowed for a little exploration. Also a good selection of spirits too for those looking to explore their whiskeys, gins etc.

Would definitely come back here!"
5,"Waited to long to give a review, needless to say the service was well recieved. The bartenders(we went there 3 times) are very knowledgeable, diligent, and personable. I wish I could remember the stout that I had but it was really good, they also have rose on tap if your not a beer drinker and they also have whiskey. Worth mentioning: this place usually get packed and eventhough it does I promise you will not be neglected. Thank you!"
3,"This place gets really crowded especially during happy hour, so be sure to come off hours if you want a quieter atmosphere. The couches in the back are nice and the secluded area is great for having a conversation when the bar in front gets too noisy.

It&apos;s mostly a bar for beer and whisk(e)y, seemingly with a focus on Scotch for the latter. Yes, they do have some selections outside of that in the way of spirits, wine, and cocktails, but they only offer very classic cocktails and basic wine. If you want wine and craft cocktails, or a more diverse selection of spirits, I&apos;d skip on this place and go elsewhere.

If you want an extensive selection of beer though, and some pretty good whiskies, I&apos;d give this place a try.

Pours of the spirits come in 1oz and 1.5oz sizes. I had a 1.5oz of a rye aged in Caribbean rum casks which was a solid choice. Really, though, if you are going here you probably have an idea of what kind of drinks you like, and as long as you stick to the realm of whisky and beer, you&apos;ll find something for you here."
5,"What a great bar! Buried in what I always thought of as a midtown east dead zone, this place is a really fantastic option for drinks -- whether you&apos;re out with a big group, a small number of friends, or it&apos;s just you and a date.

The space is incredible, it&apos;s definitely what won me over. High ceilings and wood paneling make you feel like you&apos;re in an upscale restaurant, but the reasonable prices will remind you that it&apos;s not Park Ave. There&apos;s plenty of different seating options, whether it&apos;s bar stools, table service, cozy booths, or the ample standing room throughout.

There&apos;s an excellent beer selection, with a menu broken down by type to make the extensive number of options more approachable.

If you&apos;re in midtown, this is one of the best options you can find without having to head further east. Definitely recommend it!"
5,"My favorite place for whiskey flights and great beer. It&apos;s beautifully located near Fifth Avenue, close to the Empire State building and Koreatown, which makes it a fantastic place for and after-dinner IPA or a delicious whiskey tasting. Love this place!"
3,"Saturday evening in hopes to expel a hard week of frustration and abject pain I was indeed lured by the high praise of previous reviews.  As a recluse I arrived without being greeted nor ushered to a seat amid usually seated at the bar.  There are two bars.  The primary large bar was full to capacity and appear all patrons were properly serviced.  Ergo, I sat at the rear bar that is least serviced where the bus boys and kitchen staff were working.  I waited patiently over forty minutes for a waiter.  I was provided several menus by a bus boy who spoke very limited English.  I believe with New York City&apos;s mandated minimum wage increase effective December 31, 2018 staff hours are significantly reduced or employment lay-offs have been implemented to meet with the demands of operating a hospitality and food service industry.  Flagging a waiter for any additional food or drink orders is rather difficult as none were sighted as my initial order took an eternity to be placed.  Ergo, the wait staff is very minimal and sporadic servicing customers.  This bar is good for after work hang-outs or Saturday night with the boys in laughter and in good times for the avid beer aficionado.  The craft beer menu is very extensive for IPA, American Pale Ale, blonde ale, dark lagers, stout, porters, brown ale, or amber where boys are boys.  Restroom facility is relatively clean.

New York Style $8.50
Brooklyn Brine whiskey barrel sauerkraut and a side of spicy mustard.  This was accompanied with either cold potato salad or chips.  I decided on the cold potato salad which was frozen cold direct from the refrigerator, but not served room temperature.  The hot dog was good and was a large juicy sausage.  I wished I chosen the Parmesan garlic pretzel that is very coveted and highly praised.

Cider Creek Farmhouse $8
This is a smooth unfiltered French style cider fermented with a champagne yeast.  This cider delivers an apple tart with a smooth, dry finish.  I am not a fan of unfiltered alcohol and this 16 oz. drink was too much for my preference that I was unable to finish."
