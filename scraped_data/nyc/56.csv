5,"COVID update: they&apos;ve currently got outdoor seating with heat lamps - it&apos;s a little chilly but not too bad. My boyfriend and I easily made a reservation on a weeknight in late December. 

We started with the Classic Manhattan and The Elder Collins cocktails, which were alright, nothing too special. However, the food is still amazing here, so I&apos;m upping my star rating to five. We shared the spinach &amp; artichoke dip, veggie burger with a side of fries, and apple crisp for dessert. 

Service was also great!"
5,"First time at this location. Was pulling on going to the midtown location, but after indoor dining was shut down, we decided to brave outdoor dining and go to the Park Ave location.

There were heaters, it was still chilly, but it is tucked away so not windy and really not that bad overall. I was expecting much worse.

The service was amazing, they&apos;re doing great with what they can. The food is outstanding and the drinks delicious. Would recommend, can&apos;t really go wrong there is something for everyone on the menu. Will be back for sure."
5,Best place for outdoor dining. Magnificent even. I love Hillstone - always. But during this pandemic - they have upped their outdoor game and it&apos;s just perfect. I make a reservation once a month.
4,"I lived right around the corner from this restaurant for two years and only regret that I didn&apos;t make it here more often. You need to make a reservation well in advance, and even so you may have to wait for your table to be ready, but it&apos;s worth it! 

I think that their menu is pretty unique compared to other spots like this because they have sushi and a few other Asian-inspired dishes alongside American classics like a cheeseburger. I love their French dip sandwich (served with maybe too many fries? Is there such a thing?), as well as the Osaka style spicy tuna.

The drinks here are great as well, but overall it will be an expensive meal so plan accordingly."
4,"Considering we&apos;re in the midst of a pandemic- the experience was very good. Service was good, but food was very average. 

Sitting outside (dining &quot;al fresco&quot;) here was really nice! They have heat lamps and nice decor. The food is incredibly expensive for what it is. 

The cheeseburger was good, a nice size, but pretty bland. I wouldn&apos;t be surprised though, if they got their fries from McDonald&apos;s. They looked and tasted like McDonald&apos;s fries. 
The crispy chicken sandwich tasted very much like cole slaw. Tons of slaw on the sandwich. If you like Cole slaw, it&apos;s delicious. It also comes with fries. 
The pan roasted Scottish salmon was very small. Comes with a side of broccoli. It was good, nothing to write home about. 
Again, the food was good, but you can go elsewhere and get better food for less money."
1,"The manager here is disgusting and dismissive! Shame on this restaurant, probably the worst experience I&apos;ve ever had at an NYC restaurant. This is the SECOND time the manager has been rude to my family on two occasions. We had a reservation for 8:15, they kept telling us our reservation was for 845. My wife had a text confirmation that we had a reservation for 8:15, they kept telling us the other people at 8:15 might come in even after we showed proof.

We were profiled here at Hillstone, and when we tried to speak to the manager she made us wait for 20 minutes to tell us she had &quot;investigated&quot; and Hillstone sat us at a reasonable time. The attitude and pushback from Hillstone didn&apos;t resolve the issue until 8:40 when we were seated. 

I will be reporting the manager to Hillstone corporate, and will make sure all of our friends who have ever dined here will never come back. Terrible experience all around! As frequent diners at Hillstone, I&apos;m not sure I&apos;ll come back unless Hillstone corporate looks into this situation further."
5,"I know I&apos;ve probably written a review claiming &quot;Best sushi in NYC&quot;, but this review overwrites the others! I did not expect Hillstone, an American Steakhouse, to have great sushi, but it sure does. So beyond fresh; it&apos;s unreal.

My boyfriend and I ordered-in for our anniversary during the COVID-19 pandemic because we were craving sushi and heard from a friend that Hillstone has the best in Manhattan. It is definitely on the pricier side for sushi, but you won&apos;t regret it. We spent about $100 including tip on the following:

-Grilled Artichokes 
-Coconut Shrimp Roll
-Osaka Style Spicy Tuna
-Thai Tuna Roll
-Tuna Mango Roll 

Everything was delicious &amp; super fresh. Our favorites were the Grilled Artichokes (obviously not sushi, but still delish - the house sauce hit the spot), Thai Tuna Roll and Tuna Mango Roll. Also, our order came with a free sweet treat to thank us for supporting their business through these tough times - A very nice gesture!

Can&apos;t wait to order again, and also to visit the restaurant in person once the pandemic ends.

4,"I like what they did with the outdoor space during COVID. I really do love this place. The only reason I&apos;m giving them 4 stars instead of my usual 5 is because the spinach dip really fell off. This use to be one of my favorites but the past few time I got it, just didn&apos;t live up to the usual standards. This time it came cold and not creamy. Also got the steak Thai salad and it was cold, usually at least the steak is warm. The ribs were excellent as usual. Also, I miss the shoestring fries, the new fries are not great."
5,"Stopped by Hillstone for Lunch on Veteran&apos;s Day and had a great meal.  We had a Rainbow Roll to start and then French Dip sandwiches and the Hawaiian Ribeye Steak - all were excellent!

Our server Matt D was terrific - very personable and helpful.  When he saw that we could use more jus for the French Dip sandwiches, he brought more to our table without us having to ask for it. 

The outdoor seating is set up nicely in the open space in the New York Life building (the indoor seating looked impressive also)

Will definitely return!"
5,"Love this place, the wait staff, the service,  the food, and mostly the wine selection.... I arrived to NYC in late December 2020, made reservations for every Sunday and Wednesday, each and every  visit, I was treated as a Rock star.  I am not a fan of outdoor dining but the ambiance and atmosphere of the NY Life main entrance  gave a Gatsby-esqe aura. Every meal was artfully crafted and meticulously paired with a fine bottle of red.  My two main servers for each visit: Matthew and Carly, each professional, affable and sociable.  I love them both; but  one I hold especially dear to me. Hillstone follows a strict Covid protocol: proper social distancing and disinfecting, both done without interfering with the dining experience.   In short this place ROCKS!!!!!! I hope those whom I met we will meet again..... LOVE   YOU Hillstone...."
5,"What is there not to like? Comfortable, relaxing setting, professional servers and delicious food. In addition to french dip, the fall off the bone ribs and thin fries are amazing. I often order the Hawaiian rib eye steak with a huge, fluffy baked potato (all fixings). There are a variety of offerings so something for everyone at reasonable prices for a restaurant that is great for business lunches and tourists/locals in shorts. 

Fortunately for me, other NYers love this place so i hope they will make it through the pandemic."

5,"So good you won&apos;t believe that it&apos;s a chain! I&apos;ve been coming to Hillstone Park Ave South consistently for several years now and it&apos;s been consistently amazing - both food and service. 

My go-to is the Thai Steak Noodle Salad - extremely vibrant dish with incredibly fresh ingredients that&apos;s filling but never heavy. The Campfire Barbecue Pork Ribs are fall-off-the-bone tender and juicy. My coworkers and I agree that it&apos;s a close call between the Hillstone and the Upland burgers, but my vote always goes towards Hillstone. The sushi rolls, albeit Americanized, is tasty for what it&apos;s not... I just wish that they would stop calling the little rolls &quot;sushi&quot;. My only complaint is that the string fries are super weak! Really hope they can upgrade the puny, greasy, and often rock-hard fries to something else, anything else. It is on the pricier side but worth it. 

Upscale environment with a more chillax vibe than that of Park Avenue&apos;s and Upland&apos;s. Extremely professional service that&apos;s on par with that of Park Avenue&apos;s, both of which are better than Upland&apos;s."
5,"The French dip is too die for. My first review was too long for yelp so I sent it to their corporate headquarters. I won&apos;t bother ordering a French Dip anywhere else now that I know this place exists. 

My only argument is that we are a family of 5 and they only allow 4 max... So I can&apos;t bring everyone. Maybe after covid this might change. Hopefully. Make a reservation. We saw many people get turned away. Lunch is served only at the one by Hudson Yards."
5,"Hit Hillstone this week for a friends birthday and boy was it a movie and a half. 

Everybody knows hillstone / Houston&apos;s is the best restaurant group under our sun so were fired up going in. Hospitality was electric when Michelle greeted us and took our drink orders. 

After sitting down, vibes took a brief dip since our waitress didn&apos;t come close to being as friendly and pleasant as Michelle but we overcame quickly by our order tactics. 

Right off the bat, beers and crisp martinis. One of the best martinis ever, truly. 

Next up Spinach artichoke dip (not gluten free but yolo), spicy tuna roll, spicy tuna Osaka roll, and another spicy tuna roll for good measure because it was that crazy. 

Next up, peanut chicken salad. Truly lethal and unbeatable. Fries for the table with those beautiful dips pictured here. And I dug into Dave&apos;s burger (sans bun) which was crazy. 

Along the way we had multiple crisptinis and topped it off with some of the best espresso martinis New York has ever seen. 

We got a little vanilla bean ice cream scoop action at the end from the waitress which was like a 6 out of 10 on the hospitality scale but I&apos;ll take it. ALSO when they kept changing glasses for a clean glass when we were halfway thru martinis that was incredible. 

Looking forward to many more Hillstone experiences. Bless"
5,"I&apos;ve been here a few times at both of their locations - we&apos;ve always had a pleasant time. 

Food: &apos;Osaka Style&apos; Spicy Tuna, House-Made Veggie BurgerCampfire Barbecue Pork Ribs and Dutch Country Chicken (5/5)

The veggie burger was the best I&apos;ve ever had! Super flavorful.

Service: White tablecloths + great attention from staff

They are pretty strict on the two hour limit which was more than enough, but also important to keep in mind if you want to have a few drinks and extend your gathering.

TIP: You need to make a reservation"
1,"At the beginning of Corona virus we would order Curbside. Still a limited menu and the portions were good. However, recently one of my favorite restaurants has been declining in service and food. They never have anything. No more curbside. You can&apos;t even place an order online and pick up like R &amp; D Kitchen. There is a totally different take out menu and you have to come into the restaurant and sit at the bar to be told that they don&apos;t have an item. Or to be told that item is not for take out when the person across the bar is eating it. Recently, I&apos;ve had enough when I ordered food to take home after being told more than half the menu was unavailable. When I went home to eat my burger (which was not my first choice) it was absolutely raw. I never write reviews, but I really am over it!"
5,"I&apos;m guilty for not ordering take out as much (if any) during this pandemic...but I decided to splurge for my birthday...
I thought where do I want to order from? My brain said &quot;the dip&quot;. Yes, imagine that of all places I chose the dip. It&apos;s like asking what your last meal would be...I opted for the dip. Didn&apos;t know what to expect and I was open minded and would be very grateful and content to whatever I would receive....
Not only did the order come early.....the dip was PERFECT. The jus and horseradish...the beeeeef....the buuuuun.... I was beyond content and I thank you Hillstone for this.
The slaw was also Bingo* delicious. Spicy tuna roll...(i miss sushi) was excellent.
Everything was fresh and delicious. They added a bonus thank you brownie. So sweet! Thank you again."
5,"elizabeth r was the absolute best waitress ever, she was so kind. the food was absolutely amazing, and so was the service. it was all so fresh and came out quickly, too. if i ever have another fancy dinner, i will be coming back here. elizabeth helped make my boyfriends 21st birthday so special. 10/10 environment, food, and especially service."
5,"If you don&apos;t have a large appetite you&apos;ll have to bring friends because these are the things you MUST TRY:
Veggie burger- even if you hate most veggie burgers, trust me. It&apos;s not trying to masquerade as meat, it&apos;s a different experience altogether but just as satisfying
Spicy Tuna Osaka Style- does it make sense that a place with an excellent veggie burger has such perfect, fresh sushi? No, but I&apos;m not complaining
Thai Tuna Roll- a flavor/texture combination you can&apos;t imagine until you try it and very very craveable
The Artichokes- no words. The best."
