5,"It&apos;s been awhile.....
And this time at pandemic era it&apos;s weird.
But Marta , doesn&apos;t layback and playing complacent.
They nailed with great 2 Calzones.
Fungus&amp; il Classico 
Excellent!!!!
Large portions , dough is the right size and crust &amp; fillings are fantastic .
Sad to see the place so dark &amp; quiet but at least the food bring hope for tasty close future ."
5,I love their thin crust! When I visited NY they were only doing calzones since their crust wouldn&apos;t hold up with delivery. But the calzones were still five stars! One is enough for two hungry people.
5,"I ordered Restaurant Week delivery during COVID and was very pleased with my meal. For $20.21 I got the Fun Guy (mushroom) pizza, chicken meatballs, and a mixed salad. Everything was absolutely delicious and one order was enough for two people, making it an incredible value."
3,"Food:Marta was great. I used to love their magarita pizza. And because of the covid, they are inventing Calzones. I had their broccoli Balboa, and I think I am not very hyped about their calzones. The cheese part is overpowering the freshness of broccoli and because it is a delivery, the dull cheese is saturated with the harden dough made everything uneasy to bite.
Although we are group of four, we dont even finish their calzone.
Such a disappointment.
UGH, when can this COVID be over? i MISS ur pizza.
I felt bad to leave a 3-star review here since I have heard so many great things about this place. 
I will come back and give another chance"
4,"I stayed in the Redbury NY early January, and I loved the pizza here. The amazing service and decor are to die for.

Of course, I definitely got some of my NY pizzas as a room service courtesy thanks to myself staying there. Perfectly oven-baked that you can definitely tell. 

It is thin crust pizza FYI."
2,"Ohh Marta! I&apos;m so sad, I really wanted to like this place because I typically love USHG spots and I love a crispy thin crust pizza. We started by wanting to sit at the bar in front of the pizza oven (who doesnt want a little something to look at while waiting for some crispy pizza) but were told no, even though it was totally empty and set with dinnerware. Whatever. 

We ordered two dirt wolf IPAs (which I&apos;m a huge fan of as they are made by my hometown brewery, I was excited because it can be hard to find in NY) which were served so cold that they were almost completely flat and had little slivers of ice floating on them. Weird. 

We got the mushroom appetizer and the pizza w vodka sauce. The mushrooms were well seasoned and had a great texture but they needed to come with toast or something, a small pile of roasted mushrooms is more of a side than an appetizer. Also at $17....lol. 

But that was all ok because I was so ready for that &quot;cracker thin pizza they advertise.&quot; Welp. We got a pretty flavorless soggy pizza. Maybe we ordered wrong because the &quot;vodka sauce&quot; tasted of nothing and maybe the standard pizza sauce has some flavor...but really, this pizza was so low quality I was pretty shocked. We ended up using a whole shaker or parmesan and a lot of red pepper flakes just to get some flavor. 

We wanted to try the amaro flights as dessert (cool concept and I love st agrestis amaro) but after waiting 10 minutes for our waiter to come back we decided we would wait 10 more minutes and then just get the check. Which is what happened. 

Sad because they have some fun happy hour deals but no discount is too deep to make me come back!"
2,"I&apos;ve been wanting to try Marta&apos;s pizza for a very long time and recently ordered a couple of pies. All I can say is we were very underwhelmed and felt  that it was mediocre at best. Add in the price and the review is even worse. In addition, I added mushrooms for my pizza and it made me nauseous for the entire evening. Never again!"
3,"Checked off another USHG off the list on my recent trip back to NYC.

Marta is located in the Redbury Hotel, sharing the same main entrance on 29th St. We booked a 5pm reservation to take advantage of both the dinner menu and the happy hour overlap from 3-6pm everyday.

Ordered:
3 glasses of champagne: PIERRE PÃ‰TERS, BENOIT MARGUET, LAHERTE FRERES at $18 each during happy hour. Each one was distinctly different and each was pretty good.
Negroni: on the bitter side, &quot;alcohol-forward&quot;, pretty bottle.
CALAMARI ALLA DIAVOLA: spicy grilled calamari $19. Asian flavors, small portion. Lowkey would have loved this with a bowl of rice.
STRACCIATELLA: kinda like stretched out mozzarella cheese $13.5 during happy hour pricing
+ a pizza with proscuitto and soppressata for my lactose-intolerant friend.

I think the total was about $100. We had the longest wait for the pizza and other tables who arrived later were served before we were. Everything was honestly just ok."
3,"I came here for dinner with some colleagues at work during a week night. We were a table of 8 so we ordered many different items from the menu to share, and several bottles of wine.  Overall, the food was good, but the service left something to be desired for a couple reasons, which are outlined below.

First, I could not hear our main server at all.  The space is beautiful but it is loud, so please speak up.  The server also didn&apos;t replace plates, and they were quite rude several times when I asked if they could please clear plates.  In particular, the sommelier was not the best sommelier I&apos;ve encountered, I think my colleague ordering the wine was definitely more knowledgeable than the sommelier was.  There were several instances where the sommelier had to go &quot;consult with her colleague&quot; in order to respond to our questions about the wine - was her colleague google? 

On a more positive note, the food was pretty good.  The rice balls were amazing.  The calamari was OK and we also shared a couple salads for the table (against some of my colleagues wishes), and I liked them both, but liked the one with farro and Brussels sprouts less.  The pizzas were good, my personal favorite was the white pizza and truffle (there was a lot of truffle!) and the plain pizza. As for mains, the duck was very moist though it looked a tad over cooked, and had a wonderful smoky after taste.  We ordered 4 steaks for 2 among the table since there were 8 of us, and some steaks were definitely prepared better than others - some were cooked medium instead of medium rare and others were covered in fat while others were fine.

We also forgot to order sides, so when our food came we quickly ordered a side of Brussels sprouts.  They were good but had way too much lime on them for my liking.  The potatoes on the other hand are a must order if you like crispy potatoes.  Also the sever was very keen on upselling the entire table ordering the steak, but then forgot to sell us sides, which I thought was a bit odd.

In conclusion, this place either had good steak for a pizza place or good pizza for a steak place, but neither necessarily stood on its own."
2,"I&apos;ve come here a couple of times using mealpal and each time has been pretty good. The pizza was ready within minutes and hot. This time, however, was a really bad experience. I had to wait a much longer amount of time and when I did receive the food it was already cold. When I got home, I realized the pizza wasn&apos;t cut. I want to give the benefit of the doubt to them, but I&apos;m just so frustrated over this experience."
4,"Pizza was cooked in a wood burning oven. Ordered the prosciutto and cheese. It was thin and crisp crust that was more like a cracker but I liked because it was different. 
   Best of all it was half price during happy hour, don&apos;t know the exact time
 it started but was until 6pm.
   Located in the Redbury hotel, although you can see from street you enter through the hotel.
  This is a non tipping restaurant, the servers are very polite and friendly, we were checked on more than if we just had one server."
4,"This was a great meal, though definitely on the pricey end. Given how sterile and empty the surrounding blocks are (aside from Koreatown), this is a pretty good option for the neighborhood. Note, however, that the restaurant&apos;s entrance is actually the same entrance as the hotel. 

I remain a diehard fan of Motorino&apos;s Neapolitan-style pizza, though I&apos;m glad I tried Marta&apos;s super thin-crust version. It was still delicious, as all pizzas are, but the dough was almost a cracker, sort of similar to Rubirosa. I prefer my pizza to have a bit more substance and chew, so it doesn&apos;t feel like I&apos;m simply crunching on air and some toppings. Then again, I know others who actually prefer this Roman style. We went with four pizzas: my favorite was definitely the Margherita, though the clam and the fungi were close seconds. 

I also really liked the house salad, which was, by far, perhaps the best basic green salad I&apos;ve ever had (and, in my opinion, actually worth the $18 price tag). I could have eaten this massive bowl of leaves all day long and it paired really well with the pizzas. 

We also ordered a few apps, which I think, when compared to the pizzas, could be skipped if you&apos;re trying to conserve valuable stomach real estate. But definitely a good idea to get a few of these if you&apos;re with a large group.  In particular, the ricotta with grilled bread was tasty and they gave a good amount of ricotta (and bread! Not a fan when restaurants give you a massive amount of the &quot;dip&quot; and not enough bread to soak everything up). 

Too stuffed to try dessert. Our waitress was really nice and explained that there was this enormous plant dropping tiny crabapples on our heads.

The one miss for me was the cocktails. I&apos;m usually very content with anything sweet/fizzy but, for whatever reason, didn&apos;t like the ones I ordered."
4,"Came here with friends and it&apos;s very spacious to have large parties or even small parties. Before you enter, the &quot;Marta&quot; sign is very large so you can&apos;t miss it! I got the prosciutto and calamari for the appetizers. The calamari wasn&apos;t fried but it was delicious and spicy! For pizza entrees, I got the margarita pizza and the funghi (mushroom) pizza. Service was great, but we received our appetizers before the drinks, which was a little eh and my mock tail drink came out very warm so I had to wait for the ice cubes to sink it but overall, vibes and food were great!"
5,"Danny Meyer and USHG never disappoints. I came here for dinner with a friend for an overdue catch up date. We ordered the scallop appetizer and the mushroom pizza with straciatella. Both dishes were delightful! For dessert we ordered the torta caprese which is a chocolate cake with molten center topped with a gelato flavored with this amazing herbaceous liqueur. And since we were there celebrating my birthday they also comped us an extra dessert. The food was excellent, the service exemplary as you&apos;d expect from a USHG establishment and we were very happy with our dining experience. 

Note they do half off pizzas for happy hour!"
3,"Great decor, happening spot, but the food was only so so. Great things: Level service and gratuity is already included in the menu prices, which helps with the feeling of items being overpriced! They&apos;re known for their pizzas, all wood fired, thin crust pizza, so we got a couple of those items too.

Appetizer: Grilled artichokes with ricotta. The ricotta looked shaved on and didn&apos;t have much flavor. The artichokes were also hard to chew, not very tender at all. Wouldn&apos;t recommend.
Appetizer: Prosciutto and mozzarella. The mozzarella with this dish was amazing - flavorful, delicate, soft. The star of the dish by far. It comes with 3 thick pieces of crusty bread to go with meat and cheese.

Pizza: Straciatella (tomato sauce, mozz, basil). This is their most popular pizza and for good reason. The sauce and mozzarella were a classic combination and the mozzarella, just like the appetizer, is so delicate and delicious. 
Pizza: Kale, sweet potato. This was surprisingly good - it was sweet but not overly. It was a good combo of sweet with the savory crust. It was good to combine a classic with a more modern pizza.
Entree: Swordfish on broccolini and oyster mushrooms. This was surprisingly good but also pretty expensive ($35). The swordfish was moist, cut into easy manageable slices already, and was more tender than any other swordfish I&apos;ve had. The broccolini and mushrooms absorbed a lot of the lemon/caper vinaigrette but a little too much, it seemed overdressed and so became too sour.

All in all, good experience, but not sure this is a must try restaurant."
4,"I stopped in for some pizza and a beer while staying at the Redbury. I was a little disappointed at first because I was a guest at the hotel and they couldn&apos;t seat me without a reservation even though there were dozens of open tables. So we looked past that and sat at the pizza bar. 

The waitress immediately greeted us and got our drink orders. She was fantastic! Very friendly and helpful. (Thank you Jenna) I ordered the Margarita pizza as it was happy hour and the pizzas were half price. My pizza was excellent! Fresh ingredients, perfect thin and crispy crust and the flavor was outstanding. If it weren&apos;t for the fact that they couldn&apos;t seat a hotel guest, I would have given 5 stars. That really didn&apos;t sit well with me."
5,"A favorite spot that I come to with my coworkers. A really nice atmosphere, you have to enter through the hotel (which can be a little confusing for first-timers) but it&apos;s spacious and well-decorated. You can see the brick ovens and they have very high ceilings.

Their happy hour is really great, deals on the pizzas and also drinks such as their wines and champagnes. We take full advantage of this, and we love the pizzas. Our favorites are the Stracciatella, the classic Margherita, Macellaio for meat-lovers, and the Funghi and the Inverno for those that don&apos;t mind white pizzas.

I&apos;ve tried their salads, which are good to pair with the pizzas but I wouldn&apos;t come here just for those. They also had a delicious deep-fried rice ball appetizer that we love to get as well. 

Service is usually very good, I&apos;ve come for both lunch and dinner and it definitely seems to be less busy for lunch. However, I do recommend reserving in advance just in case. I&apos;ve seen other parties of coworkers, and fair shares of people from the hotel dining here on multiple occasions."
5,"Marta is one of the best things about NYC! And the staff and happy hour are two more reasons to love it like your mother. So, do you really need another pizza place in your phone?

When it comes to Marta, in a word - yes! Marta is best known for it&apos;s delicious, gourmet pizzas. You can find them 50% off Sun-Sat between 3pm-6pm. My favorite is the mushroom and plain Margherita. But pizzas are not the only thing you will salivate over here.

You will find delicious Italian favorites from branzino to clams to chicken with Italian salad. The menu rotates through the seasons with daily specials.

But the dessert? That&apos;s where the moon hits your eye and it&apos;s amore! The ice cream pops? In a word - the greatest thing you will find in the Flatiron besides gossip on your ex! 

If this is not enough. How about the wonderful beers from Jack&apos;s Abbey to $18 champagne at happy hour. Or the late night happy hour with a free pizza for each bottle of wine you purchase. 

Go! Manga! Enjoy."
5,"I&apos;ve been here on birthdays and for special occasions and it simply never disappoints. I also went the other night during their Phase 2 reopening and sat outside for a drink and a couple of appetizers and was so impressed by the service and the food, and their commitment to following health and safety guidelines. I brought my dog with me and they brought him a little silver dish of water, which is exactly the kind of attention to detail and thoughtfulness that comes through in every dish they serve.
There isn&apos;t a bad pizza on the menu. Some essential items: you&apos;ll want to try the artichokes and squash, the risotto croquettes, the chicken meatballs, and the Marta Mista. Their pickled veggies are a perfect appetizer to get with drinks. Get at least two pizzas.
There are no bad desserts on the menu. Just close your eyes and point to any three or four and order those.
Also worth noting it is a non-tipping restaurant, which has many advantages for workers and helps simplify check-splitting. And of course, in case it&apos;s not clear, you can expect excellent service here. 
Food: 10/10
Service: 10/10
Ambience: 10/10
Cleanliness: 10/10"
5,"Came here the day my ex and I officially broke up.... so the fact that this gets 5 stars must mean it was really good to turn a day like that into a positive experience. 
We sat at the bar, he had a beer and I had a glass of red wine. The vibe was good and the bartenders were fantastic. We had to salsiccia pizza, it was good. The crust was delicious and I&apos;m fairly certain we finished the whole thing. 
It&apos;s a non tipping restaurant, so everything is included. Definitely come check this place out."
