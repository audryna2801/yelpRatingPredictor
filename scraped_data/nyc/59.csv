5,"I looooove Australian breakfast. And thus, I love Little Collins.

Each brekkie, sandwich and salad is a unique and scrumptious savory or sweet delight. The signatures for me are The Muze, The Smash, and The Sweet Uncle Fred.

Try everything once, especially their specials. Hopefully you have a crowd to try it all at once.

The coffee, espresso and pastries are as solid.

This space is bright, open, and currently has more space for standing and seating than their old location. No outdoor seating right now.

Great place to be on a weekend morning - or any morning you want to feel like a weekend :)"
5,Great little cafe with friendly staff! Just had the scrambled eggs on toast with an ice coffee. They are social distancing but have a few tables outside to enjoy. Will definitely be back when I&apos;m in the area.
3,"Good coffee, bad service. Staff was a bit on the nasty side. I ordered an iced soy latte without any ice because I don&apos;t like my drinks watered down/too cold and they filled the cup 3/4 of the way since it&apos;s &quot;without ice.&quot; When I asked them to fill it like a normal drink they gave me a huge attitude. Like bro, come on, you just have to add a little splash of milk more, chill I&apos;m not robbing you. 

Anyway, don&apos;t think I&apos;ll be back. Can get plenty of better coffee elsewhere."
4,"Stopped in for a quick cup of coffee while I was in NYC, pre-pandemic back in March. As advertised, there isn&apos;t a lot of space inside, and finding the right place to stand where I wasn&apos;t in the way felt difficult too. But, the flat white I had was delicious, and despite it being busy, I didn&apos;t have to wait long for my coffee. A true experience of going in and out without any issues! I hope Little Collins is still around when I&apos;m able to come back to NYC, the food offerings look delicious!"
5,"Really impressed by the service; everyone was very polite and welcoming. The food was great, I enjoyed that their menu had a lot of different items to try. Great for return visits. Outdoor heat lamps worked well and it was raining but we didn&apos;t feel a drop! Great place for brunch."
5,"Walked by this cafe on the way to work one morning and decided to sit down and have breakfast, so glad I did! While it is a small place my almond milk flat white was amazing. Definitely one of the best flat white coffees I&apos;ve had. I also tried the muse which was also very good which consisted of muesli, sweet, with jam, a lot of fresh fruit, and very filling.

Service was excellent.

I will definitely be back for more."
5,"Balance is a beautiful thing and extremely difficult to get right. The balance of ingredients to create one of the most perfect lattes in the world is even more of a feat and a true achievement. 

Coming from the San Francisco of Australia, Little Collins is much more than cool, hipster or trendy. It&apos;s cozy, small and dedicated to creating perfection from  every ingredient on the small menu. The lattes are not overpowering, but also not bland. They are  simply delicious with a profile of spice, fresh coffee and milk. The service is quick and tactical, getting people what they need quickly without any sideline conversations. There are no distractions to annoy an uncaffinated soul and a focus on producing some of thr best cofffee drinks that money can buy. The pastries that are here are very well made and the entire experience is quick, yet memorable."
4,"Delicious flat whites, strong coffee and delicious oatmilk. I was in and out so didn&apos;t try any of the eats, but I noted some vegan options that were different sounding. 

This place was busy - not much seating space and the line can be a bit tricky (it&apos;s difficult to tell who is in line and who isn&apos;t), but overall it&apos;s a friendly and welcoming place serving up a solid and cute cup of coffee."
4,"Little Collins was so NYC, it almost hurt. The service was not very friendly or patient, but neither is the rest of New York. The seating space is very limited and tight. I was alone and could barely find place to stand, let alone eat.

I ordered the avocado toast, which definitely needed to be eaten with a fork and knife. It was piled HIGH with avocado, sprinkled with feta and tasty to the max. Unfortunately, every time I tried to saw a piece off, I&apos;d bump elbows into someone else. The food and coffee were both REALLY good, but I would definitely recommend taking it to go.

I read reviews of the olive oil cake, so I had to have it. Unfortunately, iot was just oooookay. Tasted mostly like bread and cardamom. I wish I would have gotten one of the beautiful chocolate chip cookies in the case instead!"
5,"This place is a little gem  in the middle of magnificent city &quot;The Big Apple&quot;.
Been here twice so glad it is very close to my apartment. 

I&apos;ll make it short and simple and just call it as it is. Great food and great service!!! Excellent!!!

Can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu. 

Just FYI, space is very limited such a tiny place. 
Take out is always an option though."
5,"A great little cafe for both food and coffee - a little nondescript on the outside, the only way to tell what you&apos;re getting into is the regular flow of customers that often turns into a bit of a crowd inside and of course the Yelp reviews. I came here for breakfast twice and was impressed by the food. 

The Smash (their version of avocado toast) hit the spot - definitely the kind that needs to be eaten with a fork and knife since the avocado was piled high. For those of you who are feta tolerators as opposed to feta lovers, don&apos;t worry - there was just enough to add flavor without being overwhelming. Also tried a flat white but it was slightly too bitter for my taste.

Also tried the Sweet Uncle Fred, which I thoroughly enjoyed (keep in mind, though, that I have a serious sweet tooth). Loved the combination of ricotta cheese, fresh berries, and almond toffee. The sweetness of the honey put it a little over the edge - I thought if they used slightly spicy honey like I had at Ippudo the other night that might be perfect. Ordered a latte this time and was happier with the taste.

Both times I came before 8:30 and was lucky to get a tiny table (this is definitely not a place for large groups), and both times it was insanely crowded by the time I left and people were swooping in on my table."
4,"We enjoyed our first meal of 2020 at Little Collins. We called ahead to make sure they were open, and they said they were serving the brunch menu that day for New Year&apos;s Day. I was expecting more of a sit-down place with more seating, so I was surprised to see that Little Collins is TINY! There is really limited seating. You order at the counter, then fend for yourself if you specified &quot;dine-in.&quot; We optimistically thought there was a system and that perhaps the staff would assist with seating or stagger orders. I snagged a seat at the counter, and we were never able to get a table or another seat for my husband, so he stood the whole meal. 

Despite that, the food was excellent, and the staff were very friendly. We enjoyed chatting with one of the employees about Chicago (where we are from) since she had visited a friend there recently. We ordered the avocado toast and sweet uncle Fred (banana bread with ricotta, berries, honey). Both were amazing, but the banana bread was my absolute favorite. So sweet and flavorful! We saw on the menu that this is an Australian spot with different &quot;brekkie&quot; options. If this is traditional Australian food, then I need to visit! I loved the food. I love the people there. I love the energy. (I just wish it were bigger!) Next time, I would try to visit at less of a prime time so I could have regular seating to enjoy my meal more."
4,"{Overall: 4; Coffee: 5; Food: 4} Atmosphere: 3.5 (because of the crowds); Service: 4

It&apos;s a small coffee shop and has seats, but definitely gets crowded especially on a weekend around brunch time - you&apos;ll probably be fighting for a place, and you&apos;ll feel a little crowded in when you get one. Lots of people standing around. Service is good in spite of the tight quarters.

Delicious Counter Culture coffee. Good Australian brunch staples. 

Would return for coffee in the future."
4,"Great little place to get brekkie, brunch, or just coffee while taking in some Aussie spirit. I adore all things Australian, so walking into Little Collins filled me with warm and fuzzy feelings. That street sign! The delicious coffee! The Vegemite! ... Scratch that, Vegemite is never a good thing. 

This cafe is narrow and small, with room for about twelve seats. Prepare to wait for a table if you come between 11-2. It did feel uncomfortably tight in there while waiting to get situated. Service is standard, and so is the menu. Lots of sandwiches, salads, and avocado. I got a coffee with almond milk and a Greek salad. Both were great. The salad came with a block of feta cheese, bread, and a light dressing. It&apos;s big enough to share.

The coffee is up to par with Australian coffee. I wish they did free refills! I really enjoyed it. 

Prices are very reasonable for the food, but beverages were definitely higher than average."
2,"I really wanted to like Little Collins. The shop is close to my workplace so it would have been a great lunch option. However, I thought that the food was overpriced for what it was and I also found a hair in my panna cotta. The panna cotta was in an enclosed container and the hair was actually set in the panna cotta which makes me feel like the food prep may be a little lacking in hygiene.

I&apos;ve been to the restaurant twice and appreciate that they have vegetarian options. I think that the food is okay but the sandwich and the panna cotta ran me more than $22 which is expensive especially since both items are pretty small."
4,"The food is good, but too tiny to sit in. 
Ordered the smash and waffle with berries. Very good."
4,"Adorable cafe with delicious shakshuka and poached eggs. We lucked out by getting the 3 seats by the window but if you don&apos;t get them, it&apos;s basically standing room only. This cafe is great but pretty tiny, I could imagine a line out the door for it on most weekends!"
5,"Finally! Little Collins has exceptional coffee with friendly staff. It&apos;s a very small but cute shop. We&apos;ve been searching NYC for a place like this for over a month. 

This is the spot!"
3,"I&apos;m admittedly surprised at how high Little Collins is rated.

It is indeed very cute and has great coffee (served with a small shortbread cookie that is delicious), but that&apos;s where it really ends for me.

I came on a busy Sunday afternoon and managed to snag two seats by the window, but I did have to grab them like a hawk- it&apos;s almost a little too stressful. 

My husband and I ordered two cappuccinos, yet he had to go retrieve them from the counter himself which I found surprising, since our meals were brought directly to us. Another stress point- it&apos;s definitely not easy to carry two full-to-the-brim coffee mugs amidst the crowd, but alas he managed without a spill or someone knocking them over. 

For meals, we shared the Avocado Toast and the Big Dill. It was obvious both were very fresh, but there was nothing exceptional from a flavor delivery standpoint in either dish to warrant rating them more than just &apos;good&apos;.

Ultimately, I&apos;d come back to get their coffee, ONLY to go, and would pass on their food."
5,"Adorable Australian spot putting out delicious coffee (flat whites are particularly great) and fantastic items for brekkie.  I have a hard time not ordering the smash (avocado and feta bedazzled with pepitas and red pepper flakes), but one of these days I&apos;ll branch out.  The avocado deliciousness is loaded on greater than an inch which just the right amount of kick.  Snagging a seat inside is difficult, but sometimes the stars align and you can enjoy your items inside.  Some may call it cramped, I call it cozy."
