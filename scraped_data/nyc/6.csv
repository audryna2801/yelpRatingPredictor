5,"The food here to to die for. My first indoor dining experience in NYC in months and boy was it worth it. I had the Fra Cocoa drink which was cute AND delicious. My yellowtail, braised short ribs and mushroom polenta were flavorful and seasoned and cooked to perfection. Best appetizers I&apos;ve had in ages. For main courses I stuck to the classic spaghetti and my companion had the Waygu steak...both incredible. I was so stuffed I couldn&apos;t even finish my dessert...which upset me because they were both delicious haha. The service was on point, ambience was cute and trendy...such an awesome experience"
5,"TLDR the spaghetti lives up to the hype. I got a delivery order during COVID pandemic times and the food was still phenomenal.

Took advantage of the great NYC restaurant week deal to get their famous spaghetti that came with a side of cauliflower romesco for $20.21! Would still pay full price for the spaghetti because the pasta quality and texture was just so great. They don&apos;t drown it in sauce. It&apos;s a nice light tomato sauce with a good punch of basil. Also got the Stromboli bread, which was fantastic. The cauliflower side was also really good! Loved the cream and capers that is what served with.

They&apos;ve also set up really cute &quot;chalets&quot; for outdoor dining so can&apos;t wait to pop in for that next time! Great delivery option for a high quality dinner at home during the winter months."
5,"Utterly amazing. Wow. Spectacular!

I had one of the top 5 pasta dishes of my life here back in the fall when it was a bit warmer. We sat outside in their gorgeous vine-covered patio setup. The waitstaff was amazing, attentive &amp; swift. We had the pleasure of speaking with the sommelier as well - very knowledgeable and personable. 

We ordered some crudi (salmon &amp; yellowtail) - really enjoyed them both. We also tried the stracciatella w/ butternut squash. It was good, but not my favorite! Star of my meal was the SHORT RIB &amp; BONE MARROW AGNOLOTTI with garlic chip &amp; horseradish. Wow. Each bite was a perfectly balanced pillow of creamy / salty bone marrow, a little sweet from the short rib, and covered in a creamy garlicky sauce with a kick from the horseradish to cut through the rich flavors. You bet I didn&apos;t leave a drop of sauce on my plate. I would come back here just to order this. My main was the halibut. I liked it, but would try something else next time! I had the espresso budino for dessert - really good. I love coffee based desserts and loved the little crinkles of caramel.

Felt like a once-in-a-lifetime meal. I still dream about the agnolotti..."
5,"Their bread basket is the best in town and what makes it even better is that  they are FREE!!! The Italians sure know how to do the bread right. My server asked if I want a second one and of course YESSSS!! I was already half-stuffed after consuming two rounds of bread. This basket included three selections of breads - Stromboli stuffed with salami and cheese was outstanding. It also came with three accompaniments - butter, olive oil and eggplant caponata.

Aside from the bread basket, we had the following - yellow tail and creamy polenta for appetizers and their infamous spaghetti for entr√©e. Yellowtail is nothing to write home about but OMG you need to order the creamy polenta. Scarpetta is not even joking when it comes to creaminess in this polenta. It was so flavorful and went well with the truffled mushroom. Spaghetti had a nice little kick of spiciness and cooked perfectly. 

Their outdoor dining area is very nicely decorated and I hope to go back soon!"
5,"Came here for dinner on a weeknight. The three of us are normally pretty cold in outdoor dining setups, but the spacious booths at Scarpetta were so warm and cozy. I felt like I could&apos;ve taken a nap in there. 

The bread basket was fancy and delicious and the pasta dishes we all ordered were great. 

The only negative, but definitely not enough for me to remove a star was that DANG they sure do check in a LOT. We didn&apos;t necessarily feel rushed, but it felt like they were popping in and interrupting our conversation about one every 5 - 10 minutes."
1,"Reserved an outdoor private chalet on 2/13/21 for 8:30pm for Valentine&apos;s Day dinner celebration with my girlfriend.

To make the reservation - I had to prepay in full (tax and gratuity included with a cancellation fee of $150 pp). The 90minute time limit was also communicated through the hostess, email confirmation, and text message one hour before our reservation.

When checking in with the host, we were told there would be a wait for our reservation and they couldn&apos;t tell us how long the wait would be and that the reason was &quot;we have a lot of end of the night tables that need to be seated&quot;. After 30mins and still no text or update about our table being ready, we went to check in with the host he told us there&apos;s still a wait and then asked us if we wanted to sit inside when we specifically only made a reservation at this restaurant for the private chalet.

After waiting over 45 minutes, we were finally seated and the hostess told me &quot;they&apos;d do their best&quot; to allow us to get our 90mins of time in. It is now past 9:15pm. The reservation includes a 6 course prix fixe menu with wine pairing and not only were we seated extremely late but we were rushed through our dinner. I wasn&apos;t even finished with one course or glass of wine before they were bringing the next one out. The restaurant offered us an additional complimentary glass of wine to make up for the wait which would&apos;ve been appreciated if not for being rushed after waiting for so long and the other flaws that evening.

When we got into the chalet, their was a dirty table napkin on the floor - which makes me question how well they cleaned and sanitized the chalet before seating us (especially during these times). The fake candle that was apart of the decor was not lit. My halibut was dry and salty (although my gf loved hers). They turned the music off when we were at course 3/6 (we ended up just playing our own music on our phone to make the best of the situation). The waiter asked us if we&apos;d want to take our steak courses to go making us feel even more rushed and then served it rare without bothering to ask our preference (I would&apos;ve liked my medium rare). I overheard the gentleman at the table next to us say the steak was cooked perfectly and would&apos;ve liked to have had the same experience. Given the fact that the restaurant was at fault for making us sit so late, put us in a questionably &quot;clean&quot; chalet, and then rushed us through our courses, throwing in one extra glass of wine to make up for it isn&apos;t really enough when you&apos;re paying over $600 on dinner. There are other things I can nitpick on as well but overall I just don&apos;t have anything positive to say about this experience other than the company I was with.

Going into this night, my girlfriend and I were so excited. The private chalet seemed like a dream and the perfect way to have an enhanced dinner experience to celebrate the holiday. As this was the first time we were celebrating Valentine&apos;s Day together, we were really looking to make it a memorable experience and had high expectations. Regrettably Scarpetta did not do that for us.

It really upsets me that I feel compelled to write such a negative review but I was so unbelievably disappointed in the service that I would expect to be nothing but exceptional at a restaurant such as this. It wasn&apos;t the elegant and romantic evening I envisioned. This was my gift to my gf and I felt embarrassed by the dirty napkin, poor service, being rushed, and just not having the perfect time I had thought we would.

(Covid note: Everyone who made a reservation was aware of the time limit - it is a given considering the pandemic and time limits are expected to be upheld by the establishment. The host told us they had many late end of the night reservations that needed to be seated and it is easy to assume that they weren&apos;t respecting the time limits and asking guests to leave when their time was up, overbooked for the holiday weekend, and didn&apos;t give enough time in between reservations to properly clean (dirty napkin on the floor) and prep the tables for next guests.)"
4,"We came here for a prix fixe 6-course dinner that included the Arctic Char, Seared Diver Scallops, Spaghetti, Halibut, Sirloin, and Valrhona Chocolate Cake. 

Everything was prepared well; the halibut was seared with a crispy exterior and soft interior, and the medium sirloin was chewy and tender. The only dish I would like to nitpick is the spaghetti, which was a little too al dente for me and didn&apos;t taste like anything special. 

My favorite of the evening was actually the Stromboli bread in the complimentary bread basket. It was so fresh and fragrant! I would come again just to have more of that bread.

Besides the food, the service was good, and I really liked the ambiance of the indoor dining. It did feel a tad bit rushed how the servers cleaned up and brought out our next dish quicker than expected, but that&apos;s because of the 90 minutes max rule. 

Overall, I had a great experience dining here."
5,"Video Review Here: https://youtu.be/CM_FImKSvk0

So, for the longest time, my two uncles would always talk about how excited they are about their reservations at Scarpetta. They&apos;ve always raved about it, and I hadn&apos;t been yet! Their excitement sparked MY excitement! I finally got to go, AND film my experience there, for my food vlog!

First off, I went during COVID back in September. They had a beautiful outdoor, almost Garden of Eden kinda vibe for their set up. It was so beautiful and well done. They had the Scarpetta sign on the outside which is extremely photogenic. They followed COVID guidelines and were extremely cleanly. 

Ok, so when I was seated, they brought out the most amazing assortment of breads. This wasn&apos;t no packaged, Wonder bread! This bread was freshly made, with meats, some with cheeses, olive oil, olives on some, etc. This bread was scrumptious! The best I&apos;ve had in a while! Omg. I started off with an old fashioned with Rittenhouse Rye whiskey. It was so smooth, and well made. My friend ordered a Cosmo, which I tasted. Not only was it served in a beautiful, fun crystal glass lol, but the drink itself was great! Believe it or not, Cosmos are not easy to make, so I knew a mixologist made these drinks, and they knew what they were doing!

Ok, so we get into the food. I ordered the charred octopus, and chile....it was perfect! In every way. I tasted that perfect grill char. The octopus had a delicious, meaty texture. The sauces, the flavor of it! Just seriously, some of the best octopus I&apos;ve ever had. So simple, yet so complex in flavor. For the entree, I ordered the short rib and bone marrow agnolotti............wow. It was served in this cool dome lookin&apos; thing, which was an awesome presentation. Biting into this pasta took me on a ride that I&apos;ll always remember. The fat from the bone marrow just made the pasta so creamy and rich. The short rib was beyond tender, and I feel it was slow cooked. You really don&apos;t even have to chew it, it&apos;s so tender. It was almost like butter! Ha! Melt in ya mouf!! 

Ok, we ordered two desserts! The espresso budino being the first. This was like a rich, creamy pudding! The salted caramel was truly it&apos;s own star! It was silky! It came with a biscotti, which you HAD to eat with it, because it gave you more crunch! I could&apos;ve taken a bath in that hazelnut gelato! Ugh! The second dessert was the ricotta cheesecake, which would make the best of us wanna slap somebody nearby smh. There were so many amazing flavors happening. It came with this pretty, swirly white chocolate ring thing-y, pomegranate sorbe, and black figs! This was another thing, where it&apos;s crucial to eat everything together. Everything compliments one another! That cheesecake was beyond rich and creamy, I mean......we shared it, but I really needed my own. 

The service was perfection! Our waitress, the bussers, etc. were all great! I finally got to see why my uncles were always so excited about making reservations here. It is genuine, authentic, well thought out, Italian cuisine. It&apos;s a bit pricey, but a MUST GO TO in NYC. They have other locations in other major cities as well! Perfection! Not a single complaint!"
3,"We ordered in Saturday for date night, and decided on Scarpetta, as it&apos;s been one of my faves for years.  But I&apos;ve always dined in and never ordered takeouts. Unfortunately, I have to say unfortunately the potion was quite small I had the braised short rib) my partner had the chicken. The Food was excellent (I ALWAYS have the short rib it&apos;s the best on the menu) but I&apos;m giving them 3 stars for potions. Especially for that price point, consumers deserve more."
5,"Where to begin? Obviously it&apos;s expensive, so we can skip over that part - if you&apos;re going to Scarpetta you&apos;ve accepted you will spend some money. But it will be well worth it! We started with some crudo and the stracciatella. While the stracciatella was overhyped, the crudo was fresh, light, and tasty. 

Now for the highlights. I had the veal tenderloin and it was incredible. Very rich, flavorful medallions with delicious accompaniments. My girlfriend had the agnolotti - words can&apos;t describe how great this was. Despite how great the veal was, I found myself jealous that I had not gotten the same thing as her.

They have a great outdoor dining area set up and the staff is extremely attentive. I highly recommend Scarpetta for any special occasion."
2,"Most reviews seem to touch on: lack of service, portion size, and price.

My qualms is not with the service. Our waiter came around often enough and our glasses were always topped off. However, like most reviews already pointed out, the portions were scanty and overpriced.

We ordered the short rib &amp; bone marrow agnolotti and nero tagliolini for our main dish. The agnolotti was flavorful but the nero tagliolini was average. Perhaps I would not have felt so disrespected if the flavor of the food justified the price, but this wasn&apos;t the case.

As for the ambience... eh whatever.

To be quite honest, the highlight was the bread. At least we were given a decent portion of bread. Solid 2/5.
Here&apos;s a photo of the highlight."
5,"Nice outdoor seating options! We went there for early dinner and it was an amazing experience. The wagyu, halibut, and spaghetti is really good and so is their complementary bread. 

Great spot for outdoor dining!"
5,"A very nice place with a fine dining atmosphere set just in the corner of The James hotel. The service is impeccable. You have a handful of servers all making sure that you have full glasses, fast friendly service, and a prompt removal of any finished dishes. They have a large wine selection and some great choices for cocktails. 

Everything we ordered was fresh and delightful. From the presentation of the dish to the flavor. The wine we chose was recommended by their sommelier and it was the best I&apos;ve had in decades.  We took home three more bottles just because no matter how many places you go, or what you have tried, a great bottle is something you never pass up. 

Come here and expect to have a wonderful dining experience. You will come back over and over again. Just as I will. Matter of fact, if you&apos;re feeling like a nice getaway, stay at the hotel too and it&apos;ll feel like a full on vacation."
5,"Went to Scarpetta&apos;s last night. Wow what an experience. The service was wonderful. My friend didn&apos;t really like anything on the menu. I asked if they could make her noodles with butter, garlic and parmesan cheese, it was no problem and she loved it.  For apps we got calamari. I do not eat that, however the rest of the table loved it.  I got the spaghetti, which I have been wanting to try for years, wow is all I can say. My husband got the veal, he loved it. My other friend got a seafood dish, he said the best he ever had.  Now mind you, my friends have eaten at all kinds of high end places, he actually stopped on the say out to tell them how wonderful everything was.  I would recommend this to anyone. Yes it is pricey and worth every penny."
5,"I would absolutely recommend Scarpetta for aperitivo aka summer snacking in their outdoor garden from 4:00pm - 5:30pm daily! We made a reservation that allowed us to dine for up to 90 min before we had to give up our table. The food &amp; cocktails were delicious, and the outdoor dining area was lovely. 

I appreciated that the street was pretty empty, and I felt safe sitting a good distance away from other tables (the only COVID-19 concern I had was that they didn&apos;t give us serving utensils). The personal utensils were wrapped securely in a cloth napkin, and there were plants separating us from the other restaurant&apos;s seating area. I also loved the string lightbulbs they had (I&apos;m sure it&apos;s even more beautiful at night). 

I had the Sgroppino, which I was afraid would be sour, but it was actually quite sweet and sugary. Plus it comes in two lemons with giant paper straws which is adorable. Heads up if you&apos;re getting drinks, you need to order a minimum of three small plates. We ordered the Mozzarella in Carozza, Blistered Shishito Peppers, and the Meat &amp; Cheese Platter. The mozzarella was probably my favorite, the peppers were good but a tad too spicy for me, and then the platter was great as well (solid selection of quality meats and cheeses)."
5,"You get what you pay for is certainly accurate when it comes to the superb ambiance, cocktails and food at Scarpetta! Upscale vibe with dim lighting, perfect for a romantic dinner and/or cocktails. Partitioned with dividers and super COVID friendly. Ran out of several items on the menu, which was a bummer but nonetheless had a great time and will be back. It&apos;s my second time here and equally impressed with both experiences!"
4,"Came here during COVID and it&apos;s small and SUPER PACKED! It was a Tuesday evening and had reservations at 8PM and there was still so many people waiting to be seated! We were seated about 30 mins after our reservation time. 

Aside from the long wait, the food and service was fantastic. It is expensive but the quality of the food, at least my dish, was delicious. And the bread that they served you was good! 

I got the nero taglionili (pretty sure I fudged the name) and it was delicious. Yummy chunks of lobster and the black pasta was good! 10/10 highly recommend. 

The service was also great! Our glasses of water never went below half way! Their outdoor dining setup was also beautiful. I loved the fairy lights that they had."
5,"Ugh, love love love.

I went when indoor dining was still a thing, and sat inside. All the tables were spaced out widely with plastic dividers placed in between. However, their outdoor dining area looked very nice and spacious as well!

Can we just take a moment to appreciate their bread basket? Like wow, that Stromboli is just so amazing, I feel guilty eating it for free and asking for more. Pretty sure I had three bread baskets that night, and felt bad asking for more, but the sauces that accompany and the breads themselves are amazing. 

For appetizers, I got the yellowtail and charred octopus. The yellowtail was so refreshing and clean, and was my favorite appetizer of the day. The grilled octopus was amazingly tender as well. Octopus can get really chewy when overcooked, but it was cooked to perfection and was as tender as can be!

For the main event, we ordered spaghetti, foie gras ravioli, and short rib agnolotti. All of this was definitely A LOT of food for two people (yes, it was just the ravenous couple that ate all this), but it was my first time here and wanted to try a few different things. While all of them were delicious, the spaghetti hands down was the absolutely best. I do like tomato sauce based pastas more normally, but this tomato sauce is just so clean and done well. It is the perfect balance of acidity and sweetness from the tomatoes and freshness from the basil that makes it so perfect. It truly ruined pasta for me because now I want all my pasta to taste like this. It is not your typical heavy sauce, and is so well balance and light. PLEASE do yourself a favor and get their spaghetti! (If I had to rank the pastas I had this night from best to less best: spaghetti, short rib agnolotti, foie gras ravioli) 

Unfortunately, after three bread baskets, two appetizers, and three pastas among two people, I was too full to try desserts, but I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if those were on another level as well. A must go for a nice romantic date!"
4,"We came with a group of six, 4 of which have had the vaccine so we felt totally safe and warm in the gorgeous chalet they have set up. Check in was easy and the food was delicious. My only complaint is that 90 min. Is not enough time for a table of 6. I completely understand the time limit and know restaurant are trying to stay alive, but we couldn&apos;t control the speed of the food. There was a large gap between the apps and mains. Just as our mains were delivered the waiter informed us our time was up. It all worked out but I think the restaurant needs to extend the time for
Bigger parties. We spent a lot of money and if we had more time would have def spent more."
5,"The best duck raviolis ever! Honestly, there food is soo good! There service is incredible! They are also super clean eight the new Covid restrictions. Even though I ate inside, there out door dinning was pretty cool and looked super warm. Definitely coming back!"
