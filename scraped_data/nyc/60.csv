5,"Oh my goodness. 

This is the echelon of Korean food. When I think of Korean food, I think of fried chicken, bbq, and tofu stew but this place gives you so much more. 

After hunting EVERYWHERE for marinated blue crab, this place delivered. They don&apos;t give you the meatiest of crabs, but I was so stoked they provided it at all. My fiance and I also go their seafood pancake and one of their ox stews. Anything they do here, is done with the highest quality. 

I literally had one of the most satisfying meals I have had in a really long time. 

During COVID times, they have a small area for outdoor seating that is well heated. 

I left thoroughly satisfied."
5,"Been going to this spot in KTown for years now. This small restaurant is right next to BCD Tofu House and is my go-to for most Korean food -- soondubu, dukbokki, kimchi bokkeum bap, bibimbap, etc.

In terms of COVID friendliness, they do not allow indoor dining and have quite a large outdoor dining area. There are insulated seats which are the little outdoor huts (though I personally feel like this is basically indoor dining..) and there are actual outdoor seats if you&apos;re less comfortable with that (I&apos;ve attached images of both). I ordered pickup, so I can&apos;t speak to their safety in terms of service.

In terms of taste, we got the 2 beef soondubu jjigaes, 1 dukbokki, 1 chapchae and 1 la kalbi. The soondubu is the BEST by far. The soup is extremely flavorful without the spiciness overwhelming it. The dukbokki was amazing. The sauce was very thick and much darker than any other dukbokki sauce I&apos;ve had in the US. It was very sweet and paired well with the sticky and soft rice cakes - which weren&apos;t over cooked/ too soft. 

The chapchae and kalbi were pretty standard and didn&apos;t particularly stand out, especially next to the other two dishes."

They have indoor dining in addition to outdoor dining now, though it seems most people prefer to sit outside in the tents. If you chose to dine indoors, they&apos;ll ask you to sign in on a sheet of paper with your name, phone number, body temperature (scan upon entrance), and time of arrival. Staff wear masks and gloves and hand sanitizer is provided. It&apos;s nice to see them following the proper Covid-19 safety precautions :)

Anyways, in regards to the food, the Dol Sot Bi Bim Bap and Sam Gyup Sal Gui are absolute must haves! I get them both every single time I come. The Dol Sot Bi Bim Bap is served in a sizzling stone plate which gives the rice a crunchy texture and garners the dish an entirely different taste. Comes complete with a variety of vegetables and meat or seafood of your choosing. Definitely mix everything up though, or the rice will end up sticking to the plate. Really fulfilling too for a decent price! And the Sam Gyup Sal Gui is a classic dish in any Korean BBQ place, nothing much to say there."
4,"Amazed that uber eats deliver to my place in the UES! So glad that i checked!!!
Food came warm so good for uber!
Ordered bulgogi, Sondubu jiggae soup woth seafood and Hae mol pa jung. It came with small portion of banchan.
Bulgogi and soup were as always amazingly good. Flavour, freshness. To die for. Portions were good
The pancakes was quite disappointing. Bland, not flavorful... i guess i just need to avoid ordering this lind of &quot;fried&quot;, &quot;panseared&quot; foods for deliver here since they dont come in a good shape.
I wish banchan was larger"

Taking a trip down memory lane.  Last week in NYC we stayed in Koreatown for what became another memorable experience.  Five Sense&apos;s played such a huge role in making more great memories.  ⁣
⁣
We stumbled across Five Sense&apos;s and was pleasantly surprised.⁣
⁣
We had their, Short Ribs and Pork Dumplings. ⁣
⁣
The Short Ribs came out sizzling hot, looking juicing, and scrumptious.  That they were!  Full of flavor and we just wanted MORE.  We absolutely love fried dumplings.  I can eat 100s of these suckers easy...and these were made just right.  Nicely fried with nice crispy edges and filled with pork filling.  They did it right!

3,"I am always down for Korean food and I have tried so many Korean restaurants in NYC. But I will say that the food here was just mediocre. I did not have the k-bbq experience, although they do serve that. 

They start you off with some complimentary side dishes after you order. 

I ordered the japchae. The glass noodles were savory and slightly sweet. I got it with beef for extra $2. They gave a generous amount of beef but it was a bit dry and lacked flavor. 

The servers were really polite. Food was served pretty fast too. 

Overall:
Decent price fast-casual Korean comfort food. If I do come back, I would like to try out the kbbq."
4,"This spot is great, I enjoyed this place more than other places I have tried in Koreatown! I def recommend the bibimbap on the hot stone! The rice was super crispy and delicious!"
4,"We came on a rainy Monday afternoon. There is a lot of seating in this restaurant so great for social distancing. We were seated right away and were also given a tasty hot tea. Our dishes were the spicy squid with rice and the fried chicken. I loved the side dishes that we came with our meal. The picked vegetable (green item) was mind blowing delicious, never had anything like that."
5,"Have outside seating! We came on Friday night and had to wait at least 20mins or so. To be honest It&apos;s very crowded since it&apos;s in k town and we got super basic food like kimchi jjigae soup and kimchi tofu soup for the night. They don&apos;t have Hang Jung Sal Tang Soo Yeuk $21.99 fried Berkshire pork jowl (pigs cheek) on their new menu. I ordered this last time I went before covid and it was so good that I wanted to order again but.... couldn&apos;t find it on their menu.  
I think I&apos;ll have to call next time to see if they got that on the menu before I will go again"
3,"Was hoping for a better experience because five senses had great reviews and an interesting looking menu. When my friends and I dined outside, we had 5 people and they didn&apos;t have a great set up outside to seat us comfortably. Service was friendly and good. The food was a bit overpriced and didn&apos;t taste as good as I had hoped."
4,"Wandering around the block, we chose Five Senses because of the good vibes and loud music outside.  The place looked pretty packed but luckily there was no wait.

We started off with Peach Soju and were brought our side dishes shortly after.  My friends and I devoured the side dishes and they graciously refilled it for free!  The shoyu eggs were soo good.

My friend and I both ordered the bibimbap.  It&apos;s standard bibimbap.  4/5. I was expecting the dish to come in a stone pot, but it just came in a normal bowl.  The rice came on the side rather than with the veggie/meat mix.  Well flavored and sizable portions! 

My other friend got the chicken wings and he loved it.  5/5 for the sauce.  

Overall, you can&apos;t go wrong with this place.  The service is very friendly and fast.  My favorite thing is the wide variety of yummy side dishes they give!"
1,"DONT GO! BUG FOUND IN FOOD!
I was just at Five Senses today with a friend for Christmas Eve lunch, my friend got the Budae Jigae and I got the Bulgogi Ttukbaegi Soup. However! Halfway through the Bulgogi soup, I found this HUGE, COCKROACH looking bug in the pot! I called the waitress over and she explained that it might be from the cabbage that they used... I was so shocked and grossed out by it that I just left without receiving ANY formal apology or compensation from the manager and the restaurant. Now my Christmas Eve is completely ruined by this unpleasant experience. This restaurant apparently is one of the best rated restaurants in Ktown... As much as I understand how COVID has affected many restaurants financially, the cleanliness and health standards should not be affected at all! Incredibly disappointed, would like to speak to the manager at some point. This is inexcusable."
5,"Havent had good Korean in a while, this filled in the gap.  This is a small restaurant compared to some of the others around it but you&apos;d never know once you taste the food. The meat was tender, the sides were fresh and service was great. On my must stop list next time I&apos;m in town."
4,"Very solid korean restaurant situated in the heart of ktown which allows for an immersive experience involving all five senses. I came here with a group of people and didn&apos;t have to wait too long (fortunately). We weren&apos;t able to be seated in the main tent areas and instead were pushed up against the window, which was slightly unfortunate but really didn&apos;t affect the meal too much. They cover your table with small appetizers as is customary in many korean restaurants. We tried the deokbokki (sorry for butchering the spelling of these words) which came drenched in sauce and CHEESE. YUM! Also had short ribs which were nice and tender. The korean pancake was nice and crispy on the outside and savory and flavorful on the inside. The buckwheat noodles, cold, were a great palate cleanser.

Overall, I had a good experience here. Happy that the wait here wasn&apos;t super long but that the quality of the food didn&apos;t seem to vary for the worse as a result. Will likely try again!"
5,"This place was really great! Came here a few days ago with a friend during our trip to the city. There wasn&apos;t a wait time and there was a table ready for us which was cleaned and sanitized. it is definitely a good sign when every time I want to eat here, there is always a long line.

Everyone commented on how good the food was -- better than expected!
Will be back to try the Chicken and Kamci Fried rich."
1,"My partner and I did not enjoy our food, she was told to add salt and pepper to her soup to make it better, then our server fled like the hounds of hell were chasing her...I did not get the opportunity to tell her that my meat was tough, and despite being in a soup, was drier than licking the Sahara at noon and the only flavor for my soup was spice... so I had spicy water and desert meat... And when it came time to pay the response was only one of us complained... never mind that I was completely ignored, skip that disrespect.... if a guest in your restaurant is dissatisfied you should do your best to fix it right? Not just say GFY?"
4,"We enjoyed warming soups outdoors. Love their yummy menu choices including sullung tang, bulgolgi ddukbaegi, and galbi dduk mandoo gook."
4,"Used to love this place. But maybe it&apos;s just the dishes we got this time. The soups are very plain , not very flavorful TMO . Side dishes were just alright. But love their potato salad. Kimchi has no kimchi flavor. and not a fun of that grey cake thing ."
5,"Five Senses Korea Town Manhattan 

Korean BBQ is always good to share with a friend or two. 
I been to this place a few times and the food never disappoints.
 We order, some of my favorites:
Beef Bulgogi and Dol Pan Kimchi Bokum Bap which comes on a hot plate and is rice, egg and cheese. Super Cheesy if you are cheese lover like me. 
The Beef Bulgogi is always my favorite, I just love how savory it is .
This place also, serves many of the side dishes  and you can get seconds if you want. 
For side dishes we had kimchi, string beans, glass noodles mix with veggies, pasta salad, cabbage mix with kimchi and some spicy paste that was very good to mix with the white rice they served us."
5,"I went there recently with a friend. Their ox bone soup was to die for. So many ox bone pieces. Such a good and healthy portion. 

When you walk in the have a touch-free thermometer and offer hand sanitizer in the front and on every table. They cleaned tables right after them being used. The staff was very polite. Our waiter was extremely nice to us. Probably because we spoke Spanish to him but he was very kind. Would definitely go again. 10/10"
