Should We Book It: YES 
.
Food: We ordered the sausage &amp; kale pizza with a side of brussel sprouts. The pizza was unbelievable. The crust was crispy yet soft, each bite had sausage and kale, and the cheese combination was to die for. It was not greasy, soggy, or too salty. ORDER IT. The brussel sprouts were roasted to perfection with wafu* dressing and apple slices. I wish I could explain the taste of wafu* but you have to trust me and try it. Our friends ordered the truffle pizza and Caesar salad. We didn&apos;t try their food but they were really happy with their choice. Also, they ordered drinks here and said that they were phenomenal so just know if you are contemplating whether you should order a drink... you should just do it.
.
Atmosphere: There were tables on the side walk with overhead heaters (for groups of 4) and heated chalets (for groups of 2). We sat at the table for 4 on the side walk. The overhead heaters were VERY WARM, we were pleasantly surprised. The service was great! No complaints. BTW the restaurant looked beautiful inside so make sure you check it out! 
. 
Ideal party size: 4 - This is a great restaurant to bring your family. Our outdoor set up was perfect for a group of 4. Make a reservation before you go!
.
Overall great experience at Upland!

5,"The food is just as incredible as it was pre-pandemic. I used to come every month for brunch because it has something for everyone. They have pivoted perfectly to outdoors with enclosed cabins and some outdoor tables with heat lamps. 

You can never go wrong with their pizza, pasta or burgers. I also love the gem salad and the Brussels sprouts are surprisingly addictive. 

Wishing you all the best and can&apos;t wait to come again!"
5,"A beautiful interior! 

Staff is so welcoming, and made indoor dining as comfortable for us as possible.

They have an extensive--even a little intimidating--wine list, but our server had plenty of suggestions.

Spaghetti Pomodoro was excellent (and travels well!)"
4,"I made reservations at 8:30 - please note that during COVID times and NYC mandate, since all restaurants need to close at 10pm, the latest you can be seated is 8:30 to account for ordering time and eating time. 

We reserved a time to eat at the greenhouse huts - while there isn&apos;t a heat lamp inside, the &quot;indoor&quot; hut provided some relieve from the cold. It was 45 degrees out and I was able to take my jacket off. 

We ordered the gem salad, truffles pizza and cheeseburger. I had the junmai sangria and my partner the IPA. We both enjoyed the food. 

I will definitely come here again."
4,"Upland was near by hotel and I had always wanted to try this restaurant so I decided to go for dinner. 

My boyfriend and I ordered the bucatini and the pappardelle. Both pastas as seen in the pictures. The waiter suggested the bucatini as their most popular dish so I chose that one. Honestly, the pappardelle pasta dish was much better in my opinion. Very tasty and I loved it. The bucatini was good but the pasta was on the hard side. I would imagine it was not suppose to be that hard. It was probably over cooked but besides that it did have a nice flavor. Overall dinner was good but I wouldn&apos;t chose or crave to go back for dinner."
4,"This place is down the street from where I live. I&apos;ve always wanted to try it, so my husband, his family, and I came here. We dined inside (which they follow strict protocol). For drinks, I had the Hot Toasty Orchard, which is hot but has a great autumn orchard fragrance with spice. Then, I had the Valentina, it was light and refreshing. 

For appetizer, we shared Little Gem Salad  (avocado, cucumber, ricotta salata + walnut vinaigrette) the salad had the right amount of ratio and citrus. I just wanted more, I would totally come back for this salad. I wish the dish had options of chicken or shrimp, it would pair well. 

For dinner, Lobster Spaghetti (meyer lemon and chive), this dish was semi-alright, personally I would put lobster with pasta/ red sauce. Lobster is a delicate shell fish, which should be represented like the angus steak or the whole Bronzino. My husband got the angus steak, he really enjoyed it. Overall, we would be back and recommended this place to others! Cheers!"
4,"The food at Upland is very good but here&apos;s what I can&apos;t stand - when the brunch dishes don&apos;t come with anything (like an omelet with no potatoes). All the sides you have to order in addition to what you&apos;re getting. I had the quiche and it was fantastic. We also ordered fries, bacon, and sausage for the table. The sausage was awesome. 

For dessert we got the donuts because apparently that&apos;s the thing to get at Upland. They were fine, I don&apos;t get what the hype is all about but it was a nice sweet ending to brunch. As expected, the service was really good."
4,"Have been coming to Upland for a few years and as always they delivered on the food. You can&apos;t go wrong with any of the pizzas (great starter for a group of 4), the crispy thin crust pies are full of flavor. The cacio e pepe is a perfectly simple, and the chicken was cooked perfectly. They even brought us a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream with our lemon cake for our anniversary, nice touch. Our waiter was super attentive, friendly and helpful.

While the food is always delicious and hits the spot with the variety, along with well made drinks, the outdoor ambiance we got was distracting and a bit uncomfortable which is what led to the loss of star. There&apos;s scaffolding covering the sidewalk (of no fault of their own of course), but our table was right next to the unassuming, unclear entrance, which led people to stop and hover in front of our table because they were unaware of where to walk to check in. It was a constant distraction throughout the meal to what was supposed to be our romantic anniversary dinner. We asked for accommodation but were told they were fully booked (despite two tables being empty our entire stay).

For the sake of the diners you put right next to the entrance, I&apos;d suggest more clear signage of how/where to check in. Will be back for sure, but will wait until indoor dining is back."
5,"Have eaten here multiple times everything is excellent. Recently order pizza and it was so delicious! Received the delivery piping hot, I loved the oil pools in the pizza."
4,Made a delivery order from Upland during Restaurant Week 2021 and it was mostly good. The Pizza with the Side Little Gem Salad was great and the Salmon was flavorful. The Flank Steak though was a bit tough (and not the medium rare that we had asked for) and wasn&apos;t a very big portion.
4,"Came here for weekend brunch and they have a pretty comfortable outdoor seating area. They are taking COVID pretty seriously and checking temperature before dining. Food-wise it was just ok, it&apos;s good but nothing that stands out, and at higher prices than other places. Service is friendly and professional though.

Eggs in Hell: ingredients are pretty fresh, but it felt like just tomato and eggs with not much else. Eggs were done well though, with a runny yolk in the center

Overall it&apos;s a good spot if you need something standard that won&apos;t disappoint."
2,"Not sure what has happened since Covid hit and I sympathize for the entire hospitality industry, but Upland was sadly disappointing. I&apos;ve been waiting for nyc to open up indoor dining and once Upland was available I booked to dine in. The restaurant itself hasn&apos;t changed except for implementing very strict covid restrictions. I received three phone calls after I booked online asking for my personal information and you need to pass screened temperature checks upon entering. The Covid part I get, it&apos;s something we have to do and is the new normal and part of the ambience now. My issue was the overall food and service. 

Drinks- weak and watered down. 
The bread- if you read my last review this bread was amazing. The portion of bread is now smaller and not hot out the oven. You also have to ask for it multiple times. 
The little gem salad everyone raves about was not the same as before. Dressing was sour and the ricotta slaw was not fresh and stingy. 
The branzino- much smaller portion than before and full of bones. Not cleaned well and served a bit cold.. not good. 
The potatoes- they are gone!!! They have the side on the menu but don&apos;t be deceived they are not the same fat crispy oven baked potatoes as before. We got 10 small golden potatoes, tasteless. 
The mushroom dish- no longer available 
Lobster spaghetti- forgettable 
Brussel sprouts side- good, but served cold. 

Not sure why the food was cold when the restaurant had only 25% capacity, but the portions were smaller or the dishes completely changed and they don&apos;t tell you. 

Desert- pass! We ordered the cookies last time that were large and warm right out of the oven. This time, smaller and not warm. 
Ice cream sundae- by far the worst sundae I have ever had. It was served in a small dish with a mini scooop of ice cream.Smaller than a kids serving. One random piece of banana and some whip cream. Sad. 

Anyways, I hope upland can recover."
5,"What a fun and energetic atmosphere! I was feeling New York City during our dinner here. The interior was breathtaking with jars of lemon on racks and racks and racks, as well as bottles of wine and glassware on display. I loved the tall glass windows that gave a clear view of the dining room from the outside and vice versa. It&apos;s definitely the place to be seen in Manhattan and no surprise there as it&apos;s birthed from Stephen Starr&apos;s restaurant group where Morimoto, Buddakan, and The Clocktower, among many hailed from.

Having ordered 3 things here, I shall explain how each of them elevated my sense of taste one dish after another. 

Bbq Point Judith Squid was a dish with grilled squid that looked deceivingly over charred. It was melt-in-your-mouth-tender with a very pleasant smoked flavor. Paired with cabbage and pickled cauliflower, it worked like magic. 

I had the hankering for a pasta dish and the Spaghettini was a great choice. It was subtle yet loaded with flavor, does it make sense? You can taste a hint of the ocean from the bottarga di muggine. One bite and I knew there&apos;s no stopping, I just couldn&apos;t. I didn&apos;t want to. 

And the piece de resistance, Shrimp + Rice. Grilled huge and uber fresh pacific prawns that were sweet and juicy, paired with crispy cast iron rice you can and should eat with mouthwatering garlic aioli. Damn. 

I&apos;m so happy the celebrant picked this place for dinner. Too many great things to be had, it felt like it was also my birthday! 


Review #900"
5,"Yet another top notch find by my social savvy daughter.   So nice to resume indoor dining in NYC.    Wonderful lunch sharing a Little Gem salad (awesome dressing and cheese.. highly recommended), then a perfectly delivered Upland Cheeseburger (one of the best burgers I&apos;ve had in quite a while).    My daughter had a truffle pizza... very filling and delicious... yielding high quality leftovers.    It&apos;s a place my very discerning wife will enjoy... we&apos;ll be back.."
5,"This review is specifically for Mark the waiter... he is amazing! So upbeat and made the &quot;Upland experience&quot; amazing. He knew the menu in and out and was able to help us pick the best food and drinks. He even called over a sommelier to chat about wine. The food was great, too. I&apos;ll be back! Give Mark a raise!"
1,"Tried Upland for the first time and was very disappointed. The steak was burnt (requested medium), the side of potatoes included 6 potatoes, and they forgot to include the salad that was ordered."
3,"So sad as we were told they were out of their Fried Mushrooms on Sunday evening. 

On another note some dishes were a bit on the salty side, ie: Mushroom Pizza(just because we couldn&apos;t get the fried mushroom), Upland Cippino -- seafood in tomato broth.

Just to go over a few more items on the table, my fave were the Fried Duck Wings and Brioche Bread(on the house). Also shared a couple of pastas -- I can only recall the Bucatini Cacio E Pepe tossed in a thick rich creamy peppery sauce. On the side a hefty portioned Roasted Beets and Carrots. Small selection on the dessert menu -- Mixed Berry Sorbet was surprisingly refreshing, Anjou Pear Crisp served warm topped off with tasty crunchy cinnamon oats.

Overall, atmosphere is romantic and intimate. Service was smooth and they have a nice wine list."
5,"Time Visited: 11am Wednesday
Wait Time: None as we made a reservation

There are sections of the menu that are solely devoted to pizza and pasta while just about every type of protein as well. PRO TIP is that the sections are quite large so a pizza can probably be split between 2-3 people. A friend and I split the green zebra pizza and the quiche and we had enough leftover for a third person to have helped us out. The crust of the pizza was thin, fluffy, and slightly crispy!

The food was great but it is the space and vibe of the area that truly make this spot stand out. With hardwood floors and high ceilings the place has a very wholesome &quot;California feel&quot;. The back has illuminated preserved lemons in big glass jars that make for a great picture."
4,"Beautiful restaurant, great options from cocktails, wine and appetizers. We split the beef tartar and while my husband was fine, my tummy was pretty upset for the rest of the night. Granted this was my first time having it and I know everyone reacts differently to it so that&apos;s not their fault. For the price I expected more from my entree though. It was very good I just wasn&apos;t blown out of the park over it. Overall, very nice night."
5,"The other day someone asked my what my last meals would be if I had to leave nyc forever and I included Upland in the list. New American is one of my favorite cuisines and after coming here twice and trying an abundance of dishes, I feel like I can say with confidence that you can&apos;t go wrong with anything. Even the bread they bring out in the beginning is some of the best I&apos;ve tasted: soft, warm, buttery, almost crossaint-like, except in loaf form.  This time, we went with the duck wings (one of my all time favorites), the steak, the cacio e pepe, the kale and sausage pizza (A MUST), the potatoes, and the little gem salad. There were four of us and we ate it all. No leftovers. I associate coming here with celebrations because it&apos;s such a treat and if you know me, you probably have already heard me talk your ear off about how good it is."
