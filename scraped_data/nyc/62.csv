4,"I can&apos;t believe I haven&apos;t written a review for this place.  
* Location not currently open, visit 15th St by Union Square *
My obsession with their sushi burrito started early 2016 after seeing a video on Food Insider a few months prior and now I&apos;ve visited locations in six states along with almost any other sushi burrito place I can find!    Fresh, healthy, not outrageously priced, and at first it was very clean.  I mean there was a line out the door in cold weather so they were doing something right.  
This is definitely a smaller location but it&apos;s where it all started.   After the initial rush the wait times were leveling out at about 15-25 mins during lunch.  When the weather is nice it doesn&apos;t seem so long.  
This is a typical Chipotle / PIada / BIbibop style restaurant.  So you choose the style (burrito, bowl, salad, or noodles) then choose protein then toppings and sauces.   They even have crunchy topping choices which adds an extra layer of yum!   The only difference between a sizes is you get one more choice of protein in the larger one, only two come in the regular size.  The kale noodles were not available in the beginning but are actually much better than I anticipated.   I still lean towards the bowl or burrito though.  The ingredients were always fresh but the cleanliness of the restaurant had started going downhill I&apos;d say after the first year or so.  To enter you file into the restaurant on your left as you walk in then double back to start ordering so you will most likely feel like you&apos;re in a crowded elevator the whole time.  I only say this for non-NYC residents who might not be used to standing in a crowded line just to grab food.  The employees are friendly and patient with newcomers.  Your best bet is to take your food to go because there is very little seating.   Plus the available seating is near the door so you will constantly have people walking by you.  You could always head over to Bryant Park to enjoy your food.  I won&apos;t go into individual ingredients because you will have to just pick and choose what you like.   I do feel like the burritos are not as stuffed as the video made them seem and the bowls are slightly smaller than some other Poké places I&apos;ve been to but there is still plenty in there to fill you up as long as you&apos;re not one of those people that just picks one or two toppings.  If you are then ask for extra but you&apos;re totally missing out on more flavor in my opinion.  They do charge extra for avocado which is typical in some places but I have found several that do not charge for that.  Overall this is a great place for a bite to eat!
** The location by Grand Central (also temporarily closed but just in case you&apos;re planning a future vacation) has steps to get inside so if you have someone in your party that has difficulty with stairs then you might want to try a different location **"
4,"I was pretty exited to see pokework on mealpal. Pokework is one my favorite poke in the city. So I decide to try it with mealpal
Came to pick up my mealpal  during lunch.
No wait needed, pick up and go.
It was about half size of regular portion. 
Taste decent. But definitely build your own was way better.
I think I will just pay regular price to get my own poke next time."
4,"Pokeworks was the first poke place I ever tried and that&apos;s really when my poke obsession started. It&apos;s been a while since I&apos;ve been here and since we were in the area, we figured why not!
I decided to do the Large Poke Bowl (~$15) which included 3 proteins. I started off with organic brown rice and for my 3 proteins, I chose salmon, tuna, and shrimp. For my mix-ins, I went with a little bit of sweet onions and cucumbers. For my sauces, I got a mix of Sriracha Aioli and Wasabi Aioli. If you like a more creamy texture, I definitely recommend that combination.  For toppings, I got seaweed salad, surimi (crab) salad, avocado (+$1.50), green onions, and masago. I finally topped it off with a little bit of crunch with garlic crisps and onion crisps.
My bowl came out to ~$17 which is super expensive for a single poke bowl. Especially with all the competition out there now, Pokeworks isn&apos;t doing anything particularly special. It was filling and the ingredients were fresh but I know I can get something similar and at a few dollars less.
I also redeemed Yelp&apos;s check-in offer of a free fountain drink. They have 4 organic drinks: black tea, lemonade, stone fruit, and strawberry rhubarb. None of them really stood out to me, to be honest.
They were also out of some sauces, toppings, cups, and miso soup which seemed strange considering it was only around 4pm when we went.
Pokeworks isn&apos;t the same as what it used to be before and it seems like they&apos;re just trying to stay afloat. It was cool to come back to the first poke spot I ever had but I know I&apos;d get a better bang for my buck elsewhere."
5,"I LOVE Pokeworks. The fish is fresh, there are many options, and the poke bowls are delicious.  I always &quot;build my own&quot; with &quot;three scoops&quot; of fresh salmon! There are several options for mix-ins, sauces, and crunch. Yum! 

I will keep coming back for more!"
5,Very small store so expect to get squished in around lunch. Theres maybe 5 or 6 stools to eat at but Bryant Park is right around the corner. Great fresh food and friendly staff. Fast and simple.
4,"A pretty decent poke store. I got one of their signature works as I&apos;m terrible at deciding what I get for the make your own poke. I got the Spicy Ahi which comes with ahi tuna, green and sweet onion, cucumber, masago, sesame seeds, and sriracha aioli. I also got orange slices added to it as they told me I could add other stuff to it. I got the Sweet Chili Gochujang for the sauce. It&apos;s a pretty tasty and healthy serving for a pretty reasonable price.

Don&apos;t forget to check in to get a free organic craft beverage with your poke! I&apos;d definitely would like to come back to try out the sushi burrito."
3,"The competition for great poke is fierce in Manhattan.  There&apos;s seemingly a poke joint every couple of blocks.  Pokeworks is one of several poke specialists in the Grand Central area.  I&apos;ve been here for lunch a couple of times, and I think it&apos;s just ok.  The food itself is pretty good and they offer a lot of toppings options.  However, I think the portion sizes are small and the prices are high.  It&apos;s $15 for a standard &quot;large&quot; poke bowl before any add-ons.  And by large, I mean normal size.  Sons of Thunder and Poketeria are better options in the area if you&apos;re in the mood for poke."
5,"I love poke. This was a great lunch. It&apos;s pretty crowded, but the line moves very quickly. Everything seemed fresh and service was quick.

It was crowded, so you can&apos;t expect to always eat there. However it was raining when I was there so I squeezed into a counter seat."
3,"A tried-and-true poke spot that&apos;s slowly losing it&apos;s novelty with all the other up-and-coming poke restaurants. 

Had many of their bowls, but now really only getting them through MealPal since it&apos;s slightly cheaper. Quality of the MealPal is slightly lower since it&apos;s not made to order and the portions are also less. However, still a good option amongst the other MealPal spots. In terms of their regular menu, IMO the quality seems to have gone a bit down since I&apos;ve initially tried it. I like how they blend the proteins with the sauce and mix-in the other toppings so that there&apos;s less mixing on your part. Not much to complain about other than the relatively high prices and small portions, but then again this is Manhattan. 

Overall, due to the long lines I&apos;ve encountered, I&apos;ve opted for online ordering through their app. Most of the time, they&apos;re not prepared at the designated time--understandable since many times the line is to the door. This is also one of the reasons I&apos;ve switched to MealPal since the meals are typically ready and sitting there near the register. I would give this 3.5 stars if I could based on my experiences overall (0.5 down due to the reasons above, and since Yelp only allows whole #&apos;s)."
4,"You will never catch me saying the name right but you&apos;ll always find me wanting to eat there. I love Pokeworks. I found it on thrillist about a year ago. It was a Facebook page that showed all the newest places to eat in New York. Correction, Instagram worthy places they were showing. It&apos;s there where I saw the sushi burrito and I was like I must have it. 

I love sushi and I love burritos so there was no way I was passing up a chance to try the two in one. I slowly became obsessed but then finally stopped eating it all together. I switch to getting bowls a few times after I had burrito when I saw someone get it. Then I took a break from going there. After a long hiatus I came back and a lot had change with there menu as well as price. Mainly price, which is now why I get them once in a blue moon. To be honest it&apos;s not worth $13. I paid 10 and would get avocado to make it $11.50. Now it&apos;s just too costly for my budget. 

If you don&apos;t care about price then you should definitely stop by there. I go to the same one every time. Near herald square on 34th st in New York. It&apos;s right around the corner of Chick-Fila. 

Today my boss treated me to lunch because we had a crazy work day and I held our store together by myself. So when he said I&apos;m treating to lunch I was like let&apos;s do Pokeworks. I did a custom bowl, 2 protein option. I always get salmon and scallop as my protein. I don&apos;t know why I don&apos;t try something else really. I think it&apos;s because I love salmon and I don&apos;t have scallops often. I got mixed greens, rice, salmon, scallops, jalapeño pepper, cucumbers, edamame, mango, kale, chive. As my sauce I wanted spicy mayo. I wanted light on the sauce but I realize in life you don&apos;t always get what you want. The young lady and man that was helping me was very pleasant.

As far as the place goes, it&apos;s is clean and quite. It is small set up because honestly it&apos;s a grab and go kinda of restaurant. There is no seating area in this location. They have a bar style wall with four chairs. However, this isn&apos;t always ideal when you want to just sit and eat. So, be sure you have somewhere you can go to eat. If not you&apos;ll be stuck standing eating. 

Overall I really enjoy the food but it&apos;s no longer my go to when I&apos;m hungry because for me the price is just to high. I am currently trying to eat out only on occasions and cook more at home. However, like I stated before if you don&apos;t mind the price go for it. It&apos;s definitely worth trying out."
4,"Music blaring from the kitchen clashed with music in dining area. Really unhelpful staff in house. Burritos tasted good (only reason they got 2 stars not) although really uneven distribution  of toppings inside.

Management was very helpful and friendly when concern was expressed. Very nice to see dedication from the top down."
3,Wow were the portions small! I stopped by for lunch and ordered for pick up online. I arrived and still had to wait at least 10 minutes for my food. There was a long line of customers ordering poke. It&apos;s understandable they were overwhelmed by the influx of customers but my order was missing toppings. The portions were slightly disappointing and the rice was hard. I&apos;ve been to this location before at an emptier time and felt the portions were more generous. 3 stars for inconsistency.
5,"This is one of the first Poke restaurant in NYC and the hype around this place when it first opened was unreal. While the hype has died down because there are poke restaurants everywhere in the city now, this place still delivers good poke. This place is in a densely populated area but its not too insanely busy during lunch hours if you want to come for lunch (I came around 2pm yesterday and was there was no one in there). 

The poke here is GOOD. Its still delicious as I&apos;ve remembered. The girls that worked there gave me a healthy portion and didn&apos;t skim when I asked for every topping to be put into my bowl. 

For the area this is what you would pay anywhere else for lunch. Its about $12-$15 depending on the size you get. It&apos;s a lot for poke but thats what poke cost. This is a solid place and you won&apos;t regret coming. Solid fish and rice."
4,"Although I had an overall good experience the first time. The restaurant manager, Christopher,  reached out to me to come back and try Pokeworks again since something had felt off the first time. I can&apos;t say how happy I am to have come back. I built my own bowl and it was delicious ! All the toppings and protein were fresh! I really enjoyed my bowl, especially the kale noodles! I will definitely return again!"
4,"I have a poke addiction. And pokeworks does a good job feeding that addiction. This place gets pretty crowded at lunch so try to go during off peak hours if you don&apos;t want to wait in line.
TIP: Check in with Yelp for a free bowl of miso soup. What&apos;s even cooler is that the miso soup comes out of a miso soup machine! Just press a button and the soup will come out. 
There is no limit to the number of toppings you can get, which makes me like Pokeworks so much. There are also so many options to keep even the pickiest eater happy. The quality is excellent too."
3,For a quick to go meal that feels healthy this is the spot. I do however feel that my protein was lacking. I got a bowl with salmon and no other protein. Afterwards I found out that you were suppose to pick two proteins. I would have thought that they would have just doubled my protein. The wasabi aioli sauce was very tasty. There are only 5 seats at a counter so I would suggest taking it to go and sitting at the park.
4,"Conveniently located near Bryant Park, it&apos;s my go to poke spot for when I want something to eat while people watching and attending events 0in Bryant Park. 

The interior is clean but smaller than the other poke stores/chains I&apos;ve been to. There&apos;s about 6 bar stools in the front of the store. The staff are always welcoming and happy to introduce the concept of poke to people who has never had it before. 

The menu options are pretty much the standard ones you&apos;d find in any poke store but I wish they had zucchini noodles and different sized portions (like a snack size) too. The regular portion they have also actually feels smaller than a similarly priced option at other chains. 

They have a good drink selection by the register with fruit based juices like passion fruit &amp; orange and lychee. They do have a water dispenser by the utensils in the front so that&apos;s a plus. 

Overall a solid poke place with friendly faces and a good selection of toppings."
4,"I haven&apos;t been to Pokeworks before so as we were waiting for the Anime store nearby to open, I ordered a poke bowl to go. 

The store has quite a number of toppings to choose. My favorite ones include: 

- Orange slices, mango, cucumber, edamame, seaweed salad, masago, garlic crisps, toasted rice puffs.
- The Umami Shoyu sauce was pretty good. I want to try the Sirarcha Aioli next time.
- The ahi tuna was good , along with the salmon. There were a few salmon pieces that were a little fatty to me, though.

What I would not recommend:
- Brown rice as a base. They totally messed this one up. The rice was hard as if it has been out and left over from the previous day. It was completely not edible.
- The two seaweeds from the Mix-ins. They were dry seaweeds that were very tough to chew. My jaw hurts from processing these the whole time. Just leave them out.

Overall, I enjoyed my poke. But that brown rice has got to go."
5,"Lots of poke spots around town. I used to regular he one at urban outfitters but my gosh...This one is hands down the BEST. The number of reviews and pictures speaks for itself. It also has a longer line so don&apos;t expect it to be a quick stop. Worth the wait though...

I also love that they ask how much sauce you want..tip: get the lotus chip!!"
3,"One of the many poke places that have opened up the past two years.  It&apos;s probably the biggest of the chains, but not my favorite.  For what you get, it&apos;s a bit pricey.  And the bowl always feels a bit &quot;cold&quot; to me.  Multiple times I&apos;ve been here and the rice has been a bit too firm, which ruins the experience of this nice soft chewy bowl.

The sauces are decent and the fish options seem fresh.  I do wish there were more interesting toppings available.

The good thing about this location is that it is near Bryant Park so you can take your poke bowl to eat while you people watch in Bryant Park.

My favorite poke place remains Red Poke."
