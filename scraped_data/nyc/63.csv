5,Cute little coffee place that really makes you feel like you&apos;re on an episode of Friends. They have nice seasonal drinks and it is a great stop on the way to work to make my day go from 0-100 (before the pandemic took over of course)
5,Quick and delicious. The brown sugar latte was bursting with flavor but not too sweet at all! Croissants were great. We will be back!
4,"This place had probably the strongest matcha latte I have had. My friend said her coffee was strong too. A cute little shop. No line when we went so super quick in and out.
They have alternative milks."
4,"Let me tell you, Perk Kafe was definitely epic. Nice, welcoming and moderately priced. Pretty much every item that we ordered was extra fresh and yummy. The service was also amazing and every one was charming. A+ for Perk Kafe."
1,"Came here with a friend for coffee and it was not a pleasant experience. The barista was extremely unfriendly and was half wearing a mask on their face. They did not welcome us or interact with us in any positive way. We felt like a bother to him. 

There are 20-30 other coffee places in Murray Hill I would recommend. This is not one of them. I won&apos;t be going back."
4,"Came back to New York and stayed in this area for 2 weeks, Perk became my  local cafe where I picked up an americano and pastries ever day. I love their coffee but mostly their raisin pastry. There are a few outdoor seats as well."
5,"The best latte we&apos;ve had in NYC, hands down!!!!!

We&apos;ve decided to give Perk a try after reading so many great reviews about this place. Upon walking in, I was a bit disappointed to see how tiny the place is, thinking we might have to look for another coffee shop that&apos;s bigger, where we can actually stay for couple hours to do some studying. Lucky for us, there was an empty bench by the door. We decided to sit there while I searched for the next coffee shop. Well, that plan didn&apos;t last long when we both took the first sip of the latte and agreed it was freaking delicious, enough for us to wait it out for someone to leave just so we could order another cup later lol. 

The whole coffee shop probably has about 15 seats altogether. There&apos;s one big community table right in the middle, maybe 2 small tables that could fit 2 people, and couple stools facing the street. Even tho the place is tiny, everyone from the owner to the patrons are extremely nice and friendly. We all knew not to take up too much space with all our stuff laying out, and no one was taking a whole small table to themself either. .5 star for atmosphere

We got to try a couple latte plus pastries. I can&apos;t say enough how good their latte is. You just have to try it for yourself. The pastries we had were also good. They don&apos;t offer any savory options, but that&apos;s really not a deal breaker at all. 3 stars for quality and latte art.

We did stayed for a little over 2 hours right until 5mins before they closed. The owner was so nice to offer my SO an almond croissant free of charge right before we left. He said they were closing for the night and weren&apos;t going to keep any of the pastries, but turned out, my SO expressed interest in an almond croissant earlier, but decided to go with a healthier option instead. We were both surprised he kept notice and so nice to offer us freebie. 1 star

Don&apos;t let the small shop deter you. It really is a hidden gem and offers the best coffee in NYC (at least out of the 3, 4 places we have been to so far here). We will definitely come back next time we are in town again.

This is the break down of my rating for coffee shops:
 Offering latte art consistently: 1 star
 Quality of coffee/drinks/food: up to 2 stars
 Atmosphere: 1 star
 Customer service: 1 star"
5,"Tiny little whole in the wall making incredible coffee drinks. They only serve beans from Stumptown (a Portland based company). 

We ordered the seasonal brown sugar cinnamon latte and mocha, both iced. They were not too sweet making it easy to taste the coffee. The mocha had tiny shavings of chocolate, it was reminiscent of a coffee dessert, so yummy!

Extra bonus points to Perk for having oat milk and paper straws!

I&apos;ll be back next time I&apos;m in the city."
4,Standard coffee in Manhattan. Not too pricey. Spot is cute. They kept social distancing and capacity well. We got a large coffee and it was good.
5,This place was walking distance from my hotel while visiting nyc! It was a prefect little coffee shop exactly what I needed in the morning before starting my day! They have special holiday lattes along with that they have the regular coffee and lattes as well. They don&apos;t have a oven so the pastries that they have will not be warm! But still very delicious. They don&apos;t have a full breakfast menu this is only good for morning drinks. They have seating available but it&apos;s very small. Cute place to visit if you are on this side of town.
3,"Cute little coffee shop in Murray hill. Menu is a little expert friendly as it doesn&apos;t specifically state that you can get cappuccinos, flat whites, etc but when I asked the drinks were happily made by the barista. 

They also sell regular drip coffee but the large isn&apos;t large enough for me, personally (i usually drink 1/4th of a pot at home) and it&apos;s only $1 less (if memory serves) so why not splurge and late it up?

I also grabbed a ham and cheese croissant which was delicious going down but upset my stomach within 10 minutes of eating - i&apos;m not sure if this was a cleanliness issue on the shop or i picked up some good old nyc dirt before eating it"
4,"This was a cute cafe and was convenient when we happened upon it downtown. It&apos;s small and a bit elitist, but the prices are pretty competitive with the usual high-end coffee shop. 
They also have sustainable products which is nice. 
My family got regular - drip - coffee and I got a dirty chai with oat milk. All of us enjoyed our drinks. 
I&apos;d stop through again."
5,Stumptown coffee offered - strong and good! A lot of alternative milk available. Commute table available for you to read/talk.
4,Really cute hole in the wall coffee shop in Murray Hill close to where my spouse has occupational therapy at NYU. Not a super fan of Stumptown coffee ( I like darker roast coffees) but it was cozy and a good place to unwind. The ham and cheese croissant was delicious and they have free wifi if you&apos;re into that. Service is friendly and the bathroom was clean as well.
4,"Was in the area one Saturday and decided to stop in, as it&apos;s one of the most highly-rated coffee shops in the neighborhood. I opted for an iced honey almond latte, which was really good. Not too sweet, which I prefer."
4,"Wow after my Yelp post I got a email. 

Hi Jem,

Thanks for reaching out to us and letting us know of the unpleasant experience you had on Dec 27th.  I was away for the holidays and immediately looked into this when I returned last week. 

This was not the first time we had complaints about the barista that you encountered. We put him on a program to improve his interaction with customers and it appears that it is not working. Thanks for letting us know since many employees tend to be on their best behavior when the owners are around but revert to their old ways when we are not. After speaking to other employees here about his recent behavior, we parted ways with him yesterday. Again, I apologize for the poor experience.....

Thanks Joel and Perk team for caring about your customers!  See y&apos;all soon!"
5,"This is probably my favorite coffee destination on the upper east so occasionally I&apos;ll pop into this midtown location (I think the OG perk) for an americano. They make a great tasting americano from stumptown blends. Their pastries aren&apos;t bad, a selection of colson/dough and other outsourced bakeries.

The space is cozy, but enough for 15 people so I was able to chill by the window front. I could see myself relaxing here on a day off and people watching in this quiet part of gramercy/midtown south. 

Now I just need a day off..."
4,"Needed a quick and easily accessible caffeine fix and found this place via Yelp. They offer all the basics as well as some specialty drinks like a honey latte and such. 

Went with a cold brew with oat milk which was excellent. In addition to oat, they offer almond and soy milks.

It&apos;s a small spot and all the seats were occupied when we went, by both people camping out with their laptops to work as well as those socially grabbing a coffee with friends.

Prices are extremely reasonable. A cold brew with oat milk and latte came out to just a little over $8, which sadly I find is closer to the price of one specialty latte in NY/LA."
5,This is a small coffee shop in east Manhattan. I ordered the iced expresso and it was good. Didn&apos;t get to try their pastries but there is always a next time. The barista was really friendly. Had a great time.
4,"Convenient coffee joint in the neighborhood. The chai tea latte is ok, nothing special. It&apos;s a tiny place and gets crowded easily."
