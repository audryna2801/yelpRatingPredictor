5,"Dhaba is my favorite Indian place in the murray hill area. The experience in the restaurant is just ok, nothing special, but the food is absolutely delicious and our go to for takeout. Their food is consistent and I&apos;m always willing to go back for more!

5,"Went here to celebrate my birthday back in Sept and had such a lovely time!!! I absolutely love this place. Everything from the food and the service is top notch-- so much so that it has been deemed New York Times worthy (don&apos;t believe me? check out their feature on the NYT!) Plus, I could tell this place is well-loved because the people coming in and out for take out or delivery was NONSTOP during the whole duration of my visit. So I think it&apos;s safe to say that this place is prettty popping. 

Ordered a bunch of dishes per the help of our friendly waiter, including kebabs, samosas, a spinach dish and a goat dish. Everything was super flavorful &amp; very filling! Make sure to have your meal with a mango lassi (trust me, you&apos;ll thank me later...) 

In terms of covid precautions, I felt very safe dining here. The place is very small--they have only 3 tables for outdoor dining so best to make a reservation ahead of time. But their takeout is alive and kicking which serves as a safe option if you don&apos;t want Covid to get in your way of good Indian food. 

All in all,  I would 100% come back to eat here. I&apos;m already looking forward to it. Thanks for a great visit, Dhaba!"
5,Our top take-out spot for Indian food. We love it - especially the chicken tikki masala.
5,"Great indian place! I ordered the lunch special of Lamb Vindaloo and Chicken Tikka Masala -

The Chicken Tikka Masala was 100% perfect! Great taste very creamy, great portions of meat and SAUCE. And the chicken wasn&apos;t dry like other places.

The Lamb Vindaloo&apos;s meat was very tender and good too. Only thing is the sauce is a little bit too vinegary/watery. BUT I added some creamy chicken tikka masala sauce into the lamb vindaloo and mixed it - And it was perfect afterwards!

The Naan was also very good, would be amazing if it was slightly more crispy.

Overall very happy with the quality of food."
4,"My order delivered via Uber eats was delicious, reasonably priced, and a good portion!

The menu has plenty of good vegan and vegetarian dishes, which is what enticed me.

We both ordered the vegan tawa aloo gobi. It was really delicious and a large, but manageable portion. It came with perfectly prepared jasmine rice. We order Indian regularly and I&apos;ll say that their garlic naan, that we ordered on the side, was a larger portion than average. 

Our food was very good and was pretty easy on the tummy, which is great because Indian food can be pretty buttery and heavy. I&apos;d definitely order again!"
4,"Food = 5 stars
Service = 3.5 stars

This visit was off to a rocky start for me as I had an OpenTable reservation that couldn&apos;t be found in the restaurant&apos;s system. There were many available tables when we went (Sunday 6:30 pm), so it worked out. I wasn&apos;t provided with any sort of explanation of why my reservation might not be there when I was able to pull it up on my phone, etc. The food made up for this snag. 

Lychee martini: strong vodka flavor, hint of lychee, enjoyed it. Took a while for it to arrive (nearly 20 minutes) which was weird because the restaurant wasn&apos;t crowded at this time. 

Vada Pao (potato ball butterbuns): Ok but a lot of starch in one go (essentially a potato sandwich) - I&apos;d recommend trying one of the other vegetable versions or something meat-based. I did enjoy the buttery taste of the bread. 

Chicken Tikka Masala: Excellent, moist chicken.  I would love to be able to order the sauce on its own to dip naan in - it&apos;s that good. 

Kadai Goat: This was a more sporadic decision (based on the New York Times review at the back of the menu), but a good one. I&apos;d recommend, but not if meat still on the bone bothers you.

Garlic naan: So good, so garlicky.

We&apos;ll be back!"
3,"The lunch buffet over the weekdays is good choice. They give a small bite fir the table and latter serve hot tandoori in the plate when we order buffet lunch. 
The food was fine . Service was good . Ambiance is good.
Dessert had sushi halwa - it was good"
5,"Delicious spot for curry! I went for vegetable phaal, from the &quot;British curry&quot; section of the menu, because I love being able to pair the main ingredient of choice (vegetable or meat) with different types of curry. The phaal is labeled as being &quot;very very spicy&quot; and they are not kidding! It is hot. Not too hot to eat, but getting there. I also had the chili onion naan which was delicious and only mildly spicy. Next time I really want to try the tale hay kaju appetizer (spicy roasted cashews)."
3,"Their Indian lunch buffet seems to be a favorite for office workers in the area. On any given weekday around noon you can expect a line of people eagerly waiting to scoop saag paneer, chicken tikka masala, and gobi manchurian onto their plates. It&apos;s a very quick meal since the food is already prepared and laid out in front of you.

There are about 8 different dishes on offer, not including the naan and tandoori chicken they pass out once you&apos;re seated. I really wish the dishes were labeled, but if you&apos;re familiar with Indian food you&apos;ll have no trouble identifying most of the dishes. I also wish they rotated what they offered a bit more, since for the most part it&apos;s always going to be more or less the same dishes, and I can&apos;t say I find any of them terribly exciting. I should add that I&apos;m not a meat eater so that definitely limits what I can try somewhat, though about half of what they offer is vegetarian.

The sweet rice kheer they have is a nice touch and tasty end to the meal. They also add salted butter to the naan which is hard not to like and pairs very well with all the sauces. 

I&apos;d like to compare the lunch buffet to an a la carte dinner here sometime. I might have a different experience."
5,"Another Indian buffet I wholeheartedly give five stars to without being able to name a single thing I ate. Three of us came just as they were opening (actually a tiny bit earlier) this past week for their lunch buffet. 

I got the mango lassi at the recommendation of my coworker. Basically a delicious mango smoothie. It was very yogurty, sweet and thick. I probably wouldn&apos;t get it again because it was so heavy, but my friend said he likes to get it when he is eating spicy food.  As for the buffet, there&apos;s only about 8 or so trays, but everything was fantastic. I know it is the most basic and beginner of all the Indian foods, but the chicken tikka masala was incredible. So buttery and flavorful and sweet. I had to stop myself from getting a second plate of just that. 

Just like the other Indian buffets I&apos;ve been to, the waiters come to your table with certain sides aside from the trays. This one was an amazing chicken leg. I&apos;m not a fan of spice, and this was a bit spicy, but I still ate every bit of it. The naan was buttery and hot and so good to dip in the sauces. They put a plate of deep fried baby corn on the table as well that was new to me, but obviously incredible (big surprise).  

Can&apos;t wait to come back."
5,Stopped by for a quick lunch after shopping. Friendly service. Amazing food! Flavorful and authentic. Definitely would recommend to stop by if you are in the area!
4,"Have eaten here many times over the years. Consistantly good food and service.  
The gobi manchurian and aloo tilki chat to start. Very good
Roti, raita and aloo mutter.  All delicious. 
You get charged for an order of rice. FYI"
2,I thought I was ordering something healthy with this kidney beans dish....was sorely mistaken....I don&apos;t mind a little oil....there was just a pool of it in the dish.....I have to actually drain it out.....i have pics....don&apos;t think they really do it justice....
5,"The food was great, we ordered samosas, butter chicken, chicken tiki masala, and the vindaloo chicken. Everything was delicious, and packaged well. Definitely would eat here again and recommend!"
3,"I went for the lunch special on weekend. Although the lunch time ends at 3 pm, they still welcome customers come in if they arrive late. 
The food tastes ok, within expectation but not impressive. Variety is limited considering it&apos;s just buffet."
5,"We just went here on Sunday for lunch and sat outside. This is one my favorite Indian spots. I&apos;ve been here multiple times pre-COVID. We ordered the butter chicken, which was absolutely fantastic! The sauce is flavorful and very creamy. The chicken was cooked perfectly. We also ordered the malai kofta, which could&apos;ve been better. The sauce was creamy and delicious, but the actual kofta wasn&apos;t our favorite. We got a side of garlic naan, which was really good. We had a nice view of the city as well as the Empire State Building. Service was great and food was out quickly."
1,"This isn&apos;t the Dhaba I used to know.

It&apos;s been a couple years since I&apos;ve ordered from them and I was so excited for a night of takeaway in bed.

I ordered some of my favorites: samosas, navaratan korma, and papads. What I got were just suggestions of those things:
- The samosas, while still enormous, were soggy. The cauliflower and pea filling was indistinguishable, underwhelming gray colored mush. No tamaraind sauce to dip them in either; not sure if this was an oversight or if it just doesn&apos;t come with the samosas anymore.
- The papads were fine, but dry.
- The navaratan korma... Dhaba introduced me to this dish years ago and it&apos;s usually my go to whenever ordering Indian from anywhere now. But what I got - an anemic, watery dish that came with one potato, one broccoli, and one piece of paneer - was flavorless and unappetizing.

Such a disappointment.

All day my friends and I had joked about those one bad experiences that turn you off from a certain food for a while. If this had been my first time eating Indian, it would take a lot of work to convince me to do so again.

Maybe ordering super late/right before closing makes this my fault, maybe it was just an off day, maybe things have changed in their kitchen over the years. Whatever it is, sadly I think this was my last time here."
4,"This is my first restaurant at Curry hill and I really like it. 

We were shown to our table by an overworked waitress because it was a busy time, but she was genuinely gracious the entire time. We were starving but we didn&apos;t go for the buffet and went ala-carté. We HAD to order mango lassi as soon as we went in, and it was a wonderful choice - good consistency, not too thick and not too thin either. The main course food arrived in less than ten minutes. 

We ordered Paneer tash kebab, it was charry on the outside, full of flavor and juicy and amazingly delicious. Loved it. Navraton korma was okay, even though we ordered the spicy version our curry was very sweet. Garlic naan was soft and very good. 

My only gripe is the restrooms, I wish they were cleaner. 

On the whole, highly recommend this place for authentic North-Indian food. Will definitely return!!"
1,"Update: I went there last night. I tried to make a reservation for 2 people over the phone for 7:15 pm, and the gentleman said he wouldn&apos;t make a reservation because they were already full of reservations and we could just walk in. I asked again nicely, and he said ok fine, I&apos;ll make you a reservation. 

I showed up, and there was no reservation made. The gentleman lied to me. I was annoyed, but thankfully I didn&apos;t have to wait long to be seated. 

We finally ordered our food. People seated after us got their food. So I asked one of the waiters where our food was and he said he would check. Ten minutes go by, and the gentleman who took our order originally asked us again what we ordered. So we had to reiterate everything again. 

We finally get our food. My dishes are cold, and my husband has to wait an additional 5 minutes to get his naan. I asked for green chutney on the side and it tasted rancid. I asked for another one and the waiter gave me a lot of push back and said the chutney I had was fine. It was definitely not fine, it had gone bad and you could taste that. We finally got another one, and honestly, this tasted just as bad as the previous chutney. 

Finally we got the bill, and they charged us twice for an item, when we only ordered one portion. Thankfully the waiter took care of this without much hassle. 

This place used to be my favorite... I used to love their dishes, however, at this point, the quality of the food has gone down significantly and the service is dismal. I used to rave about this place and now it will be a place that I avoid all together."
5,"LOVE LOVE LOVE!! That&apos;s all I can really say about this place. Their weekend lunch buffet has a ton of offerings at a reasonable price. In a neighborhood full of Indian restaurants, Dhaba stands out. The tandoori chicken legs (part of the buffet but delivered to your table) and the saag paneer are delicious! The bread basket has a great variety as well. They have ample seating, but I could imagine it gets crowded in the early lunch hours. I hope to be back soon for this delicious, filling and reasonably priced buffet!"
