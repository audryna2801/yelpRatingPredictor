5,"ATO2 review: during covid, the two head chefs at atoboy and atomix collaborated to create a 6 course tasting menu. The space is pretty small and only accommodates 18, but due to covid capacity restrictions, there are way less diners inside. Everything from the service, wine pairing, and food work like a well oiled machine. Not a thing was overlooked in the creation of ATO2. 
 
Each meal was beautifully thought of and presented. The menu card even included vivid descriptions of what you should expect to feel/taste from the meal. 
The meal is $110 pp including tip, and can choose to add the optional wine pairing ($95). There are also additional supplements you can add to your various courses (which we did) that included black truffles ($40pp) and a can of caviar ($95). We also got the Korean fried chicken which is a la carte but a must with the caviar.

*completely forgot to take photos of the dishes as I was entranced by the food and just wanted to eat*"
5,"Great outdoor setup during the pandemic. Each table is sectioned off with a heater on the ceiling and minimal interaction with staff. 

As for the food, I found that it&apos;s a great place to try several dishes with friends since each person picks 3 dishes. Some highlights were the scallops and beef cheeks."
5,"Came here with a fellow yelper and thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of my experience here. 

We went post Covid so we were seated outside. 

Originally our party was for three and we were told that there were no reservations available for the night however our third person ended up flaking so we were able to be seated as a party of two. This is due to the fact that the restaurant reserves one or two tables for walk in customers with no reservations which I think is great. 

So if you plan on going here with a party greater than two I highly recommend you make a reservation a few days in advance. 

This area of Manhattan is certainly interesting in terms of passerby, there was a guy who frequents this area apparently who walks by with a boombox blasting 90s R&amp;B and invites you to sing with him but doesn&apos;t bother you if you don&apos;t pay him any mind. 

Aside from all that the food was extremely delicious. My friend and I indulged in the prefix menu and shared a bunch of different plates such as bacon wrapped scallops, beef tartare, salads, mussels, etc. 

The pairings were very unique to me for most dishes with how they combined the flavors and I was pretty happy with everything that I ate. 

No room for dessert. 

Also I cannot emphasize enough how sincere and attentive the staff was."
4,Very good experience with the collab between Atoboy and Atomix. Hope we will see something like this again in the near future. Can&apos;t wait to come back to Atoboy for the new menu
5,"We really enjoyed their heated outdoor ATO^2 tasting menu during covid 2021. Their outdoor seating is quite nice, and they even have 25% indoor now. Delicious and wonderful service- they even brought us hot tea to keep us warm while we waited for our table."
5,"Made reservation ahead of time and came here with a friend on a weeknight. It was very well spaced out indoors and felt really safe.

We ordered a bunch of things to share
special rice - don&apos;t remember what they put in it but it was nice to pair with all the entrees
spicy mussels and avocado - surprisingly delicious, never had this combo before
tuna salad - light and easy to eat. 
razor clams and tomatoes - probably the most disappointing since the tomatoes overpowered the razor clam flavor
beef cheek - tender and soft
pork belly -  yummy
octopus - amazingly done and a must order!

Every entree was done so well and always left me craving more. Highly recommend giving it a visit"
4,"I&apos;ve been meaning to go to Atoboy for some time and am glad that I finally did.  First and foremost, yes, they are most definitely adhering to all safety protocols. The tables are definitely more than 6 feet apart, everyone&apos;s wearing masks, etc.  The service is quite wonderful and was very patient considering my friend decided to be 25 minutes late because he&apos;s a terrible human being (kidding, ever so slightly). 

To start, I got the dried anchovy and bugak.  To be honest, it wasn&apos;t my cup of tea but I could care less. What I cared more about, of course, were the mains!  The menu is a 3 course for $48 prix fixe.  The dishes get progressively bigger as you go down the list. To start, we got the razor clams and raw tuna and fris√©e salad.  Both were super flavorful but the raw tuna salad stole the show for me, it was so simple yet so delicious. 

Our second courses were the bacon-wrapped scallops and octopus. The bacon-wrapped scallops were great and I loved the texture that they had, firm but not too chewy. The octopus, however, unfortunately fell flat in my book. It tasted overcooked and the broccoli rabe didn&apos;t complement it well for me.

The third courses, however, definitely brought it back home.  We got the sweet and spicy skate and the pork ribs. Both of these dishes were amazing. The skate had such wonderful flavor and a very generous portion was given.  The pork ribs were definitely fall-off-the-bone, melt-in-your-mouth next level ribs.  I didn&apos;t pay too much attention to the edamame salad but the salsa verde added a very nice kick to the ribs.  If there&apos;s anything you should definitely order, it&apos;s the ribs!!!

I loved how it was an open kitchen concept and that I didn&apos;t feel rushed while I was eating.  We got a couple glasses of wine (it was a Friday night after all) but I was a little disappointed that they didn&apos;t have any cocktails, which is completely okay but it&apos;s something to be aware of.  I had the granita for dessert, and, to be honest, it didn&apos;t taste like anything special to me.  If anything, it tasted like a cold bowl of cereal to me.  Basically, if you stick with the main courses and pick wisely, Atoboy will definitely deliver."
5,"Wonderful service and such a memorable birthday meal. The menu allows you to select three dishes to be shared family style, so we ended up with nine dishes. 
The most memorable dish was the scallops. 
The duck was super gamey and chewy. 
The endive salad was super refreshing and paired really nicely with the creamy burrata. 
The cabbage and octopus with tofu was a second favorite! 
The skate was the best main dish in my opinion."
5,"This was a wonderful dinner from start to finish. We managed to snag a highly-coveted reservation and were seated immediately. Their outdoor seating is nice and classy. 

Service was attentive and friendly and stiff in an endearing way. The server told us his recommendations and walked us through the tasting menu-style dinner. For small plates, we got the spicy mussels, the yellowtail, the tuna, and the beef tartare. The spicy mussels, beef tartare, and the tuna were all unbelievable. The yellowtail was our least favorite but was still great. All made us wonder if the embarrassment of licking the plate clean would be worth the benefit of enjoying every last taste of the flavor. Each was unique.

For our mains we had the duck and the beef cheeks. The duck was great and so were the beef cheeks, but we didn&apos;t love the flavor in the latter as much. We got the kimchi and the special rice as well and both were great accompaniments to our dinner.

If I had one complaint, it was that the drink menu was boring. Mostly wine with a few beers and one soju cocktail. I would have liked to have seen more soju options on the menu. 

Anyway, we ended up paying about $70 per person inclusive of tax and tip. It was a great dinner and I would absolutely go again."
5,"Food was great. We had several items on the menu. My favorites were the tuna, octopus, and braised beef cheek. I&apos;m not typically a fan of octopus because of how tough it could be, but this was tender, flavorful, and I can&apos;t believe that I want to go back for it.

Staff was great. I felt like I could talk to our waiter for a long time. Super friendly and affable, always there right when we needed him and made the experience even better.

I came here for my birthday and I was honestly very nervous because it was my first time eating indoors in NYC since March. I felt more comfortable once I saw that the tables were well spaced and the staff was cleaning my table while taking my temperature."
5,"Great concept, friendly above and beyond hosts and servers, and tasty dishes. 

Came here with a friend for a 7PM reservation. Our table was taking their sweet time (I could painfully see the hosts try and remind them of their check) so we were seated maybe 20-30 min after. No problem at all but the silver lining was they offered a new beer sample and sujeonggwa granita on the house for the wait! Did not even have to press them about the status of table but they made the kind gesture. 

For food, my friend and I split the 2 small plate and 1 main plate options. We ordered the raw tuna salad, beef tartare, bacon wrapped scallops, and egg custard for smaller plates and duck breast and beef cheek for entrees and an order of special rice on side. All were amazing but beef tartare I think stood out and the beef cheek was surprisingly very good. 

 Both fig panna cotta and sujeonggwa granita were good but I think the sujeonggwa granita stood out more."
5,"AmaZing experience ( with the notable hard exception of the bon chon dishes) 

Assistant manager provided attentive service and a lot of attention to detail during this Covid era.

The scallops in the watermelon juice was extremely refreshing, The warm Uni inspired, and the mAckarael in red curry broccolini the perfect entree.

The desserts initially looked unassuming but I am so glad that we ordered both because they were both divine. I&apos;ll mention that this is coming from a pre-diabetic Francophile desert snob. 

Lastly I would like to caution about to take away boxes/ Bonchon. We ended up getting three and I regret to say that none of them were ever touched once they were brought home because of the very authentic seafood-y, Asian taste. For example the raw octopus, and the dry shrimp paste chips were just too much for me to stomach. No usually I take great pride in the range of my palate, so take this for what it is. Service and ambience was great despite the outdoor seating and I will definitely be back."
5,"TLDR: Atoboy is the sister restaurant of JP/Ellia Park. Shareable plates in a tasting menu format. So good, great choice for a group meal so you can try everything.

I tried Atoboy after Atomix and I wasn&apos;t sure how much I&apos;d like it. Especially since Atomix had set the bar so high. It was awesome, it&apos;s easily one of my those restaurants that I think about quite frequently.

The concept is cool, it&apos;s a tasting menu but with shareable plates. If you&apos;ve been thinking of trying Atomix but aren&apos;t sure of booking it - try Atoboy. Atoboy will give you a an idea of what can be expected.

Each guest picks two small plates and one entree. There&apos;s a special rice you can order with your meal, make sure you get it. Lately it&apos;s been a rice that&apos;s blended with seaweed, super unique and so good. 

I would strongly recommend getting the fried chicken add-on, it&apos;s wonderfully tender and has this delicate coating. The desserts are extra but worth the investment. Every dessert dish I&apos;ve had was super unique. Granita with burrata, what?!?

The menu changes from season to season but rest assured, everything will wow you. The plates, the silverware, the service is on point.

What I really love about a fine dining establishment like Atoboy is that I always leave full."
5,"There&apos;s few restaurants that you come across that just simply blow your mind. Well this is one of them.

My boyfriend and I were walking around the area when we saw this adorable outdoor dining setting. The decor was really well done for an outdoor space so that alone drew us in. We asked the woman inside what kind of cuisine this was and she said &quot;modern Korean.&quot; 

They offer a pre-fixe menu for $45 and you can order 2 small plates and 1 big plate. You can also still order a la carte.

The spicy mussels and raw tuna apps were so flavorful and delicately balanced. The duck entree was also delicious - not necessarily our favorite but we&apos;d come back to try other plates.

The real star of the show is the shaved ice dessert called sunggjeowwa - i may have spelled that wrong, but it is a cinnamon shaved ice over lychee syrup, walnuts, and burrata. The dessert was so creative and unlike anything I&apos;ve ever tasted before I almost ordered two!"
5,"Leaving a review for their Ato Family Meal which is an amazing little treat if you want a variety of dishes for your meal. Each set comes with multiple dishes + rice and the menu seems to be rotating weekly. It&apos;s also enough food for 2-3 people and I definitely found that as a 2-person household we are getting two meals out of this. 

They&apos;re available for delivery or pickup, and the menus do vary slightly depending on what you&apos;re picking or which platform you&apos;re looking at (vs. their own site). 

The set is very much like going to their restaurant in person, where you&apos;re getting a few dishes over multiple courses. But every dish is also available for a la carte ordering!

Their in-person dining was also a fantastic experience just from the detail and design of everything. Their ceramics are some of my favorite ones and I&apos;d love to have them in my home! The plating is also always beautiful and you get to have a coursed dinner which is a nice balance of family style sharing with the structure of a more special dinner. I&apos;ve also always enjoyed the service and they had even given us free dessert for a birthday, which I find is increasingly rare in NYC!

Overall their flavors are always top notch and the dishes are a great mix of inventive combinations and traditional flavors. A great experience whether in-person or via delivery!"
5,"Atoboy has easily made my list of top 5 favorite restaurants in NYC. Highly, highly recommend!

The cost per person is $46 for 3 delicious, beautifully plated dishes + $2 for (unlimited) white or mushroom rice + free unlimited side dishes + additional charges for upgrades. I actually think it&apos;s an incredible value for the quality and uniqueness of the dishes you&apos;re getting. There are 5 options for each of the 3 dishes, so I HIGHLY recommend coming with 5 (or more) people for the best dining experience. This way, you can try and share every dish, which is what my friends and I did. The serving sizes are perfect sharing - relatively small dishes, but enough for every person to have a decent portion.

I absolutely loved every single item on the menu. The highlights for me were the yellowtail/beef tartare, egg, and lobster, but you truly cannot go wrong with whatever you choose. The mushroom rice is so delicious. The bowl of complimentary seaweed crackers at the beginning of the meal are also amazing and unlike any other seaweed snack I&apos;ve ever had.

Last thoughts: The service is topnotch. My drink was good, but a little watered down. The meal overall was super fast.

All in all, one of the best meals you can get in NY for the price. I&apos;m dying to go to Chef Park&apos;s Michelin-rated Atomix."
4,"Come here with a party size around 3-5 since they offer a tasting menu with only about 5 options in each course.

The ambiance is hip concrete, which apparently is the new upscale Korean.

Some of the dishes reminded you of Korean dishes, but a lot of them did not. I&apos;d think this place more like an upscale Asian fusion restaurant, and I mean that in a good way since the term fusion normally doesn&apos;t have a positive connotation.

Some dishes really stood out like the beef tartare, galbi, uni, chrysanthemums. The desserts were also a great combination of a little sweet, and a little tart."
4,"Finally made it here and was impressed, particularly with some dishes. All are very high quality and creative. First came out complimentary seaweed chips, a unique and welcome offering. For small plate starters, we tried the cabbage, the sunchoke, the egg (with Maine uni), and the snapper. I know each was special but the most memorable for me was the egg because it was so warm on that cold evening and I LOVE eggs and LOVE sea urchin, which is a must-have unless you have a valid/health reason to avoid

For big plates, we tried the branzino and the mackerel. Both dishes came in a broth with herbs that was flavorful in its own way- branzino was light and refreshing; the other mackerel was rich (in flavor, not texture) and complex. Both were delicious and you will want to drink the soup (broths)

Could have ended there as most diners would. But we saw pork rib ssam on the menu and just had to have it... and they were finger-licking good! Thankfully I still had rice. Unless you for some reason can&apos;t /won&apos;t have rice, I recommend having rice with the pork otherwise it could taste a little too salty."
4,"As much as I dislike being let down by the hype, I wholly enjoy the opposite. It was about time that I find such a place, and thanks to Atoboy I did.

Run by a married Korean couple and Hand Hospitality, Atoboy is typically full of reservations for which they hold the dining tables. For walk-ins, only the bar is available. The atmosphere feels raw and modern - could be a bit fancier though. But this gets me excited because in my weird mind, rusty looks == good food.

That formula was certainly valid for Atoboy. We pretty much ordered everything protein, a few veggies, and all 3 desserts. The waitresses were busy clearing the finished plates as we were speedily eating. Other than the heavy proportion of grapefruit vs. crab, I didn&apos;t have any complaints. 

I debated whether to give a 4 or 5 stars because Atoboy makes a tough case for critique. So I asked myself, did any one dish impress so much that no other place can make it to this level? Not really. If the food was great overall, was everything else? No, there is hardly any space between the chairs and the decor is a B at best. While it&apos;s not easy to be a 5 star in my book, Atoboy definitely came very close and I hope it will truly wow me in the next visit."
5,"Hard not to give 5 stars. You&apos;re either going to be impressed with the quality of the food or at the very least well fed by the time you&apos;re out of Atoboy. And since there are so many well written reviews acclaiming Atoboy I&apos;m really inclined to keep this short.

We picked three dishes each from the prix-fixe menu. With my buddy, we shared six dishes total:
Yellowtail 
Beef tartare
Sunchoke
Egg
Pork belly 
Mackerel

They were all amazing you can&apos;t go wrong here. Great sharing portions!

I opted for the sweet potato rice but I&apos;ll probably keep the regular rice next time. Mashed sweet potato mushed in rice adds a slight sweetness. It could be a bit much with some dishes."
