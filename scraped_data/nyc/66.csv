4,"One of my favorite places in the city to get KBBQ located down the block from the heart of K-town. They tend to lean towards the &quot;classy&quot; side of restaurants as you can see with the price of the dishes and alcohol pairings. Nonetheless, they offer a great lunch special as well as dinner platters for groups.

For three (me and two boys), we ordered a beef platter, one of the bibimbaps, mulbi naengmyun, and the bulgolgi tteok bokki. Everything tasted amazing and they constantly refilled the side dishes. According to the guys, the portions were a bit on the smaller side, but I thought they were pretty standard.

We also opted to indoor dine as outdoor dining was filled, and they were very good about making sure each party was spaced out. The inside is much bigger than expected, so the distance was very easy to maintain. All of the staff wore masks as well. Definitely a great option if you want kbbq in the city!"
5,"Delicious dinner. So many flavors! June, our server, was amazing.  Made reservation to Be sure we could get a seat since decreased searing for COVID. Screening, temp and contract tracing at front door...
We got the Marinated Meat platter for $100+...SO WORTH IT!  Highly recommend."
4,"One of the best places for Korean bbq. There is a lot of outdoor seating, but no heat lamps....so we opted to sit inside. There was plenty of space between us and the other diners. The staff was incredibly courteous - always wearing masks, easily accessible hand sanitizer, keeping distance, and making sure every guest was comfortable.

We ordered two different bbq offerings - galbi and bulgogi. The food came with all of the pickled toppings, but rice wasn&apos;t included. At other kbbq experiences, I&apos;ve always received steamed eggs - those seemed to be missing from this experience. 

The food we did receive was great, but the bulgogi was a little wet - you can see it in the picture. It took a while to fish out all of the meat. If I were to go back, I would order a double galbi."
5,"Wow. I would give this place infinity stars if I could. Their outdoor dining is awesome - warm and pretty well spaced out. The servers were kind and attentive but most of all the food was amazing. 

I walked past this place with my dining partner and decided to eat there on a whim. We got hot tea and the complementary small plates of tiny bites, which were all really good. As part of the lunch special, you can have one entree and a stew. Both of us choose the non spicy tofu seafood stew. It was so delicious and packed with both tofu and different types of seafood.

Both of us got meals that included bulgogi and it was the greatest decision. Bulgogi. Is. Amazing. Especially the bulgogi here. I&apos;ve gotta say, the EUI lunch special was the highlight. The small amount of broth from the dish is SO flavorful and delicious with the rice they give you. We were so fun we definitely had leftovers. They give more than enough food for two

I hope to come back and introduce more people to this place."
5,"Lovely big size dinner size
You pay for the hotpot
All side dishes are included 
It is located inside Korean town
I will be back again soon"
4,"I&apos;m so happy to review this place, it was a happy accident I came in here. The staff was so polite, accommodating and friendly. I as sat immediately and our waiter recommended we try the chefs special which was awesome. The kimchi stew was delicious. The lemonade was so good but not worth the price we did the large pitcher which didn&apos;t serve two cups because it had to much ice in it. The bimbimbap was amazing !!!! Will definitely return for more."
5,"So glad this place is still open during this time. It&apos;s still my favorite spot for Korean for lunch and my coworkers and I came on a rainy day to eat outdoors, where there was a tent set up outside complete with heater. Though we could have eaten indoors, we were more comfortable eating outside since it wasn&apos;t too cold and there was a heater. I think I would have felt ok eating indoors as well since it&apos;s so large and spacious inside. Since there is a smaller, more limited menu, I didn&apos;t get my usual fish but got the Bo special instead with the soft tofu soup, which really hit the spot on that rainy and chilly fall day."
3,Came here on a Saturday night with some friends. Got the pork belly and bulgogi amongst three people. Very small portions of each (which were extremely overpriced for amount they gave us). Was still hungry so got a kimchi pancake after. Bulgogi was ah.mazing. So tender and so tasty! Pork belly was subpar and quite disappointing. I&apos;m used to amazing kbbq from California where the meat comes seasoned and tastes great without having to dip it into any kind of sauce or adding salt. The pork tasted better once you added some Salk and dipped it in the sauce they have you. Left half of the kimchi pancake uneaten. Very bland and texture wasn&apos;t great.
5,"Taste good

Overall the dish are small and a bit pricy. I would say the lamp is pretty good"
4,"Perfect COVID spacing and excellent service. yummy plates of food that give you a reason smile, just not while chewing please. Rich, flavorful, and fragrant this meats is tender and succulent. You could have a more perfect lunch...sure. But if you want Korean BBQ with a great friend then this is the place to go."
4,"Coming here was actually an accident. I meant to go to Dons Bogam Green, but the similar name confused me. However, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed the food here.

Evidently, this restaurant&apos;s main selling point is its classy elegance and selection of fine wines that pair with their BBQ meats. I&apos;m not a big wine person, so I didn&apos;t try any, but they had an impressive lineup of wines that snaked their way from the front bar all the way through the restaurant on a banister. 

Once we ordered our food, the banchan arrived. There was kimchi, salted anchovies, seaweed crisps, bean sprouts in sesame oil, and Chinese broccoli. All delicious and a good harbinger of the dishes to come. 

We ordered the Kimchi Jeyuk platter and the Broiled Eel Bbimbap to share. The Kimchi Jeyuk platter was a big plate of spicy marinated pork nestled within piles of kimchi, and onion. The juices and spices of the kimchi really elevate the flavors of the pork and make the dish an excellent partner with rice. I wasn&apos;t a fan of the Eel Bbimbap because of its dominantly sour taste. What I expected was a BBQ flavor so the sweet and sour taste was offputting. However, the crispy rice at the bottom was perfectly done.

Overall, this was still a great meal at affordable price. I also liked its elegant furnishings and noise level suitable for conversation. Looking forward to trying its sister restaurant!"
4,"Ordered Dons Bogam for delivery and the food was delicious. My boyfriend and I shared the Galbi Dolsot, which was the best thing we ordered, as well as the Bulgogi (came with rice) and Japchae (glass noodles with vegetables). Also, the kimchi ruled. My only complaint is that the order came almost an hour late. Still, not a dealbreaker. The containers also had vacuum sealed plastic lids, which is cool.  4.5 stars."
5,Best Korean BBQ in the city!! Passed my expectations when I first came here. Service was absolutely amazing! My go to spot when people visit or for the Holidays!!!
5,"This is my always go-to spot especially in the winter. Whenever i feel sick and want to have samgyetang (korean chicken soup), i will come here to dine in or take out.

The restaurant is really popular and if you don&apos;t have a reservation, better get here before 6 to avoid waiting. The hostess was nice enough to put us on waitlist 2 hrs before our reservation at 6pm(they usually don&apos;t take last minute reservation), but we ended up arriving at 5:45 and it was pretty empty.

Soup:
The samgyetang (korean chicken soup) is my all time favorite. This time we want to try something else, so we ordered galbitang (beef bone) and seafood tofu stew. 
They taste amazing, especially the galbitang. 

BBQ:
I only had the Korean bbq once here but I was impressed by how fresh and delicious the meat were. It is a bit more expensive than other Korean bbq places, but it&apos;s totally worthy!!"
5,"If you need to pick a K-BBQ place that will keep your vegetarian friends happy, this is the one. Good selection of vegetarian appetizers like japchae and kimchi jeon.

More importantly, for main dishes, the kimchi soondoobu is one of the best vegetarian ones I&apos;ve ever had (typically the kimchi version is made with pork as well). Nice and tart without being overly sour.

Also enjoyed the subtle craft fruit soju cocktails - some other places make them too sweet for my taste."
4,"Dons Bogam is a Korean BBQ spot in the heart of K-Town that differentiates itself with a sleek look and a focus on wine.

I came here with a group of coworkers who snagged a same-day reservation on a weekday for our large group. Service was super accommodating with some of our party arriving late; combined with the family-style serving, this is a good spot for big groups assuming everyone&apos;s down to spend.

Of our starters, our japchae (veggie noodles) was head and shoulders above the rest; simple yet addictive. I thought their pajeon (seafood pancake) was both too greasy and too plain. I didn&apos;t really understand the hype with their fluffy egg dish, which was tasty but topped with overcooked bacon.

All of the banchan was excellent; we particularly loved the green onion salad. The rice is also nice and they serve rounds of lettuce wraps. The sauces were kind of meh other than the delicious garlic butter that they heat on the grill.

On meats, I thought the quality was good overall. The pork belly was very nice. I&apos;m not sure which beef we had, but it bothered me how much they cooked it; I had to steal it off the grill before it was deemed officially done by the grill master to maintain any tenderness. And I&apos;m not talking rare, I&apos;m talking well past medium with solid char on the outside. It was hard for me to tell how high quality the beef actually was when it&apos;s been cooked to death.

The price per head ($80 post tax and tip) struck me as high, but we did get a lot of food and alcohol out of that. Well, I guess we leaned heavier on the latter-- a round of makkoli, two flavored sojus (the pineapple beat the grapefruit handily), and a bottle or two of wine among the nine of us.

Service is far better than average for the neighborhood. The atmosphere is lively without being turnt. Their vents actually work pretty well to suck up the meat smell.

I have yet to find a favorite K-BBQ spot, and Dons Bogams hasn&apos;t claimed that spot-- I think it&apos;s a little pricey for what it is and I&apos;m not a fan of how long they cook their beef. But if you want a solid mid-to-upscale experience, Dons Bogams will do the trick."
5,"Our favorite BBQ in K-Town, we decided to stop by and dine outside. The set up was beautiful and the food and service was exceptional as always. As a local, I went with Bulgogi, while my wife who is originally from Korea had Fried Kimchi and Bulgogi. 

My wife and I have been dining here for about 20 years and highly recommend Dons Bogam BBQ."
5,"I would choose korean bbq from this place over 9 out 10 places in ktown. Get the marinated $99 one. Get loads of it. 

Don&apos;t get the beef tartare. Ever 

Five stars"
5,I ordered Galbi tang for takeout and I&apos;m really impressed! Everything was well packed and sealed. Also the food is on point! Portion+ Flavor
4,"&quot;A moment like this...&quot; which is composed of everything and anything that is going wrong. It was a Friday morning where I was late to work already, had my female cycle moment, was chasing a horsefly in my apartment with oven cleaner, and when I killed the fly, I realized I got some of the cleaner stuff on my YSL wallet and the coating on the wallet was rubbing off. I was super icked with the day I was going to call out sick, but decided to be a big girl (and I was already ready to go to work) and go to work. I sat by my desk avoiding emails saying &quot;can we discuss, can we have a meeting.&quot; 

It was also a slow day so I decided to text a friend that worked nearby and ask him for bubble tea. To be honest, I did not expect anything from him because he&apos;s like an imaginary friend. However, he responded and bubble tea afternoon turn into drinks with his coworkers by the bar to Korean BBQ at this place. I was craving some bosam with some naengmyun. 

This place was ridiculous. We had the best service ever because my friend was a regular. We got some beef platter and they gave me naengmyun!!! ONLY a true Korean knows what is up. The food was good and the service was great. Top of the line service compared to any Korean joint in Koreatown. I am assuming it is because they are not located in that messy strip... Another place I pass all the time on my way to Krav Maga and never knew about. I probably won&apos;t go back without this friend of mine, but I may kick his office door down if he does not answer my texts. I was contemplating on having this buddy of mine around, but I think I&apos;ll keep him... for introducing me to this place.... Two thumbs up!"
