5,"Was in search of a sit down breakfast joint to hold me over for about an hour which is difficult nowadays with COVID. Found this place randomly and decided to check it out!

Food:  With the help of the worker (who was extremely nice and patient) I ordered the avo + whites sandwich (egg whites, avocado smash, spinach, tomato on seven grain ciabatta) and latte with oat milk! The breakfast sandwich was amazing- I was not disappointed! The sandwich loaded with avocado and I found the coffee to be deliciously made as well. 

Cost: The price was fairly well priced for New York and would be considered &apos;average&apos;.

Environment: The inside of this place was very aesthetically pleasing- all the tables and seating arrangements were spaced out due to COVID and I loved the feel of the place in general.

Service: The service here was amazing! Not only was the cashier super helpful with helping me pick out what to get since it was my first time here- whenever anyone got up to leave, the spot was immediately cleaned down and ready for whoever wanted to sit down next. 

Uniqueness: A great &apos;hole in the wall&apos; place to grab some food and drink! Will definitely be coming back here!"
5,"Service is very friendly and chatty! Ordered the BEC + LT on a brioche and it was delicious! A good amount of bacon, well rounded, and filling meal! The iced matcha latte was good but it&apos;s not sweetened unless you ask. The aesthetic of the cafe was nice and indoor covid seating is spaced out. They have great outdoor dining seating and offer individual tents. Went at 2:30 pm on a Saturday and it was not busy."
5,I love the food and coffee here. I am very pleased that I live 2 blocks away and can get quick delivery. The food is fresh and delicious and the coffee is great too. My only (constructive) criticism is that it would be great if you could add some sugar free latte flavors. See ya tomorrow!
4,"This has been a standby cafe spot for me for years, but I recently visited for the first time during COVID for their special Galentine&apos;s Day evening event. They went above and beyond. I reserved an outdoor hut for no cost (for 3 full hours!), and my friends and I got our own safe space complete with a speaker system and huge flatscreen that was playing movies the whole night. 

They offered a scaled down version of their menu, with some special drinks and snacks for the event. We split a bottle of wine, ordered the Rose Gold dip (a special), and I split the Avocado Burrata sandwich with another friend. They plated the sandwich separately for us so we both got side salads and it was just the right amount of food. I also ordered an Irish coffee.

It was a bit chilly inside but it also was one of the coldest nights recently. Definitely recommend this spot anytime (COVID included)!"
4,"My office best friend and I would enjoy going to local cafes with healthy bowls every so often at our old office. We&apos;ve actually been here 2x. Good food, good service, efficient seating, and great decor. It can get crowded and loud around lunch time and we would usually come here at 1-1:30PM. 

The last time my BFF and I came here we actually ended up getting the same meal which was the Quinoa Bowl (quinoa, avocado, shredded kale, roasted squash, cherry tomatoes, cucumbers, carrots and a cilantro pepita dressing. I&apos;m always amazed at how delicious and pretty their food comes out that I almost don&apos;t want to eat it. I really enjoyed this Quinoa Bowl, felt very filling and healthy most of all.

I really enjoyed eating here and coming here. I&apos;ve never had a negative experience here. Food is fresh and awesome. I would definitely want to come back."
5,"We stayed in the hotel near by and were getting breakfast here each morning. Coffee is great, I loved smoked salmon bagel. Service was outstanding. Highly recommended! Will come back once in NY."
5,I had a wonderful time eating Brunch here this morning. I loved the peppermint tea and the BEC+LT sandwich. The brioche bun was especially delightful. There were multiple choices for outside dining-one large green structure and some &apos;igloo&apos; setups on the other side. I would definitely come back here again!
5,"Blank Slate was always on my list of cafes to try in NYC, and I feel very blessed that they&apos;ve stayed open and are within walking distance from me - they&apos;ve really become my go to spot. I come here for coffee or takeout a couple times a week. I&apos;ve tried a few different menu items here, but what they really knock it out of the park on is salads. The chickpea salad and kale caesar with brussels sprouts are amazing. Good texture/ingredient combinations, and they really do not skimp on the toppings!! When you add chicken ($4), you get basically an entire grilled chicken breast. 

Also, the boys who work here are incredibly nice and patient. One of them actually remembered me (which I am now extra impressed by, given that everyone is wearing masks these days) and complimented my style. Given that I have only worn athleisure for about two months now, that affirmation was extra cherished. Whenever I resume my office commute again, I will be genuinely sad not to get to come here all the time."
5,"(Pre-COVID review) 

Great food, great service, efficient seating, and great decor/vibes. A great fairly-priced, quick sit-down breakfast/brunch/coffee spot and a menu that has something for everyone. 

I came here on a Sunday around lunchtime with a friend. We ordered at the counter and got seated by a hostess immediately. It was really busy and crowded, but the seating process is really efficient. The coffees we ordered were fine, but nothing to rave home about. The breakfast, salad, and sandwich options all looked super delicious and healthy. We both opted for the breakfast bowl, which I&apos;d recommend. At $13, I thought it was super fairly priced. 

Blank Slate becomes a coffee shop/cafe, where people pop in and get work done once the lunch rush is over. It seems like a great place to get work done (wi-fi is offered)."
5,"It&apos;s a bit confusing because we were looking for Blank Slate Tea which is actually  closed. We were about to go to a different place for breakfast, however we noticed that Blank Slate Coffee and Kitchen on the corner of the street and decided to go try this place out instead! They have indoor and outdoor dining available. We ordered the BECLT, steak sandwich, and deviled eggs. All the prices were really good, the sandwiches were only $9 and $13.5. However, the eggs are not worth it. It comes with three flavors. I thought it would come w 2 of each flavor, given the price($7) but it only came with 1.5 eggs. Can&apos;t really taste the difference between spicy and original but the truffle one had a hint of truffle flavor and was our favorite! I got the steak sandwich which was honestly so good. It had a nice sauce inside, and a little salad on the side. Boyfriend got the BECLT. A mix of the two most classic breakfast sandwiches. It was also good, but I liked mine better. We also got a cold brew and earl grey tea to drink."
4,"Better experience this time around. Ordered a different omelette, eggs were fresh and received a large portion. I actually couldn&apos;t finish it because there was so much food. Also ordered an iced matcha this time and the beverage was completely full."
5,"Blank Slate has been my favorite place to order delivery from during COVID-19. You can order through Postmates.

Important to note- the food has consistently been exponentially better when we order M-Friday morning than when we order over the weekend (most noticeably with the steak sandwich and avo toast)

Regardless Blank Slate has been the best. 

Favorites: Avocado toast. Has a kick and topped off with a little bit of honey. Absolutely delicious. When I order it during the week they usually bless me with 3-4 slices vs. 2 on the weekend. Still probably the best avo toast in quarantine and prior to quarantine was definitely up there with Bluestone Lane.

My boyfriend always orders the bacon egg and cheese. I have really enjoyed the grilled chicken sandwich with cranberry as well."
4,Stopped in here to get some coffee the other day. I ended up getting an iced dirty chai. They have some good options and I like that they have dairy free options. They have some indoor seating available and a decent outdoor set up. The barista was really nice and friendly.
4,"Let me tell you, Blank Slate Coffee + Kitchen was actually fabulous. From the staff to the atmosphere to the prices, no complaints about Blank Slate Coffee + Kitchen. The most flavourful dish was Mushroom Scramble, me and my friend just loved it. It was so delightful. Workers ensured that everything was good. Pretty darn cool."
5,Quick service. Coffee is great. Outdoor seating available. People are friendly. Nice spot to have some coffee during this whole pandemic
4,"Got the berry Belgian waffles and cappuccino. Girlfriend got the mushroom omelet. Both great! Really love how they have magnetic slates to play with while waiting for the food.

Instead of maple syrup they have Honey and Agave which were actually pretty amazing on the waffle.

Great spot for breakfast!"
5,"An absolute favorite neighborhood coffee place that also offers excellent food and a cozy atmosphere. The chili honey avocado toast is easy to fall in love with, and they serve Vietnamese iced coffee which is such a wonderful treat. They use recycled materials for their packaging which I love. Takeout is always quick and spill-free."
5,"Ok, I have since been back  multiple times and have to add how much I love this place.

I&apos;ve tried the turkey sandwich, the flank steak and the coffee. Every time I come here I leave satisfied. 

I still stick to my point that they should have more locations, I really feel like they would do well in the LES. They have a great atmosphere and don&apos;t disappoint on food and beverages. This is the best place in the area to get cafe food and coffee with a good vibe. I definitely recommend. 

4.8/5"
5,"Great food, great service and friendly staff
We loved the berries waffle, I highly recommend as well as the mushroom scramble"
4,"This is a good place for breakfast or brunch! I came here on Sunday around 1 o&apos;clock and it was pretty busy. It has cute and nice atmosphere.  

I got their Avocado Toast and it was tasty. My friends got different food and they look all tasty. Everything is reasonably priced for the portion.
 
This place is good for a quick bite alone or with a small group. Definitely not suitable for a big group. 
You order food at the register and they bring your food. 

There are many menu options for breakfast. I would come back!"
