5,"Nice bakery to buy your Japanese breads and desserts! All of the breads and goods here are delicious! 

Location: It is located near Grand Central Terminal. The bakery is hidden tho, but if you find it, you want to buy everything. The interior, has a great display of pastries and breads, they have bento boxes too. Due to covid, they don&apos;t allow seating inside.

Service: no interaction with the cashier, just buy and go.

Food: Everything here is delicious! I tried their breads but not their bento boxes yet. Soon! COFFEE BUTTER ROLL: omg this good, fluffy and taste like coffee, perfect for cup of coffee or tea, heat 10 seconds in the microwave! CHEESE BUN: this is good too! The bun has cream cheese inside which is very delicate and smooth. CHOCO BUN: same as cheese bun but instead there is chocolate filling inside. ALMOND COOKIE: this is my favorite! Crunchy and toasted almonds are great combination! I can eat the whole container in one seating!

Price rating: 5/10, not that expensive to be honest for the goodness you get.

Been here multiple times and I just love their breads! Specially the almond cookie!"
5,Rating the ice cream only: Delicious &amp; refreshing. Matcha and sesame flavors together were amazing. I wanted to order all their desserts -they looked amazing - but I was able to control myself. The bakery had a few tables outside so we enjoyed our treats outdoors.
1,"Stumbled upon this cafe/bakery today and decided to give it a try. My husband and I must have interrupted the barista/cashier&apos;s anime drawing session because he was extremely hot tempered and rude to us. 

Every question was answered with an emotional/angry tone and he was slamming the fridges and cups for no apparent reason. We discussed with one another to see if we had said something or did something to warrant this treatment but we literally did nothing. He was just so angry at us... 

The latte we got wasn&apos;t even that good to have your employees treat people like this. Will not be returning ever."
5,"I love this japanese bakery! the breads are all delicious. I love the curry doughnut bread and the mini an pan. The onigiri are about average, but I like that it has the separately wrapped seaweed which is a big plus. ....I would have taken photos, but I ate it too fast..... next time! I have been going here since it was called cafe Zaiya for at least a few years."
5,"Delightful little bakery thats still turning out fresh Japanese buns, rolls, and milk breads. This use to be a Cafe Zaiya back in the day.

My favorite are definitely the butter rolls that are golden fluffy staples and the daily white bread, somehow, because its fresh bread when pulled apart it peels in well kneaded strips. 

You&apos;ll also find fresh spicy chicken cutlet sandwiches, dorayaki classic mini pancakes filled with sweet red bean paste, and Melon Pan!"
4,"I&apos;m kind of obsessed with my new discovery of Café Zaiya!  I was looking for somewhere that had matcha on our walk to Central Park, and found much more in this spot with yummy Japanese snacks!  There were so many delicious baked good and hand roll options, as well as all sorts of yummy drinks.  Perfect for someone who loves tea and Japanese snacks.

Drinks: Lychee Tea and Matcha
In the end, I settled on a fruity lychee tea with mango jellies, which was nice and refreshing.  And I also got my matcha with boba for the walk to the park.  Yum!

Japanese Snacks - Hand Rolls and Baked Goods
I loved the unique hand roll options - I ended up getting the tuna and the pickled plum ones.  The tuna was just right, fresh and light. And the pickled plum filling was nice and tangy! I also got a matcha sweet bun to go. It was kind of like brioche bread, and just a bit sweeter.  

Service
Really friendly service - I always ask a lot of questions to find out what some good drink combos are, and they were friendly and helped me pick out what I wanted.  We got our drinks quickly!

Ambiance
We came by in December, and they had decorated with a Christmas tree.  It was also clean and lots of seating room on the weekend when we visited.

Final Verdict
I will definitely be making Café Zaiya my regular stop when I&apos;m in NYC.  It&apos;s kind of hard to find a Japanese cafe with that many baked good options, and I can never find that many different types of hand rolls. The boba and tea options were also awesome!  I&apos;m definitely in!"
4,"Slightly hidden with a ton of options (desserts, food, SOFT SERVE). Seems like a great place to grab and go. 

I came here for their green tea soft serve. Price is average for NYC and good portion. Super creamy without being too heavy and loved how it wasn&apos;t icy. Also had the matcha latte which wasn&apos;t watered down at all. Appreciate this place for green tea soft serve which is hard to find in Midtown."
5,"This is a great place to grab a quick lunch or dinner on the way home. Food is already prepared, you must grab and go. The prices are extremely reasonable, and the meals are well-balanced. The red bean donut was delicious, and even had real red beans inside! You can tell that they use quality ingredients. Also, if you go there after 5pm, they have 25% off anything that is leftover!"
5,"This place is almost hidden, as in you&apos;d walk pass by without realizing it&apos;s a Japanese bakery store.  It&apos;s literally just a few feet from the Japanese Sunrise Market.  

I really enjoyed this place.  They had so many options including baked goods, soft loaves of bread, bentos and twist black sesame and matcha soft serve ice cream.

The prices are affordable as well and comparable to Sunrise Market.  It&apos;s also nice and quiet to sit in.  I will come back!"
4,"Here&apos;s a review that&apos;s not about the ice cream! Though I regret not trying the soft serve, I have good things to say about Cafe Zaiya. 

Cafe Zaiya is near Grand Central Station, so this is a very convenient location. I went around 6pm, and it turned out that lots of their bentos and pre-made food were on sale! What luck! I took several walking laps around the store (it&apos;s pretty spacious) to do my usual browsing. As I neared the cold section, something caught my hungry eye. I saw a stack of to-go cold udon bowls, which looked incredibly refreshing on a hot summer day. Even better, it was on sale, so I got the bowl for $5.50! And this was a full meal! Udon noodles were chewy yet soft, and the cold broth was light and flavorful. I loved the sprinkled green onion and the fish cake on the side!

I didn&apos;t get to try their bread or bento boxes, but from what I&apos;ve tasted, Cafe Zaiya seems to delivers good quality meals (and soft serve based on the other reviews)!"
4,"I breathed a zaiya of relief when I finally found a place with some ice cream on a very hot Manhattan afternoon.

Zaiya is a pretty cute, large and bustling cafe in Manhattan which serves East Asian flavoured soft serve and plenty of other key items, and it&apos;s really popular - probably because of those Japanese flavours.

Always so busy and packed door-to-door and honestly it would get a 3-star considering the prices and the products, but the service is so sweet and friendly from some of the ladies especially, so I have to round it up to four stars.

Honestly, some of the products here warrant 4 stars, others 2 or 3. It&apos;s the service that puts it over the edge for me."
4,"Cute spot to hangout with some friends. The service was great and patient when we were ordering. 

I ordered the Rose Bubble Tea. You can really taste the tea, like REALLY. The taste of tea and the sweetness of the milk was balanced. I also got a snack. I forgot what it&apos;s called but it&apos;s like a mini sandwich pastry. Really good.

I would recommend this place for some Jap Bubble Tea."
3,"Had this saved in my bookmarks and I was finally in the area so decided to check it out.

Got a spicy tuna onigiri and black sesame soft serve. They definitely give you $5 worth of ice cream. The best soft serve I&apos;ve had was at Carvel&apos;s and unfortunately this wasn&apos;t a black sesame version of that. Yes the flavor was there but the ice cream was so icy and not smooth at all that it was hard to finish it all in one sitting. The spicy tuna onigiri I would skip and just head next door to Sunrise Mart for a cheaper price but same quality.

They have a nice dining area too if you want to enjoy your pastries or bento box before heading out."
5,I like buying their bento and eat outside. Everything will be 20% off before the store closes.
5,"Came for the soft serve, stayed for the cute cafe! 
Came here with my sister on a summer afternoon, and ice cream was a must. Besides the fact that it was a hot day, the ice cream melted pretty fast, which leads me to think that it&apos;s mostly natural ice cream since natural ice cream melts faster than ice cream with additives and preservatives. Loved the matcha black sesame mix; the flavors really complement each other! They&apos;re also pretty generous with their servings, which is also a nice plus."
5,"If you&apos;re looking for a matcha and black sesame soft serve, look no further! Cafe Zaiya does an excellent job blending the two together. The black sesame stands out with a strong flavor but doesn&apos;t overpower the matcha at all. Both flavors were not overly sweet. What I loved even more is that the consistency remained thick and creamy so I didn&apos;t feel the need to eat it quickly before it melts (I hate melty ice cream/froyo, don&apos;t you?!) 

Plenty of seating here, there&apos;s also a good variety of other pastries and snacks, so surely you can eat to your heart&apos;s content here!"
4,"A really unassuming place that I could potentially hide out and do some work at in the future! Plenty of seats and table space (I didn&apos;t check if there was WiFi).

I had the matcha soft serve in a cup and bought a mochi doughnut and tuna onigiri for later. The soft serve was not as strongly flavored as I prefer my matcha soft serve (it&apos;s light and sweet), but it is tasty and you get a lot of it.

I had the mochi doughnut and tuna onigiri a day later, which both held up well. The mochi doughnut was moist, not overly sweet, and had a good chew to it. The tuna onigiri was also pretty good for a quick snack, definitely more rice than filling."
4,"Matcha Ice Cream Only Review:

I really enjoyed the matcha cone- it had good consistency and decent taste of green tea. $5 for a cone which wasn&apos;t so terrible considering regular Mister Softees in midtown charge $4!! I will certainly come back to try out black sesame. 

there&apos;s a decent amount of space inside to sit and enjoy. They have a wide array of asian snacks and cakes as well- hope to try those perhaps later."
2,"Was near Ktown and wanted some ice cream so walked all the way up to cafe zaiya. Got the mixed swirl ice cream with sesame and green tea. Would not say it&apos;s anything exceptional. I was slightly disappointed by the taste of the sesame. It tasted like korean  (kimbap) hahaa. The matcha was just original... not exceedingly good in anyway. 

Cafe ambiance was nice and casual though and a good place to chat. 
Would maybe go again to try their breads and other foods."
4,"Let&apos;s see, hot NYC day after visiting the grand library and in need of some soft serve. Queue the horns for Cafe Zaiya which was nearby, and which offered some unique flavors to entice the palette.

I honestly had no intentions of visiting Cafe Zaiya, but as already mentioned the stars aligned thanks to the heat and helpful ole Yelp leading the way to the nearest ice cream location. The cafe itself is a tad odd as it is split into three locations each serving different dishes and treats, but I was full steam ahead for some soft serve. I opted for the local favorite of green tea with black sesame swirl. While both were mild in flavor, it defiantly was a hit immediately with me as it steered me clear of the usual sugar bomb flavors I am accustomed to. Pricing was not too bad, but honestly hard to argue about pricing when it comes to anything NYC in terms of grub. Staff was quite friendly and they hustle everything along as it is NYC after all. There was plenty of seats for me to devour my delicious soft serve swirl while taking in the quintessential AC during the hotter months of NYC. 

All and all a good experience and would happily re visit to devour another soft serve as well as experience some of the other hold and cold food they offer at the cafe."
