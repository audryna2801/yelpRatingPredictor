5,"Wow! I have been dying to try this spot and it did not disappoint!! I live a block away and only heard great things. It was during COVID so it was outdoors.

I tried the specials that were recommended by the fabulous French waitress (everything that she stated was refreshing and fabulous) and they were wonderful. The escargot was, of course, amazing and the tuna tartare was the best I&apos;ve had. The main course was their special, trout over a refreshing bed of salad and it was amazing. This place is small but quality is absolutely delivered. Very happy! Recommend 100% and I will be back!"
5,"Le Perisian is a great restaurant, especially for it&apos;s location! Our servers were wonderful and they were taking all the proper precautions for Covid. Outside is charming and the food and drinks were delicious. Thank you!"
5,I went there today for brunch. Made a reservation the night before for 2 people. We got to sit inside which i was thrilled about since it was raining. I have to say the screens they put up between tables are great! It&apos;s a small place so hard to operate at limited capacity but they did a great job of maintaining covid safety protocols. The staff was lovely. We were in and out quickly but i&apos;ll definitely return! This is definitely a restaurant that deserves our support
5,"Absolutely spectacular food and not terribly expensive either. I was visiting and craving French food. We got a reservation on Open Table and walked over. We were seated immediately and enjoyed every single aspect of our food. Our meal was fantastic! 

My steak frites were so good. Tender, flavorful steak, crispy fries and this incredible red wine thyme reduction. Oh man, I moved this!

My wife got duck confit and loved it as well. I had a bite and they just nailed it. So well seasoned and prepared.

Creme brûlée was amazing too. How can you go wrong?!

My only complaint was the service was super slow. We waited an inordinate time to pay our bill and the wait to get items was a bit slow too. But the food was so great, it wasn&apos;t a big deal. They were friendly, so that goes a long way."
5,"This place was soo good!

I live in the area and have walked by this place MANY times and always said &quot;I will stop in one day.&quot; 
Well, today I did and I&apos;m so glad I did!

The food was excellent, well priced, and the service was great. Fleur was our waitress and she was so sweet and attentive. 

I went with my boyfriend for a quick local dinner. It was both of our first time we so we didn&apos;t know what to expect. 
We shared the escargot, honestly I think it was the best escargot I&apos;ve ever had. My boyfriend also agreed to that. We also had their soup of the day which was a cauliflower pureed soup, and we shared the pork scallopini with truffle polenta. 
It was all EXCEPTIONAL. 
We will definitely be back and we&apos;re happy we found a great new local spot!"
4,"Came to Le Parisien for a Sunday brunch. 

Outdoor seating was spacious and hand sanitizer was available at each table. The typical brunch options are offered as a part of a 16.95 prix fixe menu, which includes coffee along with the entree. Brunch dishes consisted of the typical egg-based fare including omelettes, benedicts, and frittatas. We loved the crispy fries that came with every dish in the prix fixe! Service was great, as we felt no rush to leave after finishing eating, and the wait staff was very attentive to refilling our waters and coffees. 

Overall solid brunch spot with generous portions but nothing to write home about.

We ordered: 

-Salmon eggs benedict: Hollandaise had a well balanced consistency. English muffin was slightly burnt though.
-Ham and cheese omelette: Great size and loved how they didn&apos;t skimp on the fillings"
5,"I could have easily walked past this place but I&apos;m so happy I was able to dine here tonight.  Very small, but the service and food were really outstanding.  I can&apos;t wait to come back to try their brunch menu."
3,"I found this cute little French spot after searching on Yelp for mussels and based on the great reviews decided to try it out. The place was fairly busy for a rainy Tuesday night. They have an enclosed tarp so we were able to sit outside with no issues despite the heavy rain, the staff was wearing masks and they have hand sanitizer at every table. We got the mussels and the steak frites. The broth in the mussels was really good, I just wish they had added more since it was only at the very bottom of the pot and made dipping very difficult. The mussels themselves were very tiny. The mussels come with fries but the bread was better for dipping in order to really enjoy the broth. I tried my friend&apos;s steak and it was just ok in my opinion. The service was attentive and prompt. Perhaps the amazing reviews elevated my expectations of this place but I was not particularly wowed by the food."
4,Cute little French bistro. My favorite is definitely their Salad Niçoise. The tuna is perfectly seared and dressed. All the veggies are so fresh. Also love their little drink menu with simple French cocktails. Never skip dessert. You are at a French restaurant after all.
5,"I came here for a date night on Valentines Day weekend. I was able to make a reservation easily off Yelp. They sent a few reminders beforehand for the reservation which I appreciated.

When we walked in, the place was a bit small and tables are pretty close together. The waiter seated us right away. The lady told us all of the specials of the day such as duck breast, etc. 

HIGHLIGHTS: French Onion Soup &amp; Bistrot Steak Frites with Grilled Shallots in a red wine thyme sauce. 

French Onion Soup: It was good enough for 2 of us as an appetizer. There was a huge layer of melted cheese on top and soup tasted savory. They also gave us bread on the side with butter.  

Bistrot Steak Frites with Grilled Shallots: Steak with fries, grilled shallots, and a salad. I would come back here and get this again!! The steak was cooked perfectly medium rare and they cut the steak for you beforehand. The grilled caramelized shallots and thyme on top of the steak made it extremely flavorful. Fries were crispy and salad was refreshing after the steak. I usually don&apos;t finish all my fries but it was so good NOT to finish it. They give you a big portion so we were super full afterwards.

The service was a 5/5! They kept coming to fill up our water when our cup was just half empty and asked if we needed anything, Next time, I will be trying the escargot. Love love love this place."
4,"Adding this place to my permanent reliable dinner go to list! Teeny tiny but alot of charm, this place is not fancy, nor romantic but it is buzzy and homey and we loved it. 

We made a res for 7:30 on a Sat night 3 weeks before our date on open table. Walked in at 7:30 on the dot and table was ready. Note there is no bar or room to wait in so get there no earlier than 5 minutes before your mealtime there is literally no room for waiting but the sidewalk.

Traditional french bistro/brasserie type menu. We had a pitcher/carafe of sancerre ~4 glasses $37. Escargot and duck pate to start. Delish! 

I had the skate with lemon caper sauce, green beans and roasted potatoes. Hubs had hangar steak with mash and brussels sprout special. Both entrees were perfectly executed,big piece of fish and a good sized steak. 

Previous reviews mentioned surly service, we had perfectly lovely and efficient service from the two women managing the room. We were not rushed at all but the place was packed to the brim. Your neighbors will be able to hear your conversation, fyi.

We&apos;ll be back but note if your party is more than 4 probably not the right place for you. 

Recommended!"
5,"My go-to brunch spot in Murray Hill when looking for a relaxing brunch with a little bit of booze, but not a crazy amount. For $17 you get a brunch entree and choice of coffee or a drink such as a mimosa. I usually get the eggs benedict and mimosa. The eggs benedict comes with salad and fries, so you&apos;re guaranteed to leave pretty full. The mimosa is fairly light, but it&apos;s great for a wake me up. 

I really like the atmosphere for this restaurant. It&apos;s very cozy, and I think would make a great date night dinner spot. I do feel like I&apos;ve been briefly transported to Paris with the decor, coziness and service. It&apos;s a nice and unique spot in the usually noisy Murray Hill, and I hope to come for dinner sometime. We made reservations for Sunday brunch around 11am. It wasn&apos;t too crowded then, but it&apos;s fairly easy to make a res just in case."
4,"I&apos;m glad I read reviews before I came here because this place is small!  I made reservations 4 hours before I went and I&apos;m glad I did because a huge party came right behind me and they weren&apos;t able to get seated.  My party of 4 was able to get seated but it was very tight.

We shared the mussels (garlic and wine sauce) and it came with fries (obviously).  It was pretty good but I&apos;ve had better.  I ordered the rainbow trout with butternut squash risotto and oh my gosh, it was so yummy!  I would definitely recommend it. 

I will come here - you really get a Parisian vibe."
2,"Made reservations through Open Table for a brunch on a Sunday and we were seated immediately when we came in. Highly recommend making reservations since the place is tiny.

I didn&apos;t try any drinks but my friend got the Bellini and mimosas and liked it.

For my entree, I got the scrambled egg with cured salmon and it did not meet my expectations. The flavor was missing and it tasted very bland. Came with a side of fries and side salad, which were fine. My friend got the Croque Monsieur and liked it. 

For dessert, we tried the Apple Tarte Tatin and it was highly disappointing. Both texture and flavor were not good. We literally took one bite each.

Overall, I didn&apos;t have a good experience."
5,Food was amazing and the service was just as good! The prices were also extremely reasonable will definitely be going back!
4,"Such a cute neighborhood place to grab brunch with friends. They have a prix fixe menu with coffee for a very reasonable price. I tried the ham and gruyere omelette with fries. The omelette was very soft and buttery and you can&apos;t go wrong with ham and cheese. Coffee was good, service was fast, and it was way better than going to a super popular brunch place that had over 1 hour of wait time. Why, people, why?"
5,"We had a great Sunday Brunch here outdoors. The staff really takes care of you and the food is delicious.

We really enjoyed the scrambled eggs with cured salmon. These were a part of their prix fixe menu, which at ~$17 with refill coffee can&apos;t be beat. The fries are really tasty and balanced out by the refreshing side salads. I&apos;m not sure what dressing they used but it pairs perfectly, and it the first thing we finished. 

Overall, the food and ambience at Le Parisien reminded us of our last summer in Paris."
5,Greattttt service delicious brunch !  but the mimosa should come with brunch like at least one . But hey I&apos;m not complaining !
5,"Had a great time here on a Sunday night. This place is a hidden gem with amazing food!!

We had the escargots, the mussels, and the duck confit. Everything was just spectacular! All the food was delicious. I would definitely come here again. It&apos;s a very cozy French place with a great ambiance. You can share a bottle of Bordeaux and enjoy the delicious food here."
5,"Le Parisien is a gem!  What I noticed is it does not bill itself as &quot;Authentic French&quot;,  it just is French!   Le Parisien reminds me of a number of fine brunch and dinner restaurants I visit on my recurring trips to Paris and it&apos;s regions. The owner and hostess/waitress are French and I also - wager - that at least of the chefs are from that country as well.  I can&apos;t tell you how many establishments I have come across that have very little to do with French.


It&apos;s dining area is small, say maybe 10 tables.  Do not be disheartened, just make reservations on Yelp as it is easy.  Their menus are in English.  People of ages appear to know a good thing when they eat in it.   I had Croque Monsieur and asked them to add a over-easy egg so it reminded me a bit of Croque Madam.  Their beet salad with a subtle hint of cinnamon was delicious.  It had little of the lettuce or arugula but it added all the right ingredients to entice one&apos;s palate and keep you wanting more.  

I also understand that Friday evenings they have a nice romantic setup complete with candle light.  I already told my girlfriend about it.

I only wish I discovered it early as I shall return again and again."
