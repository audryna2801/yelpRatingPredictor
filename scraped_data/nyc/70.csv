5,"The food is good...but the staff make this place a solid 12/10. We received such wonderful service from our waiter!! For Covid-19 we were seated outdoors (there is an indoor option and several of the indoor tables were removed to keep with the restriction). We as a table ordered using the meal app they had which made diving up the receipt at the end like a breeze! I got the saag paneer and my husband got the chicken briyani while my friends got the goat vindaloo (spicy--perfect!) and the aloo gobi along with some garlic naan. The saag was good but not spicy (I do prefer mine a but spicy). We also got for drinks a sweet lassi, mango lassi, and the gulabi (a virgin version of a gulabo(?)). If you love lemonade get the gulabi it is soooooo good!!! As a note using the app you need to add a comment to get the mango version. The biryani is cooked in the traditional method (see image). Finally we got the gulab jamun and it was so delicious. Overall amazing and will come back!"
5,"What an awesome experience at Pippali!!
We went there for lunch and were really impressed by the food and cocktails. We started with cardamom Old-fashion, Gulabo (a must try). Both the cocktails were prepared with so much precision and passion. 

For the food, we were recommended to start with aloo tikki, reshmi lamb kebab, and chilli chicken dry. The aloo-tikki reminded me of my old days in Delhi, the lamb keab was drooling in reshmi butter and was so succulent, and the chilli chicken dry was a perfect blend of Indian and Chinese.

We took a break and decided to go for our second round of cocktails, this time we were recommended to try the Indian Sparkle. This drink is hands down my favorite cocktail now; I will recommend people to definitely give it a try. A perfect blend of vodka, st. germain, pineapple, prosecco, and the sparkly edible hammered silver makes it a stellar cocktail.

Time came for the main course, and we went with the butter chicken thali and the kerala moilee fish curry thali. Both the thalis were amazing but I have to say their butter chicken, dal makhni, and khameera naan are outstanding. 

At last, how can I forget our host - Sudipta. He not only suggested us awesome cocktails and starters, but also shared his amazing experience/stories. It felt like a true food and cultural immersion.
Impeccable hospitality by the host, stellar cocktails, and authentic delicious food makes it a winner and we will recommend to all out friends:-)"
4,"If you&apos;re in the city near Flatiron and craving Indian food for a decent price, this is where you should go. We made an indoor dining reservation for Saturday 5:30pm.

The tables were 6 ft apart. It was a nice quiet night. We ordered sparkling water, samosa, chicken tikka massala, chicken bryani, south indian chettinadu duck, naan, and 2 orders of mango lassi. 

I didn&apos;t give a 5 star review because the restroom smelled a bit. Feel like if they opened at 5pm and we&apos;re the first ones in, there shouldn&apos;t be much of a stench. Think the restrooms could use an aroma (fragrance sticks) or a circulating air freshner. Nothing special regarding the decor inside. The lights are dim and walls are plain white. 

Overall they got great service and super attentative. The kitchen seemed busier than the dining area. They were getting online orders and calls for take-outs and deliveries compared to the dining service, which makes sense since most people are not comfortable dining inside nor want to eat out in the cold."
4,"Been there few times to dine-in. Due to covid, we ended up ordering up, I missed their ambience, but I must say that food was as delicious as dine-in. 
Daal Makhani and Jaipuri kofta are my all time favorites. 
Chole samosa chaat wasn&apos;t bad, if you want to try it out, then make sure to ask for more chutney&apos;s on the side. 
We tried their jackfruit biriyani and it was delicious! Jackfruit is so much like meat just a healthier version :) The biriyani was flavorful and aromatic. 
The curries had a smaller portion. Biriyani was good enough in portion."
4,"Indoor dining in NYC is back and I can&apos;t get enough of it! Not only are the drinks (Mumbai Mule with candied ginger) and food delicious (loved the chicken tikka and lamb vindaloo), but Pippali&apos;s commitment to safe, social distanced indoor dining is sublime.

There were only about 6 maximum indoor tables further than 12&apos; apart. Everything could be ordered very quickly by selecting items on the website--all with generally fast service. My only reason for not giving 5 stars (and I am a pretty tough reviewer) is that non-standard menu items, such as extra salt, took a long time to be delivered. 

Would recommend to any fellow Indian or spicy food lovers!"
5,"I&apos;ve been here a couple of times, and I&apos;ve enjoyed it both times.  Service is extremely friendly.  Mango lassi is thick and delicious.  Butter chicken has that traditional flavor, but richer and creamier.  Biryani is also awesome.  The portion sizes are a bit on the small side.

The seating is a bit cramped."
5,My husband and I went for a food ! The place was clean and we were not that hungry so we just ordered the papdi chaat and dum biryani ! And we really loved their dum biryani ! Definitely go there again to try out new food
5,Diwali night had to be special and we couldn&apos;t think of any other place but Pippali. We went there last Friday when the 10PM curfew for restaurants had been put in place. Despite that the staff was super nice to welcome us even though we got their at 9:30PM. We dined in and enjoyed our appetizers with a glass of wine and ordered our mains to go. Nonetheless the experience was great and made our Diwali night special. We got the Malai Paneer tikka with a glass of Malbec and the Fish Koliwada with tamarind and mint chutney (this was just amazing) for appetizers. For mains we got the Kadhai Paneer (again delicious)
5,"Had an lovely Indian meal at Pippali. We came here after our visit in Central Park, and decided to have a nice dinner in our last few days in the City. Luckily we found this amazing Indian restaurant around the corner and made our way here. 

I&apos;m filling in this review late, revisiting my visit and eats from New York City. So glad we found this Indian restaurant, since it&apos;s very hard to find a decent Indian restaurant which get their flavours and spices right. 

We started off with appetisers, we got malai paneer tikka. Which was so delicious and the quantity was right for about three people. Then we got the chicken biryani, which came in this dish covered with roti, which we had to poke in to get to the biryani. So cool! We obviously got dessert, because no meal is complete without dessert! We got gulab jamun, which came with four pieces really good quantity for the price. 

I loved the ambience here and cost wise is also worth it!"
4,"the place is open for outdoor dining. COVID19 safety measures include partition and adequate distancing between tables, and staffs wear mask and gloves. the chef is Bangladeshi and I heard from a friend he used to work in Michelin star restaurant or that sort. 
the outdoor dining experience was nice, although from the window they seem to have pretty interior decor... anyway, let&apos;s talk food. they gave us popadom with chutney and tamarind paste (pre-order snack? haha)
we ordered Aloo Samosa Chaat &amp; chicken tikka for appetizer. the Chaat was delicious - seasoned well, the spice was balanced, and it&apos;s refreshing. the chicken tikka was very tender and juicy, but the it would have been better if the spices were stronger. for entree we had Palak Paneer and Murg Tikka Masala. Palak Paneer was soo good (btw paneer is cubed cottage cheese with tofu-like texture) esp. with naan bread (we had garlic naan). but the Murg tikka masala was even better (esp. with rice). 
even though it doesnt look like much by the end of the day i had food coma. and all for only $20ish which was a very good price!"
4,"Came here with friends and overall experience was good.

I felt a little rushed with their service in the beginning but felt better after we got our food. We shared a naan, butter chicken and chicken tikka masala between the three of us with two bowls of rice (which cost extra).

Please be careful on what you order, our waiter wrote down extra sides without telling us they cost extra - my friend had to ask him before confirming to keep it on our order. Also be aware of what cost extra, we reconfirmed our order to ensure we weren&apos;t receiving any hidden fees later on. 

I don&apos;t have a high spice tolerance so I was satisfied that the food wasn&apos;t spicy. The food was filling and still had a bit of curry at the end for me to take back home."
3,"Ended up going here for dinner after my bf decided it looked so good, we had to. 
I unfortunately can&apos;t say I was too impressed, perhaps it was our choices. I loved how beautifully presented the biryani was in the pot with the bread on top, but ours seemed to be a bit under cooked and the taste of saffron was a bit strong for my taste. The eggplant dish was nothing special, and way too spicy for me to be able to eat and fully enjoy. I ended up eating white rice with the eggplant sauce mostly.
The carrot halwa dessert was the highlight of my night. I loved it so much that I looked up the recipe and made it at home.
I&apos;m giving it three stars because: the food was unexpectedly too spicy for us both, (and my bf loves spicy food), I didn&apos;t enjoy their seemingly special biryani rice pot, and because of the number of options around the area, I will probably default to others instead."
1,"Business conduct was horrendous, and food is subpar versus other neighborhood spots. Please go elsewhere unless you want to support a business that steals from their customers.

My husband and I came ~15 min late for our noon reservation. When we entered and provided our name, the employee&apos;s only response was &quot;you&apos;re late&quot; despite the restaurant being 80% empty. It was all downhill from there.

We both ordered the lunch thali for $16. The chicken tikka masala was a bit on the dry side and the vegetables that came with the thali were room temp bordering on cold. We also ordered a mango lassi ($3) to share which was tasty but when the check came, they charged us $4 for it.

Mistakes happen, so we pointed it out to the employee in charge of the front of house. Instead of offering a correction, he told us that he&apos;ll &quot;give us a dollar next time.&quot; ?!

What sort of business tries to steal $1 here and there from unsuspecting customers? I&apos;m surprised they&apos;re still in operation.

On another note, they have two one-person restrooms, which are marked with a small &quot;M&quot; and &quot;W&quot; (but otherwise indistinguishable). The &quot;W&quot; was occupied so I used the &quot;M&quot; and upon exiting, an employee accidentally shoved the door into me. Totally okay, but instead of apologizing, he said &quot;you should have used the women&apos;s restroom.&quot;

Pippali, you need to train your staff to adhere to NYC law. While I do identify as being female, that is something you cannot say to your customers without prior knowledge of their gender identity. (Also, it&apos;s just rude and unnecessary.)

1,"I hate giving 1-star reviews, but it is certainly appropriate for this restaurant. First, the portion was very small, certainly for the price. If it had tasted good, it would not have been an issue. But, the taste was awful. It was drenched in thick oil that pooled at the top (see picture). I have never ordered Indian food that was drenched in this much oil before. Almost inedible. The chicken was very dry and tough, and the sauce tasted very oily and gross. I do not know how this restaurant has such good reviews, the food is really terrible."
3,"Lunch meal on weekday, went with reservation. Different variety of Thalis (assortment of curry, with rice, lentil, salad, etc in one big serving plate) offered. Vegi, Chicken and Goat Lamb are categories but more variety in those high level categories. You just need to select entree, rest is all pre-fix.

Reasons for 3 stars- Nothing great!! Tried 2 thalis  -
Non-veg - Lamb curry - was just average 
Vegi - Malai Kofta - again average 

Other items in Thali - Dal, Saag, Potato curry, desert (Kheer) all tasted usual, nothing to crave about. Good joint if you wish to eat average home cooked type of meal from Indian standards."
2,"Yelp, you got us again!

Three of us went to Pippali for lunch to celebrate a birthday. We chose Pippali for its great reviews.

The food wasn&apos;t bad but it wasn&apos;t especially remarkable. It lacked spice. We all ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala which came with a ton of food; Vegetables, lentils, salad and naan. 

The biggest problem was after the meal. All three of us had a variety of stomach issues, ranging from discomfort to declaring war on the bathroom. Very surprising for food that was so bland.

I don&apos;t think we will come back."
4,"My only problem with this place is that it was a little too warm for my liking. I came with my friend about two weeks ago, and I was still sweating upon entering. I think the air conditioning works here, but it&apos;s not too strong. This might be a restaurant to visit on a day that isn&apos;t too hot, because you might need it when eating hot food. Make sure to ask them for the ice water. 

The lunch deal is the way to go here. There are a lot of great looking items on the dinner menu, but it&apos;s not as good of a deal as the lunch, which is only like $10.95-11.95, and gives you a ton of food. I ordered the chicken lunch set, and got the degh murgh (my friend got the kolhapuri), and I tried some of his- both were very good.

The lunch set (known as thalis) are served with rice, bread, lentils (dal), saag, and some other vegetables of the way. The stuff all tastes excellent, and though the saag tastes a little funny/strong, it pairs excellently with the naan. You also get a small rice pudding. It&apos;s honestly a lot of food, so you get a good bang for your buck. Sure, you can actually visit AYCE buffets here in curry hill for just 1 dollar more, but the quality here is pretty high. Totally would come back. 

The only thing I would recommend to these guys is to fix the air con."
3,"Came here for dinner with a group of friends. Service was great, but I thought that the food was pretty average given the price and lacked flavor/spice. The palak paneer was a little bland, the jaipur kofta had a flavor that we didn&apos;t quite like, and the butter chicken was pretty standard. Of everything we ordered, the chana masala was probably my favorite."
5,"Walked in at 6:30 on a Saturday and we were able to get a table right away, but it filled up over the next hour and was pleasantly full but not too loud. 

- Peshwari Boti Kebab for an appetizer is a MUST
- Lamb vindaloo was tender, spicy, and wonderful 
- Aloo Gobi Mattar had tender vegetables with great spice, wish it had a little more sauce 
- Garlic naan was nothing super special or out of the ordinary but great nonetheless"
4,"Four years later and I had yet another terrific meal at Pippali!  Sure, it might have taken a bit too long for our food to arrive, but it was worth the wait.  In the meantime, we enjoyed sitting in the upscale dining room and crunching into salty papadums with their accompanying sweet and herbaceous dipping sauces.  

In terms of the main event, I loved my tandoori-grilled Kesari Murg, which included tender pieces of chicken that had been marinated in saffron and ginger, prior to being cooked in the restaurant&apos;s special oven.  The sauce-less dish was light, but packed with aromatic flavor.  My boyfriend&apos;s Lamb VIndaloo, however, was served in as a saucy stew with an ideal balance of garlic, vinegar, and red chili paste.  We also had decided to share a Yellow Dal Tadka, which had been seasoned with cumin and garlic, but could have used more of those added ingredients.  

All of these hearty dishes were perfect toppings for the included Basmati Rice with green peas and the several varieties of bread that we had ordered.  The Kashmir Kulcha was fluffy and packed with sweet, dried fruit, while the Chili Garlic Naan was hot and zesty. 

We were extremely full by the time we left Pippali, but we were also satisfied by just how delicious our meal had been.  Despite there being a wealth of Indian restaurants in the Curry Hill neighborhood, this one would be worth prioritizing!"
