5,"Adding on to the rave reviews - yes, come here. There isn&apos;t any outdoor seating, so we sat inside where there are plastic shields and felt comfortable enough. We got the tonkotsu and spicy tonkotsu ramen, which were both good - tonkotsu had the deep, rich flavor while the spicy version had enough of a kick to satisfy me (too spicy for girlfriend though). Waiter recommended the thin ramen noodles, but interested in the other noodle options that are available - 5-6 different options!

We used the yelp check-in for the green tea ice cream, and it was so good! We were really surprised at the quality given that it was free - the taste was heavily green tea, without the bitterness (not that that&apos;s bad). Forgot to ask them what brand they use - it was that good.

Also, shoutout to Aiden! He was so attentive and FUNNY, and kept us laughing during our entire meal. We may be regulars here just because of him!"
5,"As you can see from the 1800 other reviews, this place is legit. I got the 3 roll lunch special and a side of chipotle mayo. The total was 13.07.
Service was friendly and quick, food was delicious. Really everything you could ask for in a takeout lunch spot. I&apos;ll definitely be back (probably next week) and I recommend Zen Ramen &amp; Sushi to anyone. The time of writing this they have indoor and outdoor seated available in limited capacity as well if you are interested in eating there."
5,"I finally found my go-to sushi delivery spot!!... I always check health grade (A) as I feel that reflects cleanliness of the establishment. They delivered in good timing (~40 min) and the sushi was freshhh! Mind you It was after 9:30 pm! 

I ordered the Spicy Mama and the Davidson roll. The spicy mama was delicious!! I truly enjoyed it, it was creamy and flavorful and the asparagus was cooked through, no bitterness which some places have from using that particular vegetable. The Davidson wasn&apos;t my cup of tea but I don&apos;t enjoy seared tuna- my hubby loved it though! 

I look forward to ordering from here again."
5,"This place is great!
Ramen is so delicious and authentic, service is quick and helpful!
Go there, you will never regret!;)"
4,"I came here with a friend after we enjoyed taking in Macy&apos;s holiday display windows. We went when indoor dining was still an option, so we took advantage of that. The interior was spacious and the tables were a good distance from one another. I liked the lanterns and pretty painted wall with cherry blossoms and depiction of people towards the front of the place, as well as the dangling lights near the bar area. There was a very warm ambiance throughout the restaurant.

I ordered the Pork Katsu Bento Box, which came with salad, California rolls, shrimp shumai, and rice - I asked for brown rice, as opposed to white rice. The salad came with cherry tomato and a tasty ginger-y sauce. The pork katsu was delicious and delightfully crispy, tender, with nice seasoning. I really enjoyed the shrimp shumai with soy sauce. The shrimp filling was wonderfully fresh. They were little morsels of yumminess. The California rolls were classic, consisting of cucumber slices, imitation crab, and avocado. I am not a fan of avocado, but I liked the rolls. 

With my Yelp check-in, we were given free ice cream. I chose to try the green tea flavor. The generous scoop of green tea ice cream came with a beautiful dollop of smooth and velvety whipped cream. The ice cream was so very creamy, with authentic taste of green tea, therefore it wasn&apos;t too sweet. The whipped cream paired perfectly with the ice cream, adding an additional level of flavor. 

Our waiter, Jimmy, was great! He was friendly, on top of everything and made sure we were taken care of.  Also, we thought that our bento box meal would be $18, but we were only charged around $12, which was a great surprise! We had arrived in time for the lunch special. I would happily return, as there are so many appetizing sounding menu items!"
5,"Amazing happy hour! Where do you find a place that has happy hour until 8pm?

I had 2 drinks and they were super strong (lychee martini and Tokyo iced tea). Food wise, we tried the fried chicken (super crunchy and delicious), edamame, seaweed salad, yellowtail with scallion...everything was delicious. 

No, I didn&apos;t try the ramen here cus it wasn&apos;t on the happy hour menu. But I will return again for that.

If you are looking for an amazing happy hour, this is the place. And Jimmy, the server was amazing!"
5,"Omg we love this place!! First things first we did not make a reservation. You must wear a mask until seated.

We can twice before I could even write a review!!

If you love ramen, say no more!! This is your place!!

I ordered the spicy beef ramen and the salmon sashimi!! The ramen is spicy so if you don&apos;t like spice ask for mild!! I went all in and I couldn&apos;t be happier!! The Salmon was buttery and melted in my mouth!!

We highly recommend this location very affordable they get $$ for me and the service was outstanding!! We highly recommend this restaurant!!"
5,"I came in here to celebrate my birthday! For a place in Manhattan, 3 rolls for $11 was an absolute steal. The food was good and the service was amazing. I will gladly come here again. Super nice people who made sure everyone was safe during this pandemic. Temperature checks for everyone!"
5,"Absolutely delicious!

Covered, spaced out, outdoor seating. Super friendly employees!

As soon as we got there, we were seated right away and given a huge mug of green tea to keep us warm! 
Went here after seeing amazing reviews- and Their ramen is definitely one of the best in NYC. Veggie ramen was on point . Tasted fresh, perfectly spiced, and large portions! 

Would highly recommend- Can&apos;t wait to come back here"
4,"It is bit difficult to judge the whole experience given the times and outdoor dining in the rain, but the tonkotsu and shoyu were delicious~ not too salty for my tastes, shoyu with a slight smoked kick, a savory soup. Our choices of sushi, perhaps not the most popular. The display not the most elaborate, and the sushi not a beautiful display (in the Instagram worthy way) but tasted pretty good. Not the best but a few steps above average. The karaage was decent and gyoza average (the gyoza sauce was, however, delicious!). Won&apos;t be my favorite go-to, but I would definitely visit again.

(The wait is long too given very limited outdoor seating and quite the popular spot!)"
5,"Actual 4.75 out of 5. This is a rare instance in which I am okay eating at or ordering from that does sushi, ramen, and shumai (Cantonese dim sum). I have nothing but good words and wrote down why I think they lost half star.
What I ordered: Tonkotsu Ramen with extra noodle, egg, and fish cake, so I can make a second serving later and Chicken Karaage. The half point was lost in the Karaage.  This a Grubhub order so I changed my scoring categories: food, price, portions, packaging, and service speed. 
Food 4.5/5
Ramen
Love: Ramen broth is not loaded with what I would call &quot;mouth-drying MSG for hours&quot;
Love: Free edamame side of a generous size
Chicken Karaage
Love: Cut into smaller pieces and not overly fired
Improvement: No flavor (the dipping mayo-like sauce helped and lemon is always nice, but there was literally no flavor in the chicken itself)
Price 4.5/5
Ramen cost $18 before any extras
Chicken Karaage cost $11 
I believe there was enough chicken and noodles to make this worth it! See &quot;Portions&quot; below. 
Portions 5/5
From didn&apos;t realize I even ate to average to I didn&apos;t even need a second serving, I would say above average and closer to didn&apos;t need a second serving 
Packaging 5/5
Everything had it&apos;s own container (the nice almost opaque hard plastic which I will reuse), without being wasteful 
Service speed 5/5
My order was delivered 20 minutes earlier than expected"
5,"Maan, Listen! The food here is always on point!

Just a great big bowl of hearty ramen , to warm your heart ..... after a long hard day of dealing with whatever or  a feeling to be fulfilled .

On this day, I arrived a lil&apos; before closing and the resturant was  packed. And I finally scored a seat, on the  inside!! :-] Yay! 
*small restaurant
-plenty of room to walk 
* decent servings 
* covid compliant 
*friendly staff 
* mix of American pop songs &amp; their traditional music"
1,there is a bug in it.Left side is the bug，right side is a sesame，It is difficult to distinguish but it&apos;s a real bug. Never come again！！！
1,"Very rude host . You would think people would want business after all the Covid craziness but this place was just the opposite. 
We ordered food and then realized there was a happy hour menu which wasn&apos;t given to us. And so we payed more for the food that would have been on the happy hour. She said &quot;next time&quot;

After ordering the food, we were waiting for our lyft to pick us up and it was like 9F outside at night    So in about 2 mins after they gave us the order, the lady asked us to leave the restaurant. It wasn&apos;t a crowded room or anything but the host was very rude in having us leave the restaurant.
Never coming back here!"
4,"I first tried Zen Ramen &amp; Sushi for some carryout sushi before the pandemic hit, but since then, we&apos;ve also been able to try their ramen delivered and WOWZA, this is kind of a gem in this neighborhood and I don&apos;t know why more people aren&apos;t talking about it??

In a city with a lot of ramen options, and even a neighborhood sandwiched between 2 Ichiran locations, Zen has really delicious ramen broth that should not be slept on. There is such a depth of flavor in the spicy tonkotsu and the spicy tonkotsu shoyu, and the noodles are good too, even after transit. Honestly, our experience having trying their ramen delivery has made us so excited to dine in and have it fresh from the kitchen. Some of the more flavorful ramen broth we&apos;ve tried in a while. 

We also like the sushi, as it turns out! They have the standard rolls and some fun rolls that are truly fun. We weren&apos;t surprised to see this appear on a list recently as the most popular ramen in NY according to Yelp, it&apos;s good and the people know it."
4,"An old haunt by work, zen was a form of...wait for it...zen in the form of casual sushi and ramen. I found Zen first as a lunch roll place, but my friend convinced me to give it a full chance. We order the tempura sampler with only vegetables since I was the only meat eater.

My friend got the spicy veg ramen, our coworker got the salmon don, and I got the unagi don accompanied with 2 yellowtail (hamachi) sashimi pieces"
5,Enjoyed this a lot more than I thought I would. Spicy shoyu ramen could serve as 2 meals it&apos;s just so much food. It&apos;s super spicy and hits the spot as the seasons are changing. Favorite part is the hard boiled egg which I didn&apos;t think I would be interested in. The soup also comes with a side of edamame or salad. I couldn&apos;t even eat it because I was so full.
5,My family and I ate here 2 Nights (IN A ROW!!!! ) on our three day trip to nyc. It was simply amazing and you can&apos;t get better food than this. They say it&apos;s the New York water that makes the food great but I think it&apos;s the people running the show and behind the scenes that make the food great. The owner was very hospitable to my wife and two small girls as well and we can&apos;t wait to come back! Thank you!
5,"I choose Zen Ramen because I wanted to try something different than pork broth which a lot of Ramen shops seem to use. Zen Ramen has options of  ramen with pork, beef and bonito broth - I choose beef and I was definitely happy with my meal. Pricer than what I&apos;m use to - it was worth it. 

If you&apos;re looking for something with more options, I think Zen Ramen is worth trying."
2,"I had dinner plans with a friend on a Thursday night and needed a restaurant that was close to Penn Station. Sushi and ramen are usually crowd-pleasers, and I had this place on my bookmark so I thought, why not? We came in at around 6 (no reservations), and the place was already pretty packed. Plus, the layout of the tables has a weird set up, so it&apos;s probably not the most efficient use of space. Still, we were seated immediately. 

To start, we had some chicken karaage from their happy hour menu. It wasn&apos;t the best but it wasn&apos;t the worst either. It was a bit over-fried. For the main, we decided to order a bunch of rolls to share: the Napoleon Roll (Inside Spicy tuna, soft shell crab, mango &amp; avocado, topped with lobster salad and jalapeno), the Lady Gaga (Shrimp Tempura, Eel, Avocado, Top W. Spicy Tuna, Spicy Tuna, Tobiko, Crunchy, Soy Bean Paper &amp; Mango Sauce), tuna avocado roll, and a salmon roll. The two special rolls tasted pretty similar. In fact, I couldn&apos;t really tell the difference between the two. There was just too much going on. I preferred the basic rolls over these. Not enough for me to come back though. Maybe their ramen is better? Either way, I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll be back - my stomach felt a bit funny afterwards so I&apos;m not sure if it was the sushi or something I ate earlier.

Tip - happy hour til 7. But don&apos;t get any of the cocktails. It&apos;s pure sugar. I couldn&apos;t even finish the Tokyo Tea I ordered."
