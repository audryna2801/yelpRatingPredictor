5,"Order:
- Prix Fixe Brunch: Crispy Chicken &amp; Waffle (5/5)

Pros:
- Great value brunch prix fixe menu ~ only $20 for a cocktail, a drink, and an entree 
- Great tasting food ~ the chicken tenders were nice and crispy and the waffles were sweet 
- Cute presentation ~ the food is nicely plated and the silverware were cute 

Cons:
- Small outdoor seating area on the sidewalk ~ I came on a warm fall day so it was fine, but I&apos;m not sure how it is now during a cold December day 
- The menu says you get 2 cocktails, but my friend and I were only offered one

Overall:
- Bubo is a great spot to visit if you want a tasty brunch that won&apos;t hurt your wallet"
5,"Great service, great food...and incredible soap!
We had a wonderful brunch at bubo-we didn&apos;t make reservations but were seated quickly as a party of 4 in a spacious, comfortable and heated covid friendly outdoor space. 
Our waiter, John, was wonderful! Friendly, attentive and funny. We all got a different variation of the prix fixe menu and it was delicious. 
As a side note, if you need to visit the restroom you will LOVE the soap! It smells incredible. Enjoy your visit! We highly recommend!"
4,"Stopped by as a last minute decision because it was very cold out, other places were hella packed and we were hungry. now. Quickly looked at the menu and it looked good. We saw that there were heaters so decided to stay. 

Server was working alone, but still managed to serve, bartend and buss FIVE tables. He was very friendly and efficient. Very impressed! +1 star

Food came quickly and tasted really really good. I had the Greek burgers. Super juicy and the feta inside hit the spot. I added the greens inside and it was the perfect bite. My friend had the zucchini fritters and warm grilled octopus. the Tzatziki was sooo good. you could tell it was made in house. packed with flavor. the octopus was v tender. +2 stars

Bathroom was clean and had really nice smelling soap and large, tough, soft paper towel to wipe your hands! +1 star

Honestly, I&apos;d love to give this place 5 stars but I have to minus one star because the heaters were not on or didn&apos;t work(??). I inquired about it and was told to wait and that it would warm up, but it didn&apos;t the entire time we were there.

Yummm! Brrrr! will be back though, hopefully during warmer times!"
4,"It was a sunny, but cold Saturday and a girl friend wanted to the crew to hang. A friend of ours is a regular at this place and lives a block away so we all decided to meet here. 

Note, this place does not take reservations. It is a first come first serve so if you have a large group like we did (7 ppl), have someone go and hold the table like we did. They have heating in their outdoor dining space, but it was not warm enough for me especially after drinking a boat load of icy cold bloody Mary&apos;s. I recommend bundling up!

Having said that, the food, drinks, and staff are wonderful here, which explains why my friend is a regular here. The drinks are really strong and the staff is so friendly. I love my Flying Cock, which is a block away from here, but the staff can be a bit transactional. Here, everyone is just so friendly. It is like going over someone&apos;s home and just hanging out, but obviously there is a bill to pay at the end of the moment. Two thumbs up for this place and one of few, if not the only, places I would freeze my butt off dining and drinking outside."
4,"This place has great art and a pleasant atmosphere, I came here with a date on a friday night and it was quite busy, we sat at the back and I notice they could just do a little more effort with dimming the lights to make it look like a lounge. I ordered a whiskey and the zucchini fritters, the food was ok but maybe they should have more vegan options. They have  a good variety of cocktails as well."
2,This place is AWESOME! It&apos;s a great vibe aesthetically and the food and drinks are amazing. John the bartender provided excellent service and represented Bubo well. Will without a doubt come here again for Happy Hour
4,"Cute Greek/Cypriot spot in midtown.

I stopped by here with a friend recently for a drink and some appetizers. The decor is cute and intimate. My friend had the meatballs, which are apparently amazing, and I had the Greek fries with feta cheese. The fries were all right - I imagined real Greek fries, think cute and covered with seasoning and feta, but they were American fries with some pieces of feta on top.

I would recommend this place and will be back."
5,"Decided to stop by today for Brunch. They have a great deal of 2 mimosas or 2 Prosecco, an entrée, and a beverage (OJ, tea or espresso) for only $19. On top of that, our waiter John was awesome. Super friendly, attentive and fun. Definitely one of  our new favorites in the neighborhood!"
4,"Passed by this place a few times and I decided to try it out. I went for Valentine&apos;s Day and I&apos;m glad I did. Very nice place inside. I looked over the cocktail section and decided to do a &quot;Hot in Venice&quot;. Came in a nice, big wine glass with a slice of dried orange on the side. Everything was mixed so well and the drink was pretty strong which I enjoyed. I saw someone get a pretzel so I ordered the cocktail pretzel as an appetizer. It came with feta cheese on it which made it even better. Warm and crunchy. I went straight to the pasta section because I love pasta so I decided to get the orrechiette with chicken and broccoli. It was so tasty and it was well cooked.  The server would check up on me to see if I wanted anything else and helped me pick my drink. The best part of the night was that they were giving out roses because it was Valentine&apos;s Day :) Only thing was that I had to wait a little to be seated since it was Valentine&apos;s Day and they dont take reservations but it was worth the wait. Overall, very good service, good food, good cocktails and good atmosphere! I definitely recommend this place to anyone that&apos;s around the neighborhood and I will be going back soon."
5,"Hidden brunch gem! Steal of a deal for boozy brunch

Overall: 4.5/5
Food: 4/5
Value: 5/5 
Service: 5/5 

On Saturdays and Sundays they have a brunch pre fixe special of $19 for 2 drinks (mimosa or Prosecco), coffee/tea/espresso, and a main (burger, chicken and waffles, or omelette). They have $1 oysters as well, beautifully presented. The quality of the brunch food is great as is the presentation and portion - all 3 options of the pre fixe, and the drinks are solid. The service is outstanding, really conscientious of needs and attentive. The space is gorgeous as well, super upscale and modern - think upscale cocktail bar with high top tables and leather bar stools. Love the vibes. Highly highly recommend this place, what a hidden gem and a steal of a deal! Great value for the quality and experience."
5,"Just happen to stumble upon this place while in Murray Hill and were so happy to have found this gem of a place! We came in for brunch and ended up leaving in love with the place, staff and food. The decor is very classy but not in a stuffy way- dark blue walls and gold trim around the bar area. The food did not disappoint either, our 12 year old had the Nutella Crepes which he loved, I had the chicken and waffles which hit the spot and the Mrs. had the burger which was cooked to perfection. Our server/bartender John was truly the best. He was friendly and was joking around with us throughout our time there. I love these types of places because the food, ambiance and staff are all top notch and don&apos;t break the bank. We had 3 meals and 3 drinks for under $60! Can&apos;t beat that. 
Don&apos;t forget to try the white Negroni- it&apos;s delish!"
5,"Bubo is one of my go-to places for a good drink in Murray Hill. It helps that the food is delicious too!

I&apos;ve been here for brunch, happy hour, dinner, and late night drinks. Everything has always been great.

Brunch: It&apos;s never crowded during brunch and the brunch options are all light, fresh, and delicious. The avocado toast is deceivingly simple, but perfectly seasoned and prepared. Also tried the eggs benedict. The poached eggs were perfectly cooked with a gorgeous runny yolk.

Happy Hour: Weekdays from 4-6:30 PM. Fresh $1 oysters. Not much more to say!

Dinner: Most of what is served is Mediterranean inspired. So far, I have only had the opportunity to try the mussels, charred shishito peppers, and truffle fries with feta. All three were spot on, and prices are extremely reasonable given the quality.

Late night drinks: The bartenders that have served me have always been friendly, but more importantly also made great cocktails. Most of the cocktails are around $12-$14, which is actually quite cheap compared to most of Manhattan. The Boulevardier is honestly one of the best I&apos;ve had in the city!

They have a bar area up front and a larger dining area in the back, which also has its own separate bar.

Bottom line: Highly recommended for both food and drinks."
5,"Best brunch in NYC. Hidden gem in Murray Hill/Kips Bay -as many others have said. Generous pours, a trendy vibe / music, along with the most delicious meals! 

2 mimosas, choice of tea or coffee, and a choice of either an omelette, chicken &amp; waffles, or a burger for $19? no ones done it better!"
5,"It&apos;s Saturday night, the seventeen of us went to Bubo for after dinner drinks.  Loving it here so, we stayed till the wee hours of the morning.

Sophisticated is the interior of this bar at Murray Hill. Creative are their cocktails.  Attentive is the service. Cozy is their &quot;library&quot; semi-private room.

At this writing, I cannot attest to their food. Instead, I will treasure this gem of memorable sweet sips with my peeps of then and for years to come.

CHEERS!"
3,"I ended up stopping by here since most other places were packed. After arriving, all of the booths filled up so it seemed like great timing. The server was quick with everything, and the food (I just had the zucchini fritters and grilled octopus) was great. My main issue is with the lack of heat. They had heaters, but they were not on even after inquiring about it only to be told that &quot;they are on,&quot; when they literally were not. The food got cold quickly. I would have stayed longer and had another glass or two of wine, but it was too cold to stay."
3,"Fancy drinks. Small appetizer menu at happy hour. Not much else. 

Came here to entertain a client - they seemed entertained so that&apos;s a win. At one point we got shushed for laughing. Alas."
5,Only just started going to this local spot but very impressed with this place! Wish I had gone sooner! Burger and Greek fries are so good!  Tons of other delicious food and drinks.  Definitely go!
4,"Came here strictly for drinks so rating does not include food. A friend of mine suggested to meet up here and I was amazed that this place existed as I walk by this place plenty of times. I was pretty taken away by the interior design which gave off a classy high end vibe.

They have a pretty unique line up for beers on tap which changes every so often and a good cocktail menu. The bartender is very friendly and tentative. Prices were pretty standard. Didn&apos;t come here during happy hour so I&apos;d assume the deals are nicer then. Will be looking forward to coming here another time."
5,"Best oysters in NYC! Barnstables from Massachusetts.
Love the jalapeño &amp; Pink grapefruit with

Back at Bubo for amazing Oysters &amp; Tequila! Casa Dragones.
  Getting ready to leave. Beautiful vibe for date night"
5,"I have tried pretty much all the dollar oyster places in the area (between 34th and 3rd to 32nd and 6th ave area) Bubo offers the best quality, hands down! We go there at least twice a week! 

Everyone else here already bragged about how great the food is, I can assure you, it is true. One thing I would like to add is the owner&apos;s attention to details. You can see it from the food, the decorations, restaurant layout,  to the glasses they use. Right from the front, detailed manicured designer flowers, and plants. Without missing a beat, friendly staffs come out with crystal glasses for water (or it looks like crystal). A little bit of heaven in the Murray Hill area!"
