5,Delicious food and awesome service! They adhere to COVID guidelines and have appropriate spacing between tables as well. Servers are all wearing masks and try to isolate tables as best as possible. Food is amazing - can&apos;t wait to come back.
5,"Came here for a Valentine&apos;s Day dinner on the 15th. I&apos;ve been here before with my family and we just love it. 
It&apos;s hard finding good Gujarati food and this place does it right. In the appetizer thali, the dhokla and ragada patties are my favorite. In the dinner thali, the spinach curry and the khadi are my favorite. They ask many times if you want more food so we got some but I wish we could eat more!! 
The staff was friendly and attentive and the atmosphere is one of a kind. 

I will definitely be coming back."
3,"If you&apos;re gujarati, and your mom/grandmother can cook well, then dont bother coming here.  Food is mediocre at best, however the ambiance is an experience.  Worth $34+? Naaaa homie.   No amount of standard veggies (mainly potatoes) are worth that much for a gujarati meal.  

We told them in advance we were there for my dad&apos;s 70th birthday, but nothing special about our experience here.  My sister who lives across the country tried calling and paying for the meal to surprise him, the guy with the manbun up front wouldn&apos;t even hear her out."
3,"I like this place in the city but I wish they change their menu once in a while. I have been coming to this place for a while now and everytime eating the same food gets boring. It&apos;s all you can eat place with amazing appetizers and entrees but by the time entrees is served I am almost full with the appetizers. I think you need a good appetite to get your money&apos;s worth here as it&apos;s $35 plus taxes per person without drinks! Definitely try the Taj Mahal or kingfisher in terms of beer if you wanna try Indian beer. But the last time when I had it, it was probably too much food and the drinks. The ambience and decor is amazing here which cannot match to any place in the city IMO. 

In terms of what we had for food the menu is fixed and you can lookup on the website to see it because it would take me forever to describe like 20+ items served. They do ask you for how spicy you want your entrees to be and in my opinion their Hot is not at all spicy for me. But I guess for general public I think Medium is a good spice level. They do have amazing Indian Chai at the end and yummy ice cream to end your dinner experience. 

P.S they are only open for dinner so plan accordingly and you can call them to make reservations without having to put your card information."
4,"Came here with no expectations because it was for a team dinner. Normally this is outside my comfort zone....since it&apos;s vegetarian. Man was I pleasantly surprised though!

This is an AYCE style in which they bring you the dishes. You first get a tray of appetizers and then a tray of entrees. There&apos;s a great balance of sweet, spicy, savory dishes. I barely got any refills because it was a significant amount of food.

Loved how there was just so much variety in the dishes, almost felt like a tasting menu.

The price is more than I would think for a vegetarian place, but it really exceeded my expectations."
5,"This is a must have dining experience in New York. 

Most Indian restaurants serve a very typical &quot;Indian&quot; menu. Vatan is unique in that it&apos;s a multi course prixe fix menu and the cuisine is not your run of the mill Indian food.

Most surprising was all the food was vegetarian and you can get 2nds on any items you liked. 

This is a must try!"
5,Visited this place when we were in NYC and it amazed me on how beautiful the interiors are and really stands up to the name - homeland . Its a fixed menu when the food is unlimited and they keep filling your plate up . I would go back to eat the kadi and rice that they serve . It comes around $35 before tax per person . I would definitely visit again for good vegetarian food
3,"Meh! I think I went in with very high expectations. And the ambience and decor raised them more. Fancy looking place with a different kind of seating. Mind you that makes going here with infants or toddlers may make if difficult as that means no high chairs. They do have booster seats but that does not do the same job.
They have 3 course all you can eat menu. You can either have pooris or rotis with it. But not a combination.
Appetizers were amazing, dhokla and muthiya stood out.
Main course was a disappointment. The veggies were burnt. Kadhi was an exception though. 
Dessert and tea was good to finish the meal.
This seems like a place to go on special occasions. Mostly for the ambience and feel of the restaurant. Recommend stuffing yourself on the appetizers if you go here."
4,Celebrated daughter&apos;s birthday (Feb). Good food and nice experience. Main highlight was the ambience and setting inside!
5,"All-you-can-eat thali Indian restaurant. My friend was visiting from out of town and he suggested dinner at Vatan since he had been before and had a great experience. We did the all-you-can-eat thali deal that was three courses: appetizers, main, and dessert. It was so delicious and I enjoyed most of what I ate. Eating thali style was a great way to sample a bunch of new Indian foods that I had never eaten before. Our server did a good job explaining what each item in each course was. The thali items were tasty and since it was all-you-can-eat, you could order extras of anything you wanted more of. I shamelessly ordered several extra portions of the mini samosas from the appetizers. Along with the samosas, the spinach and corn entree, the cauliflower and peas entree, and the masala chai were my favorites of the evening.

4,"Vatan is an Indian vegetarian (and kosher I believe) restaurant a stone&apos;s throw from curry hill.

Its Gujarati thali concept means that you don&apos;t actually order off the menu persay. Instead they will bring you a pre-plated &quot;thali&quot; or plate, with a little bit of everything and then you get to choose what you want more of (unlimited). This happens into different courses- First the appetizers and then the main course. I personally really love all their food. They also offer dessert at the end but take your orders for that instead of bringing everything out.

I&apos;ve heard many Indian people who are familiar with the concept complain about the $35 price (likely bc it&apos;s a cheap meal in the motherland) but it&apos;s honestly not that bad when you think about the amount of food you&apos;re getting. 

I think it&apos;s worth visiting but definitely go hungry to get the most bang for your buck. They open at 5:30 pm so I usually skip lunch that day and go for an early dinner, which I walk out of completely stuffed and unable to breathe, but in the best way possible!"
4,This is a NY institution. A true thali place. All vegetarian. Nice decor. You can sit low on tables. Worth going every few years. A bit pricy.
5,"Vatan is one of the last authentic New York dining experiences anyone can have in this town. I&apos;ve been a fan since the 1990s.

The array of Vatan&apos;s colorful dishes is a vegetarian&apos;s fantasy!

Starve yourself, come here hungry, and stuff your face. You won&apos;t run out of food here!

It might not be the tastiest Indian food you ever had, like what your grandma in India cooked, but Vatan is definitely an authentic New York City Indian food experience worth having!"
3,"We&apos;ve been longtime patrons of Vatan. As a gujarati, I won&apos;t say that it&apos;s the best food in the world but it&apos;s definitely nice to have the variety of all your favorite dishes in one place at one time. 
The pre-fixe style allows you to enjoy each other&apos;s company at the dinner table rather than spend time fussing over what to order. 
I was pleasantly surprised that they offer an extensive wine and cocktail list. The highway lassi was great! Definitely worth trying. 

Overall, I&apos;d say this place is worth a visit once every few years, to get that nostalgic village in india feeling. Other than that, don&apos;t waste time on coming into the city/ parking etc."
5,"Did you say &quot;Thali&quot;??
DISCLAIMER: YOU WILL END UP EATING YOUR WEIGHT IN FOOD. 

My husband brought us here for my birthday. And it was a birthday that went down in history thanks to Vatan. Being a Gujarati, I have tried Thali&apos;s back home or when my mom makes. 

Vatan&apos;s Thali is remarkable. The concept of a Thali is NYC is already on a whole other level, but making it &quot;unlimited&quot; and then making sure you are not comprising the flavor of any individual item? Well done Vatan!

We were seated on the upper floor. The loved the décor becuase it was very traditional and definitely added to the aesthetic of the Thali in the village concept. 

To begin, they have an appetizer Thali with all the local street foods and snacks of India and this dish definitely gets you going. Each item has its own distinct flavor and neither overpowered the other. We even ordered seconds of some of these items, like the Khaman and Sev Puri. Little did we know there was still an even bigger feast just down the road. 

The main course Thali comes next and this is filled some traditional curries, roti, dal/kadhi, and rice. Halfway through this Thali, we were stuffed but we could not stop there. We had to have it all! We even ordered some extra items from this thali as well. 

To finish off the meal, for dessert, we had the gulab jamun, ice cream and masala tea! 

I seriously do not know how I even walked out of this place after eating so much food.  

The service was great, the food was great and I cannot wait to come back here again and bring my parents who will definitely love the fact that we have a endless Thali concept here in NYC."
5,"The BEST vegetarian Indian/Gujarati food I&apos;ve had in New York. Very nice and central location in vicinity of Empire State Building. The seating area is far from the door, preventing cold drafts from coming in during the Winter months. First thing that struck me was the décor - you&apos;ll feel like you&apos;re eating in the Sistine Chapel. The walls and ceiling are a mural, and the seating areas are in mini &quot;huts&quot;. The place is very large, very high ceiling, and just a great atmosphere. It&apos;s quite a &quot;royal&quot; set up. 

The host was very kind and welcoming - I was about 15 minutes late for my reservation with a friend (train delays...) but they said it was no problem at all. The bathrooms are very well-equipped, clean, and hygienic as well - there are individual towels to dry your hands, which you can then toss into a laundry bin! I was very impressed. We were served by Swathi, who was super kind and sweet. She made the experience one of the best I&apos;ve had - started out by asking if we had any allergies, and then explained the menu thoroughly. It&apos;s prix fixe ($34) and you can get unlimited refills on any dish you like. You start out with an appetizer platter and a generous array of chutneys, then the main platter (plus rice, khadi, etc.), followed by dessert and masala chai. The batata vada was my favorite of the appetizers, and the chutneys (especially the red one!) pair so well. Swathi came around at all the right times for refills and it felt like our needs were given full attention and we never felt like my friend and I were interrupted or bothered at all. Not really sure what else I can say other than that this restaurant and decor, its servers and service, and of course its food and exceptional variety (20+ dishes and unlimited refills in perfect portions!) ticks all my boxes. 

I will DEFINITELY come again and will certainly bring my friends and family here. Don&apos;t be turned away by the price ($34 prix fixe), it is worth every penny for everything you get compared to similar restaurants in the area. It&apos;s an absolute must-try if you&apos;re anywhere in NYC and want a top-notch quality vegetarian/Gujarati meal and culinary experience. Thank you Swathi and the whole crew at Vatan!"
3,"Vatan is an authentic Gujarati all you can eat buffet. For $35 it is an awesome experience. They start you off with their appetizer thali (dish) and you can certainly get more of one specific app or the whole dish. I would rate the appetizer platter a 5/5. I did truly enjoy the variety. 

Vatan does have a la Carter menu of very few things I did order the pani puri from their and regretted every bit of it. It was bland and lacked flavor salt and any sort of taste. Stay away from it! 

Main course was also a fail for me personally. Though I asked for spicy the food was overwhelmingly sweet. Though I understand the Dal is traditionally sweet and savory in Gujarati cooking this was not that. I would rate the main course below par 2/5. 

Lastly the deserts were splendid! My favorite part of the meal. Though I do it have a sweet tooth the ice creams were delicious! The Gulab jamun was warm and custards something I haven&apos;t come across before. I must have had at least 6 or 7 alone. Followed by a masala chai. I desserts lived up to my expectations certainly a 5/5."

5,"Absolutely amazing! Went there twice, each dishes are difference and very delicious. 
I&apos;m not vegetarian, but will happy to become one if I get to eat this every meal. 
And the service is great as well. Sweet and lots of smile. 
It&apos;s my go to vegetarian place in the neighborhood."
3,"Vatan you go here for ambiance and the whole experience. The service was polite even though the servers weren&apos;t overly friendly. There is a prie fixed menu for $35 each. The food was good not great everything was flavorful but not exceptional. As someone from Indian background it was decent food but nothing I would pay $35 for.  We felt rushed and didn&apos;t really get to enjoy our food. You do get refills of whatever you want, but food was heavy on its own so you won&apos;t really need much. 

Overall it&apos;s a good place to experience Indian Gujarati food but from a price point of view it&apos;s really expensive buffet that looks quite home made."
