5,"I have been here several times, and Cask is definitely one of my favorite places in the area! Great place to dine or just grab a drink.

My staples:
- French fries. The sauce they come with is phenomenal. think it&apos;s chipotle aioli
- Buttermilk crispy chicken sandwich. definitely hits the spot when it comes to a chicken sandwich

Other food items of note:
- Lamb nachos. A nice appetizer to share, topped with sriracha and a white sauce

COVID-19 reopening:
- They are currently offering 50% off food for healthcare workers, which is amazing. Grateful for the gracious discount.
- Instead of physical menus they have a QR code for you to scan to see the menu
- They also have a QR code option on your receipt for payment option so you don&apos;t have to provide your card. You do have to download an app to use this option."
5,"Pre-Covid this place was great for drinks and dates on weekdays. Friendly staff and love the intimate candlelit atmosphere and interior. Went here recently for drinks / dinner and was satisfied, though personally it&apos;s more of a drinks place to me. They have a well priced happy hour as well."
5,"Really really loved this place. Came around the holidays this time last year and it was so cozy and festive with the most gorgeous Christmas decor. We went during SantaCon (lol) and it was the best bar food to round out a day of drinking. Some highlights -- lamb nachos (these were perfection?), brussel sprouts, french fries, sangria. Service was so warm and friendly and the restaurant itself has a lot of seating -- definitely more spacious than most places in the area."
1,"Do not reserve a table here. They may not honor it. I reserved an indoor seating table on Resy. When I got to the restaurant, they claimed I had reserved an outdoor seat. I double checked my reservation email and it was indeed for indoor seating. We were sat outside right under a heat lamp. However in 30F weather the heat lamp did little to nothing. We were both really cold. We also heard several other patrons sitting outdoors bring up with the server that they had reserved for indoor dining. This was not an isolated incident. 

The service wasn&apos;t great. When we noticed our unused glasses had literal lip stains on them(see photo), I was in the middle of notifying our server and she immediately took them away without acknowledging us or the glasses. 

The food was okay. We ordered the chicken pot pie, nachos and the burger. All nothing to write home about. The food got cold quickly in the weather so we didn&apos;t really get a chance to enjoy it. We were both in a bad mood by the time we got the food. 

Overall I would NOT recommend coming here."
4,"This is a solid choice for meeting friends for dinner and drinks or brunch. 

Lots of options, but loved the burger, chicken sandwich and fries. Someone had the Mac and cheese and said it was yummy. 

The drinks were flowing and service was great. 

I&apos;ll definitely be back"
4,"Went for brunch this past weekend with a friend. Because of covid restrictions, only outdoor dining was available. They had a nice setup, with partitions in between some tables and heat lamps on one side. 

Super grateful to the hostess/waitress (didn&apos;t catch her name but she was absolutely delightful) who gave me a tip that the corners are usually better heated than the other tables!

Had the hot toddy, which warmed me right up! Also had the chicken and waffles--came with 2 sunny side up eggs and spicy honey, definitely worked very well together. My friend got the hangover sandwich with fries, looked really hearty and thick. 

Great food and drinks, can&apos;t wait to come back once indoor dining returns to the city!!"
4,"Went here for the first time on friday while looking for something to eat, ended up being pleasantly surprised. Drinks were amazing, I recommend the Harry style cocktail. The Mac and cheese appetizer was amazingggg. The only slight downfall was the entrees. They were okay. Could have been a bit more flavorful. I got the chicken sandwich and my friend got the pulled pork sandwich. But the customer service and the vibes were great. Would come back. :)"
4,"Stopped here for a drink and appetizers on a weeknight. They had a couple of warm options, such as mulled wine, so was happy for that! 

As for appetizers, I recall trying the patatas bravas but unfortunately it was very subpar so wouldn&apos;t get those again. I also like their decor inside now that it&apos;s getting more chilly."
5,"What a lovely spot in Murray Hill! Great for brunch with a whole list of different mimosas, you can even buy pitchers! I ordered a blood orange mimosa which was refreshing and the perfect ratio of juice:champagne. For the table we ordered the patatas bravas which were crispy and came with a yummy spicy aioli drizzled on top. The chicken and waffles was delicious, the waffles were fluffy and the chicken had a little kick to it. My only woe was that the eggs got cold super fast from being seated outside, even under a heat lamp. Overall a great deal, just wish that separate checks was an option but that&apos;s what Venmo is for! :)"
4,"I came here for dinner and really enjoyed my meal. We started with the truffle Mac &amp; cheese which was great. It was very cheesy and the portion size was good. I also had the grilled cheese with French fries. The grilled cheese was huge (since they use 3 slices of bread) and it was so cheesy. It was amazing, but a little too much cheese. The bread was amazing, but it would have also been better with 2 slices of bread rather than 3. However, if you love grilled cheeses it is definitely worth trying this one. The fries were also amazing. My friend also really enjoyed the flatbread."
4,"Super cute place with a romantic vibe. 5 of us came here for drinks and it was great. Prices are what you would expect for the area. The rosemary gin drink (Brooklyn Garden) was delicious, as were the fries!"
4,"Came here for Sunday brunch after making a Resy reservation and was seated immediately. It was a windy day, but the outdoor setup was covered and heated, which made it bearable.  We started with the patatas for the table and they were perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. For my meal, I ordered the hangover sandwich that came with fries, and it was really good! I would definitely recommend coming here!"
4,This is a great brunch spot! The chicken from the chicken and waffles was fabulous! The waffles were a bit soggy but still great portion sizes. I also really enjoyed the blueberry ricotta pancakes. They were the perfect mix of sweet and savory.
5,"Came here for brunch on a Saturday, decided upon the 1k+ reviews it has already received. We were seated in the back of the restaurant as the front was the bar area. They have a pretty cool set up with wooden tables and chairs with a long table in the middle.

Upon being seated, we were given a bag of complementary mini chocolate muffins which appears to be fresh as they were warm. Definitely unique than giving out bread and butter. I got the IPA Fried Chicken and Waffles while my gf got the Eggs Benedict, which they mentioned is their best seller. I definitely loved my Chicken and Waffles meal which came with two over easy eggs. Tasted wonderful and was a filling meal. The Eggs Benedict came with home fries and they&apos;re cooked more on the crispy side which is what I like.

I didn&apos;t come here for drinks, but they look like they have some awesome drink specials, happy hour deals, especially the pitcher deals for 25$ if I recall correctly. Count me in next time someone wants to have brunch here!"
5,"This is a really cute, rustic restaurant in Murray Hill that offers brunch, lunch, and dinner. We were a party of five that went for brunch and we really had a great time! This isn&apos;t your typical boozy, bottomless brunch. It&apos;s a little more sophisticated than that. They have $25 dollar pitchers to choose from, then small plates, salads, breakfast and lunch entrees. Complimentary mini muffins are on the table for when you sit down, so that&apos;s a cute touch. 

For appetizer, we split the fried pickles which was a nice portion. However, the truffle Mac and cheese could probably be split for only two people, it&apos;s a tiny portion (We knew that before ordering because other reviews said that). For entrees, many of us got the fried chicken and waffles. I must say, it was very filling and had great taste. Chicken and waffles seemed fresh- chicken wasn&apos;t over fried. It was topped with scallions and their special sauce. Syrup was on the side with the sunny side up eggs. One person made their own omelette and enjoyed it. 

Overall, the food is pretty good and the $25 pitchers is a good deal. We would go back!"
5,"It is so rare that you walk in somewhere and you are leased with everything. This is a rare find. 
Made brunch reservations for two the night before and were promptly seated when we got there early. The place was decorated for Christmas and it was beautiful. Subtle, yet effective. For app we ordered truffle Mac and cheese which was simply gorgeous. For entree I got the steak and eggs, my husband got the lamb baked eggs. We thoroughly enjoyed our meal with hot tea and cocktail named Elixir which deserves a shout out of its own. To top it all of off is the sever who was the best. She was so friendly, attentive yet hands off. It&apos;s the kind of service I want to get everywhere. The prices were affordable, the food was delicious and the drinks were plenty. What more can you ask for?"
5,"Cask&apos;s Bar is a great place to stop by for drinks and small plates. Although they do have a full menu, the setting can get slightly louder, which may inhibit you from having an undisturbed meal. 
Their Happy Hour is Monday-Saturday 3-8 pm, with select cocktails priced at $8- definitely worth it! 
The service is fantastic. Make sure to check out the bar downstairs for a more private and intimate setting!"
4,"Came here for brunch on a Saturday morning. We were about 15 ish minutes late for our reservation but they still accommodated us. Loved the ambiance - a nice rustic feel on the inside with high table-tops. We got seated downstairs in a quieter setting so that was really nice. It was louder &amp; more crowded upstairs. 

Drinks were yummy - we ordered a couple different pitchers and my favorite was the blueberry Bellini. It had pieces of real blueberries which made the drink look pretty! And it wasn&apos;t too sweet. 

There aren&apos;t a ton of vegetarian options in terms of food. I had truffle Mac &amp; cheese (always love truffle anything) and it was delicious! It comes as a small plate, but if you aren&apos;t tremendously hungry I think it is definitely enough to fill you up. I was worried it wouldn&apos;t be enough so I ordered a SIDE of potatoes. The potatoes were yummy BUT the portion was larger than expected and I was disappointed to find out once I got the bill that they charged me for an entire entree of potatoes for $12. I wish they clarified this would be the case at the time I ordered. 

Also - for any fellow matchbook collectors or phillumenists - this place carries matches! :)"
5,I came here for outdoor dining 2 weeks ago. Delicious food! The staff was very friendly. The Rose Sangria and the Truffle Mac n Cheese are definitely favorites! I got the IPA Chicken and Waffles which came with eggs. I would definitely recommend this place.
5,"We came back after our first visit and enjoyed again.  Our waitress was great.  Service was wonderful.  Food was terrific as well as the drinks.  So the run down of what we ordered.  I had a rosé sangria, my husband the watermelon lemonade.  They were so good, very flavorful and tasty as well as refreshing for a hot NY summer day.  (NYers will know what I&apos;m talking about.)

We decided to get a few things since they&apos;re basically small plates/tapas.  

The watermelon salad was a bit bigger than I originally thought it would be, but was so good.    

The cheeseburger was good, a bit plain, but my husband enjoyed.  Fries were also good, not overly salted.  

Fried pickles were good.  They were a bit over-fried, but good.  The sauce was so good.  

The cheesesteak egg rolls were good as well as the dipping sauce.  

Neither of us liked the mac n cheese, but I saw others enjoying it.  Just wasn&apos;t my thing.  

Smores dessert... mmmmm it was very good.  The crispy marshmallows really give it that campfire goodness that takes me back to my camping days as a child.  

Overall a must visit, you will be pleased.  It can be a bit dark and loud, but not overwhelmingly."
