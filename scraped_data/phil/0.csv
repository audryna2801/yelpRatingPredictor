5,"We were really blown away by our experience with Barbuzzo. Unfortunately, we tried it for the first time during COVID, so we can&apos;t provide much insight to the more traditional vibes and atmosphere, but when we picked up our food, they really did a fantastic job with setting up seating options on the sidewalk. They are creative and safe, and it was busy there. Lots of deliveries getting pushed out and people picking up orders.  So before we even had a chance to eat, we knew we must be in for something good. 

The service was great, and very helpful. We were able to order our food for a specific pick-up time later in the evening, so that was convenient. 

I think one aspect that we loved the most was the variety in their menu offerings. They have full on meat entrees, pasta, pizza, veggie appetizers, etc. Everything we ate had so much flavor and despite it being takeout, the ingredients all still tasted fresh. 

My suggestion would be to start with a pizza, and then build off of there if you want appetizers and main entrees. We ordered the funghi pizza, which had such great texture with the mushrooms, and sweet taste with ricotta and red sauce, but also had a great kick with their pickled long hots. Just a great combination of flavor. We also got the whipped ricotta as an appetizer, and then the gnocchi and caciocavallo stuffed meatballs. The gnocchi is a standout dish - the light garlic white sauce was much more of a compliment than overpowering, and the shrooms/greens helped keep it light. 

Candidly, I try not to get too excited when it comes to meatballs having grown up with an Italian mom and enjoying her cooking, but these come pretty close and are on a totally different level. The serving comes with two, but they are HUGE, and stuffed with cheese, and their short rib and pork packs a punch!

We topped it off with the classic salted caramel budino! This is a MUST get. We would go here just for this dessert. It is the perfect combo of sweet and salty. 

Bottom-line...get this on your list of restaurants to try!"
5,"Food- Quite delicious. The ricotta cheese appetizer was outstanding- I&apos;ve never had a cheese with a sour cream like consistency but it worked! The Gnocchi may have been my favorite (minus the pancetta because I&apos;m a veggie) the flavors were robust and the pasta itself was cooked perfectly- it actually melted in my mouth.
Th pizzas were also good, my favorite part of them was the crust! My only con comment would be that I wish the sauce had a little more flavor on the funghi pizza. The ricotta app and gnocchi really stole the show for me.
Service- The service was friendly and timely and I have no complaints. Food came out quick which was a plus. 
Atmosphere- Your right in the heart of center city so this is the place to go sit outside and people watch. Because of covid I haven&apos;t yet experienced the inside yet."
5,"Barbuzzo was absolutely exceptional. The price to quality ratio was deadass, chef&apos;s kiss! 

The fico pizza is delicious and extremely cheesy, the butter squash arancini is a must try, and the dip platter with pita bread is so filling. I had so much of the pita bread--it was actually divine.

The service was great and the server came back to check-in on us/follow up. I would go again to Barbuzzo in a heartbeat and would try new things on the menu for sure. We got a lot of food and ended the course with the seafood pasta medley, where the shrimp was cooked to perfection but the overall pasta was just fine, compared to how good the rest of the dishes were.

In terms of safety, the tables were spaced apart and they were taking COVID-19 precautions that made the overall experience safe and enjoyable."
5,"OHHH EM G on this spot. We randomly passed by and took a peek at their menu. Some things looked tempting so we gave it a try. I am soooo happy we did and I cannot wait to go back again!
We had the lamb feta dolmades and they were delicious! It&apos;s grape leaves on a different level.At first I was hesitant on trying them but the waiter said they were good &amp; he wasn&apos;t wrong.
I then had their gnocchi which had butternut squash, kale and other delicious ingredients-- the tastiest gnocchi dish i&apos;ve had so far. 
I didn&apos;t even want to eat it all at once because i wanted to have leftovers. I wanted to be able to enjoy it&apos;s deliciousness again. It tasted just as great later on :)"
4,"came here back in november...really great place for mediterranean food in philly! The seafood paella was really the star of the show - it was so warm, extremely flavorful, and the scorched rice on the bottom was really out of this world. The butternut squash arancini was also too DIE for and super cheesy with a crisp exterior. You really can never go wrong with arancini!
The roasted beet salad was surprisingly SUPER yummy, and made me realize that I actually liked beets... the pistachio pesto on top was also immaculate.
The conchigle negro (squid ink pasta), however, was a little disappointing. Not that flavorful with a bit of a strange flavored after cooling. For dessert though, the bread pudding was PERFECTION. So flavorful, decadent, the perfect texture and paired extremely well with the ice cream-- 10000/10"
4,"COVID Note: Staff was all wearing masks, booths felt safely separated

Loved our experience here!  We ordered the French Farmer and Blood Orange Mint Punch for drinks (both very refreshing) and got the focaccia, whipped ricotta, arancini, uovo pizza, roasted beet salad, and paella for food. I thought the arancini could have used a bit more flavor but everything else was perfect. The focaccia and beet salad are must haves. We all left so full and happy!"
4,"This spot is perfect for a winter date night! They have half-open personal tents with heaters that keep you pretty warm! We got the fungi pizza, the grilled octopus (was kind of like an octopus salad), and the stuffed meatballs. We also had their hot mulled wine to help with keeping us warm. Everything came out amazing! I don&apos;t know what i expected for the grilled octopus but it came out with much more than grilled octopus and was all delish! The pizza was hot and crispy and the meatballs were too good to even take a picture! Had to eat them up &amp; they were ginormous! I&apos;d come back to try more on their menu!"
5,"First dinner rez in Philly did not disappoint. Was seated very soon after arriving. Didn&apos;t care much for the flickering street light, not good for those who can suffer from this sort of thing. 

Ordered a nice glass or Sangiovese and several items to try.

The beet kale salad was incredible! I love kale and red and golden beets, the dressing, cheese and nuts were super delish. This is a must order in my opinion.

Ordered the spicy pizza and butternut squash gnocchi, then proceeded to dip my pizza crust in the sauce - sooooo good!!! The pizza is so tasty, and they say you can tell a good pizza by its crust this crust was super yumm.

The items came out at a staggered rate and a bit slow but it provided time to enjoy the atmosphere on a Saturday night. 

I skipped dessert since I was getting something from elsewhere but everything was perfection here. 

The best meal I enjoyed in the city this past weekend."
5,"Please stop in for brunch if you&apos;re in the area. The menu is very different than your normal brunchy items but it is so worth it. 

The whipped ricotta is to die for. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve had something so tasty thus far, I wish I knew how they made that because man I&apos;d eat it all the time. My food item was the Autostrada and it was very good!
 
It seems like a very popular place, so please be prepared for a short wait. Don&apos;t say I didn&apos;t warn you haha. But they move pretty quickly."
5,"Now I dont know if it&apos;s just because I haven&apos;t dined in a philly restaurant in a while but damn I enjoyed this meal a TON!!  Decided to have an impromptu date night and they delivered!! Started with the shaved brussel sprout salad and cheese stuffed meatballs. Ended with maybe the beat gnocchi Ive ever had (and I used to live in Italy!!) And wifey had the branzino.  The salad was the perfect way to start the meal. Light, crisp, perfectly seasoned.  The meatballs were amazing as well. This damn gnocchi has me allll in my food feelings! The most tender gnocchi with sweet potato, kale, mushrooms and a bit if pancetta.  Just sublime!!  All in all, amazing meal!!"
4,"I came here for happy hour and got the cocktails and papas fritas off the happy hour menu. I also got the stuffed meatballs, chonchigle negro (squid ink pasta with shrimp), and the famed caramel budino to round out my dinner. Overall I thought the food was good and it seemed like a lot of thought had been put into it. Good quality ingredients as well. However I thought the dishes were overall lacking in flavor contrast, and don&apos;t think I would go if it weren&apos;t happy hour given the portions and how everything is priced. I also don&apos;t know how much of how my experience was influenced by all the reviews here -- I&apos;d heard so much about Barbuzzo and the dishes (particularly the budino) that by the time I actually tasted the food I felt like it was a little overhyped. The highlight for me was probably the $5 cocktail - very refreshing and a great deal! Overall a decent dining experience though."
5,"Service was excellent. The staff was polite, attentive, quick, and understood when to just let us breathe and chill. Each food item tasted like the best I&apos;ve had. Meatballs so tender I question if it&apos;s actually containing all of those meats, the ricotta was super creamy but light at the same time, and the arancini was crispy and filled to just about the amount of cheeses and rice that I needed. Ahhh, all so good. Maybe add just a little more bread for all the bread containing plates and starters? That&apos;s about the only thing I&apos;d say if being super picky, but GREAT PLACE for a double date, group catch up, and etc. I&apos;m not sure why, but I think having 4 people is the move here."
4,"I had a reservation for two on a friday night, at 6PM. We got seated promptly and there is a QR code to scan for the menu. We ordered lobster croquettes, salsiccia pizza (wood-roasted fennel, san marzano tomatoes, mozzarella, house-made garlic sausage, basil, parmesan), and caciocavallo stuffed meatballs. I really enjoyed the lobster croquettes, as it was very creamy inside. The gnocchi was delicious as well, although I am not a huge pasta fan. I do wish the pizza was less burnt and more crispier on the bottom. I have read some reviews saying the exact same thing -- that would be my only critique. The meatballs were way bigger than expected but was very tasty and filling. 

In all, we left extremely full and the prices were very reasonable for dinner. The staff was also friendly and the food came out at a good pace. The atmosphere of the restaurant is very busy and lively, as it is right in the center of the city."
5,"Highly suggested! 
We also had the whipped ricotta as an app which was also very good. Survive was great thanks Christopher P!"
4,"Went here for an early birthday dinner. Host was very welcoming and the server was attentive (2/8/21 for a 6:30 reservation). We were sat upstairs in a very cozy area of the restaurant with a window which I appreciated. I ordered the gnocchi without pancetta since I&apos;m vegetarian and it was delicious and filling. We ordered the Tito&apos;s basil lemonade and orange purée cocktail as well. The only thing I would knock off points for was the ricotta; it was tasty, but for $12, they only give you 4 small slices of bread, whereas at Charlie Was a Sinner, it&apos;s $10 and they give you twice the amount."
5,"I was new to this city and I had not tried many places but this place came to be one of the best restaurants I&apos;ve been to.

Mediterranean food and service at this spot was great, their staff were so attentive and also our waiter had a good knowledge about the menu and helped us with some good suggestions. They had large portions for reasonable rates.

The place was so clean with a fresh atmosphere.
I highly recommend this place to who ever wants a good meal in a great worthy environment."
5,"The chicken liver, Ricotta wiped and the paella was very gooooood. We had such an amazing experience at this place. Recommend for any one near by!"
5,"This place is worth it! Barbuzzoo is COVID friendly and the service was amazing with everyone from the hostesses, waiters, and food runners being very friendly &amp; the food coming out quickly.  We were disappointed when we got there for our 6:30pm reservation that we were not seated in the outdoor tented area but instead were seated at a table behind it.  The tables each had a heater next to it so the cold was manageable.  Despite our seating, the food and drinks were excellent!  The meatballs were a 10/10 &amp; would recommend them to anyone.  They come with 2 big meatballs with cheese in the center.  The pizza was phenomenal as it was light and doughy with the sauce having a great spice.  I will definitely be back.  Great place for girls or date night as its on a happening street with music playing and people all around.  I&apos;d say dress for the cold if your planning on going later in the night and just in case you are sitting at a table not in the tented covered section."
3,"*This review is for Barbuzzo amidst the COVID-19 Pandemic*

Barbuzzo is currently offering takeout only from 4:30pm-8:30pm through their website Tuesday&apos;s through Saturdays. That being said if you need to reach them for any reason, don&apos;t even bother. Once you place your order their is no way to edit anything or get in contact with their staff, which is super annoying. 

I had placed an order on Sunday for 4:30pm thinking they were open, only to get down there and realize they weren&apos;t open until Tuesday. I found it kind of weird that aside from the date change, their website didn&apos;t really alert me in any way that they were going to be closed that day, nevertheless that my order would be fulfilled two days later. I tried to call them on Tuesday thinking that there was probably someone around to either edit or cancel my order but .... no answer. Emailed them, no answer. Messaged them on Instagram, no answer. Understandably I totally screwed up, but what if I was no longer able able to pick something up? I had placed the order for 4:30pm, and wasn&apos;t able to get down there until 6:00pm on Tuesday because I work and wasn&apos;t able to reach anyone. It was really bizarre. 

I decided to try the Salted Caramel Dalgona Coffee which a twist on the viral Dalgona Coffee and their famous Budino dessert and if I&apos;m being honest... it was okay at absolute best. I think the hype was too big to transfer the legendary aspect of the Budino to a coffee drink. If they crushed the ice versus left it in large cubes I think it would&apos;ve been better, but it was gone in about 3 sips and mostly ice chunks. I would definitely suggest that (after you get your pictures of course) you mix it up so that the salted caramel isn&apos;t just sitting in top, rather, evenly distributed. 

Overall experience with the restaurant was lacking as well as the drink. When I arrived for the pickup, the guy even noted that it said 4:30pm and when I explained that I had tried to call and couldn&apos;t get ahold of anyone he half chuckled and said &quot;oh yeah, sounds about right.&quot; Like what? That&apos;s so weird. 

I&apos;ve only ever eaten at Barbuzzo once, just for dessert so obviously this experience does not compare. Maybe pick up the phone though."
5,"This review is for Barbuzzo&apos;s special takeout menu during the pandemic.

I was overall very impressed and pleased with my takeout order.

I originally wanted just the caramel budino inspired dalgona coffee, but then looking at the rest of the menu really drew me in. I got the spring vegetable pasta (with a broccoli pesto) and the pork coppa steak (which was a last minute substitution, as they ran out of the other item I ordered that day) and arancini as the appetizer. This definitely comfortably fed my partner and I for the night. We were rolling around, completely stuffed!

The cheesy polenta underneath the pork coppa steak was to die for!! One of the best polentas I&apos;ve tasted. The pork steak was also tender and delicious with every savory bite. The vegetable pasta was also excellent!

I think I&apos;ve come by Barbuzzo before in the past for drinks and apps, and of course during the holidays when they have their famous salted caramel budinos for pickup, but I would definitely stop by when they open again after all this is over for the freshly made menu experience. 

Pick up was easy, but to avoid what happened to me with one of my items being sold out, be sure to place an order day of if possible (I ordered my treats a week in advance for a little celebration)."
