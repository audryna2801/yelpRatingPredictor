5,"If you are a donut lover, OR think donuts are just okay and want to change your mind, head to Beiler&apos;s and pick out a dozen, maybe 12 totally different flavors. There are so many types - you are BOUND to find something you love.

The yeast-based donuts are to die for, both topped and filled with some of the most incredible creams, jellies, custards, fruits, jams, glazes, and toppings you&apos;d never think of.

Some highlights for us have included the classic Boston Creme, the maple bacon, the strawberry shortcake, and the key lime. When we have our wedding at Reading Terminal Market, we had to decide which desserts we wanted. Our biggest regret was not getting Beiler&apos;s! Maybe if we renew our vows someday. 

Until then, we feel lucky every time we get to pick up a box in Philly, or even at the local farmer&apos;s market near us now in Mullica Hill, NJ."
5,"I self-restricted myself to 2 flavors: blueberry fritter and the caramel apple. Both were as delicious as if not more than I could have ever imagined. Have to admit I did underestimate how full these would get me. Thanks to Covid it&apos;ll be a while before I can go back cross state lines to get my hands on these puppies again, but I&apos;ll make sure to get the cream topped ones and the fruity pebble one. UGH can&apos;t wait! I cannot recommend this place enough."
5,"My husband and I were craving donuts this morning, so we decided to order Beiler&apos;s through Grub Hub during this quarantine period. We tried the Oreo creme, banana creme, chocolate sprinkles, and chocolate M&amp;M. I tried the bana creme first and oh my goodness! It was sooo good! The dough is crispy and fresh, and the filling isn&apos;t overly sweet or overly banana flavored! It was incredibly well done! My next was the Oreo creme, both my husband and I had this one! It was also soooo good! It&apos;s heavy, but not so heavy you feel like you can&apos;t move! We were so impressed with the quality and taste! We can&apos;t wait to actually visit this place when the quarantine is over!"
5,"Their vanilla frosted donut is on another plane of existence.  Ever hear about Buddha?  He probably found enlightenment after a bite of it!

Super sweet.  I like how french-vanilla-y their frosting is.  Also not too expensive (a little over a dollar per donut) and beats Dunkin in terms of prices.  Will be stopping here anytime I go to Reading Terminal."
1,"I found this place by using YELP ADS, and they are not what they promised to be. I am disappointed in Becky&apos;s Bakery as well as YELP ADS for sending me to this awful place.

As far as BAKING GOES let me tell you something: YOU NEED TO USE MORE FLOWERS."
2,"The name of the place has a nice ring to it.

The fritters are popular and they&apos;re a 4/5. The donut icing has fluffy texture and too sweet for me 1/5."
3,"Beilers is now a three part operation.
Bakery... like the muffins. The pies made in house aren&apos;t good. The ones they sell from Bird in Hand bakery are much better. Cakes from Pellman are very good also.

Donuts... apple or blueberry fritters are the best! Also the maple bacon. Tried some that really weren&apos;t good at all. Would possibly try a few more flavors, but not expecting them to wow me.

Salads &amp; pickles...the quality of the salads have gone way down. The previous owner Glick&apos;s was much better. Everything I tried was meh, some like the pumpkin torte were downright nasty. I&apos;m done with this place, except for the pickles. Pretty hard to mess up a pickle."
4,"First time stopping in, it won&apos;t be my last. The line was pretty long going on a Saturday but it moved expeditiously. I got a 1/2 dozen for about $7.75 and they are pretty good. The flavors are really creative, but I kept it kinda simple LOL. No regrets!"
4,"I recommend the fritters here! 
The donuts here are soo fluffy and taste best when eaten fresh. They have tons of flavors to choose from and a lot of them are very sweet and chocolatey. My only complaint would be that I wish I could&apos;ve seen more fruit flavors. Their best sellers here are the fritters and they were definitely my favorite out of the ones we tried. A must go to if you&apos;re ever at reading terminal (pronounced &quot;Redding&quot; if you&apos;re a tourist like me )."
5,Great donuts with several flavors to try. Not open on a Sunday so go early on Saturday if you want the donuts. The line forms quick and stays long.
5,"People who know me know that if I could have any single dessert item in the world, it would probably be the apple fritters from Beiler&apos;s donuts. I first had this a few years back at the Reading Terminal Market location and was lovestruck. I remember eating it almost in disbelief because I couldn&apos;t get over how soft and flavorful it was. Since then, I made it a point to get an apple fritter whenever I was in Philadelphia, and I am now lucky enough to live here. I just had it again yesterday and was not disappointed. Still a dream to eat -- so soft with just the right amount of apple flavor + sweet glaze. I really can&apos;t say enough about it. The one thing to note is that you need to eat it ASAP, since it loses the freshness and soft chewiness even just an hour after getting it.

Because I&apos;m such a fan of the apple fritter, I haven&apos;t had a ton of their donuts -- which is remarkable since I am usually first and foremost a donut girl. I did try the coconut custard cream donut yesterday which was good but a little too sweet. They do a solid job with their yeasted donuts and flavor combinations (and they&apos;re priced so well!), but the star is definitely the fritter. Please get an apple fritter."
5,I&apos;ve been coming here for years ! How have a I never left a review !?! When I lived in New York I would literally take the drive to Philly once a month just for these donuts . Now that I live down in Virginia it&apos;s our rest stop on the way to visit NY or coming back home . That&apos;s how much of a MUST these donuts are . Soft pillowy dough crispy outside almost like just enough crust . Delicious fillings . Endless flavors to choose from. They never last more then a day when I bring em around family  . And if you have something to celebrate you can call and order their GIANT donut. Or just order it because you can . They can do almost any flavor for that to . Omg I&apos;m salivating rn writing this . Best donut I&apos;ve ever had so far.
5,"Those freshly made donuts are delicious.  The line is long, but worth it. You have to try them"
4,"After seeing this please so many times when I visit, I finally was able to get some of the goods. The line was short and I jumped on it immediately. Overwhelmed by the delicious looking doughnuts in fritters, I asked the kind cashier her opinion on which fritter i should choose (she advised apple) so I limited myself to one glazed in 1 apple fritter. The glazed doughnut was soft and pillowy..... the fritter, dense and sweet. Classic flavors. Definitely worth the wait.
My friend on the other hand, went with lemon filled and salted caramel. He said the latter was so good he was sad he didn&apos;t buy more. Beilers may have to become a part of my return trip goodies on my Philly trips."
5,"Not sure if I&apos;ve ever met a donut I didn&apos;t like... and these are no exception! Beiler&apos;s makes soft, fluffy, tasty and sweet donuts that you need to go get right now in case you were waiting for a sign. 

This is the part where I would go through each item and rank them, but I don&apos;t think I need to do that here. Everything from the Boston Cream to the French Cruller to the Vanilla Sprinkled was delicious.

They&apos;re also incredibly priced because donuts should never break the bank."
5,"Best donuts, hands down. My favorites include the Boston cream, coconut custard, blueberry and apple fritters, caramel apple, and s&apos;mores (even though I don&apos;t love the filling inside but I&apos;m generally not a cream person). The donuts are fresh and you can&apos;t beat the price!"
5,"If you are in philly and craving some donuts, this is the spot. Absolutely delicious and there are way too many options to choose from. They have a bakery next door if you wanna pick any pies/cakes/bread/bagels. Also, a huge plus, the bakery is in the reading terminal market so you can always walk around and try different food items. But these donuts are definitely a MUST TRY"
4,"A classic dessert spot in Reading Terminal Market. Its located right in the corner of the market by the 12th Street and Arch entrance. Some of their donuts are amazing while others are just average... overall great spot to pick up some treats!

Must try flavors:
Apple Fritter and Blueberry Fritter - 5/5 stars - If you&apos;re not getting a bunch of donuts, these are the ones to get. Not overly sweet and loaded with flavor. The dough is soft and flavorful on the inside and perfectly fried on the outside. 

Salty Caramel - 5/5 stars - Much sweeter than the fritters so only get this if you have a sweet tooth. You could just tell that everything in this one was homemade. Was licking the creme filling and caramel icing off my fingers.

Other recommended flavors (4/5 stars): Boston Creme (who doesn&apos;t love these), Maple Bacon (interesting and tasty!), Nutella Creme, Banana Creme, Fruity Pebbles 

Flavors that are just average (3/5 stars): Oreo Creme (really wanted this to be better), M&amp;M, Key Lime, Banana Creme"
5,"YOU DONUT WANT TO MISS THIS SPOT 

One of my top places to go to whenever I visit Philly is the Reading Terminal Market. And you can&apos;t leave the market without stopping by for some bombbb donuts. I always get half a dozen.. even if I come with 1 friend.... Because you just can&apos;t choose to try only one. My favorite one is the blueberry one! It&apos;s so warm and just the perfect amount of sweetness. 

The line looks long but it moved by so quick! Don&apos;t get intimidated by all the flavors.. the workers are here to help sell their top sellers and help you choose!"
2,"Picture says it all. Bought a $12.99 blackberry pie. Came home and was excited to try it, turns out it has molded. Had to toss the whole pie out."
