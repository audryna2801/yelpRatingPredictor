5,"I came to Amada for lunch during restaurant week and it&apos;s certainly a steal! The restaurant does a great job at adhering to COVID measures. The staff are always wearing masks and gloves and the menu is accessible via QR code. The tables are pretty spaced out, but since it&apos;s outdoors there&apos;s limited seating. Make sure to have a reservation beforehand! 

I&apos;d recommend coming for lunch during restaurant week; it&apos;s $20 in comparison to $35 for dinner. Amada is a Spanish tapas restaurant and you choose one appetizer, two entrees, and one dessert from a prix fix menu. The menu is pretty extensive and if you come with a group of people, my suggestion is to order a bunch of different tapas so you can try more dishes!

I got the Pimientos de Padrón, Entrecôte (hanger steak), Prawns, and the Pasteles de Chocolate (chocolate cream puffs). If you&apos;re a fan of green peppers, you&apos;ll love the Pimientos de Padrón. The Entrecôte and Prawns were small portions but both tasted so fresh. The cream puffs weren&apos;t mind blowing but I enjoyed them. My friends got the cheesecake and I&apos;d recommend that over the cream puffs. 

TLDR: Great service, friendly staff, and very fresh tapas styled food that makes for a fun meal."
5,"My favorite restaurant in Philly! I almost didn&apos;t want to write a review because I didn&apos;t want the place to become too popular for me to not be able to make a reservation - but that would be selfish and unfair. I live a few blocks from Amada and have been to this restaurant 15+ times. It&apos;s excellent for every occasion - birthdays, Sunday brunch/drunch, date nights, or just a casual weekday dinner. I bring all my friends visiting from out of town to Amada and will continue to do so. 

The food menu has a variety of tapas which are reasonably priced for the quantity and quality of the food. I think I have tried everything on the menu and am yet to be disappointed. But some of my favorites have to be the Manchego served with truffle lavender honey (yum!), tortilla espanola, arroz temporado (wild mushroom rice), pinxtos (spiced chickenbrochett), and the pato con pochas (duck confit with fennel and pocha bean stew). Oh and their cheesecake is heavenly too! Even during the pandemic, the staff have taken precautions with PPE and social distancing, set up outdoor seating, and have adjusted to a reduced contact dining experience (QR code menus). Dined here last night and I&apos;m already waiting to go back for more!"
5,"Given this was a weekend we were supposed to be in Spain, the SO surprised me by picking me up from the airport and stopping by Amanda to grab so many choices to enjoy. While it&apos;s not the same as being in Seville, Alora or Malaga, I felt like at least the food was a great reminder of what was to have been. Given that we did a take-out experience, there wasn&apos;t a great way to do pictures, but I&apos;ve included some anyway. From the charcuterie kit, chorizo, Brussels sprouts, flatbread, bacon wrapped dates, and more...everything was delicious. And given we had so many items with the kit, they put the honey, mustard, olives, etc in nice little jars. What a great way to be spoiled...with perfect food and a reminder of Spain."
5,"Really enjoyed this restaurant and will definitely be back. Let me start with, I love tapas!
The shrimp and scallops were really good. Scallops were even better dipped in the shrimp&apos;s sauce. 
Lamb chops were amazing. Great crisp on the outside. 
The red snapper and roasted chicken were also really good. 
My favorite was the Spanish mojito! Mojito is my go to drink as this was top 3 I&apos;ve ever had! Probably top 2!!!
Very pleased, highly recommend."
5,"Amada is a must visit in the city!

The feature a tapas menu, which is great to try to multiple things. It is a huge menu w/ lots of veggie options, and I feel like I always leave with a positive experience from a restaurant when I know I want to go back to try more things on the menu. 

The dishes and style are very authentic to their spanish cuisine. Everything was so flavorful. 

Their meat &amp; cheese board was FIRE - don&apos;t miss out on that.

The atmosphere is quaint &amp; rich, with lots of dark and wood tones. Very unique setting, and just a cool experience overall."
5,"What an amazing place! For starters, their happy hour is amazing- $5 drinks and tapas. I tried both the red and white sangria and enjoyed both. The white was my favorite and was not too sweet. It was pretty strong too so watch out!

I would recommend 2 tapas per person, 3 if your group is on the hungrier side. The marcona almonds, patatas bravas, artichoke and mushroom flatbread, olives, brussels sprouts, pimento peppers, and manchego and pear toastinis were all good. I think the most original one was the patatas bravas which was served unconventionally in little towers. Honestly everything was so yummy, I can&apos;t wait to come back and try some more!"
5,"I am absolutely over the moon about finally trying Amada. My friend &amp; I were able to get a spot outdoors Friday night. The weather wasn&apos;t too chilly and of course I love Old City,  easy parking just a block or two away. 

Tapas style restaurants are my favorite. I love trying new dishes and lots of them and this is the best way to do it. 

Started out with a tasty drink, Rose Gold (Tito&apos;s vodka, passion fruit &amp; rosemary) 

Our share dishes: jamon Serrano, Manchego w/ honey, ham croquettes, potatoes topped with paprika aioli, crab stuffed peppers, garlic shrimp, fried goat cheese salad, empanada, and the trio of desserts. I can&apos;t rave enough about how much I just loved eating here, even the bread for the charcuterie &amp; cheese was incredible.

Finished off perfectly with an espresso martini. 

Great service, friendly, quick to clear plates. If looking for recommendations on what to get,  see above!!"
4,"Delicious Spanish Tapas!

I love Old City in general, and this is one of the go-to spots. It has a great dinner ambience, and the garlic shrimp Gambas is my fave."
4,"Amada is great! We went for restaurant week lunch, and for just $20 per person getting this variety of food was an awesome deal. We ordered garlic shrimp and tortilla española for appetizers, lamb meatballs/prawns/chorizo/crab stuffed peppers for mains, and the cheesecake and chocolate cream puffs for dessert. We also got a white and red sangria. 

Notable favorites of ours included the crab stuffed peppers (10/10 -- my picture doesn&apos;t do it justice, it was truly lush in texture and flavor), both desserts (passion fruit curd was a star in the cheesecake, but if I could only order 1 dessert I would get the chocolate puffs -- the dark chocolate inside is light but decadent), and the white sangria (very light, sweet, and fun). The rest were good but not standout. The service was very quick and we had started and finished the meal within an hour. A great spot particularly for restaurant week!"
4,"During covid they had a outdoor seating area which was nice. 

Overall I thought this restaurant was more on the fancy type very high end and classy. I had some trouble reading the menu so looked at the description instead.. they didn&apos;t have dessert on the menu or a dessert menu so we had to ask the waitress for dessert.

I didn&apos;t like the food as much, not much flavor and very basic. It is tapas style so I guess should order multiple dishes, I like how the waitress did tell us that since we were new to the restaurant. 

I don&apos;t mind this place but not my style of food... review is based on the service and the lovely seating arrangement during covid! Thank you!"
5,"Love this place so much for restaurant week that I came twice in a week! Everything here is so good and the restaurant itself is quite nice! However, it&apos;s not very big so make sure you make a reservation!

- Garlic shrimp is absolutely delicious. Even though there is not a lot, every bite is pure bliss. My favorite thing here
- Scallop is really tender and yummy. It is lightly seasoned so you can still taste the freshness and original taste of the scallop!
- Chicken over rice is pretty good but not too special. It&apos;s not bad but just not that special. Had similar tasting ones at other restaurants
- Paella is yummy. By just thinking about it while writing this review, my mouth is watering again!! Definitely worth a try.

Tip for restaurant week: the lunch and dinner menu are fairly similar but dinner is ~$15 more expensive. You should check if there are things you really want to try on the dinner menu. If not, the lunch price is definitely a steal! :)"
5,"Came here for restaurant week and was not disappointed. Fantastic spot with great food. 

My family and I made a reservation for outdoor seating for 6 people on Monday for restaurant week. The deal is $35pp for 2 tapas for the first course, 2 for the second, and 1 desert. 

Manchego cheese: The honey tasted beautiful and paired really well with the Manchego cheese. This was a great plate to order with some sangria 

I wasn&apos;t a big fan of them combining our orders (we got 3 orders of the Manchego and 1 of the cana de cabra and they were combined into 2 plates) but I understand the need to save table space. 

Tortilla Espanola: Good flavor! I didn&apos;t hate this, but it is a bit heavy. If you&apos;re looking for a heavier, heartier first course, id recommend getting this. 

It tastes almost like a potato cake. The spicy sauce on the side that it comes with is DELICIOUS. My mother really liked the sausages on the side of this dish, but I personally was indifferent. Another good tapa, but definitely a larger portion. 

Pulpo a la Gallega: Tender octopus that was flavored well, although a bit monotonous for me. I wish they added some sort of spice or kick to it, because after the 3rd octopus piece it all started to taste a bit... boring. I do appreciate that the octopus was cooked well and not rubbery. Potatoes look just like the octopus so you never know which one you&apos;ll be getting. Not a bad thing, just a bit of a roulette to maybe provide the spice that the flavors don&apos;t. 

Arroz Temporado: If you like that creamy, truffle risotto vibe, this dish is DEFINITELY for you. It&apos;s super rich, super creamy, but a little bit salty. Overall I liked this dish a lot, but it&apos;s another one of those larger portion plates with a LOTTTT of creamy goodness. 

Albondigas: My aunt ordered this as one of her second plates but I tried one and these were DELICIOUS. Wish I ordered these myself! Tender lamb that was flavored well. 

Spanish-style Cheesecake: there are two options for dessert and I went with the cheesecake. It&apos;s definitely not your New York style cheesecake, but still good nonetheless. Comes with a side of ice cream too! It&apos;s very lemony, but pairs well with the ice cream. Wasn&apos;t anything mind blowing but still quite delicious. 

Overall Amada was VERY solid. Nothing negative to say about the place. Service, food, and atmosphere all exceeded expectations. And for $35, the restaurant week deal here is great! Highly recommend."
4,"Amada features amazing Spanish tapas with a classy ambiance in historic old city Philadelphia. We came for restaurant week and got a fantastic lunch special. The green salad is a delicious starter, and the lamb meatballs and the bacon-wrapped dates were tasty, too. The restaurant week deal was a fantastic value, though normal prices are a bit higher. Still, if you want a nice meal out with finely-prepared food, visit Amada."
5,"One of my favorite places for a nice meal in the city. We have been here twice for anniversary meals and both times we got the Chefs Tasting menu. My fiance only eats chicken and cannot eat beef/pork/fish. The chef was able to accommodate to us and bring out tapas that we could eat. Each tapa we tried and both times got a different variety, they were all delicious and the flavors blended well. We came once during COVID times and we felt safe eating there with all the precautions they had. Its become one of our favorite spots for special occasions. Cant wait to come back here again!"
5,"Date night at The Chef&apos;s Table was so incredible! There are only a few seats there, so definitely make reservations. (You can&apos;t make them online, so just give them a call to request!) 

Tapas are by far my favorite way to dine, and perfect for a romantic meal. Add a front row seat to all of the culinary action, a candlelit space, and you have yourself a pretty special dining experience, one surely to impress!! 

We started with some creative cocktails, but of course. &apos;Talk To Her&apos;, made with butter washed run, and black tea with orange and peychaud bitters was a standout for me. &apos;Broken Hugs&apos; is delicious too. It&apos;s lighter and refreshing. Hubs is a fan of the spicy &apos;Matador&apos;. The aged manchego with granny apple slices and lavender honey, the mixed olives and the thinly sliced Serrano and jamon were perfect lighter first bites we ordered while sipping. That honey is so delicious and sweet. It balanced the tart apple and savory cheese so well. 

We were given complimentary tuna spread with tasty flat crackers that also started out meal off on the right foot!

*You can&apos;t go wrong with one of their three sangrias or imported cava or brut though. 

Must haves are obviously patatas bravas and the gambas al Ajillas (garlic shrimp). Don&apos;t be surprised if you find yourself order a second helping of either! Fan favorites for sure! 

Plant based dishes that should NOT be overlooked are the Berenjenas con miel, perfectly fried eggplant fries with rosemary aioli and spiced garlic honey! Holy moly, these are so good!! The Setas, seasonal mixed mushrooms with truffle oil are seemingly simply, but are to die for!! They are absolutely drool-worthy!! 
The Coco de Alfachofas flatbread with artichokes, black truffle and manchego is pretty great too! The truffle was very present! 

The crispy open half shelled lagosta (Maine lobster) and tender vierias (diver scallops) are both excellent mains. Super fresh, well cooked and very tasty! I love and appreciate that can order these half, which gives you the option to taste this, and still have room for other dishes as well. 

For dessert we had a trio sample of their desserts...tres leche, decadent chocolate cream filled cream cakes and a traditional hazelnut cookie. Everything was super delicious but the chocolate, oh, yesssss!! Dreamy! It just oozed our! 

Our service at the counter was stellar!! Between that and basically sitting in the kitchen, seeing it all go down, we felt like royalty. Such a wonderful night!! It cost nothing extra to sit at the chef&apos;s seat, just a phone call, and I couldn&apos;t recommend it more! Trust me guys, book this as a surprise for her now! 
(We lost count of how many apples one of the chefs cut ever so delicately:)

We cannot thank Chef Jose Garces and his staff enough for this delicious meal and trip back to Spain!!"
4,"More of a 3.5 but I guess I&apos;ll round up. I came for restaurant week lunch at 1:30 and it took them 20 minutes to get us seated even with a reservation. They somehow ran out of both chicken and cauliflower yikes. 

To start, I had the garlic shrimp which was probably the highlight of the meal. Shrimp was super tender and flavorful, but the bread was very stale (idk if this is a Spanish thing and it&apos;s supposed to be like that or something?). Beautiful presentation. 

Next was the fries. I am such a fan of the sauce which was like a creamy aioli fused with smoky paprika flavor. Very oily but very filling. 

Burger was so dry it could have caught on fire if you lit a match near it, 1/10 would not recommend. 

The dessert tocinillo was decent- while it was way too sweet to eat a lot of, the citrus meringue had a nice light acidity that cuts into the overpowering sweetness. 

Overall worth going to for rw lunch deal  but would probably not come back. Stay away from burger at all costs, shrimp is good."
4,"My wife and I visited Amada in the fall and the food is delicious. There are a few strong Spanish tapas restaurants in the city and I would definitely return here. It was a packed Friday night and we were led to a table toward the back. It&apos;s a pretty loud restaurant, but with the dim lights, and jolly patrons I was excited. In typical Spanish tapas fashion we ordered quite a few things.

Patatas Bravas, Ensalada Verde, Gambas Al Ajillo, Shortrib flatbread, Roasted half chicken, Red snapper, spiced chicken, brussel sprouts and a cocktail. All of the dishes were plated beautifully and tasted just as good. Favorites were the Potatas Bravas, Flatbread, and Snapper. 

The night started off great, the waitresses were pleasant, the plates were coming out of the kitchen and we were enjoying ourselves. Then all of the sudden halfway through our meal, service stops. Our waitress informs us that our dishes will be up in just a minute. 10 min go by, 20, 30, an hour, and I kid you not, we still were missing half of our dishes. It was a mess!

It was so bad that the manager spoke to us and ended up comping the entire $120+ meal! After some ungodly amount of time we finished our final courses, tipped the waitress, and decided to grab dessert elsewhere. At the very least, the food was delicious and management knew how to remedy the situation so Kudos. I&apos;ll be back, and chalk up the first experience to an off day.

Potatas Bravas 5/5
Ensalada Verde 4/5
Gambas Al Ajillo 3/5
Shortrib flatbread 4/5
Roasted half chicken 4/5 
Red snapper 4/5
Spiced chicken 3/5 
Brussel sprouts 4/5"
3,"My husband and I dined for restaurant week. We had:
1st course
- Aged Manchego Cheese,  5/5
- 2 orders of Gambas al ajillo, 3/5
- Patatas bravas 4/5

2nd course
- Paella (mushroom, artichoke, piquillo pepper 3.5/5
- Albondigas (lamb meatballs) 1/5
- Prawns 4/5
- Pulpo a la gallega 2/5 

We also had red wine sangrias which were pretty good but could have more alcohol.
Overall the food wasn&apos;t so memorable that we would go back. But the food was hot when served which was a plus."
5,"My wife and I were really excited to try Amada, and it did not disappoint! We dined here last Wednesday which was during Philly&apos;s Restaurant Week, and it was a great decision. 

Right to it, it was a family-style dining. To begin, we got the patatas bravas w/ chipotle aioli, argulua salad w/ shaved parmesan and, and the manchego cheese w/ truffled lavender honey and apples. Everything came out quickly and we loved all the dishes we got here!

Next, we got the paella (vegetarian) and the mushroom flatbread. My wife had most of the paella and I devoured the flatbread. We would easily get these meals again for sure!

Finally, dinner was wrapped up with an egg custard cup and a plate of two chocolate lava pieces. These were very decadent and enjoyed by us a lot!

The service was outstanding. Even though it was absolutely a packed house, our waitress, Debbie, was able to quickly navigate through and get us our foods and drinks with ease! She was a pleasure and made our dining experience that much better! 

Can not wait to return to Amada!"
4,"I&apos;ve been to Amada a few times- the food is great for tapas! Expect to share everything with the table, which could be challenging if you have picky eaters. The happy hour menu is a great selection, but be sure to sit in the bar area. Happy hour doesn&apos;t apply to the main dining area which is a bummer since we planned a group HH and couldn&apos;t get the specials. 

This past time we ordered the paella , which easily can feed 3-5 people depending on how hungry everyone is. It takes about 40-45 minutes to come out (piping hot) and comes with a side of bread. It was really tasty. The chicken was really moist and the mussels didn&apos;t overpower the dish at all. Would definitely recommend. 

They do have a gluten free menu and can accommodate most dishes to be dairy free. With a wide area of meats and cheeses (cow, sheep, and goat), you can please everyone!"
