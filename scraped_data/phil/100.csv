5,"Outstanding take out dinner from Dan Dan!

Dan Dan Phila. is our go to Chinese take out. About 6-8 weeks ago, our usual order was pretty greasy. We tried again a few days ago. It was wonderful!! Twice cooked fish, ginger duck, green beans and house special rice. Not greasy, perfectly cooked, large portions. Must have been an off night 6 -8 weeks ago.I rarely write reviews but this meal was worth it."
5,"I ordered Dan Dan for take out the other night, and it was delicious. I ordered the Dan Dan Noodles (kinda had to since it&apos;s in the name), garlic style with beef, spring rolls, and scallion pancake. Everything was yummy and prepared and packaged well. I look forward to getting those noodles again soon!"
5,"Food was super flavorful! Everything was great but the highlight was the twice cooked chicken - flavorful, juicy, refreshing, savory. Dan dan noodles are surprisingly hearty and rich - got the normal spice level and it was good for me (I tend to like things on the spicier side). They have great social distancing seating outdoors to help with safety during COVID-19. Would definitely come back!"
4,"During Covid they have outdoor seating but I decided to order dinner to-go instead. I ordered the Chicken Dry Pot Dish extra spicy, Fried Taiwanese sausage, Taiwanese minced pork rice, scallion pancakes. 

Chicken Dry Pot Dish extra spicy: oily but it didn&apos;t taste disgusting and didn&apos;t harden in the fridge. Very flavorful and filled with lots of crunchy veggies. It also came with a small side of rice. 

Fried Taiwanese sausage: was slightly sweet and was a nice contrast to the spicy main dish. 

Taiwanese minced pork rice: simple and delicious. The rice was very fluffy and sticky. So good!

It was absolutely delicious! I can definitely see why there were loads of take-out orders from the restaurant. I interested in trying as many thing on the menu and you probably can&apos;t go wrong with anything you order."
4,"This restaurant provided dining outside and on the second floor inside. It didn&apos;t appear too have too much heating outside so we chose to dine inside. The design was a pretty clean, modern wood furnish. Each table had sanitizer ready, and everyone wore masks. The server was attentive and nice. Going into the menu we ordered the Dan Dan noodle, dumplings in chili oil sauce, scallion pancakes, and pork belly bun. The Dan Dan noodles were slightly spicy, slightly sweet, with bits of ground pork in a thick sauce. It was pretty delightful to eat, and different as I&apos;m used to a thinner variation of noodle for Dan Dan noodles. The slight extra chewiness of the noodles was a refreshing change. The dumplings had just enough dough, with the right tenderness. I was slightly sad at the filling amount, but the chili oil sauce was a perfect mixture of sweet and spicy. The pork belly bun was great in flavor and filling with melt in the mouth braised soy marinated goodness mixed with not too sweet peanut power, pickled mustard greens, and cilantro. Unfortunately the dish failed in its packaging; the bun was inconsistent with many parts being hard and dried out. Last was scallion pancakes. The pancakes were perfectly fried and cut into pie slices stacked atop each other. There was enough scallions to accentuate the dish, yet not overpower the overall taste. The sauce enhanced the pancakes with its subtle sweetness to contrast the slight salty note. I tried dressing the pancake with the chili oil sauce and that worked wonders as well. Overall I would come again to expand my taste buds.

P.S. the dishes tasted are more of a family feel taste. I think if one were to try other entrees it might be better to try other entree dishes for a more unique dining experience."
3,"It was a Saturday night in September when I called to make a reservation for six. They told us they could accommodate us outside which we were thrilled to hear since it was a beautiful night out. When we arrived, we were immediately seated at a table on the street. I was pleased with how quickly we were seated but where we sat concerned me. Now I know especially with Covid many places at the time were only allowed to have outdoor dining but when I say we were almost touching the street traffic I mean it. We were seated in the street at a long table as cars and trucks zoomed by us as we ate our dinner. They had put no form of decorations or anything to block us from the street traffic which I did not enjoy. That was the first reason why I wasn&apos;t in love with this place from the start. We ended up ordering a few appetizers since we were so hungry. We ordered Scallion pancakes, Dan Dan noodles of course, and Dumplings in Chili Oil. The appetizers were fantastic. They were full of flavor in every bite and all tasted very fresh. I was excited for the entrees seeing that the appetizers were so yummy. I ordered the Garlic Sauce dish because it sounded delicious and many people online were raving about it as well. It was chicken sauteed with their sweet, sour, and spicy sauce with ginger, garlic, wood ear mushrooms, and red peppers. My food was good but nothing I&apos;d return back for. Chris had ordered the Kung Pao dish which we expected to be amazing but it ended up tasting like hot dogs. Not sure why but the entrees were nothing near as good as the appetizers we ate earlier. 

Overall, I would return back to Dan Dan for a quick bite of their appetizers but nothing more. The service was fantastic and the staff was friendly but the entrees did not cut it for us."
3,"I ordered this last night and tbh it&apos;s just not my cup of tea.  The Dan Dan were surprising so spicy, it didn&apos;t come with a warning lol. It was a super large portion which is nice but I just didn&apos;t love. I also got scallion pancakes and chicken pot stickers, both just okay."
2,"It was very busy for take out order but it&apos;s hard to justify finding a plastic piece in my stir fried that I chewed on.

I do like the flavors of the foods but they can be very greasy especially the noodle soups, there&apos;s literally an inch of oil on the broth, and when I asked the waitstaff she told me it is how they prepare the broth so there&apos;s nothing she can do.

There should be a thin layer of hot oil, yes, but not an inch, never this over the top. Many ways to improve.

I lived in both Sichuan and Taiwan for years so I think I am more than qualified to give this judgment."
5,"Delicious food. Incredibly spicy so beware. The pork dan dan noodles are to die for! Great ambiance inside, but also great for ordering in. Definitely travels well and the portion sizes are great. Would recommend"
5,"Wow! This meal was still steaming when we got it delivered. The flavors of each dish are incredible and you&apos;ll want to get yourself a side of chili oil to put on...like everything.  The fried rice was perfect, not too heavy or greasy. Honestly my only complaint is that I didn&apos;t order more food because it was that good."
3,"Got takeout to go and ordered the dry pepper chicken and taiwanese beef noodle soup. Both were unbearably salty, to the point where me and my friend couldn&apos;t eat anymore. The flavor was good but just way too salty. Also the takeout version of the noodle soup was kinda sad, didn&apos;t have the extra toppings or veggies, just broth/meat."
4,"Covid-19 Outdoor Dining Review

The outdoor dining area, although right on the street is made inviting by several planter benches with colorful vinca flowers.  Our server wore a mask and gloves, despite the heat, and was very friendly and professional.  

Dan Dan is a bit overpriced and portions are small compared to other good Chinese food options.  We were here for lunch, although they do not offer lunch specials.  It was a standard menu.  We ordered the Ginger Scallion Chicken and the Scallion Pancakes.  Both items were really good. 

In the past , we have ordered the Dan Dan noodles. They were very tasty, but make sure you can bear the heat, because they are spicy. I&apos;ve also had the Cumin with Chicken, Dry Pot with Chicken and Garlic Sauce with Pressed Tofu. The Cumin and Garlic sauce were both tasty. The Hot Pot was a bit of a let down, because it was the dish with the highest spiciness level, yet was bland and paled in comparison to the 1-star spice level of the Garlic Sauce dish."
4,Above average interesting food and menu. (Our experience was tempered by Uber Eats delivering the food 1 hour and 15 minutes after Dan Dan said it was ready for delivery. Not Dan Dan&apos;s fault.)
3,"Food was good. 
Don&apos;t eat outside. They&apos;re not prepared for it even though they offer outdoor dining. It was freezing."
5,Absolute must if you&apos;re in Philly! The food was sooo flavorful served hot! We were able to sit outside with a tent and heat lamps which Kept us comfortable for the meal. Service was amazing and fast. Our waitress gave me some great recommendations on their vegetarian items. I can&apos;t wait to go back next time I&apos;m in Philly.
3,"Ordered take out from Dan Dan after seeing high ratings on Uber Eats and we were not disappointed! We ordered around 6PM on a Friday night, and our order was set to be ready by 6:45PM so really quick turnaround. We did deliver, and our delivery guy followed directions and left our order outside our door, which worked out very well. For eats, we both ordered the dan dan noodles as our main (felt like we couldn&apos;t not get them!) and split the scallion pancakes as an app. The scallion pancakes were OK - they were very greasy so must have been fried in lots of oil. That being said, they were tasty but that might have been a byproduct of the heavy deep fry. They were served with soy sauce, which was a nice touch, but we couldn&apos;t get past the grease. On the other hand, the dan dan noodles were very nicely done. They were coded as a 3/5 spice, but boy, were they spicy! Our noses were both running the entire time. The flavors of the dish were very good though - the sauce was strong and rich, but not over powering the noodles themselves, which were nicely done and clearly homemade. The minced pork meshed well with the overall dish, but the minced nature made the meat get a little lost in the noodles, which was disappointing. Outside of that, there appeared to be a few green onions and bean sprouts mixed in as well, but some extra veggies would have added to the dish too. But overall, we did really enjoy the dan dan and could tell it was a much elevated dish from traditional lo mein. The price of the dish was extremely reasonable (~$10 on UberEats), but the portions were HUGE! We split one dish between the two of us and were incredibly full after. So definitely worth the price!
We enjoyed our takeout meal from Dan Dan, and we were overall pleased with our selections. We will probably opt for a less greasy app next time, and we will explore other (less spicy) noodle and entree options too to give the entire menu a chance. But this is a great spot for dan dan noodles, just be prepared for spice when you go in!"
4,"The food isn&apos;t strictly authentic and has been slightly Americanized but some dishes are tasty.

I prefer the sesame cold noodles over the dan dan noodles since the sauce is less savory and more balanced between salty and sweet. Both dishes utilize the same noodles which have a nice texture, not too thick, and good chewiness.

The lychee fish dish wasn&apos;t too bad either. I like the light breaded, fried texture of the fish by itself...it didn&apos;t even need the sweet gooey sauce that came with."
5,"Dan Dan has become a staple for me, they have outdoor dining, and their food travels well. Ofc the Dan dan noodles are a must have, love that they have many vegetarian options which Szechuan places don&apos;t. Aside from their namesake dish, their lychee fish is delicious; crispy fish in a spicy and savory sauce. Another delicious appetizer their scallion pancakes, and for vegetarians their cumin tofu and mapo tufo are both delicious!"
5,"All the times I&apos;ve walked past this restaurant I cannot believe what my tastebuds have been missing!!! This past Sunday I came across a post on IG about their vegan options, I immediately ordered their cabbage, snow pea leaves, dan dan noodles (without pork), spring rolls and scallion pancakes. I am usually really good with taking pics but after taking 1 bite I couldn&apos;t stop and failed to take pics of my food...this should tell you how amazingly happy I was with my food. I managed to get 1 pic in though, after taking several bites lol, of the cabbage with dry peppers. I have eaten alot of cabbage in my life and I have never tasted cabbage prepared like this....my tastebuds were literally having a party with each bite...it was SO Delicious!! Welp, looks like I&apos;ve found a new food addiction lmbo"
4,"I was happy with my take out from Dan Dan. The menu included perfect descriptions which I appreciate considering some mishaps in the past at similar places. For instance I could clearly read the difference between the Wontons in spicy oil versus the dumplings in spicy oil, the former being sour and the latter being sweeter. I had the dumplings and they were perfect little morsels of tingly favor. I also had the garlic style entree with chicken. Very good as well and the portion was legit. Thumbs up for me."
