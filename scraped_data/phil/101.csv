5,"Since we won&apos;t be able to go to Spain anytime soon, we figured that we may as well get as close to Spain as possible here in Philly. And that means Barcelona Wine Bar.

We expected to sit outside, but indoor dining had resumed and they were taking matters quite seriously. Because of that, we dined indoors. Staff wears masks and face shields, and makes you feel comfortable with the precautions they are taking. 

We had the mushrooms, bravas, octopus and paella (seafood) - and everything was as tasty as ever. The good quality hasn&apos;t taken a dip whatsoever. Their paella is some of the best we have had in the states, too. Highly recommended!

If you are craving some paella, tapas and great service in what appears to be a safe environment - I would definitely suggest visiting Barcelona."
5,"Barcelona is a great option for folks looking to have a nice meal in a socially distanced, outdoors setting. On a corner of Passyunk, the patio provides an al fresco environment for enjoying some of the best #tapas in town. My partner and I shared several small plates and a half-order of paella con mariscos. Everything we got was good, the pork belly and croquetas with jamon iberico and manchego cheese being our top selections. Unfortunately the restaurant was out of the pulpo gallego on the day we visited, so we&apos;ll just have to go back for more :) I also can&apos;t wait for the pandemic to be quashed, so we can sit inside and enjoy some wine at the cozy-looking bar."
5,"One of my Philly favorites!

I came here before covid to celebrate a friend&apos;s birthday and we had a wonderful time from start to finish. Service is fantastic and food is amazing. Our servers were fun, professional, and attentive, making the celebration extra pleasant. The menu is tapas style, so you get to try all kinds of food, and they offer sides of delicious bread that fills you up too. I also loved the beautifully decorated space, with ample seating both inside and outside. 

Highly recommend :)"
5,"REVIEW 2021 

Feb 14: My Girls and I came here to have dinner for &quot;Galantine&apos;s Day&quot;. I saw somebody post the name of the restaurant and decided to go. This location is in Philadelphia. I love how the atmosphere was so elegant and the music was pretty nice too. The food was really good. They just come in really small portions. (I like to eat) . The Sangria was terrific. The bathroom was very nice and clean. The waiters were very nice and patient. I would recommend coming here. They were OUT of calamari this night. Was soooo upset. Anywho, overall, I give them 5 stars. See photos attached."
4,"Spain has been one of my husband and I&apos;s favorite travel memories to date. Barcelona wine bar was a great visit to fill the hole of missing Spanish food and traveling. 

We opted to sit outside and utilize their contact-less ordering system which has a system charge of 25 cents. They have a system in place of utilizing a bright highlighter yellow paper to notify servers that you require their attention or clearing of the table. Service was great, the only mishap was the server forgetting our bread in the beginning of the meal but no big deal. 

The half size paella is perfect for a party of 2 if you also supplement with 3-4 tapas. Honestly you could probably even get away with 2 tapas if you include eating the complimentary bread + olive oil. The soccarat on the paella was perfect, definitely recommend the paella. Out of all the dishes we ordered, the only one that I wouldn&apos;t personally recommend is the duck confit (however my husband loved it) so it&apos;s just a personal preference. The croquets are great, definitely can recommend that one as well - delicious fried perfectly and savory gooey goodness on the inside. The food was very quick to come out as well, even the paella which the server said would take appx 30 minutes. The mushroom arancini was good too, but a similar texture to the croquettes so just something to note in case you want to order something else to satisfy your palette, texture wise. The grilled octopus had a perfect texture, and we loved the beluga lentils that accompanied it. 

Thanks for scratching our itch of Spain! We hope to return soon for brunch, which we&apos;ve never had yet !"
1,"This had to be the worst takeout experience I&apos;ve ever had. I&apos;ve never eaten Barcelona before and I wanted to grab a quick bite before heading back home to Jersey. I ordered 2 appetizers and a slice of olive oil cake. I got the patatas bravas and the pork belly. Before I ordered, I looked up pictures on Yelp so I can get an idea or what to get. Now I understand that takeout and dine in is a different experience because the presentation is not there, but wow was this disappointing. I think if anything the takeout food should be up to par or even better than the dine in food because of the state of the world we live in now.

First why did I get basically half a loaf of complimentary bread??? Was it to make up for the glorified bacon that was the pork belly? The only good thing about my food was the jam that came with the pork belly and the garlic aioli. I gave the pork belly to my dog because I know she appreciated it more than I could&apos;ve. All of this cost $23 (olive oil cake not pictured)

This order has stained my experience with Barcelona, I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll ever order or visit again."
5,"Came here with 3 friends on New Year&apos;s Day. Every (21+) customer received a complimentary glass of champagne. I almost finished mine before the picture haha. Yes, it was raining that day. Kristin &amp; Sergio were awesome! First of, we had a little issue with our table because it was starting to pour &amp; there&apos;s just isn&apos;t enough coverage. We were okay with waiting until a table was ready for us. We were very determined to eat here lol. Kristin went above and beyond to accommodate us. Thank you!! Sergio was our server &amp; he was the best! Loved his personality. Food doesn&apos;t disappoint, it was worth the wait. Got a bottle of red, Casas Pinot noir I think? Then finished the meal with hot toddy. It was perfect for the cold. Warmed us right up!
I&apos;m glad we had our first meal of the year at Barcelona.
We&apos;re off to a great start already :D

Whatcha waiting for!? Go check them out!

PS: I&apos;m still waiting for y&apos;all to offer wine flights :)"
5,"Dinner was delicious and the atmosphere is Fabulous. We ordered the Calamari, Octopus and Olive oil cake for dessert. Yum!"
5,"Amazing tapas and great cocktails? Say less! This extremely photogenic restaurant situated among the busiest parts of East Passyunk really stands head and shoulders above the other restaurants nearby. In the span of a week, we ended up here twice just because everything was so impeccable. We were seated outside the first time and ended up sitting inside the second time, but both had the perfect ambiance to accompany the Spain-inspired menu. 

In terms of tapas (small shareable dishes), I highly recommend you get the Pork Belly a la Plancha. The fatty slice of pork belly could be cut with a fork with ease and is charred to perfection. It is topped with a sweet cherry pepper chimichurri that helps to balance the decadence of the fat. The Potato Tortilla was also a favorite of the table though it seems like such a simple dish. The potato was perfectly cooked and enveloped in a fluffy egg bed. And if you are feeling adventurous, try the Bone Marrow! The marrow is broiled in the bone canoe to create a consistency that just begs to be spread on bread. The brussels sprout escabeche nicely cuts through the richness and completes the bite. We also ended up trying and loving the Beef Empanadas and Piquillo Hummus. 

For drinks to go with the amazing food, I had the Summer Street Sling the first time, and the Guava Nectar Sangria the second time. Both were adequately potent without being too overpowering. They have quite a nice selection of wines as well! 

I can&apos;t say enough about how much we like this place. We can&apos;t wait to come back to try their paella&apos;s and other tapas!"
4,"Came for outdoor dining (they have space heaters now that the temperature is dropping) / brunch with friends and had an amazing experience. They recommend 3-4 plates per person so we ordered:

(This is also ranked in order of favorite to least)
Jamon &amp; Manchego Croquetas
Patas Bravas
Chorizo with Sweet &amp; Sour Figs
Shishito peppers
Grilled Octopus
Potato Tortilla
Pork Belly A La Plancha
Serrano Benedict (think I would&apos;ve liked this one more if our poached eggs weren&apos;t overcooked)
Braised Short Rib

Had a great time, no complaints. Mimosas are good and big plus that they&apos;re dog-friendly! Would definitely come back again sometime."
2,"Barcelona has a lot of great things going for it: hip atmosphere, good menu, and a perfect location that is quaint but cozy. This experience however failed to meet expectations. 

Other than a great night between family and friends, the food was sub-par and disappointing. We ordered the grilled hangar steak, albondigas, and a large paella. The hangar steak was the most expensive tapas on the menu, and by far the smallest. The steak slices looked bigger on the online website; they tasted good, but lacked an appealing presentation. The albondigas were the unexpected highlight and tasted quite good. On the contrary, the biggest letdown of the evening was the lumpy, undercooked, raw paella. 

Not only did the dish take 20 minutes longer than it was estimated to come out, according to others at our table, was dare I say, &quot;awful&quot;. I don&apos;t eat paella often, and even I was able to tell how severely undercooked the rice was. It was practically a risotto dish - clumpy, watery, and creamy. While the plating and presentation looked appetizing, the result was anything but. I ate a decent amount because I was so hungry from the wait, but we didn&apos;t even touch the shrimp or 3/4 of the clams. Thankfully, the manager was accommodating and understanding, but we still left shocked and saddened by what was our most anticipated dish of the night.

I&apos;d like to give Barcelona another try in the future because it&apos;s such a quaint spot with a rich menu, though tonight left an unsatisfying taste in mouth that may take awhile to stomach over."
4,"Wonderful outdoor seating option! Came here for a date night for wine and charcuterie. Service was wonderful and when the kitchen accidentally switched a salami for one of the cheeses we selected the server immediately brought us the correct option and had us keep the extra meat. 

I probably would not get the charcuterie board again (you select the meat and cheeses you want but I was surprised that was really all it came with plus a small dollop of jam. I expected an assortment of pickled veggies / fruit to be included as usually is elsewhere). Would return for drinks, ambiance, and other food options however!"
5,Best Sangria out of every other BWB I&apos;ve been two across 3 states. Great brunch and outstanding service. Very laid back approach to the entire experience as it would be in its namesake city.
5,Barcelona wine bar is a very elegant yet smooth place to be. Barcelona was one of the first places to actually provide outside dining during the Covid pandemic. I must say that the service is impeccable the food is amazing and I would definitely revisit once the pandemic is over. The wine is great and the seafood is very fresh. Our waiter was very nice and very helpful. He was very informative about the menu and how to walk us through the new way of ordering through the barcode.
3,"If you want a waiter that acts like you&apos;ve never had tapas or paella then this is the place for you! If you want burnt paella, then this is the place for you! If you want to wait an hour for it, then this is the place for you.

Our waiter kept talking to us throughout our meal about how to eat tapas. Like we don&apos;t know already. 
I wonder if he&apos;s even been to Barcelona? Ibizia? Formentera? Mallorca? 

THE KICKER: when we asked about our late paella, he brought it, BURNT- but added this little quip &quot;the way to eat paella is to scrape the bottom so you get to the juices&quot; LOL. &apos;Twas no juices to be had. My friend said &quot;who says that&quot; she put her fork down and spit it out.

We showed him the INEDIBLE Pella and instead of understanding, he said &quot;let me get my manager&quot;
I said &quot;I don&apos;t need to see the manager&quot; but the manager showed up anyway and took it off the bill. 
We were offered no apology, and no warmth concerning our disappointment. My son was the only one who ate it, because he had just ran 14 miles and was starving. When we got back to our hotel (we were bringing him back to college) he said &quot;That was actually the worst dinner&quot;  I appreciate the refund of the dish but I hadn&apos;t seen my friends in Philadelphia for a while so to take them to dinner that disappointed us all was unfortunate.
Tip to the waiter: Don&apos;t assume everyone doesn&apos;t know how the food should be prepared. It doesn&apos;t suit the restaurant."
5,"I went here last week on whim and ended up loving this place. They have really nice outdoor seating on a patio and on the sidewalk. Was quoted a 30 minute wait time, but only had to wait 10minutes. 

Each table has a QR code and all of the ordering / payment is done on your phone. This is new since COVID, but I have to say I am fan of this kind of ordering. It makes it way easier when you&apos;re with a group of people. Each person can order their own stuff and have their own tab. I also hate waiting around for the check and trying to pay at the end of a meal and this completely eliminates that. You pay on your phone and can leave whenever you want. You still have a server to answer any questions and bring you things, but it&apos;s nice not having to flag someone down when you want something you just order it. 

The drinks were very good. I got the bourbon spice rack and the whiskey root. I preferred the bourbon spice rack and would definitely get that again. I didnt get a lot of food, but everything I got I enjoyed. We got the chorizo sweet and sour figs, the skate wing, and the whipped sheep&apos;s cheese. I personally dont like truffle and missed the truffle honey on the menu when I ordered the sheep&apos;s cheese, so I wish I had gotten it without it, but if you like truffle it definitely goes well with the cheese. 

Overall, there is really nothing negative I can say about this place. I am looking forward to returning and trying out more of their menu."
4,"I&apos;ve been there about three times and have yet to be let down. Even on a bust Friday night, the food wasn&apos;t compromised.This place is a blatant hidden gem and thankfully I stumbled upon it after a dance class... okay twerk and wine.  As I always mention, sharing food is my passion. So with certain places you have to go with your fellow sharers. Meg (my fellow sharer this evening) and myself have a bad habit of our eyes being bigger than our stomach. This evening is nothing short of that. 
The wine selection is phenomenal and I absolutely adore the variety in the wine flights. The last time I went it was a completely different vibe from the slow paced Wine dinner we shared. The bartender was pouring shots in our mouths and all I could think was.... &quot;ToTo you&apos;re not in Napa anymore&quot;. So we started with patatas brava. It is roasted potatoes with a garlic aioli and salsa brava and they are quite delicious. If your stuck between that and the potato tortilla with the chive sour cream.... GET THE TORTILLA. It is a true delight. The gambas al ajillo (Italians shrimp scampi), grilled octopus, hanger steak and skate a plancha were all great choices. Calamari and mussels in white wine were just OK. The true icing on the cake was the entree we spilt. Whole grilled Bronzino with an arugula salad and roasted potatoes were just sooooo great, I thought I was in the Mediterranean. If you don&apos;t have a passport or just can&apos;t afford to visit sagrada familia.... at least learn a bit of Catalan, grab a glass of Tempranillo and head to the Spain of south philly."
3,"Had dinner here last night. Ordered the gnocchi, lollipop lamb, duck, halibut, shrimp, and the beef empanadas. The empanadas and duck were our favorite very flavorful. Unfortunately everything else fell a little flat. Not really seasoned, all of the dishes needed at least a little salt. The shrimp were very bland and though the blood orange vinaigrette for the halibut was good, the fish itself was incredibly under seasoned. We also ordered sangria and mimosas. Those were good but the amount of ice in our other cocktails was ridiculous. Overall I might visit again and give it another shot, but I wasn&apos;t impressed at all. Kano era is a much better tapas place."
5,"This was such a nice find for a quick weekend visit! My boyfriend and I were just looking up random bars to visit while we were in town and I came across Barcelona Wine Bar. As you enter, the interior was very welcoming with the bar in the center and tables surrounding it. We decided to just sit at the bar with a nice view into the kitchen. I feel pretty bad since I totally don&apos;t remember the names of the ladies who were are bartenders. They were both extremely nice and very attentive. One of them was helpful with our wine choosing and they always checked on us every few minutes. 

Since we had a heavy lunch earlier in the day, we wanted something small to eat. Luckily, this place is tapas style so you can order a variety of choices that are in small portions. We ordered what was more like a grilled cheese mini sammie with a small piece of ham in it. Sorry, I completely forgot the name of it. Also, with such surprise, our bartender gave us a complimentary plate of dates covered in bacon. Omg, they were so good! I&apos;ve never had this combination before and I was just extremely happy and thankful for this nice gesture. 

The whole experience was amazing and I definitely recommend anybody who is in this area of Passyunk to go visit them!"
5,"I absolutely adore this gem! We found this spot walking down passyunk, trying to satisfy my Bloody Mary craving  Firstly, they absolutely nailed it! It was delicious and so was their calamari and bread. They&apos;re small plates (tapas) but very enjoyable. I was satisfied!

I also loved their patio, because I really didn&apos;t want to sit on the sidewalk in the sun ‍ Definitely going back"
