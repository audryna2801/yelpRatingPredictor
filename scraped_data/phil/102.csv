5,"We just enjoyed a lovely stay at the Rittenhouse. This hotel is handling COVID so well. Very clean, all staff in masks, COVID kit in our room included a reusable mask, wipes and hand sanitizer.
The hotel is situated on a beautiful park and convenient to too many restaurants to count. All are open, with plenty of outdoor seating, taking temperatures and enforcing masks. We walked to all the historical sites, walked by many great shops and really enjoyed Philadelphia. Clean city , beautiful flower boxes, friendly people. Yes there are the common city issues but nothing unusual or concerning. 
The Rittenhouse staff was lovely- from the valet from the minute we arrived to the front desk helping us decide where to explore. 
Room was spacious, well appointed with lovely Italian toiletries , the bed divine and perfect pillows. 
Highly recommend a trip here and to this great city."
5,"This is a great and luxurious hotel that&apos;s tight next to a park.

1. Reserve online.

2. Check in using your ID and the same credit card on file.  The whole process takes less than 5 min.

3. Take an elevator to your room.

4. Someone will bring you ice, a bottle of water, and a piece of chocolate.

5. Unpack and hang our clothes using the hangers.  Thete are tons of hangers in the closet.

6. Lie in bed, enjoy the view, or watch TV on the big screen.

Tips: upon check in, ask for a map if you are not familiar with the area.  Generally, this is a safe neighborhood, but if you are exploring around town,  receptionists can tell you which areas you might want to avoid."
5,"About as perfect as a hotel stay can get. I had a lovely, spacious, clean room and extremely friendly service. The boutique shop on site was a bit of a letdown as the selection was very limited.
My room was missing a remote and they had one delivered to me in less than five minutes.
The location is perfect."
4,"Well we stayed in the Executive Suite City View. The room was no better then a Marriott room (Marriott is wonderful, I only say that because this is a 5 star hotel) however amenities the hotel has to offer is A1! There was no microwave in the room. However room service was nice enough to heat up our food. The fridge was only big enough for the mini bar options, not to actually put food  in (I&apos;m sure that was done on purpose). The room was definitely clean, however there were cracks in our bathroom floor by the toilet. We paid 640 for the suite and based on the size and room itself it wasn&apos;t&apos; worth it. However, it&apos;s definitely a nice hotel. They only have valet parking, which was nice."
5,"I had a wedding in Downtown Philadelphia and would be attending the Rehearsal Dinner, Wedding and Sunday Brunch so I decided to get a room for two nights at the Rittenhouse. 

The room I got was on the 9th floor and overlooked 20th Street, which was nice, but I would have preferred a view of Rittenhouse Square. However, the amenities in my room were great. The TV was giant and extended while the couch had a roll-out bed inside of it. There were plenty of seating areas and the large king bed I had was very comfortable.

My room lacked much of a kitchen, but they did have a little section that had a coffee maker and a mini-bar. However, I was in the bride&apos;s room a couple of times and noticed she did have a full kitchen, but I suppose that was due to the fact that she stayed in a suite.

The lobby here is really nice with some seating areas and close access to the hotel&apos;s Library Bar. There is also a nice Italian restaurant inside the Rittenhouse Hotel. 

Also, the staff here including the front desk staff, concierges and doormen are all helpful, polite and courteous. 

Finally, when checking in you get a few vouchers for some free drinks from the bar. Also, depending on when you check in they may have chocolate covered strawberries available, which is a nice touch. 

Altogether, the Rittenhouse Hotel is one of the nicest hotels in all of Philadelphia and a great place to stay for any occasion!"
5,"Took my Daughter and girlfriend to this hotel for a weekend.
I booked two clean, and well placed, comfortable suites at a very reasonable rate.
The hotel staff were kind, attentive and friendly.
Even though we had the teeniest hic-up with house keeping - the manger Alicia Rodrigues was so professional and accommodating that it was forgotten in seconds.
They have an amazing bar and a wonderful breakfast room on the morning.
This is a lovely, professional and sleek cool place to spend a break whilst visiting the center of Philly. The staff are some of the kindest people I&apos;ve met.
Highly recommended.
Thanks for making our stay so great!."
5,"Amazing Hotel, love the service and the food. 
Although the atmosphere very formal, but it&apos;s just feel home when you stay here. 
Family friendly and animals friendly. 
You can also enjoy the residential condos that available beside the hotel. 
Definitely recommend it if you are visiting the city, very close to a lot of places and restaurants."
5,"Did not expect a lot, but was pleasantly surprised.  All the  staff was extremely attentive, welcoming, and warm.  
Our suite was spacious with a separate sleeping area and living area, which was very nice.  We loved the toiletries as it reminded us of staying in plush Spain hotel.  It had a bathtub separate  from a shower which was also very nice.  
They have a beautiful pool with sauna/steam room and toiletries which included shampoos, hair conditioners, body gels, individual shavers, shaving creams, body lotions and hair dryers.  

Suggestion: 
1. Include bags for swimming trunks and other wet clothing. 
2. Include 4 hair curlers to beautify hair.  

We also enjoyed a nice touch of apple display for all guests and enjoyed some fresh apples and strawberries in chocolates.

Thank you.  

Everything was wonderful!  Thank you!"
4,"This review is specifically for the afternoon tea. 
I had been having a rough past few weeks and my husband surprised me by making reservations here for afternoon tea (hadn&apos;t had it for the past few months, since I moved to Philly from D.C.). Bonus: it was one year since my now husband proposed to me :)

The place settings were beautiful and cozy and the music, softly played all my favs from the Sound of Music. (I secretly lost it at edelweiss, such a beautiful song). The harpist was a dream. 

I also must say the service was impeccable from the minute you step in to coat check until you leave. Servers were very attentive and knowledgeable. We got the $55 package which came with the sweet and savory tea bites and cakes platter, a glass of wine and your choice of tea in your own teapot. What I was unused to and was quite pleasantly surprised by was the &quot;sharing&quot; option where for $20 more you could get another tea/teapot. I am definitely used to just having to pay double price. 

Honestly, I loved all the little sandwiches and the scones (and accompanying spreads) were amazing but I didn&apos;t much care for any of the desserts except maybe the little fig one. I think I might have enjoyed them more if they were chilled. Not sure. Also when the server came to explain what was on all the platters, she only spoke about the scones and savory stuff and didn&apos;t mention anything about the desserts...I mean some were obviously chocolate but since they were so thorough with the rest why not? Also we opted for the sharing option because I am used to 2 of everything being brought on the platters anyway but maybe next time we might just pay double because there was only one of everything so difficult for both of us to try everything."
5,"The nicest hotel I&apos;ve ever stayed, even better than a Four Seasons and Ritz. Extraordinary facility, restaurants, and staff. Perfect location in Center City Philadelphia with dozens of outstanding restaurants nearby and a healthy enjoyable walk to many sites including Independence Hall, World-class museums, university of Penn, and the Italian market. I still miss the bedding!"
5,"I LOVE this hotel.  If you are staying in Philly and want luxury in the city then Rittenhouse is the place for you to be.  The rooms and service are top notch.  The entire hotel is spotless.  They are dog-friendly (any breed, any size) with a fee of course.  The rooms are huge and the tv have a built-in Chromecast.  Turn down service includes robes, slippers, milk, cookies, and mints. We stayed during Christmas time and they opened up a large treasure chest filled with brand new toys and let my son pick whatever toy he wanted to take home as a Christmas gift. We got a park view room that overlooked Rittenhouse Square which is beautifully decorated for Christmas. I 1000% recommend the Rittenhouse."
5,"My client lives in the condo part of Rittenhouse Hotel/Condos at 210 W Rittenhouse. Unfortunately, my car has gotten towed so i waited in the lobby until a ride came. Neal, the front doorman was so nice and so helpful with getting me phone numbers and calming me down and talking. The other staff members were very nice and all talked to me while i waited."
4,"I attended a newly wed brunch here after the wedding. The service, food ambiance, everything was absolutely exquisite."
5,"*This review is for the spa*

Working retail really sucks the life outta you! After holiday season and working 2! Not 1 BUT 2! 50 hr work weeks back to back, I told myself that I deserved a treat! And what better way to treat yourself than with a spa day!

Spa: 
Every inch of the spa was clean and very modern. Once you&apos;ve checked in, The girl from the front desk gives you a tour of the whole spa, which is helpful! They have a relaxation room (tea and water is provided) Sauna, Steam room, Gym and a pool. They give you a locker ( more spacious than I expected) and you can make up your own 4 digit code which is nice! The robes are very warm and plush. They also give you slides which came in handy since I forgot to pack some for the pool.
The women locker room is very nice, they provide you with everything you need! Hairdryer, brush, comb, deodorant, razors, you literally just have to bring yourself and a bathing suit.

*Also, This is my first real spa experience. I usually go to Hand and Stone for a massage, which I never really enjoyed but w/e it did the job. Why pay $150 for H&amp;S when you can pay the same price for a more relaxing and luxurious experience.*

General Service: All the staff members I encountered were very nice and accommodating.

Atmosphere: It felt very luxurious, staff and guests were all very quiet which I appreciated. The Relaxation room was my favorite part! The lighting was perfect and there was enough space for multiple people to really relax and stretch out.

Massage: I had the 60 min &quot;The Rittenhouse&quot; massage. Colleen was great! Ive had a massage by a women before and usually it makes me very tense, but I was so calmed and relaxed that I would definitely book with her again!

Pro Tip: They let you stay as long as you&apos;d like. My massage was at 1:00, I arrived at 12 to check in, used the gym, I swam in the pool and relaxed before my appointment.  It wasn&apos;t busy the day I was there which was perfect! After my massage I spent almost another 2 hours taking my sweet ole time just relaxing. Sat in the steam room for a bit, showered, did my hair, makeup, etc!

I definitely recommend The Spa at The Rittenhouse!! I will be returning very soon!"
5,"My new husband and I stayed here for the first few days of our honeymoon - what a glorious and luxurious way to start our married life!  It was the perfect place to rest and celebrate after we were married on Rittenhouse Square.  My mother-in-law gifted us a few nights at the hotel since we were having our wedding reception at the delicious La Croix restaurant. When the hotel manager found out it was our honeymoon, they upgraded us to the most beautiful suite looking over Rittenhouse Square. Everything about the experience - the celebratory champagne from the manager, the luxury bed and bedding, the lavish marble bathroom, the attentiveness of the staff - all made it an experience we will remember fondly for the rest of our lives!

If you want a memorable and luxurious stay in Philadelphia, book your stay at The Rittenhouse Hotel."
1,"We went in for a drink. This was the worst bar experience I have had in America. We were ignored upon arrival, after half an hour, we approached the bar for a drink as we assumed there was no table service, where we were rudely told that we had to sit down. Old men accompanied by young girls were served at the bar promptly however we received no service. After eventually being asked what we wanted, the bar staff provided ice water, and then continued to drink whilst behind the bar. We were treated like scum, my advice is do not go."
4,"The staff makes this hotel exceptional. Not the utmost most luxurious or absolutely best furnished hotel I&apos;ve ever stayed at, but I&apos;ve rarely ever encountered such engaging, helpful and fun staff anywhere in the world. Also the bed and bedding was so so so comfortable I wanted to take it all home. I&apos;m now trying to find reasons to go to Philadelphia just for another stay. 
Would suggest you bring your own bubble bath as they have none on the premises. The horror."
5,"Second stay in a few weeks at the Rittenhouse Hotel.  The staff is top notch, very friendly and welcoming.  Our rooms, on both stays, were five star.  Rooms are roomy, bathrooms have a shower and a full bathtub, which is rare when in the city.  
Beds are extremely comfortable. Love the spa smell streamed thru the halls (nice touch). This hotel just does it right.  Oh and the location is perfect for reaching all the tourist attractions &amp; restaurants for that non-tourist (locals) feel."
5,"Spent five days in Philly at the Rittenhouse, a thoroughly enjoyable stay. The staff were universally polite, friendly, and helpful. The room was spacious, bright, clean, and comfortable. Housekeeping was prompt and thorough. The Library Bar offered perfectly mixed cocktails in a relaxed setting. High tea at La Croix was an elegant afternoon diversion. My wife raved over her spa visit.
     The hotel has a variety of restaurants and shops all around it. It is close to a variety of museums. The Reading Terminal Market and City Hall were a short walk away, a bit further to Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell. The concierge or bellmen gave advice on where to go how best to get there. I will look for a reason to go back to Philadelphia just for a chance to stay at the Rittenhouse again."
5,"April 9, 2016, a day that I will forever remember. The Rittenhouse Hotel and the Lacroix Restaurant in The Rittenhouse Square area of downtown Philadelphia were an extraordinary backdrop for a special moment in my life ... My Wedding Day!

The Rittenhouse Hotel, situated directly across from Rittenhouse Square, and Lacroix Restaurant with Lily&apos;s Cafe and the La Serre private dining space provided us with the wonderfully ideal, intimate, elegant and organic setting for our wedding.

5+ Stars for Sylvain Briens, Food and Beverage Director for Lacroix. From Day One upon when Sylvain walked us through the hotel lobby, lounges, and the various areas within the restaurant, he was not only the consummate professional but also very charming, personable and witty. Sylvain&apos;s attention to detail was also second to none and certainly solidified our decision to make this the perfect setting for our special day. Aside from the obvious visual beauty of the hotel and restaurant, it was comforting knowing that everything, including all the little details, would be taken care of with ease and elegance. Equally as impressive was the way in which he and his staff accommodated our guests treating them with the same level of importance as we were given as the bride and groom.

So, who expects a snowflake-laden day to pop-up on the second weekend in April? Well at least not me, however the atmosphere of The Rittenhouse was so wonderful that the snow was an afterthought as it was sunny in my head and heart.

The pre-wedding cocktail hour was held in Lily&apos;s Cafe, the same space where the nuptuials were exchanged, was quite splendid with several hors d&apos;oeuvres ... tuna tartare, short ribs rillette, heart of palm tempura with aioli and crab complimented by an open bar of wine, champagne and cocktails. The hors d&apos; oeuvres received rave reviews from all the guests as they nibbled and mingled prior to the ceremony.

My vision for the decor played out perfectly as my wedding planner, Tonia Adleta of Aribella Events, brought all the decorative elements together in such an organic, intimate and luxurious way.

Our dinner reception was held in La Serre, an intimate private dining space with a long wooden table with seating up to 18, adorned with cream and green florals and accented by beaded candles. The chairs were upholstered in a forest green velour which enhanced the overall natural feel for this quaint environment. It was just the touch that we were looking for to complete the picturesque French country setting.

The servers were very precise, executing their skills masterfully like a choreographed performance, attending to each of the guests&apos; requests and needs. Dinner was exquisite ... a true compliment to the setting with traditional starters of either Caesar Salad or Shrimp Cocktail followed by expertly prepared and plated selections of Butter Poached Lobster, Filet Mignon, Green Circle Chicken, or English Pea Risotto. Some of the main selections change seasonally depending on when you hold your event, just one of the finer details that Sylvain discussed with us as we built the menu for the evening. Dessert was artistic and yummy choices between a Chocolate, Salted Caramel, Hazelnut and Mango delicacy or Pavlova with Grapefruit, Pistachio and Honey. We told our guests that hopefully they saved room as last but not least was the wedding cake ... baked by Sweet T&apos;s Bakery in Haddonfield, NJ ... a gorgeous naked triple-layered cake champagne vanilla with salted caramel and blueberry velvet adorned with fresh florals and drenched with strawberries and blueberries. The wait staff also gracefully handled serving all of the slices of cake to our guests after we cut the cake and shared our first slice.

If you are planning a mid luxe wedding in Philadelphia and want exceptional customer service, attention to detail and a setting with a multitude of beauty, style and elegance, Lacroix restaurant in the The Rittenhouse hotel is the place."
