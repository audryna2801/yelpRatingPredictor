5,"My friends and I were looking for a dinner place near by that wasn&apos;t packed + had indoor dining since it was cold out. We finally decided on JJ Thai and we were do glad we did! 
My friends got a variety of items. Two of them got a side of fries and the fries already were seasoned and crispy yummm. I got a Thai ice tea which was really good and not too sweet like how other thai places make them. My vegan friend for stir fry mixed veggies with rice while I got the grilled seafood combination which came with mussels, shrimp, scallops, salmon, grilled veggies + sticky rice. 
Presentation was beautiful and everything tasted great! Yummm the sticky rice tasted like it had coconut milk in it which gave it a nice touch. Overall I enjoyed our meal, we felt safe dining in (they put hand sanitizers at your table and on the paper menus they outline what they do to protect you). Great service and great food! I would come back again to try other food items :)"
5,"My friend and I wanted to get Thai food for dinner so we decided to try JJ Thai. We ordered over phone for pick up and ordered chicken red curry and beef pad thai. Our order was ready to pick up in 15 minutes and we were given the option to pay via Venmo or card. Service was great! Everyone wore masks and we were able to maintain social distancing especially with paying via Venmo.

The red curry and pad thai together were portioned sized perfectly for two hungry people and both hit the spot on a cold day! The curry had a nice amount of spice and the pad thai was chewy and full of flavor. Next time I want to try the drunken noodles and green curry."
5,"I think I might have found my new go to Thai restaurant in Philly. I came here for dinner with my brother after being recommended this restaurant by a friend. I&apos;ve had Thai food several times, but I&apos;ve never had any that slapped this hard!

We came to dine in, to which we saw they had both outdoor and indoor seating. We didn&apos;t make a reservations (this was a Saturday night) so we ended up having to wait about 20 minutes. It ended up being well worth the wait. They were limiting seating indoors to about 4 tables and the ambience is very calm and the lights were dim. 

We ordered 2 appetizers--shrimp shumai and chicken satay, I ordered the Pad Gra Paw with chicken, and my brother ordered the Drunken Noodles with beef and shrimp. Our food came out a lot quicker than I expected it would, which was great because we were both starving. The chicken satay was perfect. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever had chicken that tender and succulent! The shrimp shumai was also pretty good. It wasn&apos;t crispy or too over cooked so that was a plus. 

My Pad Gra Paw was also amazing! It was savory and sweet and spicy, just how I wanted it. I also tried some of my brother&apos;s Drunken Noodles and was surprisingly impressed! I typically stay away from Thai noodles, but this tasted so good! It actually had me considering ordering it for myself the next time I come here. 

Overall, the food, service, and ambience were AMAZING --10/10. Plus it&apos;s BYOB! My only complaint is that they don&apos;t deliver to my address :( . But that might be for the best since I would probably be spending all my money here."
5,I visited JJ during the reopening and the place has implemented very good and specific procedures to make you feel safe even you want to try their dine in service. The curry that I ordered is very tasty as well. I ordered a fried tofu that is on their menu and the owner was very nice and willing to accommodate my ask.
5,"We came here for a pre Valentine&apos;s Day dinner. I grew up on thai food and always interested in places that serve food that reminds me of my moms cooking. The restaurant is beautiful inside. I ordered the drunken noodles and my boyfriend got the spare rib in massaman curry. I tried his and a memory of home came to my mind instantly. It just took me back to being home with my mom. The drunken noodles I had were perfect. Not too spicy, even though I love spicy. Then for dessert I decided to try the matcha creme brûlée. The texture was perfect. The taste was subtle, I love creme brûlée and this twist on it was perfection! Highly recommend this place. The atmosphere, the service, the  food, I wasn&apos;t disappointed!!! You won&apos;t be either."
5,Nice little hidden gem. Try their famous crispy duck salad. Definitely will have you coming back for more.
3,"I haven&apos;t been to JJ Thai in awhile, and in my memory, it had been the best Thai restaurant in Philly. A week ago, we decided to get some takeout from JJ Thai for the first time in a year.

I had the drunken noodles with beef, and my husband had the green curry with chicken. The drunken noodles wasn&apos;t as flavorful as before. The flavors were there, but they were weak, and the spiciness overpowered the whole dish. 

My husband&apos;s green curry was good, but the side of rice that came with it was tiny. 

Overall, it was a satisfactory meal, but maybe it&apos;s time to seek out a better Thai restaurant."
5,"Good food at good prices. I always get the lunch specials. I recommend trying the pad thai, green beans, and Thai tea. Can&apos;t really go wrong."
5,"It&apos;s always a struggle to find the best Thai food in the city, but JJ Thai is by far the best I have ever had in many years. I have come here for both lunch and dinner and both times, the food has been excellent. This restaurant has even got my parents approval, which is hard to come by as they are both in the food industry! 

Lunch specials are all very good. Be sure to get the side salad with peanut dressing! This dressing is phenomenal. 

My typical go to meals include the Thai Green Curry, Chicken Pad Thai, and Drunken Noodles with Shrimp. Literally, these dishes are so good and consistent every time. I highly recommend these!

Appetizer Mussels were also very delicious and the Pan Seared Scallop entree is cooked perfectly. I will be coming back to try some more items on the menu!"
4,"Came here for lunch on a Friday afternoon; the restaurant wasn&apos;t crowded and I was seated immediately.

I ordered Crispy Salmon, which was tasty and reasonably priced; it was served with soup or salad - I chose soup, which was carrot and surprisingly, really good! 

Good place to try for a quick lunch."
5,"Updating another 5 star review. 

We went in starving for a late lunch and ordered: 
Crispy spring rolls - arrived quick, tasty and filling with a great dipping sauce (ask for the spicy sauce and chili powder)
Drunken noodles - an ever favorite. SO much flavor, it was hard for me to stop eating continuously for the first 5 minutes
Grilled salmon in green curry (weekend special) - this blew us away. Amazing depth and flavor, with a unique combination Brussels sprouts, asparagus, peas, chopped shrimp and tender, buttery salmon grilled to perfection. I hope they have this again, I&apos;d rate it as the top dish here, and I love all their items 
Matcha creme brûlée - I normally tend to not think much of Thai desserts, but JJ managed to exceed expectations there as well. The matcha was not overwhelming but added an interesting element to a perfect creme brûlée

5 stars, again. Cannot wait to dine here and try more of their specials (and regular items as well) 

Best Thai in Philly for me, period. 

I&apos;m a regular red curry customer here, never disappointed me. I first had it when I was looking for apartments in this city back in Feb. Has been consistent so far. 

This evening, I went in with the intention to pick up but asked them to serve me there instead. Sat with a book and enjoyed the Tom Kha Gai (good flavor) and Pad Thai with shrimp (exceptional). The Pad Thai sauce was slightly sweet but it was really well made and bursting with flavor. 

I see no reason why JJ Thai won&apos;t continue to be my favorite Thai joint for years to xome"
4,"The outdoor seating is limited but cozy. If you&apos;re craving good Thai food, this is the place. The Tom Kha soup had a hit of lime which may not be for everyone. The red curry is like any other red curry- wish it was spicier. The massaman curry had nuts which was different. The drunken noodles were the best- I would order again and again."
5,Everything from the service to the food was amazing. Staff were extremely helpful even from the first convo I had with them on the phone making the reservation for lunch. We are big Thai food connoisseurs so we had a couple of our usual dishes and weren&apos;t let down. Def the best food we had in philly during our short 3 day trip. Fast and friendly service couple with great food and incredible weather is all you can really hope for in life these days.
4,"Came here around noon time during covid times. Able to get a reservation easily and service was super fast. We sat outside and all covid precautions were taken. Ordered my typical thai food go tos which includes chicken satay, red/green curry, and drunken noodles. All were great!   They also had a nice french touch and brought us carrot soup which was nice and different. I would definitely come here again and have to try the takeout!"
5,"Best Thai I&apos;ve had in a long time. Stumbled upon it by accident and now find it hard to enjoy Thai from anywhere else. I&apos;ve eaten both takeout/delivery &amp; at the restaurant, outside-COVID style. Always a good meal!"
5,Just ordered pad Thai for the first time... so good!! Wish I knew about it sooner. Deff going to be my new go to spot for this dish
3,"I visited this restaurant for outdoor dining and was excited to try a different highly rated Thai spot. Unfortunately, the execution was lackluster. We started with the curry puff and spring rolls. The curry puff had good flavor but the filling was quite mushy and difficult to tell if there was actual chicken in the dish. The spring rolls were standard. Both had good dipping sauces though.

For our entrees we went with the Pad See Ew, Massaman Short Ribs, and Salmon Curry. The Pad See Ew, was pretty bad, the noodles were over cooked and they were entirely too sweet. Both curries had similar problems. 1. They are stingy with the actual sauce, making it difficult to really coat the rice with the supposedly delicious sauce, are they hiding something? 2. The meat was overcooked. 

Let&apos;s start with the short ribs, pretty good portion, with potatoes, and brussel sprouts throughout, but when you dry out a sumptuous tender meat like a short rib it&apos;s a shame. Then the Salmon curry, the green curry was outstanding, well the little bit we could taste, the shrimp, peppers, and brussel sprouts throughout were a nice touch. 

Final review
Curry puffs- 3/5
Spring rolls 3/5
Massaman curry 3/5
Salmon curry 3/5"
5,"I love the food here. Coming back to Phila, I found this gem! I especially love their lunch specials. Already ordered several times here. Pad Thai and Drunken Noodle are yummy!!"
5,SO DELICIOUS! The delivery was super fast and easy to do. The food was so delicious- I got the green curry and drunken noodles. Would order again!
5,"Definitely one of the best Thai food places I&apos;ve gone to. I really enjoyed the atmosphere here as well, it was super homey and elegant at the same time.

The Thai tea is a must! It&apos;s super delicious and under 3 dollars (a bang for the buck).

We got the pad see ew and the green curry. I personally liked the pad see ew more because the flavor was so rich (you know the noodles are good when the smell of the wok is there). I also liked the green curry (not the best curry I&apos;ve ever had), but it was a solid dish and the curry flavor itself was creamy and balanced. 

I&apos;m definitely coming here again to try more dishes!"
