5,"I&apos;m so happy that my family and I were able to reserve a table at this poppin&apos; place! Since it is covid, they have many precautions in place. They take your temperature, you must wear your mask when the server comes to the table and when you leave the table, and a strict 90 minute policy is placed so they can turn tables ASAP.

Our drinks were delicious and my family loved their meals. Many of us ordered the Prince Igor. At times, mine didn&apos;t taste fresh, but it was still pretty good. 

The opera singers sounded absolutely beautiful. It was AMAZING that our waitress was an opera singer and as soon as she was done, she went right back to work! Incredible. I definitely want to come back here.

*There is valet parking and he was very attentive!"
5,"An amazing night. The entire block on both sides was lined with tables. Heater at every table, great food, opera and show tunes from the balcony, this was hands down our best dining experience during the COVID-19 crisis."
2,"Pre-Covid 
Didn&apos;t enjoy our dinner here. The experience is unique which I&apos;m guess that&apos;s why their reviews are high but the food was not (it didn&apos;t help that we were seated right were they cleaned and dumped the dirty dishes which made clanking every few mins behind my head) it might have just been an off night but not very welcoming or friendly &amp; bad food equals we would not return ."
5,"My favorite place to dine in the city, the opera is truly magnificant and makes the entire experience more than just dinner. We have been coming here for years, it never disappoints. The place is a true Philadelphia staple."
5,"Lovely unique spot with opera singing over dinner! I&apos;ve personally lived in Philly for almost 7 years and hadn&apos;t heard of the Victor Cafe until recently. So imo, it&apos;s somewhat of a hidden gem, with its opera performance by the servers every 20 minutes or so. 

The performances are enchanting, and the spacing of the performances between the meal makes the experience all the more enjoyable. It feels extra special when you get to see your own server sing in between too. I&apos;m not an opera fan by any means, and if anything, this was the perfect way to appreciate and savor it without going to a full opera performance. I was definitely very wowed the whole evening. 

The ambiance adds to the whole experience - charming yet cozy, romantic, historic, and authentic. They have lots of small tables, but also larger spaces too if you have a bigger group. What adds even more to its charm is how unassuming it looks from the street outside; little would you know looking in from the outside about what a warm and lovely experience it held on the inside. The food was pretty yummy all around too!

Definitely would encourage a visit to the Victor Cafe for any special occasion, especially to bring family or a significant other!"
4,"A unique dining and entertainment experience for sure! I live very close by and have always meant to stop in. I was finally able to go last night and was not disappointed!

The restaurant is adorable and has a quaint, old school Italian feel. Although the restaurant is small, I didn&apos;t feel like I was on top of my neighbor while dining.

The food was delicious- they had a much large menu than I had expected. We started with the Caeser salad, the arugula salad, and the burrata. All were great and nice sized portions. The burrata had some delicious roasted red peppers on the side which was a nice edition to the dish. 

For entrees, we had the braciole and spaghetti, linguine and white clam sauce, and the special pasta Dino and Aeneas (shrimp, scallops in a white wine garlic sauce over linguine - wonderfully garlicky!)

The portions were nice sized, except the linguine and clams. The portion of pasta was smaller than the others and there were not very many clams. But we had apps, so we were filled up! We also split the creme brulee for dessert.

The service was really just great. We were seated right at our reservation time and the table service for food and drink was good as well. Also, I advised one of the members in our party was on crutches and they made sure to give us a table by a wall - very appreciative of that!

The opera singing was the best part of the night. We were there enough time to see all the waiters and waitresses sing at least once, and all of them were really incredible. It was a welcomed interruption and a unique experience!

Overall, we enjoyed the experience very much and would definitely come back!"
4,"Neat little spot.  Food was pretty good, but the real star of this place is the opera singing servers.  They&apos;re really really good and during the pandemic, the singers are up singing out of a 2nd floor window  to keep with social distancing.  There are some ground rules that you aren&apos;t supposed to talk while someone is singing so keep in mind you&apos;ll have to stop your conversations every 20 minutes or so for about five minutes while they sing.  I&apos;d say there&apos;s better italian restaurants in Philly, but the singing is a really unique experience you can&apos;t get elsewhere."
5,"Wow! Such a great experience! 
A nice Italian restaurant, filled with history, delicious food, great service. and entertainment.  What more can you ask for!!!

As you can see, I really enjoyed myself  :)

My family took me to Victor&apos;s Cafe for my birthday and it really was a lovely present. 
I have never been here before so wasn&apos;t exactly sure what to expect. 
The waitress was well informed, pleasant and patient with me trying to figure it all out.
Our drinks and appetizers came out pretty fast. Decided on a Arugula Salad and Burrata. Everything was so fresh! My husband can&apos;t get away from the beef and got Filet Mignon which he said was tender and delicious.  I got Dido &amp; Aeneas w/angel hair pasta &amp; sauteed spinach and warm chocolate cake and vanilla ice cream for dessert. It was delicious!
The best part was the performances.  All the waiters were trained opera singers and about every 20 minutes they rang a bell , tell us a short tale of the song they were about to sing. Then belted out a great operatic tune.  
They surprised me by singing happy birthday which was the greatest performance of the night. It took my breath away. Once you get it sung to you like that you&apos;re changed forever!
Unfortunately we were not allowed to take pictures of them singing  :(

Victor&apos;s Cafe is located at 13th &amp; Dickinson with just Street parking.  They do have valets to park your car for $12. 
The restaurant is on the small side, which makes it intimate. The seating is pretty close together, but we were still pretty comfortable. 
Only drawback for me was the bathrooms are all on the 2nd floor with pretty steep steps. 
They also have a nice bar and lounge upstairs.
I would recommend Victor&apos;s for a special occasion or some place different to explore.
Would definitely go back!"
4,"5 stars for the ambience, opera singing, and service. 3 stars for the food itself. 
It was a great experience to be in a restaurant that had a lot of character and liveliness. I love how there is a bar upstairs and you can relax in the lounge until your table is ready. 
Food review: It was average Italian food. The pesto olive oil dipping sauce for the bread was delicious and good quality. The bread was unfortunately cold. We ordered the calamari, fried perfectly, but lacked seasoning. I ordered the Prince Igor which is penne pasta with salmon, asparagus and vodka sauce topped with caviar. The dish lacked the fresh bright taste. Tasted like an average penne with vodka sauce dish. My friend ordered the lamb bolognese topped with a ricotta cream. She wasn&apos;t impressed.
We had the chocolate cake for dessert. Now that was definitely worth it! It had a perfect molten center and the cake itself was light and airy. I enjoyed the gelato with it as well.
Service and opera: Every 15-20 minutes, a member of the staff will sing opera for a couple minutes. They are all very talented! This is a great place to have a birthday if you want to be sung to. Service was great as well- from the moment you enter and are greeted by the friendly host to when you leave."
3,"We LOVED The Victor Cafe. The food, the opera, the concept-everything but the service. Our waitress clearly felt that being a food server was beneath her.

The ambiance upon entering was &quot;everyone here knows you&quot; and so cozy! 

We were quickly seated and started with the fried calamari (or fried smelts) with a side of spicy marinara and the eggplant croquettes. The waitress recommended the croquettes and said, &quot;I promise you will LOVE them.&quot;  When she arrived back to our table and asked me about them, I politely told her they weren&apos;t my favorite. It seemed like she took my honesty as a personal affront and her whole demeanor changed. For the ENTIRE dinner. 

We ordered the ravioli filled with porcini mushrooms in gorgonzola cream with tomatoes and toasted walnuts and the pork chop pan seared with onions and apples in butter wine compote with apricot brandy over garlic mashed potatoes. Oh my goodness! Both dishes were out-of-this-world! So good! Our drinks went unfilled but she did collect our used dishes (without so much of a word). We flagged her down eventually to order dessert (which was also fabulous!).

The singing was enjoyable and unique; we loved the concept entirely. I&apos;m sorry that the entire experience wasn&apos;t 5-star worthy."
4,I love going to Victor&apos;s when I&apos;m in Philly. The food is always fresh and the service is even better. The only thing I was disappointed in I was looking for a fettuccine Alfredo and they didn&apos;t have that. However the linguine that I did have was fresh and tasty and the shrimp were cooked to perfection. If you&apos;re in the area I encourage you to check it out. Perfect for a family outing or date night!
5,"Incredible Italian food, and equally incredible experience having the talented opera singers as servers.  Fantastic place outside Philadelphia for a date, group outing and special event. What&apos;s more memorable than being serenaded by a group of opera singers while having wonderful food and well crafted cocktails?

Upstairs, there is a dimly lit lounge with sofas, comfortable chairs, candles and artwork.   

My favorite restaurant experience in Philly."
5,"I can&apos;t say enough about this establishment. Everything was absolutely fantastic and such a different experience from the norm. The wait staff/opera performers are breathtaking (talented in both) and the food is outstanding. 
The appetizers were really good - we had the stuffed prosciutto and the eggplant croquettes. My  choice of entree was the ravioli stuffed w/ crabmeat in the cream sauce and it was so good I felt like swimming in it  My husband ordered tortellini in pesto sauce and he couldn&apos;t stop raving about it. 
Can&apos;t wait to go back!"
5,"What a wonderful experience it has been dining at Victor&apos;s Cafe. Where else in Philly are going to have the privilege of hearing talented opera singers- servers. We were speechless, by the performances.  The service was impeccable. The olive oil that came with the bread was delicious. We ordered shrimp bisque and fried calamari as appetizers and we finished our plates. Then, the pasta with scallops and Shrimps arrived, buttery and the seafood cooked perfectly. However, I was not fond of the Ravioli stuffed with crab meat with a saffron sauce. Too rich for my taste. We were already satisfied, but we had to get some dessert. So we ordered the bread pudding. It was moist and not too sweet. Victor&apos;s Cafe, bravo!"
4,"I throughly enjoy the ambience of this restaurant, it felt as though I was at the opera while having dinner and that in itself was a great experience. The pasta on the other hand.."
5,"Aria ready for a great dinning experience?
What a great dinner with my Daughter &amp; her boyfriend tonight.  Cheese platter was a great start with a nice bottle of Moscato,  Pork chops with a side of Fra diavolo penne and one of the best bread puddings I have had in 30 years not kidding! And all of that with Opera (Live) sung all around the room during your meal by the waiters and waitresses  I plan on coming back next time I am in town."
5,"This place is a must if you&apos;re in the Philadelphia area! We heard about the great italian food from comedian Vic Dibitetto who said he eats here every time he&apos;s in philly but we were surprised by the awesome atmosphere once we arrived. Every person on the waitstaff is a trained opera singer and they do a short performance every 15-20 minutes - and each one was fantastic! 

Besides the awesome performances, the food was also incredible. We got the burrata appetizer, veal picatta, and the cannelloni (manicotti stuffed with ricotta, veal, and spinach). Everything was delicious. The sauce on the cannelloni entree was out of this world and we asked for extra bread so we could finish it. For dessert, we shared the tiramisu which was perfect for 2 people. Glasses of wine range from $9-$12 and you can also purchase bottles for the table. 

They offer valet parking for $12 but we found street parking easily in the neighborhood. I already can&apos;t wait to return!"
4,"We went here on a weeknight.  Everyone was really friendly as we got seated. We bought a bottle of wine and then ordered the eggplant croquettes and burratta for apps.  We were given bread and a pesto dipper complimentary and it was delicious.  The bursts was to die for.  So fresh.  Everyone like the croquettes too!

We didn&apos;t realize a show was happening as the site said Monday&apos;s.  It was nice and the folks are all so talented. We just didn&apos;t know etiquette though...do we wait to eat our warm food that was in front of us until they were done their song (and some of the songs were really long) or do we continue eating? 

For mains we got the fettuccine verdi, ravioli, tortalini and the prince Igor.  We also ordered a side of the vodka sauce.  

The fettuccine Verdi was our favorite and we mixed it with the blush sauce.  The ravioli was everyone&apos;s least favorite with too much of a Gorgonzola/blue cheese taste taking over everything.  

We also got the tiramisu and the chocolate cake.  Again, both were amazing."
4,"What a great experience. We ate at Victor Cafe last night for my wife&apos;s birthday. She was happy with the choice. We arrived early and went and sat in their upstairs lounge. My wife and I had a glass of super Tuscan. The decor is a unique tribute to RCA records and Rocky. This is the restaurant that Rocky bought for Adrian in the movie. Very relaxing sipping a nice wine and listening to Sinatra in the background. Steven is the bartender upstairs And is friendly and knowledgeable. 

We were called promptly for our eight o&apos;clock reservation. We were seated downstairs for dinner. Downstairs the decor is a mix tribute of black and white photos of the DeStefano family (owners founder of the restaurant), and Italian opera singers. Yes the novelty of this restaurant is that every twenty minutes a bell is rung. Then one of the wait staff tells a story of a particular opera song, and then sings it. Boy do they sing it. Beautiful voices that add to a great experience. 

The food is good. For appetizers we had the calamari and eggplant croquettes. These croquettes were amazing. I had the fish of the day, Branzino, and sautéed spinach. It was good. The fish had a crispy skin, moist on the inside, and well seasoned. My daughter had the fradiablo. She said it was delicious. My wife had a stuffed chicken with creamy polenta. Sadly she did not care for it. For dessert wife got the creme brûlée&apos;s, and I had a cannoli. We all had cappuccinos. The staff brought my wife her dessert with a candle and singing happy birthday in opera fashion. She stated afterwards she only wants to be sung to in opera for now on.

What a great experience. If your in south Philadelphia check out Victor Cafe. You want be disappointed."
5,"What a treat! I am not an opera guy at all, having received any and all of my opera expertise from Bugs Bunny cartoons, but I thoroughly enjoyed hearing our servers perform from the balcony! They took the time to explain the aria (a new word for me!), which helped put the performance in context. Oh, and the food! Everyone in our party was extremely happy with their meal. I had crab stuffed ravioli with some sort of bisque sauce on top, with a couple of shrimp to top it off, and it was the best! Desserts were fabulous as well. Taramisu and the chocolate lava cake were favorites, with the frozen lemon sorbet a close 3rd."
