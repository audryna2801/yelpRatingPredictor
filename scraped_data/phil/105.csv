5,This has always been one of my favorite spots for Vietnamese hoagies.  Not only are the hoagies spot on.... the service is amazing.  I wish I got her name but during this pandemic she offered to bring the order outside curbside for me since I had a newborn.  What wonderful service and quality of food!!
5,Great spot conveniently located close to the WeWork. I ordered the Lemongrass pork with rice and absolutely loved it!  Super quick pick up and the people inside were really nice. Definitely check out QT!
5,"Great vegan options for an affordable price.  I would say my bread was a little harder on the ends than I would&apos;ve liked, but I&apos;m a big fan of the lemongrass tofu marinade. The soup I ordered was sweet, light and hit the spot. Delivery man was also very nice."
5,The food and service is terrific. The Bahn mi is fresh and delicious. The vietnamese coffee is excellent as well. The family is very kind and social. The best place or Bahn mi I have found in Philly. Recommend without hesitation.
3,"I really wanted to love this spot since there are so many positive reviews, but I have to give it 3 stars since I thought the sandwiches here were just okay.  I tried the QT Special and I felt like I was eating a lot of bread.  I felt they could&apos;ve included more meat and veggies.  It could also be that the banh mi&apos;s I&apos;ve had in NYC (where I&apos;m from) are made incorrectly since that is all I know in terms of what a banh mi should taste like.  Maybe the banh mi&apos;s are supposed to have more bread?  The banh mi&apos;s here in NYC are pretty packed and has a lot of flavor and that&apos;s what I&apos;m used to.  The ones at QT were a bit bland.  The excess bread also isn&apos;t helping the bland flavor since I tasted a lot of bread versus tasting what was inside.  I also had a few bites where it was just bread. 

Sadly, I won&apos;t be returning =("
4,"Solid banh mi alert! We grabbed a quick lunch here and was surprised to see how tiny the interior was. Definitely more of a take out place. We ordered 2 of the QT special banh mi. I initially thought the sandwiches were a bit pricier than other banh mi shops I&apos;ve been to, but once we got our sandwiches I was shocked to see how big they were. The banh mi I&apos;ve eaten usually aren&apos;t that large. So with that in mind, the banh mi here are actually a great value. 

Bread was toasted and crispy while the inside was stuffed with fresh veggies and a variety of different style pork. The only thing preventing me from giving 5 stars is that they don&apos;t include pate in their sandwiches! I&apos;m so used to having pate in my pork combo banh mi that I was sad they don&apos;t offer it here. 

We saw a sign outside the shop about an awesome loyalty program. If you order 10 banh mi, you get one free! Not sure if they are still doing this, but don&apos;t be afraid to inquire about it!"
4,"Thanks to all the yelp reviews, I found another gem in Chinatown.  

In the mood for banh mi?  Well, you came to the right shop.  I ordered the traditional/dac biet banh mi and the bbq pork banh mi.  While waiting, I had the opportunity to speak to the owner who was preparing my order.  He seems like a pretty cool guy and is just trying to stay afloat with his business because of the pandemic impact.  He also mentioned that his shop is the earliest banh mi shop in the area and has been open for about 10 years.  He also has a food truck which drives around the area selling similar items in the shop.

In short time of our conversation, my order was done and bagged to go.  The banh mi was pretty good.  I love the crispy toasted bread/baguette.  Portion size is definitely good enough to share for two people.  Because I was in adventure of food tour, I didn&apos;t order the noodle dishes but will need to come back another day to give it a try."

Having previously lived in Philly for 4 years and always frequenting CT, I never knew QT existed until today when a friend and I came here to order Banh Mis for takeout.

The place is a small, cute spot at the corner of 10th and Cuthbert and if you&apos;re not looking too closely for it you might just pass it by. I ordered the QT Special Banh Mi, which was delicious and flavorful! While I wish they could have added more meat and veggies, I was content with it after finishing it. So far this is the first banh mi I&apos;ve had in Philly and it looks like we&apos;re off to a great start!

Not to mention, this place is very affordable : )"
5,"I&apos;m not sure what they put in their noodle soup but I always end up devouring it like a starved child. It&apos;s also incredibly hearty, like eating a warm hug. Their combination sandwich is my favorite. Ever since coming back from the Lunch Lady in Ho Hi Minh city I&apos;ve been craving a really good combination banhmi and I think I&apos;ve finally found it! I&apos;ve had numerous banhmis throughout the city and QT has the most legit! Picking up one of these plus a noodle soup and I&apos;m as happy as can be!"
5,"BLOWN AWAY! 

Best Bahn Mi I&apos;ve ever had. The sandwich was delicious, juicy, tender, spicy (added a jalape√±o) and dirt cheap. Get the QT special because you pretty much get to try three sandwiches in one - Vietnamese ham, Vietnamese pork and BBQ pork. At 6.50 the two of us split one and were delighted. 

Also got the Bun Rieu which I liked, but had nothing to compare to. Light tomato broth, very comforting on a cold day. Ask for their special spicy sauce which is made in house."
3,"I had super high hopes for this place. Theyre ranked one of the highest banh mi places on Yelp in Philadelphia, and although it was not bad, it wasnt great.

Maybe its because we dropped by close to their closing time and their bread wasnt as fresh? Or maybe they havent been having enough customers to keep a good rotation, but their food was pretty mediocre. The coffee was good though.

We got a special with 3 meats and a lemongrass banh mi + a summer roll with bbq pork. The filling definitely wasnt enough for the bread, as I had multiple mouth fulls of just bread. The flavor was alright, but just left me wanting more. I ended up dipping the banh mi in the summer roll sauce to substitute. 

I probably won&apos;t be back for a while, just because there are so many other places to try first. 

Maybe when everything returns to normal, they will too, and I&apos;ll try them again."
4,"Omg! This banh mi sandwich was awesome. I called in my order so it can be ready by the time i arrive so i didn&apos;t have a wait time. Contactless pickup, and payment (unless you&apos;re paying cash) the place was small, so in and out. I ordered the roast pork sandwich, and it was so good. It had a spicy element which i couldn&apos;t place. Idk if they pickled the cilantro leaves, but whatever it was it was a great addition to the sandwich. It was definitely the perfect way to go. Highly recommend"
5,This is my go to spot in philly for banh mi- price is very reasonable and the bread is good which is key! I recommend QT special my personal fave. Everyone who works there is also super nice every time I go.
4,We were here to try the bahn mi. I got the bbq pork bahn mi and it was good. I liked the bahn mi of bahn mi cali better. The cashier was really friendly. Good food.
5,"QT Vietnamese Sandwich is my favorite place to get banh mis. The QT Special is my go to everytime; it has a bit of everything -- pate, fishcake, meat, sliced pickled carrots, cilantro, jalapeno. I love that banh mis have the perfect balance of salt, fat, acidity and makes for a delicious snack or meal. The prices here are very cheap and reasonable too! Of course they also serve drinks and other food items like noodles and rice platters but I&apos;ve only really ordered banh mis here, and also the summer rolls one time. Their version of the summer rolls is a bit different and smaller than other pho places but they are pretty good too."
4,"My first time having banh mi in years (I miss my Vietnamese friends on the west coast) but this was bangin! Great sized sandwich for a great price.. albeit not stuffed with a crazy amount of meat, but that&apos;s ok though. It&apos;s really the perfect amount. 

I made the trek from the west side of center city during lunch today to see what the fuss was about. When I got there it was even smaller than expected yet very welcoming even with a sizable amount of patrons. The lady working was incredible. She seemed to be familiar with a lot of the customers remembering orders of people who hadn&apos;t been there in months, having genuine conversations and making suggestions about choices of meals. Fantastic. When I ordered my QT special she asked if I wanted peppers in mine, of course I said hell yes. The wait was only a couple minutes despite it being a busy lunch hour. I sat at the counter and watched the Musiq Soulchild videos on the tv while admiring the decor of the establishment.

The sandwich itself is so good. Perfect crispness/crunchiness of the bread and when you bite into the sandwich you can taste every fresh ingredient, packed with just the right amount of seasoning but not too much. By the time I finished I felt perfectly satisfied, not overly full nor desiring more.

Will be back to try other menu items for sure."
5,"Fantastic sandwiches. Got the QT special for $6.50, and it&apos;s incredibly filling and cheap! Bread was crispy and airy. Meat was fresh and loved the sauce and touch of cilantro in it. Definitely a great spot to get food that&apos;s cheap And convenient"
5,"Absolutely the best spot in chinatown for an on the go meal. The employees make every sandwich in love, and this place could really use the help. And they deserve support! I really recommend the lemongrass tofu banh mi, but you cant go wrong with anything on the menu. Thank you QT!!"
5,"This was one of the better banh mi&apos;s I&apos;ve had in a long time. Delicious pickled carrots, crispy and soft roll, and well seasoned lemongrass tofu. It hit the spot and this place will be my go-to from now on for banh mi!"
5,Fast &amp; delicious banh mi in the center city!! My go-to lunch place in Philadelphia :)
