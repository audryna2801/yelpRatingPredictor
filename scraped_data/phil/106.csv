5,"Even during the pandemic Noord still comes through even though it&apos;s &quot;Take Away Only&quot;.  You can&apos;t beat the price and the food is still delicious. From the Bitterballen to the Herring Sliders, to the Gravlax, the appetizers were fantastic.  The Pork loin won the best  entree selection with the Wild Mushrooms a little disappointing. 

Both the Bread Pudding and Puffed Pastry desserts were fantastic. 

Can&apos;t wait till this whole virus thing is over so that we can again enjoy their excellent staff and Chef in person."
5,"One of the top restaurants of any kind in Philly.  Everything on the menu is done with a passion to excel in the culinary arts.  Even during the pandemic, they are providing succulent Dutch dinners to go.  Even the bread before your meal will blow your mind.  I&apos;ve now taken a bite of over a half dozen things on their menu, and not a single thing even comes close to average.  I just don&apos;t think you can go wrong here."
1,"Very bad service. First time saw waiter curse. 

The iced water to start has flies, Three flies lying inside.... 

I suggest manager to hire more civilized waiter. The male waiter with braid found me several blocks away and cursed us with F words just because we were unhappy about his service and tole him he was rude (he intentionally ignored us when we tried to talk)."
5,"Noord. I thought a Dutch computer geek was involved when going here was suggested. Instead, it turned out to be a cutesy little Dutch wooden shoe of a place. 

There is room for about 25 diners if they don&apos;t get up to Clog Dance and mercifully there is no Polka loop to contend with and no braided Dutch milk maidens in dirndls curtsying table side. 

The Decor: There is art on the wall for sale, imprinted faux ceiling tiles, wood casement windows, and all in all it&apos;s like being in a small cafe waiting for a pannenkoek on Prinsengracht St. The only Hash is on the menu and the only Red Lights regulate traffic outside the front door. You&apos;ll just have to conjure up all those other memories on your own.  

The Staff: An affable Chef Joncarl, 2 in the kitchen to execute orders and 1 really busy, charming, cheerful server. 

This place is for serious foodie business all orchestrated by one of the coolest dudes to ever heft a Le Creuset Dutch Oven onto a stove. Chef Joncarl&apos;s attitude is &quot;No matter, we&apos;ll make it all work&quot;, and he does. 

The Vibe: Boers, Huguenots, locals, and tourists all coming to go Dutch and enjoy a Dutch treat.

The Bar: Perfect because you&apos;re bringin&apos; it.

The Food: Healthy trenchermen portions of fairly priced Dutch fare. The house made Bread was light and fluffy and stacked up 8 inches high. The Bread was made in the afternoon and still had a slight sour tang from it&apos;s Dutch Mother Dough. This was addictive and delicious. It was a bit spongy and soft with an airy crumb and perfect with a huge knob of Cultured Butter. It came all ready to sop &apos;n mop and/or eat neat.  

A Liver Pate with Apricot Jam was right off the buffet table at a Dutch Bar Mitzvah and good reason enough for the Dutch to protect it&apos;s Jews in WW2. 

My table jumped on the tasting menu. Chef Joncarl kept sending it until the white flag was raised. 

Fried Cauliflower with Gooseberries, Curried Carrots, Mint and Creme Fraiche was a great second starter and paved the way for some Grilled Asparagus covered in Egg Salad with pickled Red Onion. Now, doesn&apos;t that just take you back to those languid days of excess in Amsterdam during your gap year? 

A Mixed Salad had Strawberries, Danish Bleu, Baby Greens, Spiced Walnuts all awash in Green Goddess Dressing. This could&apos;ve been dinner on it&apos;s own. The Bread plate was surreptitiously re-filled and great for wiping up every speck of the Green Goddess left behind. 

Next up was a Norwegian Salmon (keeping it Pan-Scando) that was expertly cooked. Pink and translucent moist fish inside a crispy seared crust. Somebody knows their way around a kitchen in this kitchen. And if that wasn&apos;t enough, you should revel in the joy of the fresh Mussels and Clams that buried the Salmon. 

While you&apos;re on a fish jag, have some local caught Pennsylvania Trout over a bed of Caraway Seeded Sour Cream and Roasted Brussels Sprouts all settled in a Golden Raisin Gastrique. I&apos;m getting full just writing about it. 

Need a break from eating God&apos;s little swimming creatures? Have some Braised Curried Chicken which is definitely required eating here. 

Belts undone, blouses untucked, a platter of Meat Balls dripping with tart Lingonberry Compote will appear. The Meat Balls had a great grind of beef just quickly patted together leaving them feather light. You never want to overwork your meat. 

By this time your belt will be hangin&apos; from the chair back and the buckle on your Dutchmen&apos;s Pants will have long been quietly released. And just when you thought it was safe...out comes the House Made Chocolate Nut Bark along with a mound of Dutch Bread Pudding with more Lingonberries and a massive slice of Dutch Butter Cake the size of the Philly phone book.

Sweet surrender.  

Noord, Oh Lord, should not be ignored, it was that good."
4,"Really cute little spot in passyunk. We&apos;ve been wanting to go here for years! We got the mussels which were impeccable--probably the best part of the meal. The croquettes were also really delicious. For entrees, my boo had the salmon which was like a brothy dish. I had the meatballs which were very well done, but not what I was expecting (they were very Smokey and BBQy)."
3,"Came here for restaurant week. I ordered the Bitterballen and Pork Loin. The meal is also accompanied by rye bread and butter. 

The bread was quite good. It&apos;s a large soft chunk with caraway seeds that is lightly grilled. The crumb was very soft. 

The Bitterballen is a deep fried ball of unrecognizable pureed meats. There may have been fish in there? I couldn&apos;t tell. These meatballs were too mushy on the bite and had only vague remnants of actually meat protein. With this dish comes a little garnish of pickles and house salad. This seemed out of place for a meatball dish. 

For an entree I ordered the pork loin with smoked sausage. The pork loin was decently executed, though it did have some stick still on the bite. The small portion of sausage coins peppered throughout the dish were aromatic and savory. These were quite good. I found the sauce of this dish too be too thin and quite bland. It needed something to make it more savory. There wasn&apos;t much to be impressed with in this dish. 

My dessert, bread pudding, was well executed: soft and buttery and rich."
4,"Had their prixe fixe menu during COVID and it was an excellent experience! Definitely recommend it. 

Ordered online on Wednesday for Friday pick up. They sell out quick so you have to order well in advance! One of the things that really stuck out to me was how nice and sincere the (Presumably) owner was. Very nice in his emails, when he called me to get credit card payment, and when he gave me my food. 

Food was packaged nicely and ready right on time. One thing that was weird was that everything except the bread was cold? So I wasn&apos;t sure when it was actually cooked which was different than the other places I&apos;ve had take out from recently. Don&apos;t get me wrong, nothing was stale or mushy, but it threw us off at first. The snert (Split pea soup with bacon and sausage) was excellent. The tomato bisque was less heavy but delicious and with a nice kick of spices. The freshly baked bread which was AMAZING went perfectly with the tomato bisque. Had the pork and beans for an entree which was excellent with a delicious hint of mustard in the sauce. Also had the braised chicken which was good but just a bit bland and dry for me. The bread pudding was excellent and smelled fantastic - not too sweet. And the almond brittle was also good. We also ordered a pint of pickles which we haven&apos;t tried yet but look good. 

Excellent price for everything. Way too much food for one meal. Heavier food than many of the things we&apos;ve ordered lately (Meat and potatoes kind of thing), but excellent for a muggy weekend inside. Again, felt like a very nice and sincerely run business. They even drew a heart on the side of my take out bag with my name in the middle. Not a big gesture, but its those things that make it feel like they really care about their customers. 

Definitely recommend going and checking them out and supporting their restaurant!"
1,The service here just makes you lose faith in humanity in general. We didn&apos;t even get to the food part. It was a bummer cuz we were so much looking forward to it. Ya know what&apos;s better? Get a Philly Cheesesteak near the Macy&apos;s instead!
5,"All around great dining experience! We really enjoyed the complimentary bread, but held off on seconds to make sure we could try the smorrebrod (everyone around us was ordering it too! Highly recommend), entree and dessert. The star of the meal was the pork shank. I can&apos;t describe how delicious this meal was - the pork, beans, greens... it was all  perfection. The desserts were great - we ordered one of the specials so I unfortunately can&apos;t remember the name. Service was great - attentive but not over the top. All around fantastic place for a nice dinner!"
3,"Visiting philly for the weekend and came here for restaurant week, 3 courses for 35. I got the tomato bisque, pork loin and bread pudding. The service was great, even though we didn&apos;t make a reservation the staff was very accommodating. However the food was very mediocre. The pork was way too sweet and the dessert was not any thing special. There were many other options so maybe I just didn&apos;t order the right ones. But the atmosphere was very nice ."
5,Amazing food. Great wait staff that can give recommendations. So delicious and love the 3 course meal design. Love trying a different item every time I go. There is a bottle shop down the street that&apos;s a quick walk to grab a bottle of wine to bring with you. Quirky bathroom decor to top it off.
5,"I had a great experience at Noord when I went for the first time during East Passayunk Restaurant Week. We were slightly worried at first when it said online that the restaurant is closed on Tuesdays, but they open on Tuesdays specifically for restaurant week. 

It&apos;s byob, so my friend and I each brought a bottle of wine. 

I ordered the BitterBallen to start, followed by the Gehakt Ballen (which is a special and an extra $5), and then the almond butter cake for dessert. My friend ordered the brussel sprouts, the hot chicken sandwich and the dark Belgian chocolate for dessert. First, their bread is amazing! It&apos;s obviously freshly baked and it comes with a really good sweet potato spread. I really liked my appetizer and entree meatball dishes. I was worried about ordering two meatball dishes, but they were very different, and both very good! The brussel sprouts were very good. I also really liked my almond cake, because it had a strong almond flavor, like amaretto. The chocolate dish was good but it was really sweet and rich."
5,My husband and I were so happy we came to Noord to celebrate a special day! We got there early and had the best seat in the house (by the window). Our server was fantastic!! The food was out of ordinary in flavor and very well executed. We will definitely come back!!
4,"Jonathan&apos;s Hand-made Bread with house whipped butter and the wonderful service is reason enough to visit Noord! A petite restaurant with view of East Passayunk square, eating at Noord in the spring time at the open window was a lovely experience.

After the Bread, we started with Bitterballen (Dutch fried pork krokets served with nutmeg, mustard, salad) and Holland Sliders &quot;Broodjes Haring&quot; (mini herring sandwiches, cucumber, pickled onion, on potato rolls). Both were well-constructed and balanced.

For our mains, we had the Shellfish Stew (mussels, shrimp, clams) Sambal-style (jasmine rice, lemon grass, garlic, tomato, lime leaf) and the Konijn in het Zuur (vinegar-steeped rabbit leg, smoked sausage, lardons, baby turnips, zuurkool). The rabbit was tender and the stew was well-seasoned and served with sliced toast. Rather wished I had another hunk of Bread to sop up the stew juices, too, but didn&apos;t wish to seem fixated upon the Bread!

PS. Don&apos;t forget Noord is BYOB--there&apos;s a bottle shop half a block away!"
2,"Went to Noord tonight on a double date. Arrived at 7:05 for a 7:15 reservation and were seated right away. The food was excellent, but the service leaves something to be desired. 

First, the food: the complimentary bread is delicious, it has spices baked inside and we ordered two extra servings. Each couple ordered the meatballs and the rabbit which were both cooked perfectly - yum. 

Dessert was only ok, the bread pudding was too much like a sweet version of the complimentary bread at the beginning of the meal and the almond cake had too much almond extract so it tasted fake. All in all a decent meal and normally would be enough to make me come back soon. 

The problem however was the service. Around an hour and fifteen into our meal, while we were still eating dessert, the waitress drops the check, unannounced and uninvited. At an hour 30, she comes and asks for our credit cards and quickly returns the check. From then, every five to ten someone would come and try to give us signals to leave by removing plates, removing silverware, packing up the remaining dessert. At just over 2 hours, a different waiter physically came and asked us to leave as &quot;they had another party waiting.&quot; This was at 9:30 PM, an unusual time to have a second seating scheduled for a table.

Quite frankly, 2 hours is a standard amount of time to spend with friends in a restaurant and to rush out was sort of BS. I can&apos;t remember the last time that this happened to me and I&apos;m completely soured on an otherwise good experience. To top it off, I went back to the wait staff to call them out on the negative experience and instead of getting sincere apologies, all I got was a sarcastic &quot;sorry&quot; from one waiter and got scoffed at by another. Really, they were just rude and I left asking myself why I tipped them at all if they weren&apos;t going to be professional. 

Noord needs to retrain their staff and rethink their reservation system. 

Two stars for the food but this should have been a 4-5 star night."
5,"Once again, the most beautiful place to brunch. Light and airy atmosphere, impeccable service and the most delicious not-so-ordinary brunch fare. How do you keep doing it year after year, Noord? Forget that question. Just know that you do. Perfection."
5,"Noord is the perfect place to go on a cold, blustery winter night. The space is cozy and intimate, with pretty blue string lights and an open kitchen that makes you feel welcome. My date and I stumbled across this cozy restaurant in our search for a delicious meal. Alas, when we arrived, all the tables had been booked, but we left our names with the host (who also happens to be the chef/owner) Mr. Joncarl Lachman and he phoned us within 15 minutes to let us know that there had been a cancellation. He was so friendly and warm that even if we hadn&apos;t ended up eating there that night, we would have come back some other time, so taken were we by the ambiance and mood of the restaurant. 

We started our meal with some of the best complimentary bread I&apos;ve had in my life. The bread was wheat, with a nutty, slightly sour taste and a soft, pillowy interior. It was served with whipped butter and roasted garlic that made for an amazing combination. As an appetizer, we got the smorrebord, which featured prawn, salmon, and scallops served bruschetta style on toasted bread. The appetizer was, for lack of a better word, amazing. Each type of bruschetta was perfectly balanced in flavor, with the salty meatiness of the seafood balancing out the toasted bread. It was served with a side salad of greens and some of the freshest pickled vegetables I&apos;ve had to date. I never thought I would enjoy pickled onions so much. For my entree, I ordered the Konijin in het Zuur, a vinegar-steeped rabbit leg. It tasted, in my opinion, like uber gourmet chicken soup, with rabbit instead of chicken. I was in the mood for something a little different; nonetheless, the dish itself was very well balanced, with the meat on the rabbit falling-off-the-bone tender. My date ordered the &quot;Gehaktballen&quot; Dutch Sirloin Meatballs which were delicious, not to mention huge. The ligonberry onion jam added a nice, sweet acidity to the dish. We were so full from our appetizer and entrees that we skipped dessert, but their almond cake was very tempting. Throughout our meal, the waitress was attentive, but not overbearing. Noord is BYOB (a huge bonus) and she never let our glasses go empty. All in all, a phenomenal dining experience."
5,"Noord is always such a treat.  In a landscape of Americana, Italian, Mexican, African and Asian restaurants throughout the City, Noord stands apart for both Scandinavian fare, unusual in Philadelphia, and it&apos;s quality, a cut above even the best.  While a little pricey, even for a BYOB, I still return with friends to show them something different that South Philadelphia has to offer.  

The Good:

The food is phenomenal and well positioned for Americans (like myself) to take on without being too difficult or &quot;unknown&quot; - a great introductory course in Scandinavian cuisine!  I think every dinner starts with the grilled bread, which is delicious, but includes some roasted (and therefore spreadable garlic) which as smooth and garlicky!  This bread is great and unfortunately they charge an extra $4 for each additional order which must be incredibly common.  We ordered more around dinner!

We tried the Bitterballen which were soft pork croquets (recommended!) which just a touch of stoneground mustard and the brussel sprouts which were properly roasted and very enjoyable.  

My wife had usual pork loin which she would not stop raving about and I had the special seafood choucroute which was a sweet, slightly creamy stew with more mussels and clams then I could count.  We barely waddled out!

The service was good as well with our server eagerly answering any questions and the chef/owner (I think) stopping by as well.  Both were extremely pleasant.

It&apos;s also BYOB which is great!

The bad:

The space is perhaps mildly small, but without issue.  More cozy than cramped.  The prices are higher than some other comparable fare, but not by a lot.  I would expect a dinner for two to potentially push into 3 bills (with tip).  I reaching for problems, my experiences at Noord are borderline perfect!

Conclusion:

I&apos;d love to come back for brunch some time -the menu looks great.  Regardless, we&apos;ll return soon as we&apos;ve never had a bad experience and the food is always great!"
4,Great food here--I had the fish stew and the heirloom tomato salad.  My favorite thing was the bread with a fennel butter--I know that sounds crazy but it was really unique and I love fennel. Both main dishes were great. Service was excellent--fun and attentive. It&apos;s BYOB which is great also.
5,"Definitely one of the best restaurants in the city. It has some familiar Dutch dishes, which I love, but this place is so much more. The owner/chef is creative, serving up a variety of northern/Western European dishes, as well as variations thereof. I also remember that one of the first time I went with my wife, the chef happened to by dining at a nearby table and, not knowing who he was, we had a conversation with him about the restaurant and how we liked the food. He genuinely cares about what kind of experience his guests are having, and whether they&apos;re liking their food. A must-try on Passyunk Ave, and in Philly on general."
