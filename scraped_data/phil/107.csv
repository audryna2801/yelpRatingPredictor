5,We have returned to Estia several times.   A great menu.   The food is well prepared.   A great place to eat or take out.
5,"First time here, beautiful place even during Covid-times. Friendly staff, clean, and lovely romantic ambiance! We came for my birthday dinner, they gave me a kind card that says happy birthday. All of our food was great and flavored well. My only complaint is that the orzo was kind of bland, but everything else was phenomenal. Hope to return in the future"
5,"Came during the yellow phase of Covid19, which means we were only allowed to eat outdoor (not something to complain about). The server obv has been there for years; he&apos;s very knowledgeable with the menu which makes the decision process much quicker. Everything was fresh from their fried calamari to octopodi. Their Lobster linguine was definitely worth to mention. We also ordered lamb chops and they were as moist as they can be. 

Just try it. Enjoy it. Opa!"
4,"Cute Mediterranean restaurant. Delicious, chargrilled food. I really appreciated that they offered a &quot;theater menu,&quot; which offers 3 courses for $35 without compromising the integrity of the food. I got the grilled octopus, sea bass, and the sorbet. My cousin got the lamb (delectable). 

Concerns: the restaurant was, in no way, at 35% capacity. It looked to be more at 90%. This will surely put me in a frantic state of paranoia over the next couple weeks, but hey, what don&apos;t we do that is absolutely risqué during the pandemic? 

Service was great; however, due to the freshness of the food (? I guess), expect to wait a while.

Octopodi"
4,"This is a wonderful place to go if you are looking for outside (covid-safe) dining but also includes white table clothes, silverware, wine glasses and a starter of hummus and pita. We found ourselves at Estia on the night Joe Biden was called for the president, so every place was hopping in the city of Philadelphia. We sat outside on a beautiful night, ordered excellent cocktail specials (perfectly made) and ordered up the platter of spreads, calamari and two (!) orders of Estia chips. If you haven&apos;t had them...you should. How they prepare zucchini in a way that is so addictive one can&apos;t stop eating, I won&apos;t know... but as extensive of a menu that Estia has, these lightly fried, delicately salted zucchini chips are kind of a big deal. This place offers old-school-Philadelphia charm. And I have to say, whoever is whipping up those cocktails is doing everything right."
4,"A lovely relaxing happy hour before our theater date at the Academy of Music, conveniently located around the corner.

Happy hour ends by 6:00 PM, so get there and be seated at the bar or high tops and shoot out your order to take advantage of the prices. 

At a previous attempt, I arrived late a few minutes after 6:00 PM and they would not honor happy hour.

At my second attempt, I made sure to get there by 5:45 PM  and order from the happy hour menu immediately - and I don&apos;t know if this was an accident or not - I did order one more item after 6:00 PM, and they did honor the price.

Service was a bit slow, but it was busy and honestly, I was in no rush. I loved the little platter of warmed rustic bread paired with freshly made hummus, olive oil and a slice of radish as a complimentary dish. I loved the calamari ($8.5), hot, crispy and tender and of course, squeezing that fresh lemon is a must.  The grilled sardines ($8?) was a miss for me personally, and it&apos;s my taste buds at fault here. For me, just way way too fishy. Glad I tried it, but not for me."
5,"Came here yesterday for a late lunch/early dinner. Our waiter (forget name) was the man, very funny and did a great job. To start, we got the spanakoptia which was really good. For my main, I got the lamb chops with tzatziki and potatoes (essentially fries). The lamb chops were delicious and cooked perfectly. The potatoes were a bit unseasoned. The person I went with got the lavraki (Chilean sea bass), which they enjoyed too.   We got the salted caramel baklava and the autheneus cheesecake for dessert. The cheesecake was really good and the baklava was solid. Cool place and would consider coming back."
3,"Came for restaurant week for the lamb chops and have to say was pretty disappointed about the experience. 

Favorite thing of the night: THE SANGRIA.
Disappointing thing: how bare bones everything was. Mussels came with no toast or side bread. Literally mussels with red sauce in a bowl with all the cheese in the middle of one mussel. Spanakopita - 1 pie slice on the side of a barren plate. Branzino - just one huge fish (not entirely deboned btw!!) and no veggies or sauce or anything. At least the Lamb chops came with a side of potatoes. 

Service and ambience were good but for how excited I was to go there for RW, I was pretty let down. Regular things looked pretty overpriced (would you pay $47 for 3 lamb chops?? I&apos;d go to Amada instead please). Also they&apos;re owned by the same people as Pietro&apos;s so the bread basket was the same :)"
5,"So it&apos;s not errrrday that I give a place 5 stars but Estia blew my fucking socks off and out of the water. 

So I&apos;m a wannabe points bitch with my credit card because who&apos;s not trying to get some free bizz class upgrades, na&apos;mean? I got an AmEx card and one of the deals was $20 back for $100 spent which is a damn good deal if you ask me.

We made a rez to celebrate finishing a tough rotation on Sunday evening at 6pm. We arrived promptly at 6pm and were taken to our seats. We were frankly enamored with the decor and ambiance of the dining room. My little feta cube remarked on the fact that even the CEILING is cool. I believe there is decorative rope somewhere. Overall, the interior design has a very rustic feel.

The service is impeccable, as would be expected from a restaurant of this caliber. 

The menu is very large, almost comically so. There&apos;s a few cocktails, nothing particularly tugged at my heart strings but there was one cocktail with berry-infused vodka, simple syrup, and sparkling wine on top. This was served in a champagne flute and thus the volume was disappointing. The flavor was a bit rough around the edges. I didn&apos;t feel compelled to order another. 

The food, on the other hand, is absolutely spectacular. We ordered a few appetizers: the cheese saganaki, spread pikilia (three spreads with pita, we chose tzatziki, htipiti which is roasted red peppers, cayenne, and feta, and potato skordalia which is potato and garlic). The cheese saganaki is literally kefalograviera cheese (whatever that is) that is LITERALLY SET ON FIRE. This is one of the best things I have ever eaten in my entire life. The cheese develops this absolutely incredible little crust. 

The spreads were also unbelievable. The tzatziki was incredibly creamy and delicious. The potato one was also fucking bomb as was the htipiti (try pronouncing that to the waiter lmao). They were so smooth and flavorful. I&apos;d even eat CELERY with that shit. 

I also ordered the kale salata with baby kale, sliced apples, crispy chickpeas, olives, cucumbers, cherry tomatoes, and grated feta. The dressing was extremely light and the salad overall was refreshing. It was a huge quantity and I was unable to finish it all. 

Additionally as a side I ordered the greek fried potatoes which are essentially thick-cut french fries seasoned and topped with grated kefalograviera (whatever that is again but I am now tempted to look it up on google) cheese. These were again, one of the best fries I&apos;ve ever had. I definitely recommend ordering these bad boys. 

This place was sensational. I see that you can order from here for delivery on the website??? For rEALZ? I would definitely take them up on that shit."
5,My fiancé took me here a few weeks ago before the new dining regulations. Everything was amazing. I pride myself on making good lamb chops and this place put mine to shame. I can&apos;t wait until indoor dining is open again so that we can return. I plan on also ordering to takeout after the holidays.
3,"Came here for restaurant week and was definitely disappointed. I ordered the salad, which was recommended by my server. It was basic with huge slices of cucumber, tomato and feta. The dressing was nothing special, and it was disappointing that this was broadcasted as a special item on the menu by my server. I&apos;ve definitely had better Greek salads in my life. The bread and hummus they serve complimentary was fine, but again nothing special. My friend got the homemade spanikopita for his starter and it was also fine, but nothing special. 

We all got the sea bass, which had many bones still left inside. The fish was fine, but again nothing spectacular, it didn&apos;t have the taste of something spectacular. For dessert I had the semolina custard, which again was fine, but nothing special. For a pricier restaurant, I was expecting more. The food was not bad, but I think there are better restaurants in Philadelphia to money at."
4,"came for lunch during restaurant week and to my surprise they had a lunch $20 prix fixe menu which was even better than the restaurant week menu so we went with that!

let me start off by saying i had no idea this place existed, very nice and spacious inside; ample seating for everyone! would be perfect for a big dinner with friends or even a bridal shower

the meal started with some bread and hummus which was delicious! you could tell the hummus was freshly made and the bread was still warm

i got the sauteed calamari and the lobster pasta; both fantastic! the calamari quantity was pretty generous but i wish i had more lobster in my pasta. 

i&apos;ll definitely be back to try the dinner options!"
5,"This is my second visit to this restaurant.  As I live in the Princeton  nj area, I was here last year when I dAw a show at  the Merriam theater as well. 
This restaurant is truly awesome in every way. The service, the food, the ambiance and the  happy hour, it has it all!! The octopus appetizer is amazing, the lamb chops are absolutely incredible. We came for a bit of the happy hour and then sat down and had dinner. As it turned out, it was restaurant week so we went with that menu. The value was amazing and we will definitely be back whenever we are in the area. This is truly an amazing restaurant."
5,"This was one of our first diners out since quarantine. They have outdoor seating spaced adequately apart. The service was attentive, friendly and helpful. The food was delicious! We visit Greece every summer and since that do was cancelled this summer, this was a nice alternative. We had the lamb chops, branzino, mousakka, and eggplant. We had the trio of dips, spanakopita with homemade phylo!!!, and saganaki. Everything was well seasoned and filling. It was a great dining experience!"
5,"Went for my birthday - normally I don&apos;t love Greek food but I had a great experience here.

The interior is pretty large and the staff is super friendly and helpful.

Go for:
- Whole fish - they brought the pre-cooked fish to our table in its &quot;salt bath&quot; which was awesome to see. The fish was huge!! It also tasted incredibly fresh and had a light, lemon-y sauce.
- Calamari - can never go wrong with calamari but they cook it so that it&apos;s light 
- Lamb chops - so moist!

Tips:
- I believe they have a lunch special where you can pick an appetizer and entree - a great deal"
5,"OUR DAUGHTER TOOK US ON A DATE NIGHT. SHE MENTIONED THE AWARD WINNING LAMB CHOPS, But I never expected them to be all that she spoke of. Needless to say, Mom &amp; Pop are hooked!! The ambiance is pleasant, waiter staff is very professional and the food is DELICIOUS. We have decided that Estia will be in our monthly rotation. 
This is our 2nd time coming and The Restaurant Week menu was perfect!!"
5,"Great restaurant, with excellent service, and very clean. Food was amazing! Highly recommend the octopus for an appetizer and also the lamb chops as an entree."
5,"Some of the best food I had in Philadelphia. Wonderful service, excellent wine, and a varied menu. Octopus has never really appealed to me, but the grilled octopus was amazing. I thought it would be chewy but it was tender and tasted like steak. The lamb chops were spoon good. The Estia chips must be eaten while still hot. The beet salad is so tasty. Definitely try lots of the small plates."
4,"Came here before watching &quot;Mean Girls&quot; at the theatre.  We had the $35 price fixe--app, main, dessert--for 10.  Food was very good.  The waiter &apos;s Recs always had a surcharge in addition, the octopus, lamb chops, Greek salad, baklava, but they were delicious.  The octopus especially was delicious--probably my most favorite dish.

I also had the fish of the day--such a thin small portion that I was glad that I was sharing  lamb chops otherwise it would have been a very light meal!  But it was tasty.

Also tasted the spanakopita which was crunchy and rich.  My son said the moussaka was extremely rich but delicious.

Most folks got the honey walnut cake for dessert.

Nice atmosphere--great place before seeing a show!"
4,"I was going to a show Saturday night with friends, and a group of us went to Estia pre-show for dinner.  I was worried about getting a reservation, but the restaurant is so large that I was able to book a reservation and didn&apos;t have to do it too far in advance. They also have a great theater prix fixed menu that&apos;s three courses for $35. It&apos;s really a great deal to go during this time because otherwise, Estia can be pretty expensive. I likely wouldn&apos;t go there unless it was before a show. 

They have really good appetizers! I&apos;ve had their chips, which are really really good for just being chips. For dinner, I ordered the calamari sauteed, which was also really good, especially since I&apos;ve never had calamari sauteed before. The lamb shank dish was also delicious. I do wish I ordered the cake option for dessert instead of the baklava."
