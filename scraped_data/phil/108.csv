5,"Easily our go-to spot for fried chicken when the craving hits us! As a bonus, Love &amp; Honey is also one of our favorite spots for pie!

We&apos;ve tried just about everything on their menu and I&apos;ve always been impressed with the consistency. The chicken has always been moist and tender, with a great crispy breading. Even when delivered or when we pick up, the crispiness has held up quite well! My favorite is the Nashville Hot chicken sandwich, which is just wonderful. It&apos;s spicy, but not mouth-numbing spicy. So good, whether eating there (pre-pandemic) or at home.

Their tater tots also are worth getting. Another item that holds up impressively well when delivered. If you like the Nashville Hot seasoning, you&apos;ll love that on the tots, too!

If you&apos;re looking for an indulgent dessert, definitely order their seasonal pies! I&apos;m not sure I&apos;ve ever had a subpar pie from Love &amp; Honey, but their coconut cream and pecan pies are unreal. If they have pies in stock, definitely order a slice. I would be surprised if you&apos;re disappointed.

Overall, the staff has always been really friendly, and with great food and an impressive consistency, Love &amp; Honey can only get 5 stars from me!"
5,"I was recommended to try this fried chicken staple and
wasn&apos;t let down. Because of Covid it was takeout only but the Nashville chicken sandwich and fried chicken were simply amazing. I was unsure of whether I&apos;d like the spicy slaw but it became my favorite part of the sandwich."
5,"Got takeout since their indoor dining was not open. Their pickup time is accurate so don&apos;t try to go earlier. They will text you when your order is ready. Limited parking since it&apos;s around a residential area. 
My buttermilk chicken sandwich was very juicy and crunchy. The piece of chicken in the sandwich is meaty. I asked to have my coleslaw on the side and they gave me a decent amount of slaw. Unlike most places that only give two slices of pickles in sandwiches, Love &amp; Honey loads the sandwich with pickles! 
The fried chicken was crunchy, juicy, and the batter was well seasoned. If you like fried chicken, you definitely have to try Love &amp; Honey."
4,"*HIGHLY RECOMMEND*
*4.5/5*

If you are craving fried chicken of any form, tenders, wings, or drumsticks, this is definitely THE place to go. They have literally the best drum sticks I&apos;ve ever had in my life. During this pandemic, you have to place an order online in advance and it will take at least 30 minutes for pick up. Those 30 minutes are worth the wait because you&apos;ll get the most tender, juice dripping pieces of meat fresh out of the fryer. They are known for the honey drizzle on their chicken that gives it a nice sweet and salty kick. Also the wings and drumsticks are huge. This is a solid place for fried chicken and great for its price. 

- Drumsticks - MUST GET! There is a reason they sell this by the drum, it is THAT GOOD. You can hear the crunch of the well seasoned skin when you bite into it, followed by the steam as you munch further into the tender meat.  Be prepare for all the juice and oil that will be oozing out, that&apos;s a great indication of good fried chicken. I&apos;m normally a wing&apos;s gal but these drumsticks beat out the wings.

- Jumbo Wings - they were massive, worthy of its name. I didn&apos;t know how to start attacking it but just went for it and you should too. They  were on par with the drumsticks in terms of flavor and tenderness. 

- Tenders - good if you want to enjoy fried chicken mess free, however, they were not as juicy as the drumsticks or wings. Certain edges were a bit too crispy/dry but for the meatier parts were good. 

- Tater Tots - pretty standard tater tots, can&apos;t go wrong with this

- Corn bread - one of the best corn bread I&apos;ve. Soft and not too dense or too sweet.

*VERDICT*
Yes, I would definitely go back again, especially for the drumsticks! Would love to try their chicken sandwich next."
1,"Hello!  so I see all of these 4.5/5 stars and I am not sure if I was an &quot;off-case&quot; but my experience was not great.   My BF and I have been seeing their posts of FB and everything looked great, so Saturday night we decided to give it a try.    We ordered online and was told that it would be 45 min. to be ready for pick-up.   I ordered the 6 chicken wings, potato salad and corn muffin, my BF ordered chicken fingers? and tater tots and got his mother the Nashville Hot chicken sandwich.

I am not sure if the person forgot or if this was &quot;it&quot; but my food had NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO seasoning on it  NONE.  Not even a hint.  NOTHING, NADA...  It was just fried chicken.  It was beautiful to look at...great color.but it didn&apos;t taste like anything.  I don&apos;t even think it had pepper on it.   I thought it was just mine, but my BF said the same..it was really bland.  His mother sandwich was really really spicy so she couldn&apos;t eat it.   The tater tots was okay and the potato salad was not bad, however, we were disappointed in our purchase; we did not even finish it and ate something else."
5,Awesome spot! Order early in the week when they open up Wednesday and you might be able to snag some limited goodies. We ordered a couple McLovin sandwiches that we couldn&apos;t stop lovin. Also got the BBQ half chicken which was super limited but oh so delicious with that crispy BBQ skin. Don&apos;t sleep on the tots and cornbread either because they are bomb. Lastly the fried chicken wings and butterscotch pudding were also very legit. Really liked this spot and would easily come back again and again.
4,"This is one of my favorite fried chicken places in the city. I ordered online, and the one issue that I encountered was that parking in the area to run in and pick up is pretty limited - I had to circle around a few times before I found somewhere to pull over. The Nashville hot chicken sandwich is my favorite, and the Nashville hot tater tots are unique and delicious. Their cookies are incredible - I believe the flavors rotate every day, but all of the ones I&apos;ve had have been great."
5,"Today was my cheat day and I&apos;ve been wanting fried chicken so I figured I&apos;d give this place a try since it had such great reviews. I ordered it last night for pick up today and was worried it wouldn&apos;t be ready but it was. We ordered 3 pieces of chicken, 14 chicken tenders, potato salad and 2 corn muffins. Everything was DELICIOUS! My boyfriend and I have difference in views when it comes to fried chicken but specifically potato salad and somehow they were able to please both of us. Never do both of us like a potato salad. We also tried different sauces- personally wasn&apos;t a fan of the honey hot but the honey bbq or whatever it is and the honey mustard was good and the one in the bottle was good and spicy. Only suggestion I would make is they should give you some homey as well."
5,"Second time here and I absolutely love this place! 
We ordered some spicy chicken sandos, 5 pieces of chicken, and some corn bread for the group. 

The chicken sandwich isn&apos;t too spicy if you&apos;re an above average spicy eater, but it does pack a ton of flavor. The dry rub on the spicy Nashville sandwich is insane! It reminded me a lot of Howlin Ray&apos;s which happens to be the best spicy chicken sandwich in the USA. I would&apos;ve liked it a little spicier, but I&apos;m sure the general population will find it just fine. The cole slaw is creamy and compliments the chicken very well. 

The chicken itself is super juicy and never dry! With a nice little drizzle of honey, you have a beautiful balance sweet and salty in every bite to go along with the oozing juices. No complaints there. Never ask for ketchup, but get yourself some hot sauce! 

The corn bread...make sure you get it AND eat it HOT. Lather that bad boy up with some butter or eat it as is with your chicken. The consistency is perfect and it&apos;s not too sweet. Can you ever go wrong with a side of corn bread?"
5,The hot chicken sandwich has been the best I&apos;ve had in Philly. Don&apos;t forget the butterscotch pudding! Amazing food. Fully satisfied
5,"Juicy,  tender, flavorful chicken tenders!! This place is awesome, wait time was a little long but definitely worth it!!"
5,"This only speaks to their pick up experience during the pandemic, but they are handling it very well! We ordered online, and the pickup time was accurate. The staff were wearing masks, and we easily picked up our food through the window.

I personally only tried the tenders and Nashville Style tots, but my boyfriend had the drumsticks. The prices were reasonable for the amount we got, and the chicken was delicious! I was hesitant to try chicken tenders with honey drizzle, but the tenders weren&apos;t wet with honey and the honey flavor was subtle - not overwhelming. I enjoyed them, and the Nashville Style tots were good. They were a bit spicy, so I wouldn&apos;t recommend this to anyone who doesn&apos;t like hot things. The heat really added up after a few tots! 

Overall, great place for fried chicken. Would definitely go back again, and I recommend placing an order online to pickup as it&apos;s generally a 30 minute wait."
5,"Looking for some good food? Look no further. These chicken wings are love and honey. Indulge in the wings or tenders. Pick up the cookie of the day or another dessert. Tater tots, corn bread and please don&apos;t forget the potato salad. You feel the love in each bite and it taste as good as honey. You won&apos;t be disappointed. Go get you some Love &amp; Honey today."
5,"10/10 will eat here again! We just learned about this hidden gem and we loved it!  We ordered takeout via the restaurant&apos;s website and it arrived before the scheduled delivery time!  We got a sandwich, tenders, drumsticks, cornbread, and potato salad.  Everything was fantastic!"
5,"I&apos;m always a bit weary of getting fried chicken takeout because so often the batter gets soggy and oily by the time you eat it. Didn&apos;t happen here though! We ordered the Nashville fried chicken sandwich, wings, chicken tenders, Nashville tots, and spicy coleslaw. The reviews don&apos;t lie... the chicken was indeed some of the crispiest buttermilk fried chicken I have ever had. The touch of honey on the wings and tenders was perfect. The Nashville tots were flavorful (though not spicy) and crunchy. Everything held up even when we ate an hour later.

The wings and tenders came with sauces so we got honey hot sauce, spicy ranch, and honey mustard. The honey hot sauce was my favorite, and it went well with everything. The spicy ranch did not taste spicy at all (which is saying something because I am pretty bad at eating spicy). Actually, none of the &quot;spicy&quot; items were that spicy. There was definitely a kick in the sandwich but expect the spice level to be on the mild scale. 

Pricey but I&apos;d say worth it."
5,"Hands down the best fried chicken in philly, possibly beyond that. Part of the reason is the owners are always there and take care in every order that goes out. They also have an amazing pastry chef and an ever changing menu of pies to go with the chicken. Definitely order ahead they&apos;re always busy but its worth the wait!"
5,"My husband ordered delivery since we are in covid-19 lock down. And WOW!! Love &amp; Honey was the best part of our day!! This is probably the best fried chicken we&apos;ve ever had in Philly. I have traveled to Nashville so many times, and even though Love &amp; Honey does an amazing job, it&apos;s just not the same as Nashville, BUT it&apos;s the best Philly has! I would recommend they add levels of hot.. instead of one size fits all hot seasoning.. cause even though the flavor was amazing to me, I could have turned up the heat a notch! 

The Nashville hot sandwich was such high quality chicken you can tell how fresh it was. Melts in your mouth. The pickles and slaw were also perfect toppings. The tenders were great quality too, some of the best tenders we&apos;ve ever had! But the hot tenders were sold out, so we got the plain. Still good. And the Nashville hot TOTS were amazing!! 

We&apos;ll be ordering from Love &amp; Honey again really soon, I just know it!! Bravo to the people working here.. what a fantastic place!!"
5,"I wish the proprietor and/or chef of this place opened a restaurant. i dont think i can call it the best fried chicken ive ever had but its definitely excellent and just comes down to personal preferences. you can&apos;t deny the excellence. you can absolutely tell the amount of thought and care put into every single food item i ordered and i ordered a bit. its why i ultimately gave this place a 5.

chicken has thick heavy crust but its absolutely delicious and cooked perfectly.

the sauces were stellar

the corn bread muffin was delicious and moist without being overly sweet

the potato salad might be one of the best ive ever had and im from the south so ive had tons. it is NOT red potato which is fine bc I prefer Idaho potatoes vs red in my potato salad. they dont go crazy on the dill either which is a common trap

cole slaw was bland to me and has celery which is interesting but again you KNOW they thought through every detail carefully. a bit too much dill for my taste but thats ok.

the lemon pie was AMAZING too. the crust was amazing and didn&apos;t fall apart either which is rare.

if this proprietor/chef opened a restaurant, its one of the few few few places in america i would trust anything blind. Honestly if the Chef is opening anything I can seriously be contacted about investing. 

i got 2 drum sticks, a thigh, small potato salad, small cole slaw, cornbread muffin, side sauce, and lemon pie which was all $30. the small sides are for 2 people and i eat a ton so probably $20 a person roughly


JEANS: OK by far
ORDER: at counter
 
VERY limited seating."
5,"The service is always fast and safe. I have eaten a ton of fried chicken in my life, and this is the best I have ever had. Great selection of sauces. The honey hot is out of this world. The Nashville tater tots are pretty spicy, crunchy, and delicious. The chicken is such high quality. We always order extra to last a few days. It is a Northern Liberties must."
5,"This chicken sandwich is just perfection - crispy, juicy chicken, just right mix of salty and sweet with the slaw, great bread that holds it all together! And the pickles just put it over the edge IMO. We had both the OG and the Nashville hot, and while I prefer the spicy myself, They were both excellent. Got tenders for my daughter and those were a hit too. We&apos;ll be back!"
