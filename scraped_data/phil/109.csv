5,"Probably my favorite restaurant in the entire city.  I&apos;ve eaten here many times and since meeting my husband it has become one of his favorites as well.  Consistently delicious.  I was raised by an Italian immigrant and the food is up to my uber-high standards for food from the Old Country.  I&apos;ve picked L&apos;Angolo for several birthday dinners over the years.

A friend who lives in MD got to know and love L&apos;Angolo during his time as a student at Penn, and he and his family recently drove up from MD for dinner.  They were desperate for a Covid break and decided a 3 hour drive to have dinner was worth it.  Indeed it was. :)"
5,"YASSS! Not a negative word to ever say about L&apos;Angolo. I have been coming to L&apos;Angolo since I moved to South Philly a few years ago. My go to Italian spot has always been Giorgio on Pine, but L&apos;Angolo has definitely taken more of my money in recent months (even during covid). What I like is that they change up their specials, which Giorgio stopped doing (no shade though). The staff are great &amp; so welcoming. I&apos;m one of those people that need to feel comfortable in a small spot like this, I don&apos;t want to feel out of place or like I shouldn&apos;t be there and this is NOT that place. The food is incredible. Everything. Just go and eat and eat some more."
5,"Truly a gem. We were getting takeout during covid and everything was perfect as it always is but it&apos;s nice to be able to dine in and see the most welcoming and hardworking staff. Although I have never had a bad meal from there, my favorites are the Caesar salad, Smoked mozzarella, eggplant, and the farfalle with crabmeat. Husband always gets the Scoglio which is out of this world as well. Save room for dessert!"
4,"The farfalle w/ crabmeat should just be on the menu like always. Its delicious and the crab is not skimped! 

The lobster ravioli was very creamy but quite delicious as well. What I loved about it was that it was plumb and actually filling. It wasnt overpriced and sad looking like when you see it at those fancy restaurants that want to make lobster ravioli sound like some gourmet special.

They had a burrata special that was on top of I guess it was farro? Some sort of grain. Wasn&apos;t sure if I would have liked it but it was an absolute love.

The branzino mixed grill was the only thing I wasn&apos;t all that excited about. Don&apos;t get me wrong, there was nothing wrong with it. But after bites of the other dishes, this felt a little bland to me."
3,"First and foremost this place is BYOB so make sure you bring a couple of bottles. It&apos;s a very small and quaint place. The food was fine the service could have been better I think. I personally wouldn&apos;t go out of my way to go to this restaurant again. There are other Italian restaurants in the city, obviously not very many, that have better service and the food is just as good. When we visited we were a party of four and we were rushed to leave while we were still eating our dessert. If the service had been more efficient maybe we could&apos;ve ordered our food and not spend our time waiting for our waiter to come to us."
5,"This place never misses. Bring your own wine. Roasted artichokes make a great appetizer. Have not had a bad dinner here have visited many times. The staff and other customers have always been super friendly. The place is small, intimate. Romantic. ."
4,"Good meal and great little place! My mom was visiting and we decided to stop in for dinner. The restaurant is tiny but feels like you&apos;re eating in a bistro in Italy. The service was wonderful and we would definitely go back. 

We had the Caesar salad, special faro and Burrata salad, veal Milanese, and a shrimp pasta dish from the specials. The Caesar salad was one of the best I&apos;ve ever had - chopped and bits of cheese and dressing spread Throughout every bite. The pasta dish was just OK, but everything else was great.

The place filled up quick I would recommend making a reservation. They are also BYO. 

Great find, I will definitely be going sbc"
5,"My wife, family members, and I have been coming to L&apos;Angolo for almost 15 years - it is hands down our favorite Italian restaurant in the city. We celebrate birthdays, anniversaries (my wife and I got engaged here) and special events at L&apos;Angolo and John and his staff are always warm, inviting and professional.

As to their food, it&apos;s outstanding. One favorite of ours is their sauteed artichoke hearts with roasted garlic - they are absolutely delicious. So, don&apos;t pass up the chance to experience one of the best meals you will ever have. 

Go to L&apos;Angolo!"
5,"Words cannot capture how wonderful this place is. Really old school, small, with personal attention and reasonably priced. BYOB. Don&apos;t go there expecting it to be quick. Sit back, relax, chat, and wait for the magic. You never feel hurried here. 

The appetizers are worthy of an entree. You could order two or three and call it a very satisfying meal. Entrees very generous. Many selections from the menu plus daily specials."
5,Best pasta dishes I&apos;ve ever had. Hands down!! Service was great and I will be back. Best Italian food in South Philly.
5,"Located right in the heart of South Philly. This place is such a gem. The pasta tastes authentic and absolutely phenomenal. I tried the Grilled Calamari as an appetizer  and the Farfalle w/ Crab Meat, which was a special. Both were amazing. The calamari was tender and perfectly grilled. My pasta dish was generously portioned with a ton of crabmeat. Thanks for not skipping out on either. Can&apos;t wait to be back to try more off their menu!"
5,"Perfectly done pasta, meats, seafood, salad, okay so it was everything we ordered came out to perfection. Impressed by the rather tight cozy space serving out all this amazing Italian food.  Its also BYOB so that&apos;s an added bonus here. Definitely make reservations as this place is tight and gets very busy, even as early as 6pm. Wonderful service from start to finish and would gladly come back again and again."
5,The best Italian restaurant in the heart of south Philly ! You&apos;d be a fool to pass on L&apos;Angolo
5,"Delicious meal as always! Hidden gem South Philly spot, everything we&apos;ve had is delicious. Can&apos;t beat their homemade and fresh dishes. The gnocchi is my go-to because it&apos;s my fav, but like to try a bite of what my fianc√© gets, from pasta with seafood to lamb osso bucco last night, all great. The burrata appetizer special is a favorite too. Don&apos;t skip dessert either, the tiramisu is on point. They are doing a good job with limited indoor dining and sidewalk seating to make the best of  the times. The owner, John, and staff are so friendly and accommodating too, def a spot to check out!"
4,"Had our pre-race dinner at L&apos;Angola on Friday night, and it was just what we needed. We were a party of 6 and had a reservation for 8pm. As we walked to our table, we noticed the restaurant is a bit small and even with many groups of people eating, the tables were nicely spaced out and we didn&apos;t feel crammed. To start we had some appetizers to share: fresh mozzarella caprese, the spiedini, and the grilled shrimp and calamari. I really wished the portions of the appetizers were bigger, especially the grilled shrimp and calamari because it was just so freakin&apos; good. But at L&apos;Angola, you really don&apos;t have to worry about portion sizes, because they make sure you&apos;re fed, all right. For our entrees, a couple of us ordered the lamb ossobuco special, which was an enormous large shank with the bone still sticking out, with house made pasta on the bottom. Our group also had the shrimp and parppadelle special, the gnocchi, spaghetti scoglio, and the fish of the day which was a swordfish.  The servings were huge, and everything was authentic and delicious. By the end of dinner, everyone was so stuffed. But we still made room for dessert and shared two chocolate tortes, a cannoli, and tiramisu. My favorite was the chocolate torte but have to say the tiramisu was pretty good too.  Overall, it was a fantastic meal, and our wait staff was amazing from start to finish. For the authenticity and amount of food you&apos;re getting, everything was reasonably priced too. And, it&apos;s BYOB, what more can you ask for?"
5,"My first experience here was for Valentine&apos;s Day dinner with my boyfriend, and wow, could I have asked for anything better. 

We walked in for our reservation at 9:30 pm (yes, that late! We called a week in advance and nothing else was available!) to a nearly full house. By the time 9:45 pm rolled around, even more customers had walked in and all tables were officially occupied. 

The restaurant is very charming, with dim lighting and beautiful decor (I was seriously eyeing up the iron gate propped up on the wall near our table). The restaurant is pretty small, but I really appreciate that for date nights. I love being able to have conversation, and not have to worry about distractions from a big crowd, TVs, or music!

The food was delicious, to say the least. We started the night off with two appetizers: one being smoked mozzarella with zucchini, roasted peppers, and fig balsamic glaze, and the second being shrimp and asparagus wrapped in prosciutto (which was one of their specials for the night). The first dish was good, but in no way compatible to the second. We both agreed that the shrimp and asparagus was more flavorful and definitely more memorable. We do wish there had been a bit more added to the plate though. It would have been nice to have four shrimp instead of just three. I personally think that&apos;s better for sharing purposes too!

As for my entree, I chose their pasta special for the night which came with shrimp, lobster, basil, and spicy pesto. When the entree arrived, I was blown away by the fabulous presentation! Both the shrimp and lobster were prepared just perfectly, and the spicy pesto was delicious with just the right amount of spice for an Italian dish. I can only hope that this special makes its way on to their regular menu!

As for dessert, my boyfriend and I ordered cannolis. These mini, sweet treats were the perfect way to end the night. 

I definitely plan to return to L&apos;Angolo and hope that I&apos;ll get the opportunity to order that pasta again! I would highly recommend going here for a date night or with a loved one for a classic Italian dinner! Be sure to bring a bottle of wine with you as well - they are BYO! :)"
5,"Love this place-
It is a terrific BYO Italian restaurant. It is close to the stadiums, so great for before or after a game.
Most dishes are homemade and incredible. They told us , if we did not see something on the menu, they would try to make it for us."
4,"This is a real gem and I&apos;m remiss at never having eaten here before. It&apos;s on Porter two blocks off Broad. We were going to a Sixers game. It&apos;s only a few minutes to the stadium. It&apos;s cute enough small place. Service was first rate. The food is excellent. We split a Caesar it was excellent with a nice wedge of parmesan. The bread was excellent. Buddy had the duck pasta it was was nice but I&apos;m not sure I&apos;d get it. I had the  Milanese and it was perfect. As good as I&apos;ve every had. Beautiful cutlet, fresh arugula and lots of lemon. It also had a wedge of parmesan and the duck had two. A bit of a good idea run amok! I had the best espresso I&apos;ve ever had outside of Italy and my friend had the cannoli. It was a great time. Lastly, the meal was a real value. $60 for two. It&apos;s BYOB."
4,"We chose L&apos;Angolo for my mom&apos;s recent birthday for a few reasons...it&apos;s BYO, she hadn&apos;t been to the South Philly classic in about 25 years, and most importantly, they take reservations (which is such a rarity in these tiny BYOBs). 

The place is super small and uber cozy, decorated in a Tuscan manor, and definitely has that South Philly charm you probably desire if you&apos;re headed to a place like this. 

In addition to a pretty stellar menu (which is very vegetarian friendly), there are always daily specials which include a meat, a fish, a pasta and an app. Scallops and wild boar ragu were two I remember from this visit, to give you an idea. 

Served water and toasted bread with a side of delicious oil that had a basil note upon arrival. Some mentioned the plating of the bread was sloppy just being thrown in a bowl. I would have to agree. Another complaint would be the tiny bit of oil. We definitely wanted more and had to ask for it. A tad annoying. 

I personally went with the arugula salad. The salad was fantastic and in my opinion, memorable. It&apos;s worth me stopping by just for this as a to-go order in the future. It was dressed lightly, but perfectly. It had a nice crunch from the almonds and a tang found in the marinated onions. It&apos;s super easy to remove the large chunk of shaved grana if you&apos;re vegan and sharing with others. Otherwise just order without and you&apos;re golden. Another great option for vegans would be the grilled zucchini, roasted peppers, with fig balsamic glaze minus the pan-seared smoked mozzarella. Yum!

A Caesar, an arugula, and grilled calamari were ordered as starters for our party of 6. The salads are large enough as an entree for one, or to split between quite a few people for &quot;just a taste&quot; before your meal. 

The crew ordered:

The mushroom gnocchi which is definitely worth trying if you&apos;ve never had them pan-fried. I&apos;ve actually never seen them this way. They came with large chunks of mushrooms and are available in a cream sauce or in olive oil and rosemary. The table ordered the later to save calories...just a bit. 

The Spaghetti scoglio... mussels, clams, shrimp, calamari, light red sauce. So much fresh seafood at what we considered a steal. They couple easily charged $8-$10 more for all the seafood given. My sister in law did ask for their spicy marinara she favors here. Perhaps if you like spice, ask for it as it&apos;s not listed. (Insider tip). 

The Spaghetti ai gamberi... shrimp, broccoli rabe, summer tomato sauce. Nice fresh tasting red sauce. Not too sweet or acidic. Huge shrimp, but perhaps not enough pasta underneath as some had notice. A good option for the more calorie conscious. 

The seafood special with a hearty filet of branzino, big shrimp and squid over mashed potatoes. Said to be delicious. 

We also took home the eggplant parm which is served sans pasta when ordered as an app. It was not heavily breaded and enjoyed.. Looked a little to chewy and stringy for my taste when I cut it up. 

The food and ambience was very well liked by all, but our service was a bit so, so. While our &quot;buser&quot; was wonderful and on top of water refills and packaging up leftovers, our waiter was lacking. It was just before the holidays and very busy so perhaps a pass is in order, plus our fam that visits regularly had a wonderful waiter last time and several times before. Not sure what to say about that but for us, this visit was a bit of miss on that front and why the 4 versus 5 star, unfortunately. The poor service wasn&apos;t enough to keep us from returning however. 

South Philly street parking and back in angle parking. Come prepared if you&apos;re not used to it and don&apos;t forget those bottles!"
5,"Might be the best Italian in South Philly. And as we all know, that&apos;s saying something. The place is old school, comfortable, and delicious. Everything about it is great."
