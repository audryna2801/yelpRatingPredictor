4,"I&apos;ll say it: I think El Vez is a tad overhyped. Don&apos;t get me wrong -- it&apos;s good, but when all things are considered, it&apos;s not special.
Keep in mind I only ordered sangria &amp; chips/ guac during my last visit there, which is a pretty limited scope of their offerings. 
We were sat outside next to a heater which I had no qualms about! We were lucky that it was a relatively warm night, as I might&apos;ve been uncomfortable in this set up in truly chilling temperatures. It was fun to (safely) be in the center of activity and see fellow diners (and even some drummers!) on the corner of 13th and Sansom. Honestly even more of a thrill than we&apos;d get in non-covid times!
The peach sangria was a hit -- very sugary though. The chips and guac are always solid and have a great kick of lime-y freshness. It&apos;s nothing mind-blowing, though. 
Overall, I like El Vez, but I wasn&apos;t too enthused to pay that bill at the end."
5,"Reasonably priced Mexican food, great drinks and perfect outdoor socially distanced set up.  The service was great and the food was tasty and fresh.  We are thoroughly pleased with our socially distanced date night at El Vez.  We did make a reservation for indoors but they were not ready and needed an extra 15 min to set us up inside.  We chose to sit outside since there was an available table.  We were not disappointed despite sitting on top of traffic which is not ideal.  We were comfortable,  warm and able to enjoy our meal and drinks."
4,"Came here for dinner. They are definitely taking COVID safety precautions seriously which is good. We had to get a temperature check before getting seated inside. The booths were separated by a plexiglass shield and the workers all had face shields and masks on.

The food itself was great. I had the pink cadillac which tasted great. We also split the nachos nachos which were desirous and so huge! I also got mahi mahi tacos which were quite good as well."
1,"Apparently a reservation is required but you can&apos;t make one over the phone during COVID-19. The hostess was not friendly although our server tried to help our situation as we have a big family. The guacamole is good, we had the steak and chicken tacos al carbon and they were good. 

TLDR: Food was great but service was very poor."
3,"Food was great and came out quickly. 
My only complaint was that our server wasn&apos;t very friendly and sounded like a robot throughout service. I know we are in a pandemic and limited service is probably the goal, but as a seasoned server of over 10 years, I expect at least decent service especially when I&apos;m paying for it. I don&apos;t want Applebee&apos;s service at an establishment like El Vez. It&apos;s almost as if the waitress thought she was doing us a favor by serving us. There are plenty of other restaurants that I will go and pay for that have good service and the food could be half as good as El Vez.
I&apos;m not sure our waitresses name because she didn&apos;t tell us and asked if she could get us drinks. I dined there on 2/10 and was sat in the front of the restaurant. 
Another thing, if you&apos;re timing people for how long they can sit, please don&apos;t have a 12 minute greet time."
5,"Best Mexican Restaurant in the city! 
Hands down the best spot to link up with friends or family when you want to get drinks and enjoy some good Mexican food. It&apos;s always a fun vibe and they did a great job with the outside seating! 
I miss their cauliflower tacos and some of the servers could be a little nicer but hosts are always extremely accommodating and friendly!
Get the nacho mama it&apos;s one of the best things on their menu!"
5,"This spot is doing everything they can to accommodate patrons and I love that! We showed up at 10:25 right before the kitchen closed, but we weren&apos;t stressed to order food. Our waitress was very pleasant, kind, gave us time to order whatever we wanted and overall was very sweet. The service was definitely there. 

The food was delicious might I add. Everything was so tasty and fresh. I have to stress that the kitchen was closing but the food came out beautiful and tasted great too. Presentation was on point given the situation on hand. 

If you&apos;re a local or visiting like we were, please do stop in. You won&apos;t regret your decision."
5,"So glad I made a reservation, but happier I was able to sit inside as it was quite nippy on Halloween night. I picked this place based on other Yelp reviews as I reside in north jersey and planned to go the Fright Factory for Halloween. We were immediately seated, but I requested to change my seats as I wanted to sit in a beautiful booth. The hostess had no issues seating  us.

For covid 19 measures.... Everyone had on a masks and gloves. Masks were required for all patrons not seated and eating. Temperatures were taken for all that entered. I cannot recall if they offered hand sanitizers.  There were partitions throughout the restaurant between every table, which was impressive.

Our waitress was attentive throughout our dining experience. She suggested the Pink Cadillac margarita, which was good, not spectacular. We ordered a pitcher. Ordered nachos and guacamole for appetizer. I will say, the menu is not extensive. I expected more than tacos and burritos. That was a tad bit disappointing.  We ordered the combo taco with steak and chicken. The chicken was well seasoned and the steak.cookef to a perfect medium. The surprise was the corn rice side dish. It was yummy!! 

Overall, great food, good drinks, nice ambiance."
5,Went here for happy hour. Good specials. Drinks and tacos were delicious!
5,Ooooo tacos and margs tho. If you ever want a consistent delicious strong marg you come here. Never disappoints. Plus their taco tasting platter  too good
4,"Came here for brunch with some friends, and we had a great time! We made reservations for Outdoor Seating through Opentable and got seated promptly at 12 PM. They have hand sanitizers by the hostess stand, which I appreciated!

We started out with some El Vez &quot;The Original&quot; Guacamole, which tasted great with their chips. We each got different items on the menu and loved our entrees: Enchilada Mixtas and Chicken Tacos for our friends, and Tacos Al Carbon for 2 with Char-Grilled Steak for us. We got a good amount of steak, tons of vegetables (especially onions), warm tortillas, and rajas, pico de gallo, guacamole &amp; queso fresco. It was delicious, but beware of the portions! We took home half of the Tacos Al Carbon because we were so full already! 

Can&apos;t wait to be back again soon and enjoy their delicious margaritas over a nice dinner meal next time!"
4,"If you are visiting Philadelphia - most people will refer you to El Vez. They do everything right, and its location is prime - smacked dab in the middle of center city. 

It is truly a cool restaurant and bar. The bar has a rotating motorcycle, which is a unique display. Extensive margarita list, coupled with a variety in their guac options. Really good food. 

Only downfall (pre-covid of course) is the crowd. Everytime I go here, it is jam packed and it is hard to really have conversations. Sometimes it can be hard to even get a drink if you are just at the bar. On the flip-side, that clearly shows it is a popular place to be, so just noteworthy before heading in. 

Menu is fairly priced - you do get nice sized portions.

Fun aspect to this restaurant - they have a cool/old school photo booth that allows you to take black &amp; white photo strips."
5,"This place is a downtown Philadelphia world known spot. I once stayed downtown and by walking here I could tell its a vibe then went in to see it for myself. Fast forward to 2 years later, I was trying to think of the name of this spot and I couldn&apos;t.  My old roommate moved to Philly and we were supposed to meet and guess what address he sent me? EL VEZ.

Because of all that its going now, the sitting is outside, but they have a personal heater per table. So even on a crispy night you will be okay. Just make sure you bring a nice coat.

The inside Decor is fabulous. You can tell lots was invested on the decor. I even seen some concepts that I watched on the Tv show bar rescue. One is to have a big round bar inside the venue. This creates more interaction and stimulation between the patrons because everyone at the bar can potentially look at each other. Another concept was the bathroom. The are to wash your hands is common, so both ladies and gents can interact during that moment.

Now let&apos;s get to the juice. The food and drinks were amazing and so was our server. We ordered a plate to share, some beef and chicken fajitas to make some delicious tacos.

Had a great night! Good conversations and met some amazing people."
4,"Been a while since I&apos;ve been here but this place is pretty good in everything I&apos;ve had but their cocktails really stand out more than their food. I&apos;d say this is more tex-mex than truly latin in terms of heaviness and ingredients, but I don&apos;t necessarily count that as a bad thing. Good place, slightly expensive for what you get. Definitely try to go there on an expense-able budget.
Decor and service were great every time I&apos;ve been."
4,"I had a craving for Mexican food on a Monday. After Yelping I came across a few places that were open, but most didn&apos;t open until 4:00 pm. El Vez swooped in and saved the day with the lunch time hours. So, I made a lunch reservation outside for 1:45 pm.

I arrived really early and had to wait close to my reservation time to be seated. No worries, I was able to do some people watching until I was called to be seated. Upon sitting at our table, we were greeted quickly by our waiter. We ordered a pitcher of the pineapple margarita (the exact name escapes me) and the De La Hoya Guacamole (I think that was the name of it, lol). We didn&apos;t wait long for the starter and pitcher. The guacamole was sooo good. It was fresh and you could taste all of the ingredients (onions, garlic, cilantro...)

We decided to place our order for entrees. I went with the  shrimp tacos with the creamy poblano rice, and my hubs went with chicken enchiladas. The entrees arrived in a timely manner. I loved that the (3) shrimp tacos were small with the perfect amount of grilled shrimp, avocado, and cheese. I could only finish two bc I had filled up on guacamole and margaritas. The creamy poblano rice was flavorful as well. It was warm, creamy, and contained tiny bits of poblano peppers. My hubs finished his chicken enchilada in no time. He said the flavor was spot on and he was happy with his meal. 

We were happy with our dining experience at El Vez and would love to return for dinner in the near future."
5,"Made reservations online and got their earlier than scheduled and it wasn&apos;t a problem. 

Drinks: Pineapple Canela and La Fresita. Both drinks were very strong (not a complaint at all). Didn&apos;t taste the pineapple but hey nonetheless it was good. 

Appetizer: street corn OMG the corn was perfect. It was perfectly grilled and sweet. The perfect amount of cheese and Tajin seasoning. 

Meal: Every taco on that platter was perfectly cooked and seasoned. I didn&apos;t think the lamb taco would be good but it was really tasty. I ate half of every taco. I had too. It was sooo good. 

My greedy self ordered the churros (I was stuffed but saw someone else with them and had to get them). They were fresh and nice and crunchy and the sauce was a chocolate strawberry flavor.  

Staff was friendly and took every precaution to be safe. Staff had mask, gloves and did temperature checks on patrons before seating us.  Our seating area had a heater and although it wasn&apos;t that cold out, you could definitely feel the heat."
5,"So fresh and tasty! Came to El Vez to pick up a to go order and was so happy with the service as well as with my food when I got home! I ordered the chicken tacos with chihuahua cheese, avocado, tomatillo &amp; tomato salsa, and crema with a side of pico de Gallo. Perfect balance of spices and saltiness. I wish I could buy the pico de Gallo by the pint to have at home!"
4,"Stopped by for drinks and dessert after finishing a dinner reservation nearby.  Thanks to COVID adjustments we were able to snag an outdoor table directly next to a heat lamp.   Our table was a little wobbly (which we ignored) but our like server promptly noticed and grabbed something to level it. 

We got water, blood orange margaritas and the cinnamon churros.  We chatted and people watched and had a great time."
4,"I&apos;ve been here a few times and have sat both inside and outside. Atmosphere inside is great and I love the decor. Cocktails are excellent; we got the guava mojito and the zapata. The menu right now is a little limited w covid (in August it was definitely larger bc we got the &quot;de la hoya&quot; guac and there were 4 different guac options and now you can only order the regular). Pricey, but very tasty."
5,"Got very lucky and was able to get a table without a reservation at El Vez. El Vez takes Covid precautions very seriously with temperature checks, dividers between tables, staff in masks, gloves, and face shields. We had the guacamole limon which was so delicious and refreshing. The guac had a great lemon flavor and the goat cheese added some nice creaminess. We had the tacos for 2 with steak that was cooked just to our liking. The caramelized onions complimented the char on the meat very nicely. Our waitress was very nice with a great balance of checking in on us but also letting us enjoy our meal."
