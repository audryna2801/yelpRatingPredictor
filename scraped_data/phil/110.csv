5,I adore White Dog! Their happy hour and bottomless brunch never fail and I love coming here with law school friends and visitors from out of town. Outdoor seating is perfect in warm weather and a godsend in the pandemic. Thankfully they&apos;re open again and vaccines are coming out. I&apos;m excited to keep coming back until I&apos;ve tried everything on the menu and been seated in every beautiful room.
4,"*pre covid review*

Last summer while on vacation in Philly we discovered this adorable cafe and decided we had to check it out. When we arrived we were seated right away at the way back of the building. After sitting down we quickly noticed that it was hot inside the restaurant. Our server brought over menus and apologized for the heat stating that the air conditioning in that particular room was not working. When she left to get our drinks we began talking about how weird it was that they sat us in this room without air conditioning when we passed several seating areas in other rooms that weren&apos;t full. It was kind of annoying to not understand the logic behind it and to spend our meal being hot but we didn&apos;t push it any further. 

As for the food we ordered deviled eggs for the table and I got the biscuit and gravy skillet. The food was amazing which is why I kept the review at 4 stars even after the air conditioning fiasco. The deviled eggs came with 6 total 3 different kinds, all unique and all delicious. They were very elevated and sophisticated versions of standard deviled eggs. This is what I wish deviled eggs were all the time!

The biscuit and gravy skillet was also very dangerously delicious. We all kind of shared it and everyone took bites because it was so rich and flavorful. We had a big day ahead of us and didn&apos;t want to over eat. I really did want to eat the whole thing by myself. 

Overall I would recommend coming here. I hope if you do they have the air conditioning fixed!"
5,"Top brunch spot in the city! No matter which neighborhood you are in, this is worth traveling to. 

It is a huge building with all these different themed rooms. Fun art, lots of plants, and different furniture. Despite the building being rather large, they squeeze a lot in them, so seating felt a bit crammed. You could literally get lost in here though - multi-stories.

They have a unique drink menu, and their food menu is a good mix of more breakfast &amp; lunch options. Their portions were strong, and they have creative specials."
3,"A friend and I ordered delivery this weekend, so I cannot speak for the service. 

I have been once before pre-covid. The interior decoration is lovely, but it very noticeable that the food is quite expensive, especially for University City, which is heavily college students. 

The food arrived quickly after we ordered it which was nice. I got the pulled pork sandwich and my friend ordered the sweet potato gnudi. 

The menu is rather small with many farm-to-table dishes. Last time I went, I ordered the bouji Mac and cheese for $15 which was outrageous in my opinion, but at least it tasted good. 

I don&apos;t know if the portion sizes are just whack or White Dog is just bad at packaging, but my pulled pork sandwich was not plated well. 

Pulled pork sandwich: 3/5. Coleslaw was good-I love a good coleslaw- but the pork-to-slaw ratio was seriously lacking, and I could barely taste the bbq sauce. The bun was good, but this type of roll always is. 

Not to mention I had to eat my sanwhich with a fork and knife because it was just slapped together in a to-go container. 

Kettle chips: 2/5 I did not enjoy these. They were neither soft nor crunchy and some of them were flavored (Parmesan) but not all of them. Just do fries or something regular. 

My friend seemed to like her gnudi though."
5,"One of my favorite spots around Penn campus. The line is often quite long during dining/brunch hours so remember to make a reservation if you don&apos;t want to wait. 

I&apos;ve tried coming for both brunch and dinner. Personally, I enjoy the brunch more because the price is more reasonable. For dinner, I got lamb lasagna which was (~$20) and the portion size was almost as small as my fist :( But the brunch here is amazing. There are so many options and they are very flexible with customizing your order. But the highlight of white dog is their truffle fries, which are delicious. You can substitute their home fries for truffle fries, which I recommend! Once you&apos;ve tried them, you can never have normal fries again."
3,"I&apos;ve been to White Dog probably 4-5 different times, and usually it&apos;s probably more like a 4 star but today made me give them a 3. I definitely prefer their brunch over their dinner as it is cheaper and the food options are more diverse. One of my main complaints is that today we made a reservation for 1pm, got there and still waited for a table until 1:30, and didn&apos;t get served food until after 2. This was kind of disappointing for having had a reservation, and staff didn&apos;t seem to sorry either as they&apos;re used to being busy. They also had helllaaaaa outdoor AND indoor seating to the point where I was a little afraid to be around that many people with no masks on.

We ordered:
Fried Scallop Banh Mi (2/5): Man was this a let down. I love banh mi and also scallops, so what could go wrong! The scallops were extremely fishy smelling and the combo of flavors was not very appetizing, my friend and I both didn&apos;t really want to finish our halves.
Pork Belly Benedict (4/5): I&apos;ve gotten this before and it was definitely better last time, but this time the pork belly was dry and stringy, and the home fries were like thin medallions as opposed to big chunks. 

Overall I like the vibe of White Dog and it is a nicer option on campus, but the food wasn&apos;t too impressive for the massive wait times needed. If you&apos;re looking for a good brunch I&apos;d suggest Green Eggs Cafe or Cafe Lift!"
5,"Absolutely love it here. The ambiance is amazing and so unique. Service is always friendly. Food is absolutely phenomenal and the prices are very reasonable. 

Menu changes from time to time and is consistently interesting and dynamic - there&apos;s something for everyone. Excellent spot for lunch or dinner."
5,"Went here after we drove to the Dandelion to find out there was an hour long wait... and we are so glad we did. We needed a restaurant close to World Cafe Live as we were on a time crunch.

The staff was excellent and accommodated for the fact we were in a rush. The craft beer selection was on point and the food was varied but perfect for a light meal - a hipsteresque take on bar bites and food.

My sister and step dad both got the pulled pork Mac and cheese - I tried a bite myself and understood why they were so hyped for it. I got the burger with a sunny side up egg. It was a mess to eat but ranks among my best burgers ever and the truffle parm fries were a great complement.

Would love to go back!"
5,"Let me just jump right into it - The Nashville Hot Catfish Sandwich on the brunch menu...SLAMMIN&apos;! Imma just say that it&apos;s just as great as the Popeyes Chicken Sandwich that was in high demand in 2019, but the only reason I can&apos;t confirm is because I&apos;m pescaterian! LOL. What&apos;s even better is that White Dog Cafe uses locally sourced ingredients AND you aren&apos;t limited until just the weekend to order this sandwich because brunch is served DAILY. I even loved the different twang of the House Made Chili-Ranch Potato Chips - while I&apos;m generally a fry girl, I&apos;m glad I stuck with this selection instead because it was surely a treat as the ranch flavor had a strong but delightful presence.

Now as for the ambiance, if you&apos;re a dog lover White Dog Cafe is for you! While I didn&apos;t see any real dogs in the restaurant, the venue is accented with all types of dog decor and the bright colors give me Andy Warhol meets Alice in Wonderland type vibes. It&apos;s a cute yet casual place and I&apos;m looking forward to returning soon (next up: the Crispy Cauliflower Bao Buns)!"
4,"This is one of my all time favorite spots! I&apos;ve been here multiple times and this is always one of my top five recommendations. The restaurant itself is a cute little place with different dog themed rooms throughout. It&apos;s beautiful, fun, and quirky!

Their menus are seasonal so that they can always use fresh ingredients and their desserts are made by gourmet chefs! The food is remarkable. Some of my favorites: pork belly and scallops, eggs Benedict, challah French toast, and oysters. I LOVE their cocktail sauce too! It&apos;s so spicy, it&apos;s really amazing. 

For the most part, the staff is great. The reason for 4 stars is because I did have one bad experience. I called ahead of time asking if I could use my Dragon card there (a Drexel University thing) and was told yes. However after I had finished my meal, I was told they did not have their Dragon card reader anymore, and when I replied that I had called literally minutes before arriving, they accused me of lying. Not only that, but I found a long grey hair in my burger and the same waiter that accused me of lying gave me an attitude and seemed frustrated by the fact that he had to order me another. I knew that the bill would be high because this place IS quite expensive, but I was expecting to see some sort of discount after all this. 

The incident was unfortunate, but did not stop me from returning as I really do love the food here. I have truly never gotten better brunch food from anywhere else but here."
3,"White Dog is a decent option if you need a last minute spot in University City (you should probably still make a reservation, but in my experience you can make one pretty close to your preferred time with a fair chance of success). The decor is beautiful and the dining space is deceptively large.

That said, White Dog is generally not my first choice for brunch or dinner because whenever I&apos;ve visited the service has been uneven and the food unspectacular. My most recent visit was for brunch, during which I ordered the Tex Mex breakfast. The corn cakes were pretty hard and the chorizo was gummy and underseasoned. I will say that they did a fairly good job of accommodating my friend&apos;s gluten-free restrictions, but overall I&apos;ve never had a great meal here.

The pricing isn&apos;t dirt cheap, but not prohibitively expensive either. But fundamentally, White Dog is a place I visit when I need a quick reservation rather than a first choice."
5,"Dining here is always a pleasure. Definitely my go-to place whenever in W. Philly or in Penn campus area for dinner. Great wine and beer on tap (e.g. Pinehople on nitro) choices. 

Most recently, I was seated in a downstairs area in the back of the building, the &quot;solarium&quot; opening out to the street to the east. Very nicely decorated area, but in a style unlike the rest of the restaurant. Of course, the dog motifs are everywhere - if you like dogs, a plus. 

Servers are personable, know the food and beverages, and attentive. Food is always excellent. Kung Pao Cauliflower is always a favorite, and my deputy Yelper gave five stars to the Duck Breast (&quot;I&apos;ve never had better!&quot;). Excellent Branzino. I will give a special shout out for the Pear Kimchi - very unusual. As far as I can tell, it&apos;s pear - in this case, a fairly unripe pear - steeped in the some kimchi brine. Great concept, but the side dish serving is quite generous, and more than we needed with a shared salad and entrees. It came home with me, and was excellent as leftovers. I am pleased to report, having taken it out, that they use biodegradable packaging for their takeout. I would expect nothing less, given their commitment to local, sustainable agriculture and food sourcing.

During happy hour, the main bar can be a bit overwhelming as a very popular with a student and academic crowd. On a different visit recently, I found the open-faced tofu egg salad sandwich really underwhelming - too much bread, and while the tofu was good, it was not proportioned to the amount of bread, even though there was no top piece on the sandwich. I don&apos;t recommend it, but give them credit for trying to do a tofu dish like this. At $10, I&apos;d say it&apos;s too much bread for the bread. But still, they deserve the five stars."
4,"Such a cute place and I love the decor. If you are a dog lover this is a must see! Their decor is great, service is good and food was delicious.

I ordered a lunch combo: their curry chicken sandwich with a side of mushroom soup. THEIR MUSHROOM SOUP WAS AWESOME. If you love mushrooms just order a regular bowl, you&apos;ll thank me later. Though the curry chicken was decent it was just okay, not the highlight of the meal. Since I was still hungry after my lunch, I couldn&apos;t resist ordering dessert. I ordered the hazelnut chocolate cake. It was delicious and I would definitely order it again.

Please check out this place and make sure you bring a camera. There&apos;s several picture worthy spots inside ."
5,"Very trendy spot right off UPenns campus! I came to campus for a college visit and what better way to round off my experience than a very late lunch at the white dog cafe! 

The butter was whipped, and slightly sweetened which was quite unique and delicious. We ordered the fish tacos with black bean soup and the pulled pork burger. The fish tacos were amazing, everything tasted very fresh and they were filled with a good amount of fish. However the black bean soup was too salty for my taste. The pulled pork was DELICIOUS. It was paired with Cole saw and caramelized onions and it was piled quite high. Paired with housemade bbq chips, it was not necessarily the healthiest but it tasted amazing."
4,"Went here with a friend for lunch around 1. Even though it was more crowded than expected for a weekday, we were seated immediately. We had plenty of time to look at the menu and decide, and service was great! She was very quick and always made sure we were okay.

We had bread and whipped butter to start. I liked that the butter was sweetened! My friend got one of the lunch specials (omelette with pulled pork and onion and potatoes on the side) and I got the fish tacos with soup of choice on the side (I went with tomato-basil soup). I wasn&apos;t sure how pulled pork would go with the omelette but it was really good! Honestly I wish that it were part of the actual menu. There was a good portion of fish in the tacos but I wouldn&apos;t get the tomato-basil soup again. I didn&apos;t really taste any basil and it was also a lot cheesier and creamier than I thought so I would get a different soup if you are not looking for something heavy.

Overall if you&apos;re in the ucity and are looking for somewhere to eat, I would recommend White Dog Cafe."
4,"White Dog Cafe is an awesome spot for Sunday Brunch.  It was bustling and very busy, but the staff and waiters were very attentive.  The waitress told us that White Dog was the first farm to table restaurant on the East Coast.  Therefore, all the ingredients are local and fresh.

We ordered a couple of omelets (the Kenneth Square and Lancaster County Three Egg Omelet).  Both were accompanied by home fries (essentially diced potatoes).  They were good omelets and stuffed with fillings.  I substituted carmelized onions for the bacon in the Lancaster and it was really great along with the roasted tomatoes, spinach and goat cheese.

The decor is rather cool with painting and other sculptures paying homage to dogs."
5,"I came here for a birthday lunch on a Friday and it was AWESOME! I just love the decor. This time we were seated in the green room which is so beautiful! So much natural light and cute vintage decor. 

Food:
I got the southern fried chicken sandwich ($16) and my boyfriend got the catfish tacos ($16) with the carrot ginger soup. The sandwich was good. I definitely did not expect the veggies in the sandwich, they were almost pickled. The truffle fries that came with it were delicious (free of extra charge!). I would definitely recommend the fish tacos. The fish was so tender and the flavor was great. The carrot soup was good but the texture reminded me of baby food. My boyfriend really like it though haha

Now for the extra cherry on top. We didn&apos;t even mention that it was my birthday but I guess the waitress over heard my group&apos;s conversation (group of 6). So at the end after she brought us the check, she surprised me with a cup of vanilla ice cream and a plate that had happy birthday written in chocolate. It was so unexpected! How sweet is that?!

This restaurant is so awesome. It always has been a great restaurant and I&apos;m so glad it has not dropped its standards over the years."
4,"My brother recommended this place for lunch and WDC did not disappoint. There were dogs on the walls, dogs on the floor, dogs on the bathroom door, I cannot stress enough that this place is worth a visit for the space alone. I walked around on my way to the bathroom and was so impressed with the overall execution of the doggie theme. 

The food was okay. I think maybe I just got something that didn&apos;t necessarily showcase their talents. I had the Farmers Plate which came with your choice of &quot;Cage Free Eggs, Thick Cut Green Meadow Farm Bacon, Multi-grain Toast, Yukon and Potato Home Fries.&quot; I had poached eggs, which was probably my first mistake (because obviously they weren&apos;t going to give me hollandaise without up charging, but I also didn&apos;t ask) but the potatoes were wonderfully seasoned. 

My boyfriend had the Southern Fried Chicken Sandwich that featured &quot;Spicy Ep!c Pickle, Sweet Pepper Chow-Chow, Honey Butter Sauce, Toasted Brioche, House Made BBQ Potato Chips.&quot; The sandwich was so huge he couldn&apos;t fit it in his mouth in one bite. The homemade potato chips were AMAZING THOUGH. They seasoned them with BBQ and I basically ate the whole basket because my boyfriend was full (or at least that&apos;s what I told myself ). 

I&apos;ll 100% be back to White Dog Cafe next time I venture on over to UC, moreso for the cute doggie cafe vibes than the food--the food was good, but the cafe doggie theme was more of the show stopper."
5,"White Dog is always a great place to go for a good meal! It is also the perfect place for a fun date night filled with delicious food. Our waiter was amazing and the service was incredible, the food came out so fast even with it being a busy Saturday night! The cheese board was an amazing starter, and all local cheeses. I&apos;m from Kennet and I have to say that I had the best mushroom soup I&apos;ve ever eaten! My boyfriend got the Duck Breast and I don&apos;t eat meat so I didn&apos;t taste it but he cleaned his plate and said it was amazing as well! Great food and a great experience! I highly recommend and can&apos;t wait to go back, I&apos;m already craving another bowl of that soup!"
3,"Was heading for a Five star review except for Lacey, the rude bartender. With a beautiful space, locally sourced food, bottomless drinks, and above all for me, vegan options, I was excited to try this place! 

We were seated promptly on a Sunday, without reservations. Our server, Jeff, was great, telling us the specials and even providing me an allergen menu for my dietary restrictions. We were sat in a beautiful but cold room, so we asked to be seated at the bar.

Jeff obliged without hesitation. He even carried our drinks over.  

When we got to the bar, Lacey, the bartender, aggressively came up to us and asked if our bills were transferred, coming off as very aggressive and transactional. We told her Jeff brought us and even brought our drinks. 

Lacey never came up to us to see if we wanted anything, so we were confused if we should order from her or Jeff. Jeff came by and brought our food; I had the arepas, a special Jeff told us about, with tofu, and my friend had a Farmer&apos;s plate (eggs, bacon, potatoes, and toast). 

My tofu didn&apos;t come, and I didn&apos;t want cold food, so after ten minutes, I went to Jeff to check on it. He told me it was coming. A manager (guessing, because he had an earpiece) brought it to me at the bar. 

The arepas were delicious, a simple dish with corn cakes and a few beans with corn sprinkled over it. The marinated tofu was a hit, juicy and flavorful. 

After being ignored by Lacey, we stopped her and asked her for a drink. She asked if our bar tab was transferred yet. She needed to work this out with Jeff, not us. She finally took our drink orders and was friendly for a few minutes. We were surprised and hoped that this would mean an improved level of service. 

We asked for the check and ordered another drink (had the $16 bottomless special). When we asked for another drink after signing our check, she said that we had to finish our current drinks. She took our signed checks. 

When we told her we were ready for our last mimosas, she said she was unable to serve us (despite ignoring over half of the time) because we already paid. Talk about mixed signals. Was our tip not good enough?

We saw Lacey chatting up and asking patrons whose orders originated at the bar if they wanted another drink. She even offered local bar recommendations to them. 

What kind of place has a bartender treat people like second class citizens because their order did not originate at the bar? That needs to be worked out among the staff. I spent $30 for corncakes (not including drinks). What a disappointing mess."
