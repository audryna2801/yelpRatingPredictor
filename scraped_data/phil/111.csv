5,"They currently do not issue an timed entry free ticket at the visitor center. So just come by and wait in a queue. (Although all the sign still indicate to get a free timed entry ticket at get visitor center including inside the visitor center).

They limit 9 people per tour to maintain social distance. I think we waited about 30 minutes for our turn. A ranger explained a short history while waiting outside. 

A ranger is knowledgeable and told us which part is still the original.

I got overwhelmed by just standing there knowing this is the place!"
5,"Took a little tour of Philly on the way back from AC. Independence Hall was closed due to the pandemic, but it was only nice to get out during the weekday and without a crowd."
5,"History is something that I really do love and always wanna dive more into so when I get the chance I visit places like this because you can never stop learning about the past!

Coming here was such a random thing but totally worth it in every way as this was a very informative tour of the two rooms that made up Independence Hall the rangers were very knowledgeable with the story of what happened here with two different people explaining what happened in either room!

One of the coolest parts about coming here is you can just feel the energy in here from the past which is kinda a kick in the face to the current times as I feel our government is in shambles even more so with the election as none of the candidates are worthy because I feel they need to step back into this room and start over again just like they did back in the day!

This wasn&apos;t meant to be a political review but it needs to be said that what happened here in independence hall was definitely one of the greatest things in America history because if it wasn&apos;t for this happening who knows how much worse it would be today.

Overall super fun and very informative tour in s building that&apos;s rich with history I do hope to make it back here again at some point because you never know what else you&apos;ll discover!"
4,"This is actually pretty decent area. There&apos;s lots of areas and sites along the way to visit and browse for a little bit of your afternoon.

Nice area to spend the afternoon with family and friends for a few hours."
3,"The complex which houses Independence Hall is a must see when in Philadelphia to check out the historical sites.  It&apos;s close to the Liberty Bell.  You do have to go through security to get into the complex of buildings.  The line was a bit long and we didn&apos;t have tickets to the main event, so we skipped going inside.

If you want to actually go into the main Independence Hall building, you must get tickets at the Visitor Center about a block north (past the Liberty Bell).  We were unlucky as tickets were gone for the day when we arrived around 2p or so, so get there earlier if you want to go in.

You can go into some of the other buildings.  The &quot;Gift Shop&quot; is part of it and outside of the security area.  This is also the building which housed the country&apos;s first US Supreme Court.  It you like history, that&apos;s worth it right there.

They need to rethink how they do the tickets as it is pretty far from the security line to where you need to get tickets and even walking fast, you can lose about 1/2 an hour.  Not convenient at all and no clear signs on what you need to do.  We just happened to overhear others that were angrily walking to the visitor center.  That&apos;s the reason for the 3 stars.  

You can still see the outside, take pictures, etc., but you have to plan in advance for this one."
3,"Interesting for history lovers, but if you&apos;re in a crunch for time, I&apos;d skip this and just walk by the outside--you can feel the history of the place from out there--and go instead to see the Liberty Bell. 

Our tour guide was ok, he was trying to be fun, but his humor fell flat. I did appreciate hearing about the significance of Independence Hall, but wish the tours were a smaller group size, and a little longer."
5,"Independence Hall is closed for the time being but how can you not be moved just by being here - hot, cramped and claustrophobic, these tiny chambers were host to some of the most consequential debates of mankind. 

It&apos;s anathema to modern thinking when conferences and business gatherings are now overweened spectacles designed with the expectation of luxury and ridiculous team building exercises, that any consensus could be formed without the benefit of high-end catering, 24/7 connectivity and one drunken buffoon from sales.

Would our country even exist if these debates had been conducted over Skype or Zoom absent the passions of a room sweltering in 95 degree heat. 

I have my doubts considering the climate controlled lassitude of our current Congress and the venomous keyboarding of our Commander-in-Chief who loves to taunt enemies from the cloud-based tranquility of the Twitterverse.

I have been to this building countless times and with each there&apos;s new learning. When everything is open once again, Philadelphia will be one of my first stops. A star rating seems so trivial. It&apos;s Independence Hall - it&apos;s part of who we are. Go immerse yourself in it."
5,"National Park Ranger Ed Welch was our guide for our visit to Independence Hall. A very interesting, informative and memorable presentation and visit. Seeing where our country was founded and where  the signing of the Declaration of Independence &amp; Constitution happened was a great experience and one not to be missed. 

Tours begin at 9am and happen every 20 minutes and each group is a manageable at around 70 people, which allows everyone to get a good view and hear the Ranger. 

Tickets are needed March through December and can be obtained for free from the kiosk at the visitor center, just across the road. We lined up at the visitor center at 8:15 for the 8:30 opening, and there were maybe 40 people ahead of us. The Rangers said that tickets are usually all gone by 10am, if not earlier. We obtained tickets for the 9am, first tour of the day. We used the restrooms at the visitor center, as recommended, and then made our way over to Independence Hall. There is a security screening area that we had to pass through before getting into the queue with our group. Both the line for tickets and screening moved quickly and efficiently."
4,"We got a free tour. Everyone that worked here was super nice. Be ready to walk. 
You can take pix but no flash.
I don&apos;t really care for history but since I&apos;ve seen the Hamilton play it&apos;s cool to recount things that mentioned him."
5,"For its historical significance, Independence Hall gets five out of five stars from me. This is the birthplace of America. Both the Declaration of Independence (1776) and the Constitution (1787) were signed here. You can see the room where the documents were signed, an original draft of the Constitution, and even the inkstand used to sign the Declaration of Independence.

Admission is free. Admission is also free to the adjacent Liberty Bell Center (https://www.yelp.com/biz/liberty-bell-center-philadelphia-2). I recommend going to both back-to-back. While the Liberty Bell Center is open on a first-come, first-served basis, admission to Independence Hall is ticketed during most times of the year. Both buildings are run by the National Park Service. Rangers serve as guides and staff. You have to be screened at a security checkpoint in order to enter either building.

Tickets to Independence Hall can be obtained for free at the Independence Visitor Center located about a couple blocks north at the corner of 6th and Market Streets. Same-day ticket distribution begins at 8:30am daily on a first-come, first-served basis. You can also reserve tickets in advance for $1 per ticket (nonrefundable). Check the National Park Service&apos;s website for details: https://www.nps.gov/inde/planyourvisit/independencehall.htm.

The tickets are for tours. The first ticketed tour begins at 9am and tours start every 20 minutes until 4:40pm (last ticketed tour of the day). During extended hours (summertime only), no ticket is required from 5-7pm. Tickets also aren&apos;t required in the months of January and February and on July 4th, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Eve. The hall is closed on Christmas Day.

Most importantly, Rocky Balboa jumped a park bench outside the south facade in Rocky II (1979). There was even a documentary about it and Rocky filming locations in Philadelphia, released in 2008. It&apos;s called Rocky Jumped a Park Bench (2008): https://youtu.be/ryGnmGKbRFo."
4,"This is the place where the Constitution was signed .  It is a massive campus, but the area the tour is given is very limited. Guests are taken into the hall for a 2-part 15-20 minute presentation on the building.  The first part is the judicial part where you see a reconstructed court room.  The send part is the legislative part where the laws were made.  While I waited, I was treated to an reenactment of a woman suffrage speech in the court yard.  The actress never broke character. I was impressed and felt the need to play along. I visited on the first day back since a 4 month break due to COVID. The Rangers were so excited. They are also so friendly and passionate about what they do. The tour is led by Rangers and they were awesome, so very knowledgeable. A visit here should definitely be a part of a larger trip because it does not take much time to see.  I would say about 30-45 minutes tops.  I recommend coupling it with the Liberty Bell, the Visitor&apos;s Center, the Constitution Meuseum, and the Betsy Ross House to Maximize your time."
5,"When you come to Philadelphia this is a must stop. Literally the birthplace of America. Where would we be without the historic events which took place here. The founding of our country. To enter the hall is free, simply enter through a checkpoint and you go directly on a tour with 70 other people who wait to enter the hall. Usually the tour takes about 20-30 minutes. The tour guides do a great job of explaining the different events which took place there. The hall is exactly the same as it was when the historic documents were debated and signed. I can only imagine the conversations and debates which were had while formulating our government. So much history. Definitely a must see when in Philadelphia."
5,"This is a truly cult American place. This is the birthplace of American history. The most important documents were signed here. Lot of American presidents were here. This is DNA of American nation. While you staying here you feel it. Strong place!
Truly history does not required money and that&apos;s so true that admission here is for free. Love this place 5/5!"
4,"The admission is FREE!! You need to get a ticket at the Independence Visitor Center (open at 8:30am) with timed entry. Go as early as possible because tickets run out fast since they only give out the same day entrance. You can pick a later time of the day too. 

It is a guided tour so you will get lots of information about the history. Very informative. In that area, many other tourist attractions as well."
4,"&quot;Independence Hall&quot; was a walk down our illustrious beginnings. It gave insight into how the United States became what it is today. Some of the story was new, some I learned in school. But nevertheless all of it informative. The lady that ran our tour was a character herself. She made it fun and interesting learning about how out Government came to be. I learned that Independence Day was really on the second and that Benjamin Franklin wanted only one Congress. I recommend anyone who visits Philadelphia, come to &quot;Independence Hall.&quot; The tour is free, but the knowledge you gain is priceless. Also be prepared to be crammed in a room with about forty people. The tour fills up pretty quickly."
4,"Great way to spend an hour or two in the historic section of Philadelphia. We stared by going to the visitors center but were a little put off about how long the line was to get tickets. We decided to explore the grounds  a bit and wandered over to Independence Hall to at least look around. We went through security since no ticket was required to get in there, and as luck would have it, as soon as we got through, we heard a park ranger announce that they had extra tickets for the tour that was about to begin 10 minutes later. 

All of the tour is guided, and I suspect your enjoyment of the tour will depend on who your tour guide is. Thankfully we had a great one who kept the 100 or so people on our tour engaged the whole  time. 

After you finish the formal tour, there are a few other buildings with exhibits to look though, but we were running short on time, so I suppose we&apos;ll catch them next time!"
5,"What an honor it was to be here!!  To stand where our founding fathers officially formed our great country...just no words!!  We took our 9 yr old and he was so engaged and loved the tour.  Our tour guide was fantastic.  

Tickets are free but you do have to get a ticket.  I imagine during the summer this may be harder to do when it is their peak season.  We went in November and there were plenty of tickets available for a tour in the next half hour.  You can reserve tickets online for a small fee.  This would probably be worth it during peak days.  You can&apos;t reserve tickets online the day of though.  

The Liberty Bell is right here too and it&apos;s great to tour that while you are here.  No tickets needed for that."
5,"Did the tour at around 4 in the afternoon. There was a line to go through the building (and it was free) so we waited, went through security then entered the building. A man greeted us and spoke about the history within 2 rooms about the Declaration of Independence. If you&apos;ve got the time, I&apos;d definitely recommend this. Was nice to do!"
4,"Came here and had the free 20 minute tour, and it was pretty cool. I came early in the day, and there was still a decent line, so you&apos;ll probably be waiting a looong time if you come  in the afternoon. Our tour guide was knowledgeable and enthusiastic, and this was a nice refresher of US history. Cool artifacts in the building as well! Note that you will need to go a security line a la airport security minus removing your shoes to enter the building."
4,"Wow! What amazing history here at Independence Hall. The tour is free, only requires a ticket from the visitors area. The tour lasts 49 mins, they let you see a couple of rooms including the &quot;Room Where It Happens&quot;!"
