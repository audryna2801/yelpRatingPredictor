5,"This place surprised us. *I&apos;m not a vegan* but for a vegan restaurant it&apos;s definitely a 5-star. The for two breakfast was just enough food for two, the standout was the beans, exceptionally seasoned and phenomenal taste. Best black beans I&apos;ve ever had at a restaurant. The agua fresca was a pineapple passion and it was very tasty. Outdoor seating wasn&apos;t the best I&apos;ve seen but adequate for covid guidance and outdoor heating for winter. 

Only downside was the for two came with the option for the Bloody Mary mix which didn&apos;t include alcohol and the charge to add alcohol was $9 which i felt was a lot, could&apos;ve been $4, essentially a $9 shot- but maybe that&apos;s the going rate in Philly."
5,"We got the dinner combo for takeout one night ($40 for 2 apps, 2 entrees, and 2 sides). Everything was so good!! I can&apos;t pick a favorite dish. I would highly recommend going here whether you&apos;re vegan or not!

Peruvian Yuca: WOW these yuca &quot;fries&quot; were amazing. They had aji amarillo, castletrevano olives, fried capers, and cilantro. The flavors all went together really well. The yuca was crispy. I would totally get these again and I&apos;m not sharing next time!

Spanish Rice: They gave us 2 huge containers of this rice for the dinner combo so the portion was huge! That was a nice surprise. The rice had an excellent flavor and didn&apos;t even need any salsa or sour cream. Though I did put some on my fajita taco which was great.

Philly Steak Empanadas: Ignore how orange these look in the photo, that&apos;s how my flash made them look since we couldn&apos;t wait and ate them in the car lol. These are SO GOOD. I would highly recommend getting the full appetizer order since you only get 2 with the dinner combo. 

Sweet Plantains: Delicious sweet plantains cooked perfectly. They were almost caramelized on the outside. The insides have a slight banana flavor but are a little sweeter. We got 6 plantains with the dinner combo.

Blackened Chick&apos;n Fajita Tacos: Tastes so similar to real chicken, and the flavors are fantastic. It was lacking a little bit on the fillings, so I embellished it with rice, sour cream and salsa. The flour tortilla was okay, it got a little soggy in the takeout container, but it tasted fresh. You get 2 in the dinner combo. 

Buffalo Cauliflower Tacos: While the fajita tacos were lacking, these were overstuffed! The cauliflower stayed crispy even in the takeout container, and they were very flavorful. The black beans and guac were an interesting but welcome addition. I would get these again. You get 2 in the dinner combo."
5,"Came here on a frigid evening in December, braving the outdoors in search of good cocktails. Luckily, Bar bombón did a great job with both the ambience and the drinks. They are a Latin, veg-based restaurant but you&apos;ll hardly notice the lack of meat. During COVID times, they have erected an open air tent with heaters to keep restaurant-goers sheltered from the elements. They also have a special warm-up menu with warm drinks and a blanket ($20).

To start, we got the nachos which were served in a hot queso with baked beans, guac, sour cream and chips. We ate every bit! With this course, I tried the Smoking Darts (Mezcal, white rum, crème de violette, rose water). It was an interesting and potent purple drink. Then for the main, I tried the buffalo cauliflower tacos. These were very tasty and reasonably sized. I ended with one of the warm up drinks - the coquito. It actually was almost enough for 2 drinks and boy did I enjoy that delicious sweet coconut milk with rum and spices. Definitely a decadent end to the meal!

Overall, they did a great job acclimating to difficult circumstances. The service was a tad slow, but other than that we were very pleased with the food and drinks and the warm ambience. Would definitely come back!"
3,"Location: conveniently located; a short walk from Rittenhouse Square &amp; surrounded by other local restaurants. Cute interior decor.

Service: kind staff! Went on a weekday afternoon and service was a bit slow, only one waitress on staff. Indoor and outdoor dining were both open. Indoor dining had plastic dividing panels between tables.

Food: the portions were quite small for the price, but have to say for plant-based vegan tacos I could hardly tell the difference. The empanada was delicious, a bit cold upon arrival but filling was nicely seasoned. The Buffalo cauliflower had a softer texture, a bit mushy, but still flavorful and delicious."
3,"I really wanted to love this place but I just couldn&apos;t.

After exploring their menu online this place looked great. Sadly it is overpriced and small portions. Plus the food wasn&apos;t anything that I would say I had to have again.

PROS:
~The queso dip &amp; mushroom ceviche was delicious!

~They offer outdoor seating during Covid. 

NEG:
~Their &quot;spicy&quot; pickles was a small dish of flavorless pickles.

~I ordered one of their $20 hot chocolates which was supposed to come with marshmallows (which is why I ordered the hot chocolate drink) and they told me they were out after they delivered the drink. Plus its supposed to come with a blanket and they never gave it to me I had to ask for it as we were about to leave.    

~The server was pretty much non existent our whole time there. We had to keep calling them over.  

I would suggest looking at another place such as black bird if you are visiting Philly!"
4,"This review is for updated operations during COVID (because isn&apos;t that what everything is these days?!)

Re: Food - Bar Bombon has been on my list to try in Philly for quite some time! While I generally try to steer away from vegan / vegetarian only restaurants (instead preferring restaurants that have both veggie / non-veggie options), this place was a hit for me and my SO (who is strictly vegetarian). It is a bit pricey (the drinks from the warm up menu go for $20+), but we were able to grab a table via online reservations for happy hour which was a good deal for the quality of the food. The Philly Cheesesteak empanadas were great, as were the nachos. The cheese tasted better than any nacho cheese that I&apos;ve had in a while! 

Re: Logistics - They have outdoor tables in the alley between them and a.kitchen as well as tables on the sidewalk / street. We were seated at the tables in the alley, which was nice because we weren&apos;t in the more crowded street-side seating with lots of pedestrians. However, the alley does feel a little less nice given the noise in the alley and general alley-like feel. This can&apos;t be avoided and I&apos;m glad they had multiple seating options! Perhaps something to think about if you are trying to assess your risk tolerance when outdoor dining

Our server was so amazingly pleasant and lovely and followed all of the COVID safety precautions well. Would recommend veggie and non-veggie folks to come by and check out their happy hour!"
3,"Overpriced and the quality is mixed. I got steak empanadas and queso. The empanadas were DELICIOUS but very expensive for the amount of food you get ($10 for two). The queso on the other hand was very expensive ($12 for a tiny amount) and did not taste good at all. The flavor was bland to the point it was liking I was eating the chips plain. I know texture is always hard for vegan cheese, but this queso was watery and oily and barely stuck to the chips. Definitely nowhere near worth the price."
2,"Food was below average, we ordered Buffalo cauliflower tacos, yucca fries and empanadas, except the fries the others were dominated by lemon flavor and the quantity was very less. 2 stars for ambiance."
3,"Friend is vegan so we had vegan for lunch.. eh.

All seating is outdoors on the main road. There was too much noise and cars passing on 1 side and persons walking the sidewalk on the other for me. 

Bruce was a great waiter!

I had the 5 meatballs with garlic bread. They were okay. Meatballs were sizeable. Garlic bread was good. 

Tacos were fairly small. My friend seemed to eat both in just four bites total ;) 

Vegan meat is just not my type, but my friend said it was all Good!"
5,"This past weekend, my friends and I visited Philly and decided to try out this Puerto Rican vegan restaurant. That&apos;s rice Puerto Rican vegan, packed with all organic flavors in every bite. Bringing their Latin roots to philly, providing 100% vegan dishes to customers, this was undeniably one of my best vegan experiences. As a foodie, I am open to trying all kinds of food and Bar Bombon has my heart

Appetizer: Queso Dip (house made &quot;Cheese&quot; sauce with mojo verde
Entree: Cubano Club Slider (Blackened &quot;Chicken&quot;, smoked tempeh, avocado, dill pickles, lettuce, tomato, grain mustard aioli 
Drink: Mango Mojito

THANK YOU"
5,"Sat outside and although it was cold the food was amazing as always. The food came out pretty quick as well. I could eat those Buffalo chicken tacos ALL day. In fact, do you ship to colorado because I need them  despite COVID-19, the servers were super positive and attentive. Can&apos;t wait to come back."
5,"Outdoor dining experience during COVID-19...

Had a lovely time eating outside at Bar Bombon! It was my first time visiting this restaurant and I was excited to try out the all vegan menu!

There are about 5 or 6 tables outside on the street and in the alley next to the restaurant. Service was friendly and attentive.

I had the Buffalo Cauliflower tacos and they were AMAZING! They were delicious and filling. Highly recommend. I also tried the Classic Margarita with spicy salt on the rim. Nice and refreshing with a little kick courtesy of the spicy salt.

I can&apos;t wait to return and try more of the menu!"
5,"I love it here  I come at least once/week. The habanero beet marg is delicious! I always start with nachos with added impossible ground beef. The steak empanadas and meatballs are also amazing starters. 

The traditional tacos are my go to! You really can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu. The dining experience is always amazing and it&apos;s owned by women!

Easily one of my favorite spots."
5,"Ordered delivery; was surprised at how filling the meal was. Bold flavor in the buffalo tacos and tres leches cake. Unique and very well executed, definitely one of the best vegan spots on the city."
3,"This is the second time that I tried this place and I was really praying that their cauliflower tacos were going to taste better but it did not. The cauliflower was hard to bite into. I don&apos;t understand why they won&apos;t fry or roasted it  my friend ordered - i think - a fajita taco and they did that very well!

I was not crazy about the &quot;queso&quot;. It literally tasted like I was dipping my chip in to garlic water.

The guac was horrible. 

Platanos and Tres Leche were good!!!

Might return, might not."
5,"Great spot even if you&apos;re not a vegan! Ordered take out and was impressed with the packaging for everything. The Buffalo cauliflower tacos (2 per order) are always a great option on any menu. Pleasantly surprised by the Cuban Sliders in both size and texture of the filling. Definitely seemed like real chicken inside. Tostones were good but wouldn&apos;t recommend as a takeout option. They&apos;re so much better fresh from the fryer and a microwave does not do it justice when reheating. Latin chop salad was also delicious with the chicken add on - however, the two of us were satisfied enough with the other items and saved the salad for the next day. Excited to try their other items on a future trip!"
4,"I love restaurants like Bar Bombón and others that have opened the door for lifetime meat eaters like myself to tiptoe into the world of vegetarian and vegan food. My husband and I have switched to a pescetarian diet during the week, so we&apos;re always looking for new and delicious meals that will keep us full and satisfied. 

We ordered delivery for lunch this week through Caviar, and I was really excited to see that that Bar Bombón is currently offering some grocery items in addition to their regular menu. I scored some fragrant cilantro and mint, lemons and a pound of roma tomatoes. Yes! 

In terms of the prepared food, my husband chose the blackened &quot;chicken&quot; fajita tacos while I went for the latin chop. We got the peruvian yucca fries to share. I&apos;m a little wary of substitute meats (fully aware of the irony here) and I&apos;m trying to get more adventurous. I tried a bite of the taco and was pleased to find: it tasted just like chicken! I&apos;d try these myself in the future. My salad was fresh and tasty, but I was glad to have the yucca fries because the salad alone wouldn&apos;t hold me over. The yucca was delish, topped with a substitute cheese, sliced green olives and fried capers. I was sad I had to share. 

The reason for four stars and not five is because the portions are pretty tiny and the prices are not. Two tacos were $13, and the yucca was $8.50 but we each only had about four pieces. Our weekday lunch was pricier than I&apos;d like but I&apos;m happy I got to try some new things!"
5,"A shot of mezcal. Then one more. Then, another. Oh, and can you top me off with some mezcal please?

I&apos;m fresh off the latest wave of &quot;Chef&apos;s Night Out&quot; episodes, courtesy of one of my many guilty pleasures, Munchies. It&apos;s a way for me to live out my fantasy, really. Except, I can&apos;t say that my fantasy has included NEARLY as much booze as what seems to be consumed on the show - or, namely, nearly as much mezcal.

I&apos;ve never been much of a drinker and if I have indulged, the alcohol is often an afterthought, a tiresome accompaniment to the real reason I&apos;ve chosen to visit whatever bar/pub/shandy/late-night-establishment that&apos;s enjoying whatever business I offer it.

But an illicit six-hour visit to Philly calls for celebration. And of reasons to celebrate, there are many: being reunited with long-lost friends, indulging in the exploration of a new city that could, one day, become yet another home. The enthusiasm began on the two-hour train ride from New York: one of the most pleasant, I must admit (although I still prefer Chennai&apos;s MRTS and it&apos;s open-air ambiance, if you can call it that).

This is what someone playing hooky must feel like, I imagine as I run into friend #1 and prepare to surprise friend #2 in what is a carefully-planned adventure. (I use the phrase &quot;carefully-planned lightly: I&apos;ve already scoured Zagat reviews of restaurants in the area to make the most of my precious six hours and have tortured my best friend with menu questions. It&apos;s ok, she&apos;s used to it by now.)

Only slightly deterred by the fact that I&apos;m ravenous for Philly&apos;s vegan-laden offerings, we settle on Bar Bombn rather quickly: after all, they have impossible &quot;beef,&quot; handmade empanadas, and a treat for the masses: yucca fries. 

*Note: I later found out that Bar Bombn is the brainchild of  Nicole Marquis (of HipCityVeg fame). Of course, that doesn&apos;t leave me any less impressed with what followed.*

The intermittent July showers have us moving outside, inside, and outside again as they subside and while the food is sublime, each dish more marvelous than its predecessor, what I remember is the smoky mezcal: it&apos;s got my brain in a tizz and yet, I can still distinguish its woody aftertaste, its flirtation with the dark side, and its foray into territory undiscovered, carrying me with it in as I protest once, twice, and then, not at all.

Soon, it was time for me to journey back and my only lasting memory is of a foggy brain, heavy with weighty, heart-wrenching memories. Or at least, that&apos;s what I tell myself. Truth be told, it&apos;s probably just that last sip of mezcal, lingering in the wake of yet another adventure."
4,"I went to Bar Bombón a few weeks ago as they began their warm drink + blanket special. It was so cute and cozy, and the drink was delicious. I enjoyed the buffalo cauliflower tacos for food. We sat at a table in the alley and felt plenty spaced out and safe."
5,"For Sunday brunch, this place delivered a delicious, plant-based meal that any vegan would most likely love.  It was so difficult to decide with so many choices.  We didn&apos;t have a reservation (which I would probably recommend), but were lucky enough to get a table before the wave of people came in.

Bloody Mary and Verde Maria (tequila) - Both drinks were excellent and mixed well.  Not too spicy, but had a bit of a kick.

Chocolate Chip Banana Pancakes - These were so delicious with gooey chocolate and a nice banana flavor.  A bit of maple syrup made them disappear quickly!

Sweet Plantains - These were some of the best plantains I&apos;ve ever eaten.  I usually don&apos;t like them at all, but I could have eaten all of these.  Crispy and sweet with a little savory mixed in.

Tofu Egg Sandwich with Tempeh Bacon and added a sausage patty - This is the vegan equivalent of BK Breakfast sandwich with bacon/sausage/egg/cheese, only it&apos;s good for you.  It came with a side of cheese sauce to pour/dip.  Excellent Breakfast Sandwich.

Cuban Slider - This is no slider, it&apos;s a half-hoagie.  The only thing that gave it a bit of a Cuban sandwich vibe were the mustard and pickles.  It wasn&apos;t a faux Cuban, but it was delicious AF.

Hearts of Palm Ceviche - I love ceviche, and this fish-less version had all of the makings of a traditional ceviche.  Bright citrus and savory onion flavors on the crunchy tortilla chips made this a must order for me.

The service was great as we had water refills and offers for another drink too.  The food came out quickly and all was great.  I&apos;d go back for brunch, but would also like to try their other food as well.  Also, it&apos;s a bar!"
