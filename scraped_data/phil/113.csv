4,"I loved how the place is pristine enough to be safe for the customers during this pandemic. The customer service was standard, and the order was almost instantaneous. Although the drinks were exquisite, the takoyaki was bland and non-authentic."
4,"Trip to Philly is not complete without good Boba from Chinatown!!

The bubble teas at this place are the best in Chinatown. They have a nice variety of drinks, they have tea with fruits, milk teas, and smoothies. Their biba tea has a nice balance of sweetness and not overly sweet. The staff was also extremely friendly and fast. 

Looking forward to coming back and trying more teas!"
1,"I wanted to like this place, I really did.

My first time here, I ordered the mango smoothie and my friend ordered taro milk tea. The smoothie tasted like soap and had weird chunks in it that wasn&apos;t mango or lychee. The taro milk tea tasted fake and was inundated with weird powder texture, and was way too sweet. Nevertheless, I stopped by today to give it a second chance. I ordered takoyaki and a regular hot black milk tea with tapioca. It was by the far the worst bubble tea I&apos;ve EVER had. Every sip had bits of tea fragments, and it was impossible to drink without almost choking on the tea leaves. The tea itself also tasted super bland, like brewed black tea with milk and nothing added to it. This alone made me infuriated because... well, how can you open a bubble tea shop and mess up on a classic black milk tea?? 

In other words, I&apos;m never coming back. Thanks for the disappointment."
5,"I love this place! It&apos;s always packed here, but the vibe is so chill and welcoming, it doesn&apos;t even matter! I&apos;ve never once had a bad order--every drink I&apos;ve tried has been amazing and the food is good too!

One complaint I have is that they have so many fruit-flavored drinks and I think the names make it a little confusing! I never know which order is which, so every time I go I just select a random one. The good thing is, I like all of them so it doesn&apos;t matter THAT much."
4,"Tea Do is a good place to get a quick drink. It is clean-cut, has a nice aesthetic and an overall broad selection of drinks to choose from, including some food options. My favorite drink to get here when I want something sweet is the Zen&apos;s Awakening. It has a mocha coffee flavor! You can add boba to almost any drink too. I will say from trying other places boba, I do find theirs to be a bit smaller and more firm. Overall though, if I am in the area I will stop by for something refreshing."
5,"Incredible Thai bubble tea in Philly! They obviously don&apos;t let you sit down anymore inside but you are allowed to entire the establishment and order inside which is nice. I order just a regular bubble tea and my friend ordered the grasshopper. I loved mine and they were both made super quick. His was ok, not my favorite. He said he would order something different next time but enjoyed trying it!"
3,"Came here craving some bubble tea. Ordered a large taro- it was alright. Tasted very watery. I appreciate they didn&apos;t put too much boba in it. Not amazing, but not awful by any means. Average prices."
5,"You&apos;ll never understand all the Boba shops like WE DO
You can see all the Boba, but can the Boba SEE YOU
You can be a Merekat, an Ocelot, or even a Boba EMU
But for Boba in Chinatown Philly you come to TEA DO

If the Boba gets touchy feely will you hashtag ME TOO
If the Boba makes you sick will you and Boba BE THROUGH
If you&apos;re drinking Boba in jail, will Boba FREE YOU
And if you&apos;re in Philly, will you come and drink at TEA DO?

Anyway, now I have to hit the restroom for a PEE/POO
If you hate this rap, just ask me for a RE-DO
BYE.

My notes said - nice tea do with incredibly friendly ppl, good milk tea, drank most of it, nice and creamy, like your ma last night

I love Tea Do, and this is a great location with good service.

This is an excellent bubble tea shop that is open late night in the heart of Chinatown Philadelphia. It&apos;s one of my favuorite spots for a good milk tea, and the fruit teas are pretty good too, here.

They also have lovely service, and the decor is basic and old-building-style and very similar to the location in Boston (and some of the other Chinatown Boba), which I think this place is modeled very similarly after.

It&apos;s not quite as busy or popular as the Boston one, but it&apos;s still a great place. The tea was good and creamy, and as I said, the service was definitely nice. 

They will make off menu drinks which a lot of people won&apos;t do, especially in Chinatown. They&apos;re insanely friendly.

I really have nothing but great things to say about Tea Do. As an added bonus they are open late and they have a bathroom as well.

In conclusion, one of my favorite bubble tea shops in Philadelphia and well worthy of five stars.

The best things in life are not free
And especially not in Philly
Pat&apos;s/Geno&apos;s Steak Sandwich
Is really just spam, which
Belongs in e-mails, not in me

No, I hit Philly regularly
Not for relics from a past century
Nor for a Cheez-Whiz sandwich
For I am a man which
Is in love with Tea Do Bubble Tea!"
5,"This place has always been my go to in Chinatown. Parking in the city sucks but if you want to pay $10-$12 you can park across the street for multiple hours. It&apos;s not a huge bubble tea spot, but it&apos;s definitely a place where most teenagers go to get their fix of bubble tea. Almost everything here is delicious, from their milk teas to their fruity and coffee drinks. They even have onigiris and other foods that they offer. 
Drinks: I personally love the black milk tea with bubbles. I prefer more sugar than 50%, so next time I would go 70%. It&apos;s always very milky and sweet with a good tea flavor. 
I also really love their avacado smoothies because it really refreshing and filling. Great fats. 
Everyone has their own preferences, so I would tell you to try anything on the menu."
4,"Going to start off by saying I grew up on Orange County boba/bubble tea, so my standards are skewed (I&apos;m giving them 4 stars given this acknowledgment). Nonetheless, the drinks here weren&apos;t bad (at least the one I had). This TeaDo location is nicely situated in Chinatown. The space is kind of cramped because they seemingly tried to get as much seating in for studying/hanging out, but it&apos;s comfy and welcoming. It&apos;s kinda dim and loud; there are board games available. Service is solid. 

I got their Sakura rose milk tea with boba. The boba was pretty decent in consistency and taste. The milk tea itself wasn&apos;t bad, but I wasn&apos;t blown away. I liked how many options there were, though! It seemed like their menu was well curated with both the safe go-to flavors and some more unique ones. What I enjoyed the most was their food menu! I wasn&apos;t very hungry coming in, so I just tried their takoyaki, which didn&apos;t disappoint. 

Overall a really solid place to go for drinks and snacks! Would definitely come back here if I lived in the city and wanted to grab a bite and boba in a social setting."
4,"- Stopped by and got the honey jasmine tea
- I usually prefer teas on the sweeter side and this was even considered sweet for me
- Tried the sakura rose milk tea as well but didn&apos;t like the flavour
- Couple of high top tables available and a couch for large groups near the door
- Bathroom at the back"
5,"Tea Do is probably my go  to spot when I want bubble tea in philly/ Chinatown. There flavors are always on point and they do disappoint.

I love their milk tea drinks but I especially love their famous, flavor drinks such as the grasshopper, tropical twister, Sunset, and etc. the I can&apos;t get enough of them and the price are decent for their drinks. I also enjoy their food snacks like onigiri, wings, and fish balls. 

The place is always pack on the weekend but their service are pretty quick."
2,"I really don&apos;t understand how Teado has such good reviews or if it&apos;s because I have high standards coming from NYC for bubble tea places, but this did not deserve to be called bubble tea. I was in Philly for a weekend trip and heard good things and finally decided to try it but NO ONE in my group enjoyed it, and I&apos;m a bubble tea addict. Everyone ended up tossing it and we ended up getting sharetea instead, which was so much better. However, giving another star as they did not mess up our relatively large order via Grubhub. The taste was just off and was not pleasant."
2,"I have tried to like tea do for like 2 years when my friends get it, but it just doesnt hit right."
5,"This place has the best bubble tea! They have so many flavors from super fruity juices to original tea flavors. 

I love the popping bubbles in a fruity tea in the summer. It&apos;s so refreshing! But my standard order is their Japanese green tea milk tea. You are able to adjust the sweetness and I usually get unsweetened or 30% sugar. 

Great place to add to your must do&apos;s in China town!"
4,"The bubble tea we had from Tea Do was good. We enjoyed it.

One of our friends, who currently lives in Philly, brought us here. It was a good choice. Another one of our friends, who used to live in Philly, considers this Philly&apos;s first &quot;legit&quot; bubble tea place. It opened in 2012. It&apos;s located in Chinatown, just one block north of Friendship Gate: https://www.yelp.com/biz/chinatown-friendship-gate-philadelphia.

Outside, the corner storefront has a cool mural of a dragon. Inside, the place was packed. Almost every seat was taken - and this was on a Sunday night around 8:10pm. Like a lot of bubble tea shops, Tea Do isn&apos;t big, but it does have seating. There are a handful of high tables and low/coffee tables. Several years old now, there&apos;s nothing too remarkable about the interior.

The menu is sizable with over 76 drinks to choose from. They include Tea Do specialties (special drinks unique to this brand), smoothies, milk bubble tea, popping bubble drinks, green tea drinks, black tea drinks, and aloe vera drinks. All drinks come in regular and large sizes. Most specialties and smoothies run $4.25 each for regular and $5.25 each for large, milk teas $3.50 regular / $4.50 large, and other drinks $3.75 regular / $4.75 large. There are 17 topping options and 16 of them cost $0.50 each (white pearl jelly is $0.75).

In addition to the regular menu, there was a blackboard menu on the counter. During our visit, it advertised Tiger milk tea, winter melon green tea, Johnny tea, and chrysanthemum tea plus apple and yogurt popping boba and almond milk substitute. There was no description of the Tiger and Johnny teas, so you&apos;d have to ask the staff.

I tried three drinks:

* Grasshopper (large, $5.25)
* Taro bubble milk tea (large, $4.50)
* Oolong bubble milk tea (regular, $3.75)

I enjoyed all the drinks and would recommend all three of them. Across the board, I thought the tea and topping quality was good. Good tea flavor and fresh, appetizing toppings with ideal textures.

The Grasshopper was different than what I&apos;m used to (I usually order milk bubble teas). The Grasshopper is made with green tea, green apple, pear, green tea jelly, and lychee jelly. The drink was mildly sweet, a little bit tart, ice cold, and very refreshing. It hit the spot for me. I think my fiancee liked it the best of the drinks we ordered.

The taro bubble milk tea and the oolong bubble milk tea were both solid. No complaints here. Both drinks had a smooth, non-powdery consistency with nice flavor and ideal sweetness (for me). The boba was excellent; soft and delectably chewy.

Service was fine. The apathetic cashier could&apos;ve been friendlier. He didn&apos;t have a great attitude. If we didn&apos;t tell him what size we wanted our drinks, he would&apos;ve made them all large. He didn&apos;t ask us what sizes we wanted. Our order was filled quick.

According to Tea Do&apos;s website, this location in Philly is the first location. There are six other locations in the Northeast including one in Boston Chinatown: https://www.teadocafe.com/locations-1.

TL;DR - Tea Do is good."
5,I was around the chinatown area of Philly with my boyfriend and we wanted a refreshing tea drink. We ordered online and we both got the Tropical Tea Twister since there were a lot of reviews highlighting it. One was with 30% and the other at 75%. Indeed it was super refreshing and delicious to drink. You can tell they use fresh tea leaves and it does not that artificial. The tropical flavors enriched the drink and I&apos;d definitely come back here to try other drinks if I&apos;m in the area again.
3,"My experience at Tea-Do was just okay. I ordered the tiger milk tea and hoping that it would be like the brown sugar bubble tea. That wasn&apos;t it. It tasted like normal black milk tea. The boba was chewy but some of the pieces were slightly firm in the middle. As for the tea itself, it was sweet but mild in the tea flavor. 

The shop itself was not a good place to hang out. It was hot and humid. It definitely didn&apos;t help that the place was crowded. Stop by for a drink if you are in the area but don&apos;t go out of your way."
4,"Service, 4.5/5: They have good service, but the drinks did that a while to come out which I was confused since we were the only customers in the shop at the time. They were very accommodating with me and my family.

Aesthetic/Atmosphere, 5/5: Of course every Tea Do has that dark, club-like theme. There was a cute low table area, which I thought was chill. The space is a decent size too. 

Food/Drink, 5/5: The drinks are always bomb. Tea Do is one of my favorite bubble tea places and the one in Philly definitely did not disappoint. 

Pricing, 4/5: It was a bit annoying that there was a $5 minimum for Credit/Debit Card. I personally don&apos;t really cash anymore as most people don&apos;t. 

Overall Experience 4.5/5: It was a pretty good experience just like the one in Maryland!"
5,"Great place to get bubble tea and some Asian snacks! I have ordered various types of bubble tea here and have never been disappointed, so please try whatever you&apos;re interested in! The bubbles here are also always very chewy- which I love (:

Their food (rice triangles, etc) are also very delicious if you&apos;re in the mood for a snack. I will say- you do have to wait awhile for them to make it, but it&apos;s still yummy!"
