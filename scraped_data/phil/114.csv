5,"The food, ambience, service, and drinks here are amazing!! We got take out the first time and then had a Valentine&apos;s Day brunch a few months later. 

The Valentine&apos;s Day special (strawberry scones with lavender cream) were so good we inhaled them before we remembered to take a picture. 

I didn&apos;t try the cocktails but the coffees were great. My latte was rich and flavorful. 

Our server (can&apos;t remember his name but he had a man bun) was super nice. He went above and beyond to ensure we had a good time."
5,"This is spot on. It&apos;s cold out, but warm in their individualized partitioned,  outside tables, tucked away with heaters and twinkling lights. Both of my girls had the fried chicken and it was delicious. I ate my second girl&apos;s grits because they were creamy and delicious and her palate isn&apos;t sophisticated enough yet to understand that. My bestie and I had the salmon, glazed just right and cooked perfectly. The service was exceptionally good. We all had cocktails that were balanced. Thanks for making this pandemic-dining bearable, Love."
5,"We wanted to have a lunch out for the first time in ages, and so we booked a spot at The Love&apos;s outdoor seating area along the street in front of their restaurant. It was cold day, but the hot air being piped in to the individually sectioned-off tables made it comfortable. We made the reservation on Open Table, and it&apos;s a good thing we did, because when we left, we saw a huge line of people waiting to eat. The staff were professional and crisp, like any good dining experience, but it just happened that the dining room was outside.

As for the food, it was very good. I got the &quot;Take Me Away&quot; (fried nashville hot chicken, griddled brioche, pickles, and comeback sauce), which was wonderful. The chicken was tender and moist, the outside was crispy and very well seasoned, the sauce was impressively spicy, and even the pickles were good. And it paired well with a Wyndridge Original apple cider. Dessert was the Apple Marzipan Tea Cake, which again, was very tasty.

Overall, The Love was fantastic. It made us so happy to be able to eat outside but still have a great dining experience. I would definitely go back."
5,"My fiance and I had a great time celebrating our 6 year anniversary at  The Love. We are not local to Philly; I found the restaurant on a whim while looking for places to dine in Rittenhouse Square. The Love seemed like an appropriate place to celebrate such an occasion!

I made a reservation for a Saturday evening on Open Table a few weeks prior. When we arrived, we were (happily!) surprised to see how busy they were. The Love has a block long outdoor dining structure, with all tables partitioned and set up with heating devices. We checked in outside and were walked through the interior, which is so romantic and properly distanced. 

We started off with drinks. My fiance got an espresso martini, and I had the Love Me Sweet with some vodka. This was a great light yet sweet drink, and I was able to nurse it all night!

Next came a round of their famous parker rolls. These were next level delectable, especially the chive butter combo that the rolls come with. My ratio of bread to butter may have been overwhelmingly leaning on the butter, but you only live once, right?

We inhaled our entrees basically within seconds of them arriving to our table, they were that good. Their entree list is succinct but I don&apos;t really think you can go wrong with any choice. I had the Pulled Brisket Fazzoletti (garlic ricotta? yes please), and my fiance had the Lovebird. 

What made our night outstanding was our waiter. I unfortunately don&apos;t remember their name, but they were friendly, approachable, and knowledgable. They also surprised us at the end of the evening with a lovely dessert plate. It was so kind and made our experience even more memorable.

I will definitely be here again! Thank you for a wonderful experience."
4,"Went here on a little brunch date last week, we were told we&apos;d have 90 minutes at the table but we certainly spent more time than that! 
The restaurant is clean and well spread out, and the outdoor seating is just delightful! I always assumed this was a bit of a stuffy restaurant and wasn&apos;t really eager to try it but we were actually seated near a group of 8-10 &quot;bros&quot; out brunching for one of their birthdays. At one point they started to sing Happy Birthday and the whole restaurant joined in. It was absolutely lovely.
The menu was a bit sparse and not really my ideal brunch menu but I landed on the shrimp and grits, it was really good - too many grits and not enough shrimp but it was cooked perfectly and had an excellent sauce.
BEST PART - Espresso Martinis!!! Don&apos;t sleep on these, I had at least 4 and was wired for the rest of the day. A simple pleasure of mine is having an ultra boozy brunch and head home for a nap - but after this brunch I didn&apos;t need a nap and enjoyed the rest of the gorgeous day out walking the city."
4,"The outdoor seating at The Love is incredible. They have individual outdoor booths with heating vents in each booth that are not recirculating air from other booths. They also change tablecloths between customers. COVID safety is probably as good as it can get for outdoor dining in the cold. We arrived early so I got a spiked hot chocolate from the bar. The drink was really good...cost $16 so it better be! 

We waited outside for a few minutes and then were seated in our booth. The server was really friendly, had a great knowledge of the menu and was COVID safe. We ordered the pulled brisket fazzoletti, ricotta ravioli and shared an order of potato frites. Both of the entrees were delicious and filling. The side of potatoes was really salty (and I like salty food so that&apos;s saying something). I did decide to let our server know about the potatoes so she replaced them with a portion that was less salty. Value is important to me, I&apos;d say that this met the mark since the atmosphere was really nice and the entrees we received were high quality. 

Overall, we were really impressed! The food was delicious and the safety measures put in place were appreciated. I would lean towards a five star review but the two things that made it less than perfect were 1) the salty potatoes and 2) the service was pretty slow while we dined. I&apos;d definitely come back to The Love. Be sure to make a reservation in advance-this place was busy!"
4,"Loved my meal during Covid. Felt safe in their outdoor houses. And warm! Those heaters work very well. For drinks I enjoyed the prickly pear margarita. YUM. For food, I shared a few beginnings with a friend: The Labor of Love cheese plate, the Buffalo cauliflower, the risotto, and a side of Brussels. The risotto was DELICIOUS. And the cheese plate could not be any prettier!"
4,"Visited The Love this past weekend for girls night. The name is so aptly fitting as the ambiance is very romantic and cozy. The service was great, super attentive and helpful with making recommendations. We tried the Ravioli, The Fried Chicken, and the Short Rib Pasta. All 3 entrees were a 10/10! For apps we shared the Kale Caesar salad, Hush puppies, and Rolls with Chive Butter. Again, all 3 apps were a 10/10! For drinks we tried the Broken Arrow and let&apos;s just say after 3 rounds of those we still couldn&apos;t get enough lol. I&apos;m only taking one star off because the restaurant wouldn&apos;t seat me until the entire party arrived and with covid that meant standing out in the cold. Other than that 9/10 would highly recommend and cannot wait to visit again soon"
4,"This review is based on a take-out order! Did Valentine&apos;s Day dinner and walked it back about 10 minutes to the hotel. Food stayed hot and was very nicely assembled to put together yourself. Ordered the harvest plate and Caesar salad for myself and both were delicious and flavorful. Harvest plate was a little soggy with all of the oil soaking into the cardboard takeout box but I would definitely order again when we go back in-person. Boyfriend had the pulled brisket fazzoletti which looked and smelled delicious and the portion was large! Finished off with the apple marzipan tea cake which I would recommend for any dessert lover, it was perfect to end the meal."
4,"We finally got the chance to visit The Love for Valentine&apos;s Day. We were stoked because we have been hearing such great reviews, and we felt that the food 100% met the expectations, but we were let down with some of the service.

Our reservations were set for 9:00PM, we arrived at 9:10 and were told they were clearing some tables &amp; should be seated soon. After 30 minutes of standing outside under a heat lamp, they decided to bring us some warmed wine. This was a nice gesture, but less than a minute after receiving this, our hostess came and told us our table was ready (so just felt like a little too late). When were seated, we actually didn&apos;t meet our server until 15 minutes later, and she just jumped right into seeing if we were ready to order. There was no introduction or offering of running through the menu. We ended up not leaving until about 11:45. Unfortunately, it was kind of uncomfortable the entire time because my wicker chair felt like it was going to collapse, it was so unstable. I think they even noticed it, and offered us an additional dessert for free. Which again, was a nice gesture, but we were already so full - it would have been more appreciated to have the 1 dessert we ordered comped or something. 

Given it is COVID, I get it - restaurants are still figuring things out, but it seems to be pretty common practice to have expectations for tables to be cleared on time and held to a time limit. If it wasn&apos;t the pandemic, I would have given them 3 stars at most. 

All of that to be said, everything we had was delicious, and I can&apos;t emphasize this enough.

Whole Grain Cast-Iron Baked &apos;Parker House Rolls&apos;   $6
This really hit the mark, from how it was presented to how it tasted. Brought out right in the cast iron pan, still warm when we got it, so the chive butter just melted for every bite. It was doughy - but still light, and perfect for cleaning that soup bowl!

Creamy Mushroom Soup    $13
Everyone is on the same truffle train right? Like, put that on anything, we have to try it. The soup was rich and creamy, and the parm &amp; sage were the perfect combo to cut some of the earthy tones from the truffle &amp; mushrooms. Excellent dish for a cold night outside. 

Ricotta Ravioli  $26
Okay - looking at the price, it seems a bit high for ravioli, but this plate was really impressive, and the portion size was fair. I rarely ever have the chance to eat a plate with saffron on it, but this was a nice floral/light note to add to a heavier dish. This pairing with the pistachio crumble &amp; chili vinaigrette made for a really complex flavor. 

Pulled Brisket Fazzoletti  $28
This dish was super. Felt like a home-cooked meal, something your mom would make. Just an amazing combination of sweet and savory in every bite. 

Apple Marzipan Tea Cake $11
The cake itself wasn&apos;t overly impressive - it was good, but didn&apos;t pack a punch or provide a memorable moment like the dishes mentioned above. The whipped creme fraiche was a nice touch. 

Bee Sweet Sundae  $11
This dessert could have easily stolen the show for me. The honeycomb toffee was amazing, and provided a yummy crunch to the ice cream. The fig &amp; lemon cake gave it some fresh notes and served as a great addition to the dish. 

So would I go back...I believe the food was good enough to definitely visit again, and just hope for a better overall experience."
5,"I came in not expecting much from this restaurant, located right in the middle of rittenhouse, I thought it would be another fancy restaurant without much flair. But boy was I wrong.

I loved all of the food they served and was totally impressed! From the entrees to the sides, there was nothing mediocre about this place. The flavors are amazing with a great ambience to match, &apos;the love&apos; is definitely a place I would recommend."
5,"Oh my god.. like seriously oh my god. The food was immaculate. Have you ever seen pieces of chicken that big on a plate before? But was it juicy, moist and tasty?! Because mine definitely was. 

We came here because my friend has been here before, it was definitely worth it the trip. Service is up there, the food was spectacular if you didn&apos;t already guess. I mean come on look at the presentation of that dessert. 

I know seeing is believing, but I think in this case tasting is even better!"
5,"What a treat this place was!! The name matches the experience perfectly. We loved everything about this place. 

Great ambiance (sat inside), nice unique cocktails (worth every penny), awesome service, and most importantly delectable food!! 

Highlights for me had to have been the spaghetti and lobster appetizer. Yup...you heard correctly. We typically don&apos;t drop $25 on an app nor would we think to order what sounds to be an entree as an app. However our waiter convinced us that this was the best thing on the menu. Oh my goodness...heaven on a plate is all I can say about this dish. It&apos;s not as heavy as we thought, perfect to share, and just exploding with amazing flavors. Well worth the $25!!

For entrees we went with the fried chicken, which seems to be one of their signature dishes; and the brisket fazzoleti. I wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the chicken or the sides (grits and collards). It wasn&apos;t what I&apos;m used to when it comes to those southern classics. Just wasn&apos;t my thing. The brisket pasta was to die for. Nice Smokey brisket, in a light cream sauce, with fresh cooked pasta. Doesn&apos;t get better than that. 

Such a memorable experience, which in my opinion is what dining is all about. You gotta be able to talk about it and remember it days, weeks, months from the time you had the experience. 

Can&apos;t wait to go back to Philly to head back!!"
5,"Another Stephen Starr gem. My friend and I got to dine inside right before indoor dining closed again. The interior is beautifully designed, it has a European feel. The lights are low, bar is cute, music is somewhat trendy.

I give 5 star reviews for food quality, great service, a nice ambiance, and consistency. You&apos;ll get that here. For some reason,  I wasn&apos;t thrilled when my friend made a dinner reservation here but I am so so happy that she did! We had the best girls night out. Everything was amazing. We talked about it days later.

So we started with drinks. I had Love Drunk which is an apple ginger mule. Got it because.. a seasonal mule. It was ok. It arrived with a lot of ice and tasted watered down. No one ever wants a watered down drink. I ordered the margarita next. It was better but nothing to write home about.

We shared the kale salad. The brioche croutons..omg and it was topped with tons of Parmesan, yum! The apples were a nice seasonal touch. We kept with the seasonal vibe throughout dinner. We also shared the ginger miso collard greens. SO GOOD. They were so cozy and different. 

I ordered the ricotta ravioli for my main, pumpkin &amp; parmesan sauce.. yes please! Thee coziest meal ever. Must order. Wow, after writing this, I realize my entire meal was vegetarian.  My friend ordered the scallops and really enjoyed it. 

The dessert menu is amazing but we were way to stuffed to order anything. Instead, our server brought out the perfect bite sized carrot cake bites."
4,"I finally visited The Love for weekend brunch and am so glad I did! We were seated right away and our server was friendly and attentive. The outdoor seating is wonderful, especially with 18th shut down for outdoor dining!

As for food, the warm cinnamon roll scones were EVERYTHING! I could eat those everyday. The frosting/icing was warm and not overly sweet. The scones were moist and tasty and the perfect size, I highly recommend! As for my meal, I opted for the Turkey avocado melt. It was tasty, but nothing special and not for me. My guest loved the chicken and waffles, though! Finally, we both opted for lattes (delicious) and each had a cocktail. 

I am not jumping to go back for the brunch food itself, but the location and service cannot be beat. I will definitely be back to try the dinner menu!"
5,"This spot offers a simple brunch menu filled with tasty choices, including several carb free and vegetarian options. My friend and I were both very satisfied with our meals and felt like the servings were generous for the price."
4,"Been here twice, once for dinner and again today for brunch. Bottom line: both times were perfectly lovely and I&apos;d come again. 

I made reservations for 2 the day before and I was seated outside per my request as soon as I arrived (well, after they took my temperature in the wrist. I didn&apos;t have to wait for my friend to arrive). In the beginning my waiter forgot that I had already given him my drink order (love drunk/their mule) but after that things went pretty smoothly. 

I ordered the scones which were warm and lovely but nothing special. I was between the chicken and waffles and the pancakes (I was avoiding the straight up egg dishes) and eventually decided on the lemon poppy pancakes with sour cherry sauce. Whew, that sauce was overpowering, it&apos;s very rare you can barely taste the lemon in a lemon dish but this was one of those times. The pancakes themselves were fluffy and had a great consistency so I enjoyed them despite. Very filling.  My friend loved her chicken and waffles. 

As for the drinks, while drinking my mule I thought to myself &quot;this is very refreshing...im barely tasting any alcohol though.... not enough ginger..&quot; But there was definitely alcohol in that bad boy, don&apos;t let them fool you. 

In general, is come back for the chill vibe sitting outside (who doesn&apos;t love people watching) and the intriguing cocktail menu (there was even a drink named after Kamala ;)"
5,"Just came back here for dinner and it did not disappoint!!! Everything we had was very good and honestly no complaints at all. One of the best meals we&apos;ve had since covid.

Labor of love cheese plate - so pretty and so much food on a plate!

Spaghetti and lobster - must have. Good amounts of lobster and very creamy and umami flavored
Brisket pasta - my fiancé loved this dish so much and I got to try a bite and it was very good

Honey roasted pork chop - super moist and tender. Not a tough bite at all. Probably because the cut was pretty fatty but it was well distributed

Gold rush dessert - great ender for the night with the creamy white chocolate cream gelatins and the raspberry sorbet. Had some good crunch/texture as well"
5,"I&apos;ve only been here twice, this is my first time post covid and everything was so good! It&apos;s very obvious that they know how to do outdoor dining because I was entirely comfortable in 40-50 degree weather. Service was very consistent and good. Our waiter was attentive and kept coming back to ask if we needed anything. The host was beyond amazing, we didn&apos;t have reservations and she made sure to accommodate us and made us feel very comfortable! I recommend the scallops I cleaned my plate and I was not even that hungry but it was just that good!"
5,"What is NOT to love about The Love? 

I have been for brunch time and time again this Fall season and am more impressed each time. 

The menu selection is extremely high quality and the ENERGY of this classy spot on a weekend day outside, under the heaters cannot be beat.

Fresh food and great service. Can&apos;t wait to go back for another round. Thanks The Love fam!"
