5,"Excellent Covid protocol, easy availability of all their packaged coffee drinks and as always excellent pastry and the best coffee anywhere"
5,"Love La Colombe coffee! As does my whole family and all my friends!

This location is conveniently located conveniently next to Rittenhouse Square. My friends and I went on a Saturday afternoon and luckily did not have to wait in line. They have a decent-sized menu of coffee and tea drinks. There is an ordering line outside, and then you go inside the shop to pay and pick up your drink. They also have a small selection of pastries inside the shop if you&apos;re hungry and need a few sweet bites to pair with your drink! Great stop for an afternoon coffee, or in my case, a chai tea latte!"
5,I needed my La Colombe fix since I&apos;m in town. This location was quick and pandemic prepared.
4,"I recognize all our nerves are frayed now. Our patience is stretched to its limits but I still expected better service then to just plop some frothed milk into my cup, push it at me and hope I step aside as quick as possible. 
I&apos;m a physician (anesthesiologist) and I think my service has gotten more empathetic. 
At least the cappuccino was good!!!"
4,"I am usually against $$ coffee, but will make an exception for La Colombe and their oatmilk draft latte. So perfectly smooth and silky, just the right hint of sweet mixed with that high quality espresso. YUM! My bf took a gamble and tried the oatmilk black and tan (cold brew + latte) and wasn&apos;t a huge fan of it, tasted more just like an iced coffee.

We most recently visited this location during the pandemic, where you place your order outside the door then pick up inside. Very efficient!"
4,"Always great coffee and service.
I personally love their iced latte with oat milk and little simple syrup. They have great croissants too!"
5,"I love coming here for the hustle and bustle and a good cup of coffee. You will have to stake out a seat at busy times, but once you have one it&apos;s a great place to pop your ear buds in and do some reading. I love the decor and the vibe. 

My favorite thing to order is the Black and Tan - cold brew with draft latte. Delicious!"
3,"Stopped by while in the city on an errand, ordered a latte and a scone. The latte was great no issues, the scone was another issue. It was a blueberry poppy seed scone with lemon icing I believe. I admit the scone was an impulse purchase and I didn&apos;t walk in to get it. The scone had a weird chewy texture, like the dough had been over kneaded. It ruined the experience. I didn&apos;t try while in the store (obvs) but I was too far away when I did try it to take it back. Otherwise the staff is really friendly and the set up for social distancing is great."
5,"AMAZING tea, coffee, and atmosphere. They definitely know what they&apos;re doing which isn&apos;t common in chains. NOT good for working, so forget about WiFi, plugs, or roomy seating. 

I&apos;d definitely come again."
5,Best coffee in Philadelphia. Nice cafe atmosphere too. Only gripe (which isn&apos;t a big deal) is in the lack of clearly displayed menu.
5,"There really aren&apos;t any cafes like this near where I live. La Colombe is always crowded and they have no wifi (I was tempted to dock them a star for this). They serve outstanding, bold, robust brewed coffee in actual coffee cups with saucers.

This is not a place where I would try to get any work done, nor would I ever schedule a meeting here. This is a place to sit, relax, and watch the world go by. In other words, La Colombe is a true cafe, the likes of which you rarely see anymore.

Merci, La Colombe."
5,"I&apos;ve been coming here for years.  I don&apos;t live in Philly anymore and stopped in while in town.  I saw a sign at the counter for oat milk draft latte.  I gave it a shot.  It was a game changer.  

So many questions rose after drinking it; 

why wasn&apos;t this invented years ago?
why have i been living my life without this?
Why Wasn&apos;t This Invented Years Ago?
How have I lived my life without this?

I now know what cruelty is and it&apos;s life without the oat milk draft latte.  

Go. Go now.  Drink Oatmilk draft latte.  Thank me later."
5,Excellent coffees from a very friendly staff. This location is always a bit crowded so finding a table during peak hours can be a challenge. Really enjoy the pour overs. Big fan of the La Colombe coffee houses and brand of coffee.
5,"Oh man, La Colombe where have you been all my life. You know when you lock eyes with someone and your souls just naturally speak to each other. That feeling of bliss and belonging happened each time the dark brew hit my lips. Ok... I exaggerate. But the coffee, pastries here are legit delish. Corsica is now on auto delivery to my home in Vegas!"
5,"I&apos;ve always been a HUGE fan of La Colombe, and it&apos;s wonderful when their new products keep getting better!

First off, if you&apos;ve never had a draft latte, go. Now. Second, if you&apos;re my mom, NO they aren&apos;t alcoholic just because &quot;draft&quot; is in the name!! They&apos;re just poured out of taps. And amazingly frothy magic because of it. 

Third, the pastries. $$$ for patries, but you won&apos;t regret it. Well, maybe your waistline will!

Fourth, draft lattes come in cans and they&apos;re fine but save them for when the real thing isn&apos;t available. 

Last. They just came out with a dairy-free on-tap draft latte made with oat milk, and now&apos;s your chance for the guilt free drink of the century."
3,"I had high expectations because this is such a known brand. I thought the environment was cool, simple menu. Felt like the customer service was underwhelming. But I came for the drink, got a simple earl great tea with oat milk. Felt just like that. Will probably find a new coffee shop next time I&apos;m here instead of coming black, happy I tried!"
4,"While I wasn&apos;t wowed by la Colombe&apos;s oak milk latte from the summer, the hot chocolate here is amazing (especially when it&apos;s cold out).  The baristas are always friendly and the interior space is a great hangout spot.  Would recommend checking this cafe out!"
5,Came here at an extremely busy time and I was very pleased how quick and efficient the service was to manage the long line of customers. I was very lucky to find a table at such a busy time. The tabletops are really beautiful!
5,"This La Colombe outpost just steps away from Rittenhouse Square is super busy, welcoming a stream of visitors almost all day long. Although the line can stretch out the door, everything moves along reasonably quickly, and the staff are super sharp and proactive.

Most people get their joe to go, which means that even on a busy weekend morning, you might be lucky enough to snag a seat at a table or at a window-side counter if you want to linger for conversation or for some reading. Just remember not to loiter *too* long if you&apos;ve already finished your drink and people could sure use a seat.

In my case, I got my oat milk black-and-tan (half oat milk draft latte, half cold brew) very quickly, and it was darn delicious. I had to resist gulping it down all at once, so savoring it slowly while banging out a few Yelp reviews on my laptop made for a nice start to a weekend morning. ;)"
4,"Excellent coffee spot near Rittenhouse Square. Perfect spot to sit at and study.

Coffee was great. Had an almond milk latte. It was $4.75 is about on or if premium coffee. More of a $$ establishment. 

They also offer a variety of pastries which are freshly made each day.  

Even though this is a local chain, it didn&apos;t have that feel to it. Seemed like a local mom and pop coffee shop. 

Very nice touch was the all you can drink sparkling water. Really awesome and unique. 

Overall this is a great spot to sit to get work done. Coffee was solid. Only knock is that the location is smaller and definitely can fill up and the price is a little more than advertised on yelp. Definitely would recommend."
