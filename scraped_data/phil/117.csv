5,"We didn&apos;t go inside the Liberty Bell to view it due to COVID abut we stayed outside and the cool part is you can see the bell from outside.

Surrounded by glass, the bell is super huge and if you want to go inside there is typically a line.

Stay for awhile and explore the are full of history. You won&apos;t be disappointed!"
5,"Must see for all Americans.

Yes they are open but number of people inside is limited due to COVID.

We got here early and waited in line probably for about 10 minutes. Line got longer as the day progressed.

A Uber driver a few days prior to visit here warned me about this place. It&apos;s free and if anyone approaches you with an offer to skip the line for $20, it&apos;s a scam. He also told me not to bring a large back pack due to security.

I came with a small purse and a camera bag. They let me bring in an opened bottles of water. They asked you to remove a jacket but a hoodie is not a jacket although I was using a hoodie as a jacket. I tried to remove my hoodie but I was told I didn&apos;t have to.

Since they are limiting the number of people inside the building, it&apos;s not crowded at all. I took time to read all the displays and learned so much about the Bell.

Also since it&apos;s not crowded, it is very easy to take a picture of the Bell without anyone in the background or anyone waiting to take pictures of the Bell."
3,"It wasn&apos;t the easiest to locate by foot and we had to reset it 3 times to find it and ended appearing to use the street markers to get us to the mall.

The line to get in is over an hour long. There&apos;s a guy on a bicycle telling us to go check out some guy that looks like smoky the bear. 

You can see the glimpse of the Liberty Bell from the window. There&apos;s a guard watching over the bell people approaching and take pictures of the famous crack. 

As we only have another hour here in the city, we can&apos;t waste our precious hour waiting in line to get inside to go look at the cracked bell. Will have to be another time when we have more time here in the city."
4,"My trip to Philadelphia was planned to see the Liberty Bell (among other tourist sites). I was excited to see it because of its historical significance; furthermore, way back when in elementary school, the Liberty Bell was a large part of Social Studies classes.

I was bummed to not be able to see it from a good angle. What I mean by that is the center was closed where people can see it from the front side where the crack is. Online it shows that it is still open for partial hours, but that was not accurate. The only way to see it was from the side through a dirty glass window. My best educated estimate would be an approximate 20&apos; distance from the window. Another point of view to see it from was from the backside, but that distance was much further than the side window.

Overall, I am still happy that I got to see the Liberty Bell. I just wish the hours online were accurate and stated the center was closed."
4,"Waiting here in Line
Winding through the maze
Almost to the door
History ablaze
Empty your pockets
Go through security hell
Hopefully you are all clear
Now you can ring the bell
(not really)

Liberty Bell, Liberty Bell
It is a Must See
Oh what fun, it is to look
at this cracked piece of History

With that being said (or sung to Jingle Bells), the Liberty Bell Center has information on lots of various things, so you can mosey through and read all of the cool things about history.  But if your like us, you are already tired of the wait so you just walk through and B-Line it to the main attraction.  It&apos;s free and you don&apos;t need tickets like Independence Hall.  It&apos;s something you should see when you&apos;re here, but you&apos;re not in Awe like the Grand Canyon, Washington Monument, or the First Ever Taco Bell."
5,"There is no admission fee or ticket needed to visit the Liberty Bell Center. This is different then if you want to visit Independence Hall just across the street. The only negative has to do with waiting outside in the line, but even that is an enough to detract from the experience. When waiting outside both when we visited and other times when we walked by there were homeless people looking for handouts amongst the tourists in line. So just keep your eye out.

There is some wonderful history as you walk into the building looking at the footprint of a home in the surrounding area in front of the Liberty Bell Center. After you go through security you&apos;re treated to a timeline in the history of the Liberty Bell. There are some very unique artifacts including a cane and jewelry made from pieces of the Liberty Bell. Seeing a timeline of its history where it has traveled during different times in our country including the Civil War.

In the final room for the Liberty Bell Center you are greeted by the bell. The view is simply stunning looking at the Liberty Bell representing freedom and in the background visible through the glass room walls is Independence Hall where this nation was born seeking freedom. Highly recommend this as a stop."
5,"Loved this exhibit! It is the perfect size with just the right amount of information about the Liberty Bell and how its icon has evolved throughout the course of history. Outside, while you wait you can see different exhibits that demonstrate how marginalized groups, like African Americans and women, fought for their rights by providing quotes said by famous activists.

I felt safe in here because they made everyone walk through a metal detector and remove their coats to put through a conveyor belt (like you would see at the airport). They start with the earliest history of the Liberty Bell right at the entrance, and lead up to the current times as you walk through. At the end, you can see the Liberty Bell with its famous crack. There are lots of staff around to help or answer questions."
3,"The last time I saw Liberty Bell was when it was outside a lot of years ago. There&apos;s a great monument about slavery right next to it. I&apos;d recommend they filter the line through that attraction. It&apos;s a great way to learn about Oney Judge, among others, along with the Liberty Bell."
4,"There is a bonus star here because seeing the Liberty Bell is free.  Located adjacent to Independence Hall, the Liberty Bell is housed in a large glass building.  During the day, you have to wait in line and go through security.  At night, you can see it from the outside lit up and personally, I find that almost a more impressive view.  Alas, the bell does not ring, but the souvenir vendors of Philadelphia have done an amazing job on creating tiny ones that do and bear a remarkable resemblance to the original."
4,"How can you not like the Liberty Bell, a symbol of American freedom?

The Liberty Bell, which was originally cast in 1752, is located inside a building known as the Liberty Bell Center which opened in October 2003. The center is located next to Independence Hall within Independence National Historical Park, a park that consists of several blocks in Center City, Philadelphia.

Admission is free. The bell is owned by the City of Philadelphia and the center is run by the National Park Service. The center is open daily, except Christmas Day, on a first-come, first-served basis. There&apos;s not much to the place. You have to go through security (metal detectors, bag inspection) to enter. Once you enter, there&apos;s a hallway with various exhibits about the bell including a 10-minute video put together by the History Channel.

Of course, the main attraction is the Liberty Bell itself which is located in a room at the end of the hallway. The bell is roped off so you can&apos;t touch it, but you can walk around it. You can view and take pictures of the bell from 360 degrees. The room the bell is located in is cool because the backdrop is Independence Hall (https://www.yelp.com/biz/independence-hall-philadelphia). Admission to Independence Hall is free too. Whoever designed this center did a great job because the backdrop is perfect; very picturesque. The bell is attended/guarded by a National Park Service ranger.

We visited the center on an ordinary Sunday around 5:40pm. There was a line to enter the building, but it moved fast. We were through security in about 5 minutes. There was a small crowd around the bell, but luckily, everyone was polite and respectful, keeping their distance and taking pictures in turn. Our entire visit at the center lasted less than 20 minutes. We could have spent more time looking at the hallway exhibits, but were hungry and wanted to get to Jim&apos;s Steaks (South Street location, about a 15-minute walk away) for a cheesesteak dinner.

The center was clean, modern, and felt safe.

We&apos;re glad we came here. This is definitely a spot worth checking out."
5,"Came here on A Friday morning so there wasn&apos;t much of a wait in line and it moved quickly. There&apos;s no admission fee and you get to read through the history of the bell before getting to it. There are no restrooms here so please be aware. However, You can cross the street to the visitor center and use the restrooms there. 

The bell weighs 2,080 pounds! And the crack on the bell they say could have happen from the clapper person hitting it to hard. They would ring the bell to honor our first president George Washington on his birthday. The bell was repaired but cracked again and so it&apos;s been placed in a museum ever since."
4,"The Liberty Bell Center is where they house the Liberty Bell.  It&apos;s a small facility in downtown Philadelphia.  Parking is limited and the city garage will cost you around $10 for an hour.  Plan to spend a little time here since the line to get in can be long.  You will have to go through a security screening and your belongings X-rayed.  The facility is maintained and run by the Park Service.  It&apos;s clean and modern inside.  The exhibit is free, and there is a nice gift shop and place to grab a quick snack as well.  It&apos;s worth checking out."
5,"This is a pretty straightforward attraction.  This is no charge for admission. There is some neat stuff and videos playing outside the facility. You first enter the facility by going through security. You then walk though exhibits that relate to the liberty bell culminating in seeing the Liberty Bell itself. There is ample metered street parking around this attraction and the facility and groups are clean and very well maintained.  It dos not take to long to go through this attraction, so I recommend doing it as part of a larger adventure, coupled with Independence Hall, the Visitors Center and maybe the Betsy Ross House for good measure. If you miss the operating hours of the facility, don&apos;t worry, you can get a good view of the liberty bell outside through a large glass. The Park Rangers that work this and the other facilities on campus, they rotate from one to the other, are so friendly and passionate about what they do.  I enjoyed seeing a part of history and there is no way you can come here and not see the Liberty Bell. That should almost be illegal.  I glad that I came here."
5,"&quot;Give me liberty, or give me death!&quot; Quite literally this was my chant as I ran between the visitors center and Indepence Hall to see Liberty Bell just before the doors closed.  See, I saw it as a kid just before it was moved to its current location and despite being in Philly plenty of times, *this* was the trip I had to be back to see the bell.  Why not add on a dose of drama with a time crunch?  The security and National Park rangers could not be more helpful as they urged me to run this way or that to get to the location.  I dashed down hallways, past buildings, over children, jaywalked streets, hopped over old ladies, and ran like an Olympian until finally, I made it!  The guards all laughed and by the skin of my teeth I saw it.  It looks the same."
4,"On the Liberty Bell, a message reads &quot;Proclaim Liberty Throughout All the Land Unto All the Inhabitants thereof&quot; which is from the bible, Leviticus chapter 25, verse 10. This bell was actually originally called the State House Bell or the Province Bell. It wasn&apos;t until the late 1830&apos;s, it was renamed the Liberty Bell during the anti slavery movement (let freedom ring!). The Liberty Bell also is a symbol of American Independence. 

The crack on the bell is from the metal being too brittle and had to remade twice (melted down and reformed). The crack is very prominent on the front side when you arrive here at the Liberty Bell Center.

It is free to view, visitors must line outside and go through a TSA like bag check. Only sealed bottled beverages are allowed. Open drinks and food will need to be discarded. There is some reading available on the history of the bell and its symbolism before heading the bell. However, because my husband and I came here 5 minutes before they closed (we caught one of the last tours at the Independence Hall across the street, which is also free to attend), we just rushed over to the bell to view it and take photos. Afterwards, we were told by one of the state employees that we were not allowed to walk back to view the boards. But according to my fellow Yelp member reviews, you are able to walk back if you come during regular hours, not so close to closing. 

Coming this late to view the bell, we were still able to get some photos that was mostly people free. But it seems like if you come around opening, you may be able to get some great people free shots of and with the bell. 

Definitely worth a visit if you are plan on doing the whole historical tourist attraction during your trip."
5,"Loved it!! So many historical sites disappoint, but the Liberty Bell wasn&apos;t one of them. Loved the simple layout of information presented on the informational placards, and thought that the video at the end does a great job summing up the Bell&apos;s significance. Loved that the lines weren&apos;t long today, and we could all take turns snapping photos."
5,Great place to go with your little ones. You are able to take pictures but don&apos;t forget to leave a donation at the end.
4,"Very important part of the history. It is located at the center of this national historic park. Admission is FREE. 

It opens at 9am, come early before the long line. I would recommend after going through the security, go straight to see the bell &amp; take pictures. Then go back to see the exhibition of it&apos;s history. It could get very crowded at the bell because so many people want to take pictures with the bell."
5,"1. Go line up outside

2. Put everything in your bag if you have one

3. No open containers!  Gotta finish your drink before you reach to the front of the line. 

4. Skip the history and go straight to the Liberty Bell.

5. Line up to take pictures. You can take pix all around, but don&apos;t forget to snap a picture with the crack in the bell

6. Go back to the history stuff before going out."

Passed through to see the Liberty Bell on our way to New Jersey.  You walk through security scanners and bags/backpacks are placed on a security scanning belt--just like the airport. And if you&apos;re like me with a belt buckle, you will set the alarm off, to take off your belt and hold your pants up as you walk through the upright security scanners. 

We did the quick self tour and just took some pictures and read some of the posted items. Walked through quickly and was able to get a picture with the bell before heading out. 

If you have the time to look at the pictures and read extensively about the history of the Liberty Bell and it&apos;s infamous crack, it&apos;s pretty interesting."
