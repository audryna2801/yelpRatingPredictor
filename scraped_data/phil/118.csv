4,"Wait staff was very attentive and knowledgeable of the menu. Food was good but seemed expensive for what it was. Partners steak was over cooked and though they offered to make it right, seemed like more effort than was worth and he enjoyed it as was. Cocktails was good and a good wine list to choose from. Covid protocols were followed and felt safe dining inside."
4,"My 40th Birthday Celebration at Del Frisco&apos;s Philadelphia was amazing. I reached out to Del&apos;s to make a reservation for my family of 4 for dinner. I was apprehensive about taking my children to an indoor restaurant, but they advised they had  appropriate COVID protocols in place. We did an early dinner at 5pm when it would be less crowded. My family arrived a few minutes early and we observed all staff was wearing appropriate PPE. We were seated quickly and the servers wore both masks and shields which made us feel comfortable. I had the signature VIP cocktail which was great. I also ordered steak topped with king crab and their famous lobster Mac and Cheese. Everyone enjoyed their meals. They even brought me a pice of cake to celebrate the occasion. I left off one star since they didn&apos;t have any candles for my cake. 
Great time at Del Frisco&apos;s."
5,"What a wonderful take out experience during this Covid Crisis. Calling in to order was breeze and the pick up process was organized and efficient. 

As I was celebrating my birthday, the meal came in handy and it was truly a fine dining experience at home. When I tell you the Sea Bass was something incredible, please take my word. Complainants to the chef for preparing the wonderful. I can&apos;t wait to be able to come in and have an in restaurant experience."
5,"First time experience and most impressed I was. This is an old bank and still has the look of it. 
They have sections for groups and little as 4 people. But the highlight I think would be having dinner in the vault itself.  It has a certain look about it that says SHE&apos;S SPECIAL. 

The prices are reasonable for a special date setting. But the food &amp; service is worth the price. 

I had the lamb chops and they were extremely good. Taste,  the portions, the meat quality were all 5 star.  The sides are enough to share with couple people. 

The service was very good. I wish I had gotten the waitresses name. She was very helpful in deciding what to try and her favorites. Her attentiveness was perfect for any first time visitors welcoming.

If you have a special occasion or want to impress a special guy/ gal. Or just want a perfectly cooked steak. You will not be disappointed in this place.  

I&apos;ll be trying this again, again and again"
2,"This restaurant seems confused by what aesthetic it&apos;s trying to portray. It has the makings of a classic steak house yet the music being played I felt more like I was at a dive bar on the other side of town. The music was played so loud we could hardly hear our poor waitress who did her best to convey the menu to us. 

Though we did enjoy our food, we couldn&apos;t help feeling like we were at a glorified casino. Add a few slot machines, and AC here we are. The evening lacked luster and elegance that I believe at one time this restaurant may have had. It&apos;s in dire need of much upgrading and a general care of the overall quality of the establishment. 

Not impressed, and if you&apos;re looking for an actual fine dinning experience. Look elsewhere!"
1,"It&apos;s tradition to go here for my birthday and although COVID put my birthday plans in jeopardy we were able to go! Unfortunately the tone of the restaurant has changed completely. 

The people:
We arrived yesterday (a Tuesday) at 7:20pm. When we walked in, we were not greeted by the 5 employees standing at the hostess stand, but asked rather curtly by one of the people, &quot;can we help you?&quot; and the question was asked almost as if we didn&apos;t belong there. My friend was already seated so we called her and found her. She expressed when she arrived with flowers and cake no one at the hostess stand offered to help bring the items in, it was as if she were bothering them. The only positive aspect was our server Michaela who was super attentive and kind.

At the end of the night at 9:50p a man who I believe is a manager comes up to the table, interrupts our conversation abruptly and says &quot;we close the doors at 10&quot; and walks away. 

I have dined numerous times since the reopening of restaurants and have never received this type of treatment and especially to receive it from a double eagle steakhouse is absurd. 

Please dine at a restaurant that actually appreciates its guests."
3,"My husband and I have heard great things about this place, so he booked dinner reservations for our anniversary. When we entered we were greeted and told it would still be a few minutes until our table was ready. We were asked if there was any special occasion and we mentioned our anniversary. After that, zero attempt to go the extra mile to acknowledge it was made. We were walked all the way to the back, up the stairs and then halfway back around to our table. 
Our server was awesome! I believe his name was Darrell. He was great with giving suggestions, answering any questions, and being attentive to our table. Also, the water guy was AMAZING! I never sat without water - ever. 
My husband and I split the seafood tower. I was VERY disappointed. We paid $57 per person and it was the weakest tower I have received at a &quot;high end restaurant.&quot; I have been to Davio&apos;s and had a MUCH better seafood tower. My husband and I also split a wedge salad. It was good, but heavy on the dressing. My husband has the special. It was 3- 4 oz. filets with 3 different toppings. I got a single filet with the blue cheese on top. It was good, but I thought the topping was a bit overcooked on it. We split the berries and cream for dessert, which was light and refreshing. 
Our drinks were good, but.... I can&apos;t understand why it took 10-15 minutes to receive at times. The espresso was excellent and went well with dessert. 
However, the major drawback to this place was how smokey it was inside. Sitting on the top level you court see the haze. It was all I could smell from the time I entered to the time I left. I smelled like the restaurant until I went back to the hotel and changed my clothes. 
Overall, food was okay, prices were a bit extreme. I could have went somewhere else with better food and pricing. I would give this place a solid 3.5. I wouldn&apos;t be opposed to going back, but not anytime soon."
1,"Ordered Christmas dinner from this restaurant through their website directly, received and email confirmation, paid in advance, drove 40 mins into downtown on Christmas to pick up and the restaurant was closed. I don&apos;t I understand how this happens with Del Frisco.... I mean, this is not Applebee&apos;s.... I definitely expected better. I need my money back for sure."
1,"Heart broken, disgusted, and deeply saddened!

With everything that happened in Philadelphia during 2020, it appears Del Frisco&apos;s Double Eagle Steakhouse has decided to fully embrace Jim Crow Era culture. 

Literally asking a group of black men with reservations to &quot;go to the bathroom and change if you want to eat here.&quot; Not to mention, it was my 36th birthday.

Still, America has taught the world one thing.. YOU CAN NOT STOP BLACK PEOPLE FROM SHINING! Shoutout to Alexander at Butcher and Singer. Hope you enjoyed the Tip we left!"
3,"I came to Del Frisco&apos;s with some of my coworkers for a nicer lunch during Restaurant Week. The special menu consisted of three courses: soup/salad, entree &amp; dessert. 

I started off with the house salad, which was a bed of spring mix with carrots and bleu cheese crumbles in a balsamic vinaigrette. For the entree, I had the salmon cooked medium in a lemon butter sauce. It was an appropriate portion for lunch and didn&apos;t leave me feeling overly full. I ended with the chocolate mousse, which came in a cute, chocolate cup and was topped with whipped cream. 

Overall, the meal was good. However, for the usual price of the menu items, I was expecting something a little more elevated. It really didn&apos;t seem to wow me.

Two things worth mentioning:

1) I did not try the filet, which would probably support the argument for the cost of the meal. After all, this place is a STEAKhouse. I am sure the filet is premium quality (a few of my coworkers ordered it and it both looked and smelled very good). 

2) The sesame seed bread, which came a-plenty(seriously, I think we each had a loaf to ourselves), was warm and freshly baked. I would give this place a 5/5 just for the bread alone. It is the perfect type for dipping in left over sauces (or steak juices). 

Would I come to Del Frisco&apos;s again? Probably not of my own accord. It was an experience that I was grateful for, but it&apos;s not worth the price for someone who is not a steak person."
4,"Del Frisco&apos;s Double Eagle Steakhouse is just simply great. The menu items were flavorful and yummy and the price point was also very good. I was told to try their Filet Mignon, which was amazing, but all other menu items were great too. Staff is super helpful and will help you with anything. But try Del Frisco&apos;s Double Eagle Steakhouse for yourself and you decide."
5,"Great staff, incredible food and atmosphere. The view upon entry takes your breath away, with a tasteful list of food and drinks to choose from. Highly recommend."
1,"This place sucks it should close it s doors. 
I get better food from the Acme and I&apos;m not kidding. I want to say more but it&apos;s not worth my time."
4,"Holidays tend to call for a surplus of money which means time to splurge on a higher end meal. At the same time, my debit card offered a 10% cash back for Del Frisco&apos;s Double Eagle so it was destiny. 

We went for a lunch which is lighter on the pockets, however we balled out. The day after Christmas did not bring in much of a crowd so there were few tables, low noise and we were able to just soak in the environment of the building&apos;s architecture. 

Our server, Marco, promptly greeted us and took our drink order. The VIP cocktail was fantastic as they let the vodka soak infuse the pineapple flavor over the course of a few days. Throughout the meal, the cocktail glass was replaced for a colder one. Great service by Marco throughout!

We started off with the Cheesesteak Dumplings. The dumplings crust were crisp and the inside was juicy. The spicy ketchup was a nice touch. Solid overall. 

The main course was (obviously) steak paired with two sides. We ordered the 12 oz Filet Mignon and 12 oz Prime Strip with the lobster mac &amp; cheese and brussels sprouts.  Marco and the other staff member portioned out the sides with our steaks at the table. The steaks were nicely seasoned with a great sear around the edge. The flavor was good, but personally thought Barclay Prime was juicier and seasoned better. Mac&amp;Cheese was some of the best I&apos;ve had - creamy and packed with flavor. Brussel sprouts were perfectly charred and added flavor from the bacon and lemon. Overall, solid entrees and sides. 

For dessert, we ordered both the Lemon Cake and the warm Banana Bread Pudding. My favorite of the two was the Lemon Cake - it is a culmination of 6 layers of cake with lemon buttercream and lemon glaze. Although delicious, I would have preferred a stronger lemon taste to really hit the lemon craving. As for the banana bread pudding, it was lackluster in flavor and barely considered warm - would not order again. 

Overall, Del Frisco&apos;s Double Eagle Steakhouse offers delicious options and their steak is one of the best in the city. Service was great and drinks were good. Great for a date night or, if you&apos;re looking to save a few dollars, lunch is a good option. Would go again."
5,"Dinner was absolutely delicious!!! My boyfriend and I celebrated Valentine&apos;s Day a little early and our server was Michaela. She was very attentive and gave great suggestions for cocktails, apps, entrees and desserts! Definitely recommend for any occasion! We will definitely be back!"
4,"Came here for dinner. Really nice building the restaurant is located in but sort of crammed seating. Waiters were excellent throughout the night. For appetizers we started with Shanghai calamari, the cheese steak dumplings and the tuna tartare. All 3 were excellent. I think my favorite was the calamari but I&apos;m biased since I love calamari :p it had a tiny bit of sweet and spicy taste to the sauce. The biggest surprise was the dumplings. They were surprisingly tasty and the spicy ketchup worked well! Tuna tartare was pretty typical and my least fav of the three.

For entree I had the 45 days dry aged ribeye. I asked for medium rare and they did a good job cooking it. Portion was great and the steak was tasty although not sure if worth price tag other than the portion. Definitely had better steaks. We order as a side lobster Mac n cheese, spinach and onion rings. Onion rings were just large onion rings lol not worth the price. Mac and cheese and spinach were tasty and would recommend!"
4,The server and food was amazing. The only reason I&apos;m giving it 4 stars was because it seemed very smoky and fogy inside the restaurant.
3,Everything was great once we got past the hostess table. I hate that this is such a great restaurant but they need better hostess and also when people call to make reservations the dress code should be stressed.
5,"I just love it here! That&apos;s just sums up my review :) 

The restaurant itself is big and beautiful; it was a bank before. 
The VIP drink (pineapple martini) is my favorite. It&apos;s so good, I haven&apos;t tried anything else. We has a party of 8. We started at the bar and were seated around 6:30 which our reservation was made for. 
I ordered a prime rib (as most of the group ordered steak) and one other person ordered fish. Everything came out perfect, food was delicious and service was phenomenal. 
For dessert, I shared the crunch bar that was also delicious. 
I am hoping one day I can sit in the Vault Room."
4,"Restaurant week can be such a hit or miss experience. I joined friends for a restaurant week lunch here and was very impressed. The space is a wow factor from the second you enter with high ceilings, large columns, and other architectural details. We were seated in the middle of the dining room.

I don&apos;t eat beef, so I was the only one from my group who didn&apos;t order steak. For the restaurant week menu I chose the lobster bisque, chicken piccata, and the chocolate mousse. Bread was served to start. It was nothing special. The lobster bisque was nice and creamy and quiet enjoyable. However, it paled in comparison to some I&apos;ve has in other upscale steakhouse chains inn the city. It was missing something to give it that extra oomph and the lobster amount was very tiny. The chicken piccata was delicious!  The chicken was incredibly tender and the sauce was flavorful, but not too rich. I would have liked the light breading to have been a little more browned in a perfect world, but for restaurant week prices, it was fine. The chocolate mousse was rich and decadent, but not too sweet. 

Our water glasses  were never empty and the courses glided from one to the next. The food is good, but won&apos;t  blow you away. The stand outs here are the service and atmosphere. I&apos;d like to go back outside of restaurant week and have some cocktails and bites at the bar."
