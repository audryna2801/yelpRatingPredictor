5,"Came here during COVID and was seated in the heated back patio. It was very cozy and welcoming while still following proper social distancing guidelines. Special shoutout to our waittress who was so kind and attentive. She gave us great advice on what to order and didn&apos;t rush us (despite the fact that there is a 90 minute limit on reservations).

For the food we started with the guacamole sampler which provided all 3 of their special guacs. I really enjoyed the one with cheese and corn. For the food, we got the baja fish tacos and the grilled mahi mahi tacos. You can get 2 or 3 depending how hungry you are. For drinks, they have a great extensive selection of margaritas. I tried one of their seasonal specials - the pear - and I was pleasantly surprised by the spices and nuance in the drink.

Overall, I had a lovely evening at la Calaca Feliz. They did a great job adjusting to COVID guidelines while keeping the experience intimate and the food/drinks great. Would definitely come back!"
5,"It&apos;s been a minute since my last visit to La Calaca Feliz. My husband happened to be in the neighborhood and I was jonesing for tacos so he suggested takeout from La Calaca. Excellent choice! 

We ordered the shrimp tacos, blackened mahi mahi tacos and a side of refried beans all to share. I had some leftover guac and chips at home; otherwise, we probably would have ordered another side or app. 

The tacos were absolutely delicious. There were two flour tacos in the mahi order and three, smaller corn tacos in the shrimp order. Both had entirely different toppings, which I loved. I think the shrimp tacos had a slight edge for my favorite but the mahi was great as well. The beans were solid, too. 

Glad we revisited La Calaca Feliz and I&apos;ll be thinking of them for takeout more often in the future!"
5,"You can&apos;t beat $6 margaritas and $8 nachos on the happy hour menu!!  We came here tonight for happy hour &amp; dinner and was very impressed! It was our first time dinning indoors since COVID and we felt very safe, our temperatures were checked at the door and the tables were socially distanced. The happy hour nachos were a decent size with a ton of toppings and good crispy chips.  For dinner we got the enchiladas.  We were sad our waitress said they stopped serving their green chile enchilada sauce but we were still very happy with what we got.  If your near Fairmont and want more authentic Mexican, this is the place to go!"
5,"Quick COVID update: La Calaca appears to have adapted its menu to incorporate more &quot;takeout-friendly&quot; options, including burritos and bowls. Back in the summer, my husband and I loved sitting out on La Calaca&apos;s socially-distanced back porch, and now that the weather is cold, we are happy to order comforting takeout food that travels well and still tastes great at home. We&apos;ve also ordered to-go margaritas more than once during the pandemic, and no matter how bleak things are in the world at any given point, those margaritas have always made things seem just a tiny bit more tolerable!"
3,"I live in the neighborhood so have been here a bunch of times and I love their Three chilli margarita so much that I get it every single time. In fact, we started getting a carafe of it instead of a single serving. 

I went back here after 6 months yesterday and ordered the carafe again. It did not taste like their three chilli margarita at all. They always always used to put chilli rings in the glass or carafe, this time there was no hint of chilli in the carafe - I couldn&apos;t see or taste any. It tasted like classic margarita. And it was LOADED with ice - barely any margarita in there. 

They also served us glasses without the spicy rim which has never happened before. I suspect our favorite bartender wasn&apos;t around that particular day. Posting a before and after picture of the three chilli margarita carafe."
4,"Recently went here for the first time. The staff were so friendly, my servers name (I believe it was Marvin) was enthusiastic and helpful. The restaurant was clean. There was a back patio with a plastic cover and heaters. The tables were very far apart, making me feel safe about dining. I had the seasonal cocktail which was a blackberry margarita, it was amazing! I also split the guacamole, it was okay. Lastly I had the shrimp tacos which had a very nice remoulade sauce. I am looking forward to going back."
4,"As a resident of Fairmount, La Calaca Feliz is a top place to go. When you walk in you&apos;re welcomed by a bar, then are taken to the back where there is indoor seating and outdoor seating in the back garden. As for COVID guidelines they are doing great - tables are far away and you feel safe. First, the Tropical Margarita is amazing! Not too sweet and a good amount of added flavor from the different fruits. The Chicken Nachos were cheesy and had a lot of extras on it (peppers, onions, beans, sour cream) that made it taste more gourmet than usual. For entree had the Shrimp Tacos with corn slaw that was creamy and added just the right about of taste for the grilled shrimp. Go &amp; try this place out for sure!"
5,"I got delivery from La Calaca Feliz and it was delicious! I ordered the Mushroom Burrito Bowl (mushrooms, truffle potato puree, asparagus, and a lemon vinaigrette over rice and black beans with queso mixto). The truffle potato puree was incredible - so soft and rich. 

We already had drinks at home, but I had my eye on the to-go margaritas! I also really want to try the sweet plantains and esquites guacamole, so I guess I&apos;ll have to get another takeout/delivery order soon!"
4,"Amazing food and service. Very creative Mexican cuisine. This is not your standard Mexican. Short rib nachos and black bass special truly magnificent. Service also great. Only reason 4 stars instead of 5 was it just seemed the back patio was a tiny bit dirty/ shabby. 

We had to give a credit card to book on open table. 

I would definitely go back."
4,"I can&apos;t believe I didn&apos;t review this place sooner. My first visit was on July 6th, but I have been back 3-4 times since then. Clearly, this has become my Philly go to place for Mexican cuisine. The servers are GREAT. They are personable and attentative at a time where restaurants are struggling. 

Now, I must move on to the food and drinks. The Tropical Margarita pitcher is my FAV. However, I did try the white sangria last night and it was soooo GOOD!! 

My go to app is the tradional guacamole. It&apos;s fresh and you can taste a hint of cilantro &amp; lime. It&apos;s a great starter. 

Now, let&apos;s talk about the tacos. I don&apos;t have any favorite tacos bc they are all great. I tried the baja fish tacos, shrimp tacos, steak (goes by a different name), and shrimp tacos. My husband tried two specials, one that consisted of brisket tacos and the other was a shrimp bowl. I will say the brisket taco was AMAZING!!!!!! It was smokey, tender, juicy and full of flavor. I didn&apos;t try his shrimp bowl. 

La Calaca is a solid staple in the neighborhood, so I will return to La Calaca again and again."
5,"Even though I have always liked it here, this has become my favorite place to come during the covid era. Very distanced and clean inside and out and patio is wonderful. I loved coming here during the summer because it was quiet and distanced but for winter it&apos;s the same plus WARM, seriously I could take my coat off their tent is so warm. Drinks here are fantastic and happy hour is really a great deal. While I love the food I would suggest sticking with their classics, the carnitas here is honestly to die for but the bbq cauliflower is just okay."
4,"Really great food here. The dining area is on the smaller side but I love everything about La Calaca. A reservation is essential on the weekends and seats at the bar are hard to come by.

Tonight I had the carnitas tacos and they were way better than I expected. Kind of disappointing they don&apos;t come with sides, but the rice and beans is cheap enough to average out a decently priced meal. 

I also wish the gave out complementary chips.

Yet this is still one of the best Mexican restaurants I&apos;ve been to on the east coast and always really enjoy a great experience here nonetheless."
3,"Came here for brunch. We were seated without reservations which was super nice but their seating arrangements didn&apos;t feel 6 feet apart and when we asked if we could sit a little further from a table, they said that it hadn&apos;t been wiped down yet. I got the breakfast burrito without bacon, it was pretty good but got boring after eating a 1/3 of it. My friend got the avocado toast and found it got soggy fast. We also got a die of tater tots even though it&apos;s not technically on the menu which was greeaaat. The service was slow but I don&apos;t wanna fault the workers in a pandemic. It seemed like it was understaffed at the time but we went the whole meal without a refill on water. I would like to come back for happy hour and experience their drinks but I&apos;d pass on the brunch menu."
3,"Following my 5th visit Monday 12/30/19, I, unfortunately, find the need to downgrade my review.

I have no idea what the heck happened on this repeat visit but the restaurant stars were not aligned.  Nearly every aspect ran afoul.  Is it because it&apos;s a Monday and many restaurants close after the weekend?  Were they grossly understaffed?  Maybe on each.

Here is our experience as concise as I can be, which is not as easy as I enjoy writing strong reviews.

We did have a reservation and were shown to our table, however, not their fault, but we were stuck next to a super loud talker with no inside voice filter, so that started the snowball running downhill.  Julian our server for the evening came by, asked what type of water we might like and about drink orders.  Okay, usual start.  Next, he rattled through the dinner special which I had to ask for him to repeat next time he stopped by.  We started with an order of carnitas which was good, however, while the appetizer literally just hit the table, our entrees, which I&apos;ll get to shortly, followed immediately.  Huh?  I told the server to bring them back to the kitchen, no way were we rushing through dinner, especially as the place was mostly empty at 6 pm and I asked for our server.  Julian came over and honestly, I felt his excuse was a rehearsed repeat line.  (Reasoning will be evident in my closing). 

I told him we don&apos;t want to be rushed, it was happy hour and we just received what ended up being our only round (again, I&apos;ll speak to this shortly as well.)  He half-witted apologized, which meant out plates either was sitting cold or under heat lamps.

We enjoyed the carnitas but asked if chips and salsa came to the table, he said, &quot;no we don&apos;t automatically bring, only when asked&quot;; so we asked.  However, we would later learn that we were to be charged; that is okay if Julian would have told us that.  So that was another ding.

As for our entrees, I ordered the special grilled fish tacos (you may recall that was the special he had to repeat at a slower cadence to understand) and my wife ordered the seafood enchilada.  I enjoyed my dish but my wife&apos;s dish was like &quot;where is the seafood&quot; (a throwback to the old Wendys &quot;where&apos;s the beef&quot; campaign, it was loaded with vegetables not shrimp and crab so she returned that dish for the chicken enchiladas and a side of rice and black beans.  It was a nice tasting dish, a safe staple.

Never once did the bus person or Julian come by to refill our water glasses, we clearly saw other tables being refilled.  On one of Julian&apos;s return check-in runs, I ordered a second margarita (happy hour), the drink was never brought to the table.  I brought it to his attention and said, &quot;since we are finished, I think I&apos;ll want that drink that never came.&quot;  Again, a half-baked apology.   It would have been nice to have it as we were enjoying our meal before a concert, so I was looking forward to the 2nd drink.  Oh well, maybe for the best.

Lastly, we asked for our check, and when Julian brought it over he said he removed the shrimp and crab enchilada, sort of like he was doing us a favor. Perhaps taking off my wife&apos;s replacement dish would have been a nice gesture, but not required.  Remember, we returned that seafood dish, so yeah, no charge for that dish.  When I walked over to him he stumbled trying to say he meant to take the replacement off the check too, but clearly did not.  Did our server think I was a moron and wouldn&apos;t notice that we were charged for what we ate?  Only then did he remove it.

Again, I go back to the start, was it due to Monday night?  Understaffed?  Unhappy employee?  Not sure.  We will need to pause coming back and explore other great eateries around Philly. 

The dishes we did eat were enjoyable, tasty, fresh and flavorful.  See our pictures.  

In closing, be mindful that anything can happen but the server or manager should be honest and upfront and most of all sound sincere."
3,"I want to love it here, but leave feeling like the mark has been missed every time. The dining room is loud. I&apos;m not sure if it&apos;s the acoustics or close tables, but it&apos;s hard to have a conversation or hear the waitress. We sat in the dining room near the door to the patio. The door was left open every time a server or customer walked in/out. It was less than ideal on a 90 degree day. 

We started with the traditional guacamole which was very good. It was a large starter for 2 people. I ordered the baja fish tacos. The fish was yummy. There was a bit too much cabbage slaw for my liking, but the flavors all meshed very well together. My boyfriend ordered the short rib tacos and he really enjoyed them. My one wish is that there wasn&apos;t a side with the taco entrees. 

2 beers, guacamole and 2 taco dishes was $55. The food was good, but on the pricier side in my opinion. We will keep this as a happy hour spot, but likely not return for dinner."
4,"THE. NACHOS. WERE. SO. GOOD. 

I ordered the fish tacos which were very good too! 

Great ambience, good customer service, and food was fresh and delicious! 

Will definitely be returning here to try out more of their menu items."
5,Dinner was excellent! You have to try their Bacon &amp; Fig Guac!  The fish taco was good and had a great crunch.
4,"Visited this place the night prior to Cinco De Mayo since we knew the actual day would have crappy weather. So glad we stumbled upon this place! One of the best Mexican restaurants we&apos;ve visited thus far! 

This place is located in a nice neighborhood. Just blocks away from the art museum. 

As we entered, I asked for outdoor seating because I saw seats outside in the front. I was confused since the hostess led us to the back, but it ended up being a nice surprise. It was way better than the outdoor seating in the front! First off, they have beautiful lights hanging above the outdoor tables and it set a nice romantic date night vibe.

The inside of the restaurant is also really cool, with nice painted murals.

We got elote to start off with. Amazing flavor, 5/5! Tropical margaritas to drink, which were addicting to say the least. I got the chicken tacos and my boyfriend got the baha fish tacos. My tacos were okay; 3/5. However... my boyfriends baha fish tacos were astounding! The fish was so crispy and I loved the sauces it came with. The portion was pretty nice too. 

This is definitely gonna be one of our new most frequented date night places. Can&apos;t wait to come back!

The only thing I would change about this place is that I wish they had more on the menu."
2,"The food was AMAZING! We ordered the Tuna Ceviche mini tacos, guacamole sampler, and Korean BBQ and Carnitas tacos.

I&apos;m giving it 2 stars because the Manager made us uncomfortable. When we got there the hostess told us it would be a 45 minute wait because there were folks there that were taking a long time to leave. We still put our name down and while we were deciding on other places to go, the Manager came to us and said we could be seated but they&apos;d need the table back in an hour...... wtf ? I&apos;ve never been told that at a restaurant. When we get seated there were PLENTY of tables in the main dining area and the heated patio. We were seated next to a table that seemed to be nursing their margaritas. Every 30 mins I&apos;d see the Manager out of the corner of my eye. I don&apos;t want to make this a race thing but I wonder how many other customers were told they could only be seated for an hour.

The food was really good but I&apos;m not sure if I feel comfortable going there."
1,"Hate to do this, but I asked for guac in a burrito 5 times and never got it. The sixth time, some of the burrito was slightly tinted green, but there was clearly no meaningful amount of guac in it. How hard is this? Only reason I kept going is because it&apos;s the only burrito place near me. Not going again unless I get a freebee at the very least."
