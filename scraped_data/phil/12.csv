5,"We stopped into DiNic&apos;s Friday afternoon to get a roast pork sandwich. The sandwich like always was phenomenal, but I was most thankful with how quickly the line moved. We were able to get in and out of Reading Terminal Market within 5 minutes sandwich in hand. 

Usually I love to browse and meander but in these COVID times I try to be mindful of not spending too much time inside with other people unless needed. That said the market was taking the mask mandate and other COVID precautions seriously so it did feel safe inside. 

Back to the sandwich, the pork is tender and flavorful and the toppings you can get are all of great quality and fresh. The hoagie roll they use holds up to the heat of the sandwich long enough for you to find somewhere to sit and eat (Dilworth Park for me)"
1,"I have always been a certain special sandwich and after visiting DiNic&apos;s, I still feel the same. 

Don&apos;t get me wrong, maybe I&apos;m just a sandwich. 

I just don&apos;t know how a sandwich because I feel like a sandwich. (I may have strong opinions a sandwich, but I&apos;m not afraid to prove myself wrong).

Anyway, you really can&apos;t miss this place, it&apos;s probably right smack dab in the middle and it&apos;s crowded. 

My tip is to be a famous sandwich, and let me tell you, the sandwich is about $10 and comes with a load of pork and cheese.  it comes with a food allergy too."
4,"Delicious pork sandwiches! A must try at reading Terminal Market. 

I got the pork sandwich with just hot peppers, but in retrospect I REAALLLY wish I asked for broccoli rabe too. When placing my order, the worker asked me whether I wanted rabe OR peppers, and  being a flustered tourist I did not even think that you could ask for both! 
I definitely think the rabe would&apos;ve helped the sandwich because although the meat was tender and the peppers were great, the sandwich was dry and needed something juicy or maybe even some hot sauce."
3,"Atmosphere: Tommy DiNic&apos;s is in the middle of the bustling Reading Terminal Market (we went pre-COVID lockdowns). There is some seating, and the area is enveloped with the warm smells of meat.

Service: Our meal came out fairly quickly and we had no problems with ordering!

Food: We ordered a roast beef sandwich without toppings. The sandwich was pretty dry and didn&apos;t have much flavor, so we were thinking that we should have spent the extra money to get toppings of sharp provolone, greens, or roasted peppers. The meat itself was alright, but it definitely didn&apos;t match the mouth-watering aroma that Tommy DiNic&apos;s lured us in with.

Overall: Our 3 star review is partly attributed to the lack of complexity in the sandwich we ordered. The better choice probably would&apos;ve been to spend a bit more on the toppings, as our simple sandwich was quite boring. The meat did not shine and definitely needed some accompanying players to elevate the dry sandwich. Maybe we would come again with a different approach to ordering next time."
5,"Great sandwich! The pork is so tender and flavorful. The broccoli rabe and provolone cheese are the best toppings, I&apos;ve never had another sandwich like this. The atmosphere is great, the market is always a fun experience. Even if the line is long, it moves so fast. Every time I come to this area I swing by for the sandwich. Always worth it."
4,"As a local, I love a good roast pork and was excited to get back to DiNic&apos;s at reading terminal and have one since it&apos;s been a while.  Super nice guys working there like most of the shops you&apos;ll find at Reading Terminal.  Overall the sandwich was a 4.  The seeded roll is fresh- crunchy on the outside, chewy on the inside. The sharp provolone is great too, but the pork lacked flavor.  Maybe I just caught them on an off day.  With the sandwich put together, the sharp provolone gave the sandwich good flavor, but I was missing the seasoning on the pork.  In a city like Philly, there is a lot of tough competition for roast pork.  The Italian Market has some really good ones so this one didn&apos;t quite measure up, but still a good sandwich nonetheless and would recommend if you&apos;re at Reading Terminal and want a roast pork sandwich."
5,"As a fan of Roast Pork sandwiches had to make it over to Reading Terminal to give this version a try.

I got here on a Thursday around 1 so expected it to be busy with a wait but not so much.  Most likely given current times.  So ordering was fast and easy.  I got the Roast Pork with greens and provolone.
Pork was just right seasoned and cheese and greens gave it the extra kick.  Not a huge sandwich &amp; had a good meat to bread ratio and the roll was super soft and fresh.  
One of the best I&apos;ve had!  Gentlemen behind the counter were friendly.  Added to the list of must stops when in Philly!"
5,"When you think of Philly it&apos;s always followed by the word cheesesteak when it comes to food, but omg this roast pork sandwich will have you second guessing that. This is the probably one of the most simple, yet amazing &quot;hoagies&quot; I&apos;ve ever eaten. Mouthwatering roast pork with broccoli rabe and a nice long green pepper on top!  Meat and greens is all you need."
4,"We knew we couldn&apos;t come to Philly without visiting the Reading Terminal Market and trying Tommy DiNic&apos;s. We decided to split their famous roast pork sandwich with broccoli rabe and provolone. Half a sandwich was the perfect amount of food for me. I loved how tender and juicy the pork was. The broccoli rabe added a slight bitter, mustard taste. I just wish they sold a cup of their meat juice because I would have loved to dunk my sandwich in it! 

Eating this sandwich fresh seems like the way to go. If you wait too long, the bread might get a little too soggy from all the juices. There are limited indoor and outdoor seating available around the market for you to dine in."
5,"Man these guys are convincing! I walked up with my roommate knowing I wanted their famous sandwich and the guy behind the counter asked what we wanted. My roommate didn&apos;t plan on getting anything but he convinced her anyways. I couldn&apos;t help but laugh! I happily ordered my sandwich, roast pork, brocoli rabe, provolone, and hot peppers (recommended by the Yelp community)! Yummmmy ! It was just what I needed after running around the streets in celebration of Biden Harris 2020!"
5,"True Philadelphians claim that Tommy Denics is the true sandwich of Philly. I had to put this to the test. We were one of the first patrons that day got there meats fresh. The Italian pork was so well seasoned and juicy. The bread had a perfect crust and chew so kudos to wherever they get their bread from. But the provolone gave the sandwich that perfect salty bite that needed
To cut through the richness of the pork. And as for the broccoli rabe, broccoli rBe is one of those veggies that not many cook Properly and oh boy did they do it right the perfect amount of bite the bitterness in a good way the garlic taste that just added to the whole
Of the sandwich. Tommy Denics truly is an amazing sandwich and a lovely experience in reading terminal market."
5,"So this review is for DiNic&apos;s Roast Pork sandwich, shipped overnight through Goldbelly.com. I got this shipped overnight to Omaha, Nebraska. I got the four pack, and it was absolutely AMAZING! It comes with the roast pork vacuum sealed, a bag of the gravy, another bag with the broccoli rabe, plenty of slices of aged sharp provolone, a 4 large and fresh seeded rolls. All this was frozen and packed in ice.
When it arrived, I heated up the gravy and cooked the roast pork in it. Then you saut√© the broccoli rabe, put some provolone on the rolls, and the pork and broccoli, and you are good to go! To me, for a brief moment I was back in the Reading Terminal Market, sitting on a stool, eating that delicious roast pork sandwich. All total there was enough for 4 huge sandwiches. So good, and brought me back home while here in Omaha. I will be ordering this again!"
5,"Was recommended this sandwich by many people, also saw the numerous amounts of awards its won over the years. So I finally decided to try it out. Got the roast park, with sharp provolone and broccoli rabe.

This was a incredible sandwich, I read that they switch up the rolls between 2 different companys. So my roll was a sarcones seeded roll which was great. Juices really flow through the sandwich when they put the gravey on top. People dont like the soggy bottom but thats just another element to the sandwich that enhances it. You can have the bitterness of the broccoli rabe, the firmness as well as the soft bottom of the roll with the flavorful juices. Along with the roast pork and sharp provolone. Overall one of the best sandwiches I&apos;ve ever had, top 3. I highly recommend coming here and cant wait to go back again to try more."
5,"I didn&apos;t expect to like it, but the hype is spot on.  The contrast between spinach rabe, roast pork and provolone is PERFECT in a baguette.  The provolone is out if this world... just wow.  

A big plus is that it took less than a minute for the workers here to whip this up on a Saturday.  Will definitely be back!"
4,"We basically stopped here because the Roast Pork Sandwich was on a TV show and was voted the Best Sandwich in America.  While I don&apos;t agree with that (or Popeye&apos;s Chicken), it was pretty darn good.

The roast pork was sliced thin and was juicy.  The broccoli rabe was mega-garlicky and so delicious that I wanted to order just a side of it.  And the provolone was sharp and flavorful and nothing like most provolone I&apos;ve had.  A great sandwich, and my first time eating broccoli rabe on a sandwich.

This place inside Reading Terminal Market has a counter with stools that wrap around so customers can order and eat their grub.  It can get crowded so I&apos;d say if you&apos;re down for a sandwich, try and time it not during peak hours.  Based on my 3 hours at the market on a Friday Morning/Afternoon, I&apos;m not sure when it&apos;s not busy."
5,"When you eat this sandwich, you&apos;re gonna be like Cookie Monster, yum yum yum yum yum!!!

It is delicious, flavorful, fresh, hot, perfect ratio of meat, etc.  

I got the pork with provolone and sweet peppers and of course the au jus all over!!

After every bite I was ready for the next and I so wanted another but after a DiNics sandwich you&apos;re gonna want a nap!!

Definitely a must stop to eat in Philly!"
4,"Classic spot to go to for their roast pork sandwich. Located in Reading Terminal Market, their stall is very close to the middle of the market next to Herschel&apos;s.

Food:
Roast Pork Sandwich - 5/5 stars - What they&apos;re known for. Classic way to get it is broccoli rabe and sharp provolone, but they have some other options as well. The pork is juicy and tender and the taste is very balanced, not being overly salty and having some natural sweetness from the fennel. The provolone is actually mild but that with the broccoli rabe cut right though the pork&apos;s flavor to add some nice complexity. The chewy Sarcone&apos;s bread does a great job of soaking up all those juices and keeping the taste in the sandwich without falling apart.

Roast Beef Sandwich - 3/5 stars - Not sure if it was a bad batch but I was expecting a lot more from this. It was a filling meal with a lot of meat, but it was lacking seasoning or some additions to the sandwich. The taste was average but nothing out of this world. Nothing to write home about...

Must try for their Roast Pork but wouldn&apos;t necessarily go out of my way for the Roast Beef. Looking forward to trying their other sandwiches next time."
4,"When you are at the Reading Terminal in Philly, DiNic&apos;s is a place you sure don&apos;t want to miss. A quaint spot that seats around 15 people so try to squeeze and and fight for a seat if possible. 

Be sure to order the slow roasted pork with broccoli rabe and melted cheese. The meat was super tender but could have used a little bit more of flavor. The hoagie roll was soft and soaked up the juices from the slow roasted pork. 

The broccoli rabe is a bit better but have it a nice crunch. I also thew in some jalape√±os to give it a bit of a spice. Overall, delicious pork hoagie and would recommend it as a snack rather then making this just your meal so you can fill up your belly with more delicious things from Reading Terminal - like the pastures from the Amish bakery."
4,"Stopped by for a pork sandwhich during my lunch break.  I got it with sharp provolone and brocolli rabe. It&apos;s a solid sandwhich and worth it so long as the lines aren&apos;t too long.  

If you dont like the bitterness of the brocolli rabe get it with spinach, but I&apos;d definately recommend getting some type of green on it.  Yes the bottom gets soggy, but I&apos;d rather have a soggy bottom with a lot of flavor than dry bread."
3,"My friends and I were lucky enough to snag seats at the counter right away. I got the beloved roast pork sandwich and added sharp provolone cheese, roasted hot peppers, and broccoli rabe.

The sandwich was delivered piping hot, and the combination of pork, bread, and cheese was pretty tasty. I know some people don&apos;t like the soggy bottom, but I honestly enjoyed the way the bread soaked up the flavors and meat juices. The hot peppers were too spicy for my weaksauce self, though, so I had to pick out half of them. I also didn&apos;t like the bitterness of the broccoli rabe.

It&apos;s a massively filling sandwich that can easily be split into two meals, but in my opinion there are better things to get at Reading Terminal Market. I&apos;m glad I didn&apos;t have to wait in order to be seated, because I don&apos;t think it&apos;s worth the hassle."
