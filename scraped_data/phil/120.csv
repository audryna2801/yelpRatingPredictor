5,"You know it was a mind-blowing sandwich when you&apos;re thinking about it in the middle of the night. I didn&apos;t have the chance to visit this place again due to COVID19, but I can&apos;t stop thinking about their sandwiches. I still remember the bite like yesterday. It was that good.

I got the Whole Pig Banh Mi. They used a French baguette over a Vietnamese baguette, but that made the texture even more interesting. In fact, the French baguette made the initial bite crispy and then the meat would melt in your mouth. To be honest, I&apos;m surprised a non-Asian joint got the flavors right.

I love how they pack the sandwiches with visibly fresh ingredients, so you&apos;re getting your moneys worth and it fills your soul.

I can&apos;t wait to go back once I have the chance and try their other heavenly sandwiches."
5,"Small business sandwich joint close to CCP and Masterman! Honestly, it was hard to find and you can miss it very easily because it looks like it&apos;s part of an apartment. Currently limiting people and practically can only pick up the food behind a table due to COVID. Otherwise, the sandwiches here are very good! They have a daily special, which is pretty awesome, giving you a new sandwich pretty much almost every day. You can find out what that sandwich is through their instagram. Otherwise, very solid choices on a daily basis. Their fried potatoes are also a great side to your sandwichl it&apos;s fried pretty perfectly! I definitely recommend this place as a staple for lunch if you&apos;re in the area and want to order out!"
5,"Stockyard creates art for your taste buds. This little shop has a lot going on in the best ways possible. I&apos;ve enjoyed their soup and grilled cheese combo during the winter and am constantly impressed by their daily specials available for take out during quarantine. Their grilled cheese is a super slim, buttery, but well-portioned option that pairs nicely with any soup they offer. 

Recently, I&apos;ve been wow-ed by their daily specials that often involve fried chicken, delicious and hearty greens, and soft fresh bread to hold it all together. My experience getting take out has been super easy and safe-you order online, call when you arrive, and you get your sandwich through a window so it&apos;s super contact-less. Definitely check out their social media for daily specials, though you&apos;ll want to visit them everyday!"
4,"tl;dr the first bites are spectacular at this upscale sandwich-ery, the end of the meal won&apos;t necessarily leave you planning your next trip back

Philly is a sandwich city through-and-through, so any challenger for the &quot;best sandwich&quot; title has to stand out. Stockyard Sandwich Co. aims to do that through its &quot;farm-to-takeout&quot; concept, using premium ingredients and upscale culinary techniques to craft a memorable takeout experience. Pick-up was simple -- just a quick phone call once I arrived, and a worker had my bag ready to go.

I opted for the Braised Beef Sandwich (Stockyard&apos;s sophisticated take on a cheesesteak) with a side of Fried Potatoes. The first bite of the sandwich was magnificent. With the rich onion-and-mushroom gravy, I almost was fooled to think I was eating a Sunday roast. Unfortunately, the good vibes did not last the entire meal. My once-crisp baguette quickly eventually descended into mushiness, and the richness that originally took me off guard felt single-note by the end. And I had only walked 2 blocks before enjoying my meal -- too much longer, and I&apos;m afraid the sandwich would not have help up at all.

The fries similarly started out incredible, The large hunks of russets were fried up extra-crispy, seasoned generously with salt and herbs, and perfectly balanced by &quot;stock sauce,&quot; a sweet aioli. However, the small stock sauce was nowhere near enough for the large serving of fries; by the end, and without sauce, my fries were similarly single-note! Also, and admittedly minor, I wish each fry was slightly smaller; each chunk felt uncomfortably sized at 1.5x bites.

At $17 total, Stockyard hits the wallet a little harder than the tastebuds. With good sandwiches galore throughout the city, I don&apos;t envision myself going out of my way for Stockyard all too often moving forward."
4,"I have to say I do agree with the whole Philly is the &quot;Sandwich Capitol of the Universe&quot; ! We know how to make them, and Stockyard you&apos;ve just been added to the list of places one could venture off to. 

I am telling you it is not an easy decision to make when you see their menu. What did I get, what was my choice ? Well I&apos;ll tell you my fine family of Yelpers! I went with the Braised Beef sandwich on a baguette for the win folks. Just picture this perfectly made with love cuts of beef with all the flavors coming out of it, drizzled in a house-made whiz, seeping into that roll, with onions, mushrooms, on a Baguette. Stockyard, gentlemen, and ladies this is simply on point! My Yelp family, you will not be let down with this heavy hitter working numbers on your taste buds. 

What also made this epic sandwich reach its peak is the side of cut potatoes. A fried potato that has been dressed with sea salt, and herbs  that has been cut up just waiting for you to enjoy with their own &quot;Stock sauce&quot;. This is clearly the perfect combination, that one, two punch you&apos;re looking for. I mean, I suppose you can get a salad with your sammy, but why mess with perfection kids?   

You&apos;ll definitely miss their sign if you&apos;re not paying attention. That&apos;s my only gripe, but the rest is simply Uhh-MAZE-ing! So get in there and enjoy!

I am Nando, and I approve this message."
4,"We ordered the Whole Pig Banh Mi and the Braised Beef sandwiches.  Both were tasty, but a little on the salty side (I&apos;m not a salt sensitive person).  The meats in the sandwiches were delicious.  I think the cheese they use in the beef sandwich is what made that sandwich a little salty.  The banh mi flavor was really good and had a little kick, but I think they put too much sauce, so it made that sandwich a little salty as well.  Overall, good flavors and I&apos;d go back to try their other sandwiches.  I&apos;ll just make sure to tell them a little less sauce next time."
2,"It looks like there are some new faces at Stockyard. The chicken parm sandwich is the worst sandwich I had in a long time. The red sauce has absolutely no flavor and neither does the chicken parm. It should be stricken from the menu ASAP. Or reworked immediately to have some flavor, perhaps start with some salt and pepper. 

Also I placed my order at 6:30 and was given a 7:00 pickup time. I arrived at 7:00 and waited until 7:10 before asking if my order was ready. They told me to hang tight for 2 minutes. I ended up standing around until 7:30. They should have been honest and told me they didn&apos;t even start making my order yet.

I don&apos;t mind tipping ahead of time but today I am very sad that I tipped before I ordered. The staff today was not deserving of my generous tip. (For being rude and lying to my face)

The fried potatoes were good today per usual. A+

The staff and the chicken parm receive the score of F on their report card. 

Overall D experience. 

I won&apos;t ever order the chicken parm here ever again. Bet."
4,"Stockyard has extended their menu with a few staple American comfort food as well as a few healthy options (e.g. mixed green salad, charred broccoli). I&apos;m quite satisfied with my recent takeout orders here!

================================
This must be one of the top sandwich shops in the city! Three of us came here for breakfast and you can customize you breakfast sandwich! I went for breakfast over potato platter so I could enjoy both the protein (eggs &amp; chicken sausage) and the acclaimed fried potatoes! I ordered a side of falafel to go for lunch, which were heavenly delicious! The coffee was also good (I believe they use La Colombe beans), as you usually get crappy coffee at sandwich shops.

The only thing that prevent me from giving five stars is that food here is way too salty to our tasty! Though I know most prepared food are high in sodium, but all three of us found their homemade chicken sausage extremely salty that day. The potatoes and falafels were salty, too. I hope the owner read my review and consider adjust the recipe a bit. At end of the day, it&apos;s something good for every customer&apos;s health :)"
5,"Quick and accurate service. During a LUNCH RUSH. With only 2 PEOPLE WORKING! Need I say more? Damn right I tipped them twice!

I got the Pork Bahn Whole Pig and was fully satisfied. A flavorful sweet and spicy tasting sandwich perfectly portioned and wrapped to lock in all of the pieces. I would get it again if I had more room to fit it in my stomach. This sandwich was perfect!

In addition to the great selection of sandwiches, and quick service, they brought the food to our table! Again, ONLY 2 PEOPLE WERE WORKING!

Everyone I talked to about how great this place has raved about the burgers. Now I wish I got that. Oh, well. There&apos;s always next time. I recommend this place if you&apos;re in the Fairmount section of the city. #HastyFoodiePic"
5,"Top 3 sandwhich spots in Philly. What makes Stockyard standout from the rest is its inclusive menu. Whether you&apos;re in the mood for some meaty, artery clogging goodness or satisfying vegan delights, Stockyard has it all. 

Their menu is definitely on the pricier side, but they source their ingredients locally and aim to reduce waste by utilizing off cuts of animals and seasonal produce ... and every creation is delicious! 

So yeah, I can get behind that."
4,"We got the salmon burger and the pulled chicken burger. 

The salmon burger was a disappointment. I would have liked it if it was spicier and smelled less &quot;fishy&quot;. 

The pulled chicken burger was AMAZING. This is coming from someone who is skeptical of that sweet BBQ taste. Best pulled chicken sandwich I have ever had. I would definitely get this again."
4,"I got the Whole Pig Bahn Mi and boy, the flavor was STRONG, not in a bad way. I usually not the one to shy away from sauces, in this case, I prefer to have less on my banh mi since the flavor is already so infused in the meat. I have been wanting to try this place and def will come back for different sammiches. 

Oh, also got the fried the potatoes; they&apos;re crunchy...nothing out of the ordinary though."
5,"Stockyard is probably the best sandwich place in Philly, at least in this Yelper&apos;s opinion. I love Paesanos but Stockyard tastes just as good and uses healthier ingredients.

Located on Spring Garden parking is pretty easy. It is also a short walk from the Subway station. The shop itself is clean and funky. There is one large communal table and then counter seating for 5-6 more patrons. Stockyard does a lot of take away or carry out business.

We ordered the Stock Burger, the Bahn Mi and a salad with salmon on this visit. The burger was huge, juicy, a bit messy but delicious. The Bahn Mi, as others have written, is fantastic. My wife&apos;s salad was also very good and the salmon was better then she expected. Everything is made to order so it takes a few minutes, especially if they are busy. I have also had their breakfast sandwiches perviously and they are also equally delicious.

Service was very friendly and helpful. There is one small bathroom for patrons. 

5 Yelp stars for Stockyard."
5,"I had the whole pig bang Mi, it was truly truly amazing. I was licking my fingers literally!"
5,"HOLY breakfast sandwich!!!! I was back in Philly for the night for a concert and woke up the next morning wanting a great breakfast sandwich for the drive home. I looked around on yelp and knew we had to stop at Stockyard. The shop is adorable and the staff is so friendly (the girl who took our order was great and offered us water and multiple refills while we waited). My mom and I both crafted our own breakfast sandwich on the Philly Muffin... this a fluffy English muffin with everything bagel seasoning (O M G). I had egg, pastrami and swiss cheese with the house made hot sauce and wow is all I can say. 

Needless to say I did not need to eat for many hours after but I literally dream of this breakfast sandwich and will 100000% be making another stop here on my next trip back to Philly."
5,"This section of Spring Garden does not disappoint when it comes to the food offerings and parking. Disregard the trash that can usually be found in the streets. Don&apos;t know why people are so thoughtless with their trash all over the place. So rude. Anyways, all is forgotten once you enter into Stockyard. 

The space is small but clean and bright. The counter and kitchen area are open for your full viewing pleasure. They are far so super friendly and customer satisfaction oriented that you will be taken back by the kindness and consideration given.  The food is sourced locally with sustainable ingredients and um delicious  solid on all counts! Take out, eat in or catering available."
4,"Ordered Smoked Chicken, Salmon Burger, and Breakfast Burger- two very tasty beef patties with a fried egg and other unknown ingredients- Very very good.  Everyone else liked their sandwiches a lot!  Online order was easy, up smooth.  Very good spot."
2,"Ordered a few week ago and it was great decided to try it again but was really disappointed the second time round. We tried to order beverages but the store called to inform us that they were out and would replace with something of equal value. I asked for a refund and was told they would do that for me. The food can quickly and was warm but the burger patties were overly charred and I was given the wrong fries. A wrap was left whole instead of cut in half, the burger to patty ratio was off, and the food inside felt thrown together in a rush."
5,"Sandwiches, sandwiches, sandwiches,...   The  sandwiches here are freaking awesome!

If you can&apos;t find a favorite here and fill up on one of their sandwiches there is definitely something wrong with you.  These sandwiches rank as some of the best in Philly for sure.

The braised beef and the whole pig banh mi are awesome.  The braised beef is beefy, cheesy, mushroomy, and caramelized onions.  This alternative to the Philly cheesesteak is a great choice.  

The onion rings and fried potatoes are great accompaniments to the sandwiches.  Although I like brussel sprouts I didn&apos;t think I liked their version here and quite frankly ended up throwing most of it away.  This was the only thing I&apos;ve order here that I&apos;d not recommend.

I&apos;ve never been able to get a parking spot here without circling more than a few times.  More often than not, I&apos;ve double parked and ran inside to get my order."
2,"I don&apos;t understand the great reviews and hype. We had the braised beef sandwich. And it was bad... we threw most of it away.

Cute shop and nice folks though."
