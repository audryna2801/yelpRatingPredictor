5,"Isot is one of my favorite restaurants in the South Street area. This Turkish gem is friendly, attractive, and delivers excellent food.  Its $12 lunch special is one of the best deals in all of Philadelphia.  A recent meal in mid-afternoon (to avoid any crowds during the pandemic) proved Isot is still at the top of its game.  The lentil soup was delicious and the accompanying salad fresh.  The Kasap kofte were full of flavor but not as flavorful as the tasty Adana Kebab.  A serving of Abugannusch and Haydari completed the feast.

Our server Amy was always friendly and efficient .... and I can&apos;t wait for another meal at Isot!"
5,"This has been on my list for a while! I came with a friend to celebrate my birthday and it was worth the anticipation. The waitress was friendly and really helpful when helping us decide on what to try. We got the Abugannush (charboiled eggplant) as a cold starter, Adana kebabs (ground beef and lamb), and Coban Kavurma (lamb cubes over sautéed vegetables and straw potatoes that just soaked up all the flavor). EVERYTHING WAS AMAZING, I would highly recommend those dishes but also next time I come back I&apos;m going to have to decide between getting the same exact things or trying more of their menu... It was a lot of food for two people but I enjoyed the meal too much to leave any leftovers!

During the pandemic the staff wears masks and provides Turkish hand sanitizer that smells amazing. Such a great experience. There weren&apos;t very many people dining in, but there were a lot of takeout orders from what we could see. If I lived closer, I&apos;d definitely come here often because Mediterranean food is my favorite!"
5,I&apos;ve ordered takeout from here at least three times. I have never been disappointed with anything that I&apos;ve ordered.. The mezze is my favorite! My only issue is that they give so much pita and not enough scoop of the dips. I could just eat their hummus by the spoonful! A little pricey...and you get what you pay for = Great customer service and excellent quality food.
5,I absolutely recommend you visit this restaurant if you want to enjoy a Mediterranean dish that is made with love care and attentiveness. When visiting this restaurant and there wasn&apos;t many people there and it was honestly my first time having Turkish food. The waiter was very kind and educated me on the foods that I was eating so it was definitely a win win for me felt like I was in Turkey ! The presentation and the food was just amazing I don&apos;t even know how to describe how satisfied I was after eating from this restaurant. If visiting Philadelphia this is a must try !
5,"We were looking for something fresh healthy and delicious... they nailed it!
Can not wait to order again!"
5,"Worth to visit to taste Turkish food there. Clean and the price is reasonable, would love to stopby next time"
5,"I LOVED my meal at Isot! I&apos;ve had this bookmarked for over a year. Finally went and was very impressed! 

The mezze appetizer was great. My favorite was the Manti.. Turkish lamb dumplings. The yogurt sauce mixed with the hot chili oil was lip smacking perfect. I was ooohing and aahhhing over every bite! The Ali Nazik was also amazing. The lamb was so delicious and flavorful. Husband got the Coban Kavurma, lamb cubes spiced to perfection with pita triangles. So much flavor in all the dishes. 

The service was also 5 stars. So very friendly, caring, and really cared about our experience. Maybe he was management or part owner? It seemed like it from his genuine authenticity about our dining experience. 

Loved every bite and every minute at Isot. Highly recommended."
4,"Got take out here. We got the Ali Nazik which was really good. It&apos;s a great with the pita. The lamb was cooked well that they put on top of it. We also ordered a mix plate to share. Meats were all okay. Pretty full for two people. Would definitely come back for the Ali Nazik. 
There was outdoor seating but looks like they can only accommodate a small number of people."
5,Amazing good - very tender meat. Their server name Sarvat is very nice. A MUST TRY when in Philadelphia. The food is halal. AMAZING
5,"The köfte and kunefe were phenomenal. The atmosphere was a 10/10. Service was great and was very knowledgeable about the traditional foods being offered. Coming from Turkey, I think it was the best Turkish restaurant I&apos;ve been to since being back in the U.S. FYI, they were byob the last time I was there. Will be back."
4,"Came here on a whim after spending an amazing day touring Philly and Candytopia. We were popping into random spots as we bopped around the city and happened upon Isot. 

The place is unassuming but warm and cozy when you walk in. We absolutely love Turkish food so we ordered a variety of dishes. The menu provides a description of the chef and where his influence comes from so we knew it would be different than what we were used to, and, we were right. We started out with a few appetizers and shared a kebab platter as a main dish which had mullet rice as a side which was a pleasant surprise. 

All was very enjoyable, as well as the drink they shared (cannot recall what te name). Thoroughly enjoyed the baklava as well."
4,"Came here for brunch with some friends and ordered a bunch of different dishes from their menu. Everything came out in a timely manner with great service!

We ordered the turkish breakfast which came with an assortment of cheese, sweet dips, pita, fries, and spinach boreks. We also got the sucuklu, menemen, and 2 gozlemes to try. My favorite was the menemen,  which is a soft, fluffy, veggie and egg scramble.

Overall, we had a great experience here and I will be back to try out their dinner menu!"
4,"Great Turkish food. I visited this restaurant late winter and had a delightful time. We were promptly seated and had great service throughout the meal. The place isn&apos;t too large, and the seats are quite close together so if you&apos;re looking for intimate conversation then the set up might not be for you.

Starters: Hummus and Calamari. The hummus was delicious, just the right amount of olive oil and lemon and there was plenty of bread, so try not to fill up. The calamari was fried nicely and was a large portion, the two dishes alone could put someone over the edge.

Entrees: Spinach and Feta Borek and Char grilled chicken thighs. We didn&apos;t realize it, but at this point we were getting stuffed. The pastry on the Borek was delicious and the filling as well. The char grilled chicken thighs were just ok. The vegetables were a nice touch. I&apos;m not sure what I was expecting, the dish was as described, but there was no depth of flavor.

Dessert: What other than Baklava and Turkish coffee would one get at a Turkish restaurant? Both were great ways to finish the meal.

Overall
Hummus 5/5
Fried Calamari 4/5
Spinach Feta Borek 5/5
Chargrilled Chicken Thighs 3/5
Baklava 4/5
Turkish Coffee 4/5"
4,"We had dinner here over the weekend. 

Assorted Mezes 
I always like to try a restaurants mixed Mezes. This version was good. There was a good variety on offer. Everything was tasty with varying flavors!

Kavides Tava (Shrimp)
This was probably the least memorable fish for the evening. The large shrimp came in what looked like an infused oil with garlic. The oil and garlic weren&apos;t tasty enough and was evidently missing something. Nevertheless the shrimp was still super fresh and crunchy. It could have used more flavoring from the garlic sauce though. 

Gavur Daqi Salad 
This was refreshing and tasty! It is a mix of finely chopped Cucumbers tomatoes onions green peppers walnuts and parsley in a pomegranate lemon dressing. Love love loved! 

Kasap Kofte 
This was  beef and lamb patties mixed with fresh parsley and spices. This was super tasty when eaten with the onion parsley salad and bulgar rice. 

Service was super friendly and helpful. They answered all questions and made great suggestions. This is also a BYOB restaurant. 

Loved!!"
5,"Was really happy to discover this marvelous Mediterranean restaurant! The service is impeccable, the vibe warm and cozy, a good value with generous servings, and excellent attractively served dishes. 

We were treated to complimentary warm sweet drinks and appetizer on being seated. Ordered the mezze appetizers, served in a platter were 6 different scoopable items. Yum. Husband ordered  grilled chicken thighs and I ordered meatbally things of beef and lamb. Both were served with rice pilaf, grilled vegetables, a nice green salad and a side topping of marinated thinly sliced red onions and parsley. Delicious! 

We declined dessert but were brought baklava anyway, &quot;because of the wait&quot;.  We didn&apos;t feel we had waited at all! The baklava was very good and not sickly sweet like it often is. 

Highly recommend Isot!"
5,"Amazing BYO place! First off they are very lenient about what you bring to drink. We brought a ton of white claws which doesn&apos;t really scream good dining etiquette but the staff was happy to provide us with glasses to drink from (no &quot;corkage&quot; fee). 

As for the food, WOW. SOLID meal for affordable prices. We got:

- manti - Turkish dumplings. We had high hopes and placed two orders but did not like this. It was weirdly cold and doughy. Wouldn&apos;t recommend. 
- hot hummus- so good you can&apos;t go wrong with hummus really!!
- beef and chicken kebabs - yes yes yes so good, came with veggies and some type of grain. 
- spinach and feta pastry - loved
- Ali nazik - lamb meat over eggplant we loved this a lot!

Overall, very solid Mediterranean eats!! Would come back."
5,"Friday night and I did not have a reservation.  In come Isot with an opening and one hungry customer.  I am so glad I took them up on the opening because this was one of the best mediterranean spots I have been to in a while. 

From the beginning chef&apos;s treat, to the mezzanine, and meat - lots of meat, I was never going to get the opportunity to leave hungry.  In fact I could not eat it all they gave me so much.  Bad problem to have right?  

Overall, the staff was super friendly and very helpful to my dining experience.  If you do go and want to have a drinky drink here, its BYOB."
4,"We were on a Saturday for dinner. We got seated right away. We ordered the mixed meze and beyran for appetizer and the chicken kebab platter for entree. This was a lot of food for 2 people. The mixed meze was a mix of 6 different meze with warm pita bread. We enjoyed trying these. The beyran was ok. The chicken kebab platter was good. The service here is great and the waitress was really friendly and made sure we had a good dining experience.
Overall,
Food: 4/5
Service: 5/5
Ambiance: 5/5"
4,"Great BYOB place for some delicious Turkish cuisine! 
We made reservations and bought wine ( no corkage fee). The interiors are beautiful and the servers are eager to please. We ordered the mezze, which is a sampler and they were sweet enough to give us some complimentary couscous salad. We probably should have waited to order the entree, but we thought there would have been a lag between the 2, because we had barely touched our mezze and had a sip of wine when they bought the entree. 
The food on the other hand is sooo delicious. Can&apos;t wait to go back and try their lunch specials."
4,"Food: 4.5 Out of 5
Quality was great! Portions are nice enough to share between two people for each dish.
We ordered the mixed meza, mixed meat platter for one, Ali Nazik, &amp; Kunefe for dessert. What I enjoyed the most was the Ali Nazik since it had grilled eggplants with their yogurt based sauce topped with a good portion of tender/non game-y lamb. Kunefe was different since it was both savory and and a sweet dish. 

Service: 4.5 Out of 5
Yes they get busy for dinner service. We had 3 three servers rotating to check up on us. They gave us a complementary non alcoholic drink. The drink I believe was some sort of tea. Our servers was kind enough to explain and give us more when we told them we like it.

Environment: 4.75 Out of 5
Surprisingly big restaurant. Not only did they have seating downstairs they also have an upstairs which I believe seats bigger parties. 

Overall: 4.5 Out of 5
Definitely coming back! For the quality of the food, portion size, and price point it&apos;s a definite yes for my partner and I. I love different like of Mediterranean food, as of right now Turkish food is at the top of my list."
