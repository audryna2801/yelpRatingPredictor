5,"Drinks - In general, La Colombe Coffee is one of the best coffees that I&apos;ve tried. From their draft lattes to their regular brewed coffee, everything on their menu is delicious.

Food - This particular location offers a breakfast, lunch, AND dinner menu. 

Covid - Due to covid, this location doesn&apos;t allow seating, but it&apos;s HUGE and there&apos;s plenty of space to work or catch up with a friend."
4,"The draft chai tea oat milk latte was amazing. I walked in for a 12 pack of draft oatmilk cans and left with the lightest, tastiest chai I could have asked for. Although it&apos;s so bubbly that you drink it in about 3.5 seconds, would still give it 4 stars. Worthit"
4,"If you have the chance to stop by this specific La Colombe Coffee you need to take advantage of the opportunity.  In addition to their cafe beverages there is a full service menu for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, AND at night, they serve adult beverages as well!

This Philly location of La Colombe Coffee is on trend with the industrial hipster vibe, and when I was there I saw a wide array of clientele using the space from your stay at home yoga moms, to your young professionals holding meetings, as well as hipsters all on top of the birthday event that was going on in their entertainment space.

If you haven&apos;t been here before, even if you&apos;re a tourist for the day, take chance and stop by.  It definitely outranks the local Starbucks!"
4,"Pretty cool place!  very spacious and plenty of seating here.  I was very surprised to see that they served food (not just bakery)...if people are reading this and are like WTF...i&apos;m not from philly...and where i&apos;m from, there isn&apos;t a place like this.  So yeah...anyways...this place is located in Fishtown.  It seems like a really cool spot, but kind of far from downtown Philly.

Anyways...when i got here...there was a line of people....you order your food/beverage first and then you sit down.  I decided on french toast (theres an option of 2 or 3 toast) and a cold brew.  The cold brew was pretty good and strong!  the french toast was awesome!!  it tasted good with my coffee...prices were fairly reasonable...i kind of wished i got 3 toast.

Overall a great place! =)"
5,"We came here for brunch and it was AWESOME. It is definitely a yuppie spot, but it has a good ambiance and feels like a brewery-coffeehouse hybrid, which I understand it is. We arrived at around 11:30am on a Sunday and there was a 10 minute wait to order that moved fairly quickly for how long to line was. What we got:

- Grilled cheese and tomato soup - Soooo good. The house-baked bread was perfectly toasted and crunchy, and the cheese was melted to perfection, almost oozing out of the bread. The first bite of the sandwich dipped in the beautifully flavored tomato soup was phenomenal, as was every other bite after that.
- Biscuits and gravy - The presentation of the food in a car iron skillet was beautiful, and the gravy was hearty and flavorful. The fried eggs absolutely made the dish, and the bacon didn&apos;t hurt either - perfectly crisp without being burnt. The biscuits were warm, moist, and fluffy.
- Oat milk draft latte - Fantastic.
- Nizza Iced Latte - I could definitely taste the milk chocolate, but the brownie notes not so much. Still a good latte.

Lots of great brunch food, and delicious coffee to boot. I was not disappointed. Huh"
4,"Sleek, modern, industrial space with plenty of seating. There&apos;s usually a small selection of pastries/baked goods and the drink menu is on little wooden clipboards. Even though the food prices were clearly written on the blackboards behind the cashiers, prices for the drinks were only on the little menus.

I&apos;m usually not one for dairy substitutes in my coffee, but I was recommended by a friend to try the draft latte with oat milk...and wow, I enjoyed it a lot! It felt like a special treat. I also tried one of their solid, which was solid. Would come back the next time I&apos;m in Philadelphia!"
5,So excited to write this review. I am an avid coffee drinker. Like what even is water?? Coffee always. Coffee over sleep. Until I wondered upon the best coffee shop and bakery/eatery/heaven. La colombe has it all. And the aesthetic of this place will have you wishing you could redo every room in your house for a more modern rustic look. This is the best coffee shop you will ever enter. Coffee is a science here. A science that is perfected and worshipped. Same for the tea selections! And the food is so fresh and delicious. Fresh baked goods. Fabulous breads that make you feel like you&apos;re at a French market. If you eat in... the plates and cups are beautiful and make for the perfect Instagram photo shoot. You won&apos;t regret stopping here. And your probably going to make some new friends if you do. It&apos;s amazing!
5,"I love La Colombe coffee and I especially love this location! It&apos;s a huuge warehouse-y space with a ton of tables and a full bar and kitchen. 

Space: If you want to come work here on a weekday, it&apos;s pretty good. Plenty of people but enough space to not be jammed next to someone. Decent amount of outlets but NO WIFI. A buzz of talking and some medium-volume music but pretty easy to tune out or drown out with headphones. Beware of the weekends past 11AM though! It gets super crowded! You&apos;ll likely have to wait in a line that wraps around but it goes quickly enough that it&apos;s worth the wait. Finding a seat for 2 is tricky but doable; more than that, good luck. Clean bathrooms with a ton of stalls. 

Drinks/food: I love the regular draft latte and oat milk draft latte. Creamy like milkshakes. $4 is a tad high but it&apos;s nice for a weekend treat. Their regular coffee is great, too (add your own milk/sugar). They serve beer and cocktails after 5pm I think. The grilled cheese is almost too cheesy (I never thought I&apos;d say that!!) but delicious. The biscuits and gravy are soo good but soo heavy; be prepared for a coma. 

Service: Pretty friendly and consistently quick."
4,"This is the only location I&apos;ve ever been to.  It&apos;s a beautiful place.  Great food!  I know, I know...they are a coffee company....it&apos;s just way too strong for me.  But the food is great!"
2,"My iced coffee and scone were amazing but that only goes so far. Everyone that worked there was cold and inhospitable, I asked the cashier how her morning was and she just stared at me blankly waiting for my order. Great food is nothing without great service."
4,"I really like the vibe of this place, it&apos;s very laid back despite being very bustling and spacious.  During my visit, I grabbed an iced mocha and a whoopie pie, and they were both pretty solid.  I also like that they offer both regular and sparkling water to patrons. 

Overall, La Colombe Coffee is just a dope place to grab a coffee or a pastry, connect to the wi-fi, and just hang out.  I have my eyes on their Artisan pizzas for my next visit."
5,"Dope af vibe. One of my favorite coffee shops in the city. It&apos;s just cool. 

It&apos;s industrial, hip, local, coffee shop vibes. They have lots of seating areas and a private work room in the back which you can reserve (might try a work party there sometime soon). 

They serve beer and cocktails which is dope plus they have a pretty expansive food menu. 

The coffee as you can imagine is good but it&apos;s all the rest that makes this place standout"
4,This location is beautiful with lots of seating but sadly no WiFi. I would definitely come frequently if they offered WiFi.
4,"This was my third time coming here and I have no complaints either time. My brother who&apos;s a yelp elite was raving about this coffee shop and has been checking in here a lot on yelp. So the very first time I had gone- I went with him. It was so crowded and it made me a bit overwhelmed cause of the crowds and not much space to move. 

The first time I came I got an iced coffee and it packed a punch! The coffee here is so strong! But it tastes more real compared to dunkin where I usually get my iced coffee. The beans just tasted differently like more fresh- idk honestly what it is but their coffee is amazing! 

The next time couple times I came there wasn&apos;t as much of a crowd so I was good waiting in line. I got iced coffee again and a banana nut bread! Wow oh wow talk about tasty! I sat down with my brothers family who visited from SC and we had a long table in the back. I hadn&apos;t realized how huge this location is- there&apos;s so many seats in the back and it seemed to thin out the people and crowd that forms in the front. 

I really enjoy this coffee shop and would be coming back again!"
5,My latte with oat milk was perfect. When I say perfect I say perfect the froth with oat milk is my favorite and a lot of places don&apos;t understand how to do it right! Best coffee I&apos;ve had in a while
5,"What a cute coffee shop. I low key regret not having an actual coffee while I stopped by, but I had one at the airport and it was good! I bought a juice she. I got the &quot;Mr. B &quot; juice and it was great as well. The vegan pastries are literally just bread (didn&apos;t try them so I can&apos;t confirm/deny the faste). Not really a good place for food, but would go again for the coffee.

4,"This was a gotta try..&amp; my coffee buddy &amp; I went.
It was good.Only thing coffee batch wasn&apos;t as strong as I preferred.
But my cast iron blueberry skillet cake was Great!!
Love this spot.
Return factor:
Definitely!!"
5,"If you haven&apos;t been here before, get the nitro draft latte. It&apos;s what La Colombe is famous for and it&apos;s delicious. I haven&apos;t tried anything else because this is what I come here for but the pastries look delicious. $4 for a nitro draft and you don&apos;t need to add anything because it&apos;s perfectly balanced and delicious."
5,"You&apos;re certainly not going to do better than this place, coffee is incredible I believe they created nitro coffee so you know they were ahead of the game. The food selection is small but very fresh and wholesome (not sure if any of it is organic) and exactly what you need for any category be at breakfast or lunch, they don&apos;t do dinner. So if you&apos;re anywhere within 15-20 minutes but it is worth it to come here; If you&apos;re not doing anything I would even drive 45 minutes or so to hang out with a friend."
4,"Food is amazing. 
I always get French toast and scrambled eggs with a cold brew  

Seating is horrible though. 
Just a bunch of douchey hipsters talking about sports and expensive lofts."
