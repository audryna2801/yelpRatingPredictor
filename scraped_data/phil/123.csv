5,"Holy goodness!! Ahhh, this ice cream! I&apos;ve had a few cookies and cream scoops and eaten in the market when they had indoor dining opened, but recently looked at the pieces and decided to just buy a pint this time to take home! 

$7 is a lot for a pint at the supermarket, but! at this place, it&apos;s worth it! I was craving pistachio ice cream (which I&apos;d never even tried!) And whoa!! This place delivered more than I expected! I wasn&apos;t sure how the nuts would be, I hate crunchy things in ice cream, but these are soft and almost a raisin texture- very cool! You can get two flavors in a pint, so we did pistachio and strawberry. Strawberry is super fresh tasting, not artificial like others. The lovely lady working also really shoved in our money&apos;s worth of ice cream! I admire her arm strength! Overall wonderful experience, def will get some more pints!"
4,"Did you know?: Bassetts is America&apos;s oldest ice cream brand-it&apos;s been serving ice cream from the same marble countertop in Philadelphia&apos;s Reading Terminal Market since 1893!

When I was planning a trip to Philadelphia, I just happened to run into this article and I told myself I have to visit.

It&apos;s located at the reading terminal market.  
Salted-caramel pretzel and butter pecan are supposedly the most famous one here but they have so many to choose from.

They sell from 1 scoop and the receipt said kids size ice cream. I am glad they decided to sell kids size ice cream to me as I was still pretty full from earlier lunch.

They have a common indoor dining area in the center but due to COVID, they blocked most of the tables. They also have some standing only tables outside. 

Ice cream is rich and creamy. Yea... one scoop was small and I was really tempted to go back to order another as it was that good."
5,"When it comes to the OG&apos;s of the ice cream game, no one is touching this place. Bassetts really knows what they&apos;re doing and it&apos;s no wonder there is always a line here. I can&apos;t go to Philly and not get ice cream from here within the reading terminal market before I go back to NY. It must be something to do with the cows that make the milk they use because this ice cream is unreal. It&apos;s a must try if you&apos;re from out of town. Don&apos;t leave without trying at least one flavor from one of the longest running ice cream parlors in the country."
4,"It&apos;s a popular Philly ice cream place.  Quality of the ice cream is decent, they do offer sorbet for vegans or folks who can&apos;t have dairy.  It would be nice for them to offer milk alternative ice cream.  The prices are a bit on the higher side .  Small ice cream is over $5.  Cones are over $7."
5,"The richest, creamiest ice cream I&apos;ve ever tasted. And I&apos;m somewhat of an ice cream junkie. 

Firstly, the staff was wonderfully friendly. Secondly, it&apos;s easy to find inside Reading Terminal and there&apos;s a little bit of counter space to lean against and enjoy your ice cream. I was lucky that the market wasn&apos;t jam-packed, so there was plenty of space and no line. 

Okay, but back to the ice cream. I asked the cashier what she recommended and she said her favorite was Butter Pecan, but that the Salted Caramel Pretzel was one of their most popular flavors. You get two scoops, so I got one of each. To be honest, the Butter Pecan let me down a bit. It was creamy, but I wanted more flavor. More pecan flavor? More sugar? I don&apos;t know. Now, the Salted Caramel Pretzel...well, that was EVERYTHING. Lots and lots of little chocolate-pretzel pieces and salted caramel. I kept saying, &quot;I&apos;m not going to finish this because there are other things to try in this market,&quot; but hell...I couldn&apos;t stop. That ice cream was addicting. If I lived anywhere near this place, I&apos;d easily have a real problem. 

While I was eating here, I also met two lovely elderly women. One who regularly drops in (she works at a nearby theatre) and said it&apos;s the best ice cream in Philadelphia. She&apos;s such a regular that they serve her the ice cream in a ceramic plate. The other woman is the mother of one of the employees and admitted that although she&apos;s a diabetic, she still finds a way to enjoy a little of the ice cream from time to time because she loves it so much. The point is, GLOWING REVIEWS ALL AROUND. 

Love yourself. Treat yourself. Eat this ice cream."
4,"I took the train down from NYC specifically to try Bassett&apos;s Ice Cream. I saw it featured on Vice Channel&apos;s &quot;Ice Cream Show&quot;. My impression is that it is an ice cream of high quality, in that it is very creamy and has great texture. It is also very cold and they do not skimp on portion size. 

The shop carries many flavors, but I found that some of the flavors are more flavorful than others. I ordered a large cup (three scoops, $6.75) of butterscotch vanilla, peach, and rum raisin. The butterscotch shone through but the peach and rum raisin flavors were too faint. I like that they even have peach available though, because many ice cream shops don&apos;t carry that flavor."
4,"Dessert is always a good idea before leaving Reading Terminal! That&apos;s exactly what I did!

Had a scoop of the birthday cake. The quality of the ice cream was very good. Creamy and delicious!

Staff was friendly and fast."
4,"It&apos;s ice cream.   

The place is fast and efficient inside the super crowded Reading Market.  

The ice cream itself is good, but typical compared to any stand alone ice cream shop.  

What is impressive is how fast and efficient the process it.   One person takes the order and gives you a receipt and they have about 4 or so individuals who make what&apos;s on the receipt. Works pretty well."
4,"When you charge $8 for a milkshake, I am expecting it to be a pretty darn good milkshake. Reading Terminal or not, this is way pricey and should probably be brought down to $6. If it was this would be a 5 star review.

A friend of mine had ice cream here when he was in Philadelphia and he told me about this ice cream joint. I complied and am happy that I did. This milkshake was amazing, so much so that I could not put it down. So rich, so flavorful, so perfectly blended that it was hard to believe this was not artificially flavored. It was made with care and passion and is reflected in the final product. In addition, it comes in a decent sized cup so I was not ripped off.

I am not so much an ice cream connoisseur as I am a milkshake one, but this was on point and am willing to forgive the high price for something so dandy.

I cannot wait to try another."
5,"Directions are pretty clear. Stand and follow blue line! Order! Wait for number to be called! 
There was only one person in front of me when I got in line. They called out my flavors and not number when it was ready. I chose pistachio and banana. OMG it was so good! So creamy! 
Both flavors were amazing. The Pistachio had lots of pistachios in it at different size bits. I would get both again!
I asked for a lid but he said it wasn&apos;t in the cup that has a lid- he&apos;d have to transfer it. So I canceled the lid request. 
I don&apos;t know how many adjectives there are for the word &quot;creamy&quot; but insert them all here in every language!!! 
I will come here again next time in Philly."
4,"What can you say about someone who&apos;s been making ice cream for over 100 years!! Bassetts does it rich and indulgent. The flavors are mostly classic/standard but they are done right. The raspberry truffle seemed like a popular choice, and after getting one for myself I understood why. The chocolate and the butterscotch were delicious too.

They have a wide variety of cone types, so it&apos;s tough to decide on one :) Beware of their portion sizes, they are very generous and a small scoop might be tough to finish unless you have super sweet tooth !!"
4,"As far as ice cream shops go, It doesn&apos;t get much better than Bassetts.  The thickness and creaminess of their ice cream just makes the guilt go away. The service was friendly and very prompt. 
I ordered a cup of peanut butter swirl.  The serving size was just right to satisfy. The peanut butter ratio was on the heavy side, which was perfect in my opinion.  Creamy, rich and thick flavors just put this ice cream over the top of other brands. A rep of theirs once told me the milk fat content is higher which helps with the flavor, creaminess and thickness. I would be here constantly If I lived closer!"
4,"Pretty good ice cream shop that gives you a very reasonable portion for the price. 
I love their mint chocolate ice cream. I think I always get that I come back to Reading. 
The servers are really friendly. They give you a sample of any flavor if you ask. 
This place definitely made its roots in the market as a good establishment. They do things right. 
The flavors and price are right. 
People will keep coming back for more."
5,Best ice cream I&apos;ve ever had!  That clear enough?  Luckily my friend had stopped here once before based on a tip he heard from a friend and he insisted we go get an ice cream here when we were in Philly on business.  Can&apos;t believe they don&apos;t have a national brand.
5,"THE REAL DEAL

You want creamy dreamy ice cream? This is your place! They have wide selection of flavors. A small size has 2 big scoops of ice cream. I highly recommend the Banana - it&apos;s my favorite and so good."
4,"The line moves quickly. I have tried this ice cream at different locations but never at the actual shop. 

I love their pralines and cream. My daughter got the cookie dough ice cream, kids cup. 

The price is a little high for the amount you get but it&apos;s totally worth it."
5,"I have been dying to try Bassett&apos;s since 2011. I saw it on Food Paradise. I was 17 at the time and was obsessed with trying ice cream from the oldest operating stand in the United States. However, I never saw myself having a reason to visit Philadelphia. Fast forward 7 years and I find myself in the City of Brotherly Love (without reason), ready to try the almighty Bassett&apos;s.

I went to their Reading Market location multiple times over the course of four days. The weather was unseasonably warm and I used it to my advantage. The line for whatever reason never was unreasonably long. I was expecting crowds out the wazhoo for some reason. It didn&apos;t deter me. In fact, it only got me more excited because it meant I didn&apos;t have to wait long for ice cream.

According to Food Paradise, the reason Bassett&apos;s Ice Cream sits atop the cold confectionary throne is their butterfat content. Apparently, most ice creams are only around 13% fat filled while Bassett&apos;s is a whopping 17%. I&apos;m pretty bad at math so I don&apos;t really understand the importance of this disparity but I do know I can taste the difference. I ordered mocha chip every damn time because I am a creature of habit and mocha chip is my favorite flavor of all time. The richness and creaminess of Bassett&apos;s is something I&apos;ve not experienced in my extensive ice cream travels. I wish the term &quot;extensive ice cream travels&quot; was a joke, but I&apos;m quite serious in that I&apos;ve eaten my weight in ice cream at shops around the country. There was something so incredibly satisfying about that mocha chip - it had the consistency of American ice cream but the velvety flavor and texture of Italian gelato.

I can see why Bassett&apos;s consistently makes the top of best ice cream lists. I also see why Food Paradise chose to feature them all those years ago and made me yearn for it. I was pleasantly surprised by the city of Philadelphia for many reasons, but Bassett&apos;s was probably #1 on the list."
4,"I ordered the matcha flavor ice cream. They  really gave you a big portion of ice cream. The taste was nothing special, much like the matcha ice cream you could have in other places but the taste was long lasting. Not too sweet. Not too rich either. The texture was medium firm. No too thick or smooth."
4,"This is my favorite ice cream in Philadelphia! My favorite flavor is their chocolate caramel pretzel, but you really can&apos;t go wrong with any of them. They&apos;re a little on the pricy side, but it&apos;s worth it and they definitely don&apos;t skimp out on the scoop size!"
5,"If you find yourself in Reading Market, you know you have to save some room for Bassetts. With tons of delicious flavors available, Bassetts dominates the ice cream game here in Philly. It&apos;s been around for a very long time and is absolutely worth whatever lineup there might be!"
