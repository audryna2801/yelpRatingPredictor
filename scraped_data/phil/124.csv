5,"I&apos;m not a huge fan of donuts, but I really like their donuts here! I&apos;m happy to see them open during the pandemic as everyone needs something sweet in during these hard times. You can easily order online and pick it up at this location which they make it quite easy by opening their side window and giving your order without much contact. They were also very kind and understanding when I called to ask if I could pick it up 30 minutes early than the original set time to pick up. The donuts came hot and fresh which I really appreciate. Thanks again, Federal! You guys are awesome!"
5,"When we heard donuts we figured just your average donut stop! However they had a fried chicken sandwich and OMG better then any other food chain and etc. it had this crisp too it like I&apos;ve had no where else and some sauce that had a little kick too it. Plus SOO many pickles! 

The Vietnamese coffee was okay I thought it would be sweeter since the milk they usually use is condensed milk. Still really good though!

Hot &amp; fresh, cookies and cream donut was hot and I love how it&apos;s like sugary based and not a frosting!

This place does not disappoint!"
5,"We got half a dozen donuts (one of each flavor), hot chocolate, and a chicken sandwich. Everything was delicious. We chanced upon this place but will be returning to the neighborhood to eat here again."
5,"5 Fancy Donut/Halva Lemon Pistachio- The tangy combination of the lemon and pistachio was an interesting combination, but very enjoyable.
5 Hot Donuts/ Strawberry Lavender- The hot donuts are really unique. The strawberry lavender is really tasty and when fresh and hot is unbeatable.
4Breakfast Sandwich: Egg, bacon, Cooper Sharp, cherry pepper relish ok a potato roll. Expectation were a little high on this one. The seemed like it could have been microwaved. The other ingredients all seemed fresh. The potato roll was similar to a Stroehmann&apos;s roll.
5Overall: Federal is always consistent with their donuts. The fancy flavors are always unique and interesting. The hot donuts are always really tasty!"
5,The best fresh made donuts in the area. Love the freshly made ones. Must come! Got to try the chicken next. Only down side is they close somewhat early
2,"Federal Donuts has great donuts, no surprise here. Today I decided to order a whole meal from here since it was in the middle of the afternoon and my girlfriend and I haven&apos;t eaten yet. The service is friendly and patient as I asked the cashier for recommendations. 

We ordered our usual half dozen hot and fresh donuts, half cinnamon brown sugar and half cookies and cream. We ate one donut as we waited for the rest of our order which didn&apos;t take long. It was delicious as always. 

The fried chicken, sandwich, and fries didn&apos;t take much longer and we were on our way home to enjoy this meal. My girlfriend&apos;s sandwich was very good, the chicken was fried well and the potato roll was perfect for this sandwich. However, it was very small and probably wouldn&apos;t fill me up. I was very disappointed in my chicken. For $10 I got 3 small pieces of chicken. One of the thighs was undercooked as it was very pink inside. The undercooked chicken even had someone&apos;s hair in it. So for $10 I was only able to eat 2 pieces of chicken. The chili garlic glaze was sort of underwhelming. The glaze wasn&apos;t spicy it wasn&apos;t garlicky, it wasn&apos;t much. I enjoyed the fries more than the chicken, unfortunately. 

I would still go to Federal Donuts, but only for their donuts."
4,"There&apos;s plenty of places you can go to get donuts, but I recommend coming to Federal because they&apos;re just good. They have a select few staple donuts, but they also have a few daily specials. On top of that you can get your fix of coffee for the day or if you come after 11 you can even get chicken wings!

I gave the cereal donut a shot. it wasn&apos;t as sweet as you would expect. Great flavors and texture. The outside is coated in a cereal milk which is fantastic."
4,The fried chicken sandwich was pretty good nothing crazy it looked better than what it was. The doughnuts were tasty as well. They sell out with the doughnuts fast so get there early.
5,"Yelp readers this place never gets old, Yelper Matt H has no idea what he is talking about. I&apos;m not a liberal but I will gladly eat their donuts! 

I&apos;ve come here a few times and it&apos;s been a great experience every time. The first time I came we were trying to get there before they closed and literally arrived right before they locked the door. Not only did they let us in, they gave us extra donuts! 

This time around my wife and I stopped by on our way to Easter dinner at a friends place. Nothing says let me in/I love/ happy Easter like a box of Federal Donuts. A few of the people at dinner had never experienced FD glory. Let&apos;s just say they started with a half, took another half, then took a full donut. I&apos;m pretty sure they fell in love. :-) 

This place is great, I didn&apos;t even tell you how good the chicken is. I&apos;ll probably be back in a few weeks..."
4,"Expected more, but it was an okay experience.
I heard LOTS of recommendation of FD, so I decided to give it a try. I came to the shop on the 2nd street around noon and they ran out all of the specialties donuts, so I got the hot fresh ones and 3 pieces of chicken.
So first of all, the donuts were super soft and hot. They deep fried the donuts and sprinkled sugars flavors on them. The thing is they are too sweet and too sugary. Plus, the donut texture is pretty cake-ish, which got me full after the second one
Secondly, the chicken is a bit pricey. 3 pieces for 20$. Flavor was okay, but I had expected them to be more than that."
5,"What&apos;s you&apos;re favorite food combo? I have several! I didn&apos;t know Fried chicken  and donuts  was one until @federaldonut opened in South Philly in 2011. It quickly became a favorite during my years living there
.
.
I remember waiting outside patiently until 11 am when they begin to serve the fried chicken. Served in a box, making you feel like you&apos;re grabbing your boxed lunch, it&apos;s always hot, fresh, and seasoned to perfection! The skin has the perfect crunch and the meat is always tender and juicy. You have a choice of several different dry seasonings and then you can pair it with a wet glaze. My favorite combination is the buttermilk ranch with the sweet soy garlic
.
.
The order always comes with one of their signature honey cake donuts although simple in nature, it&apos;s a perfect accompaniment to the chicken. They are even better than some of the specialty donuts! Depending on the location the specialty donuts may vary but the original location seems to carry all of them
.
.
Be sure to check out any of their 7 locations and enjoy the experience! Thank me later!

5,"One of our favorite yearly treats- the federal donuts chicken sandwich. During our recent visit to Philly, we went all out at Federal Donuts. I tried a donut for the first time- a fancy limited one: rose lemonade, which was fantastic and full of spot-on flavor. We ordered two chicken sandwiches to eat at the restaurant and then asked for 5 to-go, and for the buns, seasoning, sauce, cheese, chicken, and pickles to be packed separately. I had to bring some sandwiches back to my family in the burgh, as they were just as obsessed as us when they tried one last year. They accommodated our unique request perfectly, which I really appreciated. Best chicken sandwich I&apos;ve ever had!"
4,"They have a few locations, and we picked the one that is in more of a residential area than a busy center of the city. There was no line when we arrived shortly after 11am. But, it was still busy, it can get crowded very quickly with a very small interior. They have five counter seats, and that is about it. While we were there, most of them were there to purchase the food to go, so the seats were not in high demand.

Even though this is mainly a donut shop, they also offer enticing fried chicken. We ordered their very popular Fried Chicken Sandwich, available from 11am. It was smaller than I thought it would be, but I always take quality over quantity. It was juicy, tasty, with a nice little kick to it. We really enjoyed it!

We couldn&apos;t just order chicken from a donuts shop, so we got a couple of donuts from their Hot Donuts selections. We chose Cookies &amp; Cream and Strawberry Lavender. We both liked the strawberry one better, since it had better, stronger flavor. Cookies &amp; Cream was good but didn&apos;t have much flavor. 

Definitely a place to visit if you are visiting Philly!"
4,"I have moved the South and no longer live on 2nd Street, thanks for the update and for acknowledging my concerns about the neighborhood, my husband passed a couple of years ago and that&apos;s why I moved, my husband&apos;s family has lived there for over 60 years and we loved the neighborhood, I&apos;m glad you&apos;re doing well in Pennsport."
5,"Wow wow wow, soo good. I had a coffee and recommended donuts by the cashier and both were fantastic. It was small, so don&apos;t expect to stay in and eat but they had a bench outside for enjoying. Someone walked in while I was there and said a &quot;I&apos;ll take the regular.&quot; Speaks to their donuts and their staff!"
3,"Donuts are good and fresh....I did try their buttermilk fried chicken and it was dry, overcooked and salty....I was not impressed. I&apos;ll come back for donuts but not the chicken."
4,"Very good interesting doughnuts at this local chain. Be aware (since it is easy to miss!) that some flavors are made to order while others are not. I (accidentally) opted for two premade ones: a peanut butter malt and a pastelito (guava and cream cheese) one. The pastelito was a little too sour for me, although it did a nice job of cutting through the sweetness. The peanut butter malt one was simultaneously rich and tender and I adored it. The don&apos;t serve chicken until 11am, so I didn&apos;t get to try that. Next time, I&apos;ll have to try the chicken and the hot doughnuts!"
4,"The fried chicken sandwich was pretty good. It wasn&apos;t as crispy as I imagined it to be, but still crispy and yummy.

Our friend said it&apos;s their version of Chick-fil-A. I can see that. Though I think having a slice of cold cheese is strange on this type of chicken sandwich. I rather it be melted since the chicken&apos;s fried. Just saying... I guess it reminds me too much of Chick-fil-A.

I might have checked in at the brick and mortar location since we visited the food cart at Spruce Street Harbor Park. Oops. 

We wanted to try the doughnut chips (interesting right), but their stock was low towards the end of the day as so many people were ordering. Until next time Federal Donuts."
5,"I always thought of myself as a yeast donut guy rather than cake.

Until federal.

The freshly made ones, like strawberry lavender, is really the only donuts you should be getting from Federal. The textural difference between cooled down and frosting coated ones vs. freshly made and sprinkled ones are insane.

Still have not tried their fried chicken, which I definitely have to do. But if it&apos;s nearly as good as their donuts, I know I&apos;m in for a treat."
5,"There&apos;s something heavenly about Saturday mornings that involve a corner doughnut shop. A place where you can perch on a countertop stool, drink fresh coffee, and sample a half dozen off-the-griddle doughnuts. 

Sauntering in before the morning rush, we were able to indulge in this simple, blissful experience. Each doughnut tasted better than the previous one (but you have to try the blueberry pancake and strawberry lavender). Yes, you may leave on a cloud of sugar, but it&apos;s worth the treat."
