5,"First time ordering from Hardena last night, and was even more blown away than I thought I would be.

Due to COVID, Hardena is only doing takeout and serving a &apos;temporary&apos; menu. By the time we called to place our order, it was late and they had ran out of a bunch of things, but luckily they still had the ginger fried chicken - one of their featured dishes! Yay!!! So we got two pieces.

We also placed two orders of the Nasi Campur, each of which came with two sides served over rice. Our sides for the Nasi Campur included the tempeh &amp; tofu, beef rendang, goat curry, and cumin spiced chicken (Chicken of the Day).

My favorite sides were definitely the goat curry, and chicken of the day. I was shoveling spoonful after spoonful of food into my mouth, the flavors and spices were just SO good! The beef rendang was good too. I&apos;ve only been to two other Indonesian restaurants in South Philly, but Hardena is definitely the best by far.

As for the ginger fried chicken, contrary to popular opinion, I just didn&apos;t think it was that great. The cumin spiced chicken was better, and juicier.

Next time, we&apos;re totally getting the not-pizza box!"
5,"Hardena is AMAZING. Best little gem in this part of south philly. Whether you love meat or are vegan, there&apos;s a bunch of options for your meal platter. I always love their eggplant, tofu, seitan, jackfruit, and beef rendeng! I believe you can only call to order, but that is the best way. They do take credit card/debit card. Be prepared to wait at their door when you pick up - they&apos;re trying to be safe with the pandemic and all. 

Mondays they open their orders for NotPizza boxes which are super huge portions of mostly meat, veggies from their entree sections, and some rice. It could feed about 4 ish amount of people? $80, but it&apos;s so bomb. Their slots for orders (whole week, not weekend, as that is reserved for vegan/vegetarian boxes), run out quick so hurry!!!! I wish I wasn&apos;t broke so I can get some right now."
5,"I loved Hardena when they were opened normally before COVID, but now they actually have an amazing takeout option during these times called the #notpizza box!  I would highly recommend checking out their instagram and trying to snag one.  The box feeds a family of four, and between my partner and I we made it stretch for a hearty dinner into lunch leftovers.  We loved every single item - from spicy potatoes to different curries, we were exposed to a number of different really amazing dishes all in one box. 

As you can see from the photo, this pizza box is truly filled to the brim with all kinds of delicious dishes.  They had a whole fish in there too, plenty of rice, and a lot of veggies.  I feel like I&apos;m not encapsulating how amazing the experience was, so you all will just have to order one for yourself! For people who aren&apos;t meat eaters, they also have a vegetarian version of this.  I can&apos;t recommend this enough - it was assembled with a lot of love, and worth every single delicious, colorful bite.  I can say with confidence, the #notpizza box is such a creative take on takeout and I would honestly order it again as a treat."
3,"This is such a cool spot to eat at - you literally cannot find much like this. For the record, this experience comes pre-covid. 

Literally, you could drive right by this restaurant - little corner spot, looks like you are walking into a home. They even make the inside look and feel like that a bit. Super cozy, lots of warm colors/art/textures and you just get smacked with that initial woff of Indonesian scented cuisine. You wanna know why? This tiny space is like an open-air cafeteria style restaurant. 

With its limited seating and serving style, you get immediate service, which is nice. 

This is an ultimate bang for your buck - super affordable for GREAT food. Just beware, it is spicy!!"
4,"This restaurant is really popular now, I think because it was on TV recently. It&apos;s a tiny little corner place that you wouldn&apos;t expect to serve such great Indonesian food. I had never had Indonesian food before, but really enjoyed their offerings. My favorite item was the ginger chicken. It is covered in ginger and other spices, then fried. It&apos;s packed with flavor, very moist, with a good crispy texture. We also had the beef rendang (kinda like a stew). The meat was really flavorful and tender. There were some pieces that were tough and had some gristle, but wasn&apos;t a big issue. Their corn fritters are also super delicious. Next time, I need to try their satay, which I&apos;ve heard is awesome and super authentic."
5,"You know it&apos;s going to be a special meal when you see people standing around outside (socially distanced, of course) waiting patiently for their takeout during a pandemic - and in the RAIN! (Yes, really. Not a drizzle, but actual, straight-up rain.)

But no one is mad about the wait because they know what wonders await at the other end of it. Yup folks, the food here is every bit worth the hype. Absolutely delicious flavors to tantalize your tastebuds. The beef was oh-so-very-tender. The chicken, with the skin on, had me scooping up the next spoonful before I&apos;d even halfway finished chewing the one before it. And don&apos;t get me started on the way the rice soaks up all that heavenly curry flavor...

When I first saw the menu, I thought surely the low prices had to be a mistake, or an older version of the menu. NOPE. Such a bargain, especially for the amount of food you&apos;re getting. 

Like I said, you will wait for your food; we waited half an hour for ours, as there were numerous others already in line before us. 

It will be worth it. 

Don&apos;t hate on the wait. Spend it thinking about what wonderfully authentic Indonesian delicacies are being cooked up especially for you. 

Now go."
4,"A sweet family owned Indonesian restaurant with cozy homemade food. I&apos;ve tried their not-pizza box and their other entrees as well, and their veggie dishes are some of the best dishes on their menu!

I really enjoy their tempeh and tofu, eggplant, egg and tofu curry, and I heard their coconut collards are also worth trying. With very reasonable prices for a nice, delicious home cooked meal - it&apos;s a great place to check out."
5,"Times feel Hard(ena) right now and it feels like everything is all Waroeng. If you need a pick me up during this weird quarantine time, be Surabaya large takeout container (or 2 or 3) from everyone&apos;s favorite Indonesian hidden gem and support a local minority opened business. Maybe when you pick it up they will be using PPE in the form of a gigantic inflatable T-Rex suit and put a smile on your face, but if you are not that lucky, you will still have something comforting and delicious to take you through this time. 

My recommendations are the beef rendang and the collards but everything is delicious and they have lot of of vegetarian and vegan friendly dishes like egg curry, tempeh, and jackfruit curry and great meat things like sate and goat curry. Don&apos;t forget the sambal hot sauce! Over the years I&apos;ve come here for many dinners with friends (you can bring wine and there&apos;s not a ton of seating so you may have to wait), a birthday dinner for my sister (parent approved), and gotten takeout for someone who requested it as their last meal before leaving Philly (and the first thing she requested when she came back to visit). It&apos;s no frills and people don&apos;t like too long, even when drinking wine out of plastic cups. You stand in line to order kind of like a cafeteria, but it feels homey and cozy, unlike a cafeteria.

The owners are lovely and they need your support during this time! They are taking lots of precautions and offering no contact takeout- call ahead and give your card and they will bring it out for you. I promise you will not be disappointed."
5,"I&apos;ve ordered take-out from here twice, for me and my friends and we were not disappointed. The portions were enormous for me, which is great for the price you&apos;re getting! It was filling and one time I ordered on the weekend and went on a limb and tried the jackfruit (the vegan option) and it was delicious, very tender, savory and sweet, texture was like tender pulled beef, I would recommend. I&apos;ve also tried the beef rendang and it was also great. If you like spice, ask for sambal (I love their sambal, could get a container of it alone to put on everything haha). 

So happy to see this small business opened and helping out the community while serving delicious food. I drove by here recently and saw them hold a food drive, it was truly amazing to see!"
5,"This place is just amazing. 

My plate of food was $8! Insane. I&apos;m vegan and I really appreciated how the staff was knowledgeable about their vegan dishes. 

I had their collard greens and tempeh/tofu with rice. It was absolutely delicious. The food was flavorful and filling. I cannot wait to come back and try more!"
5,"Wow this place was such a treat! The boyfriend and I ordered the Rijsttafel plate to share, plus a fancy pink drink, and I don&apos;t think there was one thing I disliked.

The wait was a bit long, but we expected it considering how much food we were getting. Since the restaurant is tiny and the demand is the size of South Philly, the wait in line can feel like hours and seeing every seat taken can feel daunting. However, since we always end up -just- beating the crowd, we got some seats by the door. Cold, but seats nevertheless.

We&apos;ve had Indonesian food before, but we don&apos;t ever really know what we&apos;re eating so we left it up to the chef to give us what they thought was good. Every meat dish was super well seasoned and perfectly cooked, but I&apos;m always surprised at how well Indonesians do veggie dishes. Tempeh and tofu and veggies, oh my! I would love to come here again and again, and at some point learn what the food actually is called for my inevitable trip overseas one day."
5,"Got take out from here last weekend during the time of COVID. Food was excellent! Service was a bit slow but that was just because they were super busy. 

Called to place an order for dinner for take out on a Saturday. Called by 5 or so and they were already out of Satay and goat which was sad! Ordered a Nasi campur with beef randang and collard greens and cendol. A hefty helping of food for not much money at all! Beef was super tender and delicious. Mix of spices was great. The collard greens came in coconut curry/sauce and were great. Tender and not bitter at all. Everything was also not super salty. The cendol was different but delicious as well. Nice mix of flavors and not super sweet like bubble tea. Straw they gave with it was way to small to eat the little jellies at the bottom. 

Service was a bit spotty. When I went to pick up the food there were at least 10 people waiting outside. No one would answer the door if you knocked or answer the phone if you call. Someone finally came out 10min later and gave me my food. They were super busy (she actually said they were unable to take any further orders at the time) but it would have been nice if they had a better system, since it seems like its always like this. 

Excellent Indonesian food (for sure the best I&apos;ve had in philly). Service was a bit eh, but I&apos;m glad they&apos;re staying busy during COVID. Check them out for sure!"
5,"I can&apos;t even begin to express how great this place is, I started going here half a year ago and I have literally never been disappointed. The food is beyond tasty and it&apos;s amazing for the price! I think the best part of this place is how many vegetarian options there are, being a vegetarian i&apos;ve never gotten the opportunity to try Indonesian food. During the pandemic they are keeping contact at a minimum by only allowing online orders and then picking up outside their door which I definitely appreciate. However, when things do get better the inside has a very nice cultural decor and the family is very nice if you are confused on what to order. The dishes are done over rice and cost $9-11 to get 2 of the stews and then $2-4 more for every add on for a max of 4. Definitely give it a go, this place will definitely not disappoint!"
5,"Indonesian food is hard to come by, and I&apos;ve been wanting to get here since I moved to Philly. Hardena posted an opportunity on Instagram for a 14&quot; pizza box full of Indonesian goodies for $60, and I realized this was my chance! They sold out almost immediately, but I was lucky enough to grab one. I&apos;ll be honest, I have no idea what some of the items I ate were, but 4 of us shared this and were all stuffed by the end. Absolutely delicious. Can&apos;t wait to come back post-Covid for an opportunity to dine-in. Terima kasih, Hardena!"
5,"NommingNomad Approved.

I&apos;ve been going here periodically over the last three years ever since I discovered it. And I have never tasted anything that is not freaking perfect ever. It is a small place that is family run and authentic with limited seating but you will feel so welcome and taken care of. They do have an a la carte menu which is served family style but I&apos;ve never tried it. 

I always get the rice and 2 veg/meat combo and I used to love their fish dish which is just amazing but now that I&apos;m no longer eating fish the tempeh tofu is my absolute favorite and a must try. I&apos;ve also tried the spinach/collard greens, the jackfruit, chicken rendang and the potatoes. Like I said, you can never go wrong with anything you get. 

If you like the spicier things in life, definitely go for the sambal that comes with the meal. All in all I love it and when I need a tummy hug, I know where to go!"
5,"This place became an instant favorite for my girlfriend and I after just one visit. I dare you to find a place that will keep you stuffed for two meals on just $8-10/person. When you walk into this unassuming corner store, you will see a small counter that displays 8-10 dishes. On your platter, you can choose to get two of those selections to go with your mountain of rice. The dishes rotate, but some of their most popular dishes stick around. Everything I have tried has been amazing, but my personal favorite has to be the super flavor and tender beef rendang. Their oseng tempeh is also a great choice. You would never be able to guess that the dish is vegan with the amazing umami flavor. You can always opt to get more side dishes at a small cost and honestly, I&apos;m always tempted to get all of them."
5,"Love the love this mom and pop shop is receiving. Sisters are so nice and help explaining what the options are. Beef rendang is tender, fragrant, and flavorful. Fish curry is also wonderful but sometimes have a few small bones so be aware. Shrimp crackers are a must!
Enjoy!"
5,"OMG, Hardena/Waroeng Surabaya Restaurant was truly amazing. Very cool and different. Hardena/Waroeng Surabaya Restaurant is one of these spots where all the menu items look terrific, I had Ayam and it was very good. Staff is super helpful and definitely will help you with everything. Amazing. Hardena/Waroeng Surabaya Restaurant did not disappoint."
4,"Your typical Asian food stall, roadside or at a food center; tastes EXACTLY like home. I got the beef rendang, tempeh and tahu telur over rice with an extra serving of belacan chili. It&apos;s 3x what I would pay in Singapore, but I gladly parted with my money."
5,Truly amazing food. Love love LOVE! I&apos;ve gotten the out during COVID. Awesome option for PB neighborhood.
