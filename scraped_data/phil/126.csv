5,"Stellar bakery with an easy to navigate online ordering and pickup system. Though the chocolate babka stole the show, their cookies are excellent too! The brookie (brownie &amp; chocolate chip) was good pairing with their fresh brewed coffee."
5,"On a walk today and craved some sweet. Searched for a bakery and found a gem. A small group of people were outside socially distancing waiting their turn to approach and pick up their treats. Lisa was working today, she commented on my Vote today in philly shirt and we briefly chatted about the importance of voting. I&apos;m going to enjoy my baked goods now, check back soon for the rest of the review."
5,"Like the cheap person that I am, I went for their $1 chocolate chip cookie promotion -- and I will definitely be back for more! Their cookie is generous in size and so rich in flavor without being overwhelmingly sweet. Layers of dark chocolate with some pinches of salt for balance, and overall a very chewy cookie. I called ahead on my way there and had it in my hands almost as soon as I got there. They take Venmo for payment during this pandemic which is also a good precautionary option to have!"
5,"This is my absolute favorite place to get coffee in the city. 

In fact, my friend knows me so well that she got me a gift certificate for The Bakeshop on 20th for my birthday so I could keep treating myself to the most delicious goodies and coffee of all time... 

What do I do? I lost the prized possession before I even had a chance to lose it.

To be honest, I figured I was s*** out of luck... but called the bakery just out of curiosity. The amazing team helped me and worked with me in contacting Lisa who helped provide me with a solution. 

Every single time I am in the shop, on a rainy cold day or during the weekend morning rush, the employees are so friendly and customer service is always great. 

I&apos;m Gluten Free but there are still plenty of delicious options like the soups and toasts on GF bread. Perfect place to grab dessert for a party or baked goods for brunch, just a cup of joe or sit down for lunch. Highly highly recommend the food but the team is truly the cherry on top."
4,"My friends and I stopped by here one snowy afternoon. They were short staffed but still tended to our orders pretty quickly. I had a delicious Nutella muffin and a coffee. The muffin was so fresh and flavorful, but the coffee was on the lukewarm side. They all take proper COVID precautions which I always appreciate. You can either order at the door or over the phone for pick up. The menu has a wide selection, and I&apos;ll definitely be stopping by again!"
3,"The birthday blondie was a little too sweet and it felt like both the frosting and the cake bar component were missing a little something extra in terms of flavoring--can&apos;t quite figure out what it is. I think I was expecting a punchier, more full-flavored dessert (maybe more butter or salt could&apos;ve helped?) The brownie was excellent though, and the brookie was pretty good too, although I wish it had been a bit thicker and chewier. I think I should&apos;ve ordered more along the lines of the muffins/scones, but the child in me wanted to try these treats."
5,"Incredible lox sandwich (Smoked Salmon Special Sandwich)! They use the freshest, highest quality ingredients that really come together well. Highly recommend this place. Their baked goods smelled incredible though I didn&apos;t get any today, I&apos;m looking forward to getting some in the future!"
5,"Love this place!! Order &amp; pick up is super easy. You can call, order online or order delivery. I usually call because I want to see what they have for the day. 

Seriously, one of the BEST brownies you&apos;ll have in the city, but my favorite thing to order here are the scones. Up to this point my favorites have been the cherry scones and the apricot scones. 

Definitely one of the best local bakeries!! Make sure to stop in and pick up a treat (or two... or three...) to-go!"
5,"I had such a wonderful experience here. Coming in I was met with the delicious smell of bacon in the air. The atmosphere was very comforting and I appreciated all the precautions they are taking. All the treats I got were absolutely mouthwatering! My favorites were the maple cookies and the iced oatmeal raisin cookie. I also really enjoyed the ricotta cookie and the spiced cookie. The portions are quite generous and I look forward to my leftovers. I can&apos;t wait to try more things, sweet and savory. The owner was extremely friendly and went through all the desserts they still had available. I will definitely be back to try some scones."
5,Best bakery in the Rittenhouse area. My favorite sweets are the birthday bar blondie and Italian ricotta cookie. The scones and made to order sandwiches also sound great - hope to try them in the future!
5,"Stopped in for the first time to grab a breakfast sandwich and coffee. Very cute place with some amazing looking pastries! The bacon, egg and cheese was delicious and perfectly assembled. The coffee was great too. The people seemed really nice and were definitely working hard as there was a line of loyal customers waiting outside. I highly recommend giving The Bakeshop on 20th your business!"
3,Go early if you want anything here. We were super excited about their scones and chocolate croissant but they were out of almost everything. We settled for a plain croissant and hot chocolate. Both was average. But I will be going back for the scones.
5,"Unique, pricy, quality. 

The Bakeshop on 20th has pleasant staff onsite with a very unique decor to it. From in and out you can tell management put heart into making this place happen. It has anything from cold brewed coffee to chocolate fudge brownie. OMG! The brownie is out of this world. Its tender with a slight chocolate crust on top. The price of the brownie was a surprise to me. It was almost 5 dollars for not big of a piece. Considering how good of the brownie it is I would say it&apos;s worth the price. I highly recommend it. Overall, if you are in Philly and you are in a mood for some delicious and unique desserts the Bakeshop on the 20th could be a great option for you. 

PS if you check in with Yelp app, you will get 1 dollar OFF a cookie! 

Thank you for reading this and I hope you find this helpful."
5,"The baked goods are good, but the coffee is amazing! The vanilla latte is a teeny tiny bit sweet, but there are flecks of real vanilla, and the coffee is still strong. Would highly recommend!"
5,"Such a great bakery. I have been here pre and post pandemic 4 or 5 times and have also had their pastries at my office. The bakery is fairly small with a couple of seats and just enough room for a few people to stand in line. The workers are so sweet and clearly excited to share their love of pastries with the masses.

I have had the chocolate chip cookie, Brookie, chocolate fudge brownie, oat walnut brownie, blueberry swirl muffin, chocolate Nutella muffin, coffee cake, chocolate chip scone and maple oat scone. All phenomenal. 

I tend to frequently enjoy the Nutella Muffin, Brookie, and Chocolate Chip Scone. My least favorite is the maple oat scone because it is made with shredded coconut which I don&apos;t prefer.

I need to wake up earlier because the babkas sell out instantly and I have yet to try it. One day. Either way I&apos;m just as content consuming whatever they have left once I mosey on in during the late afternoon."
4,"Sweet little spot that&apos;s still open during covid. 

It&apos;s nice to be able to grab some sugary treats during these stressful times. I swung by for one of their tasty ricotta cookies a few weeks ago (called ahead and venmoed them), and really enjoyed sharing it with my roommate. I also saw that they were available during this time on the Ritual app, if you happen to have app credits to use up from there. 

The items at the Bakeshop on 20th can be a bit pricey but hey, you&apos;re helping a local business and sometimes you just gotta treat yo&apos;self!"
5,"I&apos;ve been here ~10 times. Great service, amazing baked goods. My go-to is the birthday cake blondie. I also have had their food/breakfast menu- the grilled cheese is delicious. 

It&apos;s a small shop but they do have indoor and outdoor seating.

Suggestion: go in the morning. They bake fresh and sell out fast."
5,"I have to admit, The Bakeshop on 20th was definitely extremely good. The atmosphere in this location is great. I don&apos;t think I have ever had such an amazing meal, Avocado Toast Special Sandwich was just unbelievable. The staff is super welcoming also. I can come here every day."
5,"I&apos;ve had the pleasure of enjoying Bakeshop on 20th twice during the COVID-19 pandemic. The first one was when a thoughtful friend had an assortment of delectable baked goods delivered in celebration of my birthday. The second was when I called in an order of Avocado Toast and a Chocolate Chip Cookie, inspired by the $1 cookie deal (still going!) in celebration of Yelp&apos;s Sweet 16 birthday. loved the options for contactless payment either via credit card or via Venmo (tip: don&apos;t be confused that the name Lisa Cosgrove goes with the Venmo handle @Bakeshopon20th). Their baked goods are all fantastic and definitely a nice pick-me-up during the pandemic!"
4,This place is super tiny and a super cute bakery/cafe that my friend and I ran into during our lunch break! What I love about this place is just how homey it is but i would say that the baked goods are overpriced for the quality. The cinnamon bun I had looked delicious but its taste wasn&apos;t completely there -- I definitely would have liked it a lot better if it was warmed in-house. With that said super cute and give this Rittenhouse bakery a look : )
