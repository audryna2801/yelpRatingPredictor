5,"Thinking about making J&apos;aime my new spot for pastries in the morning whenever I need to stop by my office. Move over, Starbucks! 

The entire place is appealing. I didn&apos;t really know what to expect when I got there, but I loved it. They had a sign displayed outside that stated only 2 customers were allowed in at a time and masks are required. 
Inside, it was bright and airy, the music was soft and the pastries looked heavenly. J&apos;aime also sells baguettes and other breads. The girls behind the counter who took care of us were such sweeties and offered to cut up a loaf of bread into slices for my friend who accompanied me. 

I got the lemon tartlet because for some odd reason I wasn&apos;t craving anything chocolatey. It sat in the refrigerator for most of the day because I wanted to ensure the merengue stayed in tact. When I got home, I cracked the box open and went to town! The lemon flavor was absolutely perfect. Not too tangy and not too sweet. The merengue was fluffy and melted in my mouth. Crust was buttery and flaky. There&apos;s no reason why someone would hate this thing. I noticed they have a berry tartlet available so that&apos;s next on my list to try. 

Overall, a VERY cute French bakery with several options for everyone! Definitely recommend J&apos;aime for your morning cup of Joe and a delicious bakery item."
5,"My wife had a Doctor&apos;s appointment around the corner so we stopped by for an AM pastry. The staff was so kind and friendly. The restaurant was spotless. We tried three types of croissants and took a french baguette to go. All three croissants were flakey and buttery. Everything you&apos;d want in a croissant. The chocolate pretzel croissant was super yummy! Highly recommend. Can&apos;t wait to come back! 

Also, I&apos;m very COVID conscious and I felt very safe picking up food to go here. Big thanks to the staff!"
5,Super cute bakery with a large assortment of drinks and pastries! Very open inside which would be good for social distancing and two outdoor tables that have turned over quickly while we were here. They were also accommodating--they have crepes and were happy to customize one for me. There was a lot more available for food than I expected!
4,"J&apos;aime is a solid go-to whenever we are craving some pastries. It&apos;s a popular spot on the weekends, so go early as they tend to sell out of items. 

I have been a fan of everything I&apos;ve tried there so far. The sweet items are just the right amount of sweet and everything is baked to flaky perfection. I haven&apos;t tried any of their drinks, but it seems like a regular morning coffee spot for many.

As of right now there is limited indoor seating and a couple outdoor tables as well. Off the main street so it&apos;s nice and quiet, perfect for munching and people watching!"
3,"It&apos;s hard to write a review based on my one experience with a bakery. Ordered Buche de Noel desert for Christmas as Metropolitan bakery was sold out. Was really excited to order it and the owner was really nice. Cake was creamy and tasty but I was so underwhelmed with how unimpressively decorated the cake was ( my family was too). 6 measly cranberries which didn&apos;t even look like real sugared cranberries, no greenery etc. I&apos;ve seen unprofessional cakes decorated better. When it&apos;s ordered for a holiday table it&apos;s especially disappointing. We got some croissants as well. They were pretty good but not as good as in the French bakery near me ( La Baguette Magique). I would be hesitant to order the cake for occasion again . However, I&apos;d stop again for coffee and pastry if in the neighborhood and will update the review."
4,"I will admit, I did feel like I was swept back to Paris when I entered this bakery.  They had all the classics from croissants to crepes and baguettes.  After visiting Paris it is hard for us to order croissants from anywhere else (yes I am that kind of snob now) so we decided on a crepe and baguette with jam and butter.  A place that can make simple bread and butter tastes good always is an excellent mark for a place in my book.  I would eat that baguette everyday and be happy.  I think it is hard to mess up a crepe and this one hit the spot for us, went for a simple raspberry lemon one.  Think this a lovely spot if you want to hang out and enjoy your coffee and breakfast on the weekend."
4,"In my quest to try as many French pastries as I could in my short time in Philly, I dropped by J&apos;aime as pictures and reviews made this place look amazing.

J&apos;aime seems to be nestled in the middle of a Philly gaybourhood, which I always personally enjoy. Its a brightly lit space that is quiet enough to sit and chat with friends or even use as a study/work space. It is rather small though so I&apos;m not sure whether or not it&apos;d be conducive to a lot of people working.

Pastry wise the fare is pretty average. The 4 star rating includes the ambiance and location as otherwise, I&apos;d probably rate closer to a 3.5 on food alone. I got a Paris Philadelphia, which to me is just a Paris-Brest with a strange name. Flavor-wise it was good, strong praline/hazelnut flavor in the cream. My friend thought the cream could be lighter but I&apos;ve never had trouble downing just chunks of butter so personal preference. The choux pastry felt a bit soggy and not as light and crisp as I&apos;d prefer, but this may just be because I got one towards the later afternoon so it was probably sitting out for some time. Overall, it was a good pastry, nothing standout and pretty one note.

The same could be said about the Lemon tart. Again, the flavor was strong of lemon and there was acidity but it was very one note. Nothing special or stand out with this pastry either. The tart base itself was pretty well made, held up to the custard well and kept its texture. My friend made a comment that the custard felt grainy but I don&apos;t think I noticed it as I attributed the graininess to the tart itself.

Overall, its a nice place to sit and chill and get a craving out if you&apos;re looking for some pastries."
5,"Very fast service. Cute coffee shop
Good for a place to study or to come for a catch up/date - all the tables seem to fit two. 
They offer an array of pastries for very decent prices like croissant for $3 - and your typical cafe drinks."
3,"I had high hopes for this french bakery. It&apos;s cute for sure, but none of the pastries really moved me. I only tried the pastries and no coffee. I had the Lemon Pound Cake, Apple Turnover, Almond Croissant and Chocolate Croissant. 

The pound cake was dry enough said. The Apple turnover was delicious, very good ratio of filling to pastry and the flakiness was outstanding. Both the chocolate and almond croissant were on the overcooked side and I&apos;ve had much better. 

Overall:
Lemon Pound Cake 2/5
Apple Turnover 5/5
Chocolate Croissant 3/5
Almond Croissant 3/5"
5,Very cute bakery!! And it&apos;s the spelling of my name so even better. Friendly customer service. Great coffee and almond croissant! Recommend!!
5,J&apos;aime kills it! Great pastries and awesome t-shirts! Will definitely go back anytime I&apos;m in Philly.
3,"The review is for the canele. It&apos;s chewy with thick outer crust. It&apos;s not too sweet but it&apos;s missing the citrus and rum flavor.

As always service is great"
5,"A really good bakery! It has a nice and cozy, but modern atmosphere. The staff is also very friendly! When i went there I was pleasantly greeted w a display of desserts, and I would recommend the Paris Philadelphia! It&apos;s is good! It has almost a hazelnut taste while adorn w almonds!"
5,"Cute little french bakery, with a wide selection of pastries to eat. Also great ambiance to do some work as it wasn&apos;t too loud and wifi was speedily fast, and they make a wide selections of coffees. Baristas were really friendly and accomodating, and their coffees (got an Iced latte for ~$3) was surprisingly good and tasty. Lots of tables at back to do work and sit. The whole decor feels like your transported to a coffee shop in Paris, and a cool place to hangout with a friend or invite a date over. Would definitely come back here!"
5,"Cute place, nice staff, great pastries. It was my first name having a Napoleon (flaky with vanilla cream in the middle), and it was amazing. My standards for it are probably too high now. The seating areas are cute and comfortable. I got the 15% discount when I told the cashier I would write a Yelp review. My Napoleon and green tea ended up being $8ish total. Definitely recommend!"
5,"I really enjoyed visiting this bakery! It was on a weekday, right before the store hours ended. It&apos;s a beautiful, quaint shop, with unique relaxing detail. The clerk was friendly and patient with me as I decided on what to get. Although the bakery was close to ending time, the pastries were still fresh and that makes all the difference! Happy to visit the bakery again!"
4,"Waaaaaay too convenient to the PATCO stop at 12th and Locust.

This sleek, bright and airy coffee and pastry shop is adorable, with big open doors / windows that open up to the street when the weather is nice.

It&apos;s no Dunkin Donuts. You&apos;re going to pay a fairly expensive price for handmade pastries and strong coffee.

Pay up, pick a seat and relax. Pretend that instead of downtown Philly, you&apos;re at a French patisseries in Paris. Minus the smoking. And petite yappie dogs sitting beside you in a chair."
5,"Fabulous bakery with kind and caring employees! I had pre-ordered a dozen chocolate croissants for Mother&apos;s Day and when I got to the bakery, they did not know what I was talking about. I was pretty upset, as I had specifically called before hand so I could be prepared. The employees apologized profusely and offered me a small box of free macaroons to enjoy while I waited the 20 minutes for the croissants to bake. The croissants were so delicious and the iced americano with oat milk was smooth and creamy, just the way I like it. I will definitely be back!"
5,"The location is quite convenient, and the restaurant itself is beautiful, and the food is just delicious, totally worth the try."
4,"Lovely french café. Very simple and straightforward, which is great. Would definitely recommend to stop by on the way to one of the parks around. 

Covid: masks on, limited capacity to 2 people at a time"
