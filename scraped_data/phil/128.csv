5,"Been coming here for a few years now, always just as good as the last. Service is always somehow more pleasant and consistent than most places in the city. I&apos;ve been twice during covid and even with the outdoor seating service has been quick, friendly and helpful. Dogs are always good, i&apos;ve found my favorite to be the Kansas City Beefs. Good beer choices, always a solid place to come to."
5,"Excellent service. They were closed for a while because of the COVID19 pandemic, but recently reopened. Temporarily you can only eat outdoors, but the experience was magnificent. Very helpful staff, and mouth-watering food. They even bring a large bottle of hand sanitizer to every table. Magnificent restaurant with unique concept. They have unique hotdogs with inspiration and flavor from all over the world"
4,"They have outdoor and indoor seating. The staff there is very friendly. You pull up the menu by scanning a QR code.  You can either order one of their signature dogs or create your own by picking the type of meat (protein) and condiments/toppings. If you decide to make your own, beware of the paradox of choice. I took the easy route and got the Vietnam Duck dog, a duck hot dog Vietnam style. I started off eating out on the patio, but quickly went inside after it started to rain.

The dogs are instagram ready and also tasty.  They almost look too good to eat.  The restaurant also has a limited cocktail menu and a full bar. I order a couple of cocktails with my dinner they were stiff and pretty good"
4,"Visited Destination Dogs on a day trip to Philadelphia. The restaurant is much larger than I expected, but it was still only outdoor dining due to COVID-19.

We took one of the tables outside, and the waiter came to tell us menus are now available by scanning the QR code on the table. The menu has been simplified. Now you choose a sausage, and the style (condiments) you want on it. I got the lamb sausage English style, which came with cheese sauce, grilled onion, ketchup, and pickle. I really liked the lamb sausage, cuz it tasted heavily of lamb.

For an appetizer, my girlfriend and I split the Patatas Ridiculas, which was tater tots topped with Bacon, Duck Confit, House-made Cheese Sauce, Pickled Jalapenos, Jack Cheese, Sour Cream and Scallions. 

Service was good, prices are fair considering the exotic nature of these hot dogs."
4,"3.5 stars. Travel the world via hot dogs! Well, loosely speaking. These are inspired iterations, so as long as you don&apos;t come in with expectations of authenticity, you&apos;ll probably enjoy the food... especially since the hot dog list is insanely long.

I got the Bun Mi (Cantonese sausage with shaved foie gras, pickled vegetables, fresh jalape√±os, Sriracha mayo, and cilantro) and The Poi Boy (wild boar sausage with pork belly, pineapple relish, teriyaki, and honey dijon mustard). The Bun Mi tasted pretty good, since you can&apos;t go wrong with pickled veggies and Sriracha mayo, but the sausage wasn&apos;t Cantonese sausage. It was just a regular hot dog. That was a little puzzling. The Poi Boy, on the other hand, was so damn delicious. The wild boar sausage had a really strong, slightly smoky flavor, and the toppings added a great touch of sweetness to the hot dog.

My friend got the One Bite in Bangkok (Python sausage, cucumber salad, pepper jelly, crushed peanuts, and cilantro) and Charles Dog Gaulle (duck sausage with duck confit, shaved foie gras, diced cornichon, and dijon mustard). I tried both and liked the One Bite in Bangkok, but the Charles Dog Gaulle was bland. Plus, my friend said the latter had no hint of duck confit, which annoyed him.

The Brazillionaire cocktail was very good. I wouldn&apos;t expect anything less from a mix of cachaca (distilled from fermented sugarcane juice), soursoup, brazil nut, and lime.

The service wasn&apos;t great considering how empty the place was when we went. Our waitress was nice, but we couldn&apos;t find her half the time, and the rest of the waitstaff was just huddled up by the bar chatting even when we were looking for help. It&apos;s not a huge deal, though, and not enough to deter me from returning."
5,"Thank goodness for Yelp, because we probably would&apos;ve never found this gem without it!

Atmosphere: HUGE inside! Not what you&apos;d expect from a hotdog joint. Lots of tables, bar seating and high tops. Also a little section of vintage arcade games.

Service: Friendly and quick, although we did come on a Monday at noon. The place was quiet for the most part.

Starters: The apps blew us all away! The patatas were awesome. Absolutely order those. The truffle fries were tasty and crisp, the buffalo wings were too spicy, and the scotch egg (actually my first time trying one) was delicious. There wasn&apos;t a crumb left! 

Dogs: Holy huge! We all ordered two, and while we have no regrets, one would do just fine. There&apos;s a lot of bread going on and they are big, so it&apos;s a lot to try and bite into. Recommend cutting your bun down to the bottom to get a better grasp! 

Overall, it was a fresh menu with lots of fun twists."
5,"My friend suggested lunching here and I wasn&apos;t sure how it&apos;d go. I&apos;m not a huge hot dog person unless it&apos;s the perfect texture and flavor. 

Considering I&apos;m already craving a repeat lunch, I&apos;d say I&apos;m a convert. 

I ordered the German dog but subbed an all beef hotdog for the bratwurst. The beef dog had the perfect snap and flavor. The bun was buttery and sturdy enough to withstand the weight of all the toppings. Truffle fries were good but the hot dog was absolutely the star!"
5,"This review is from March 2020. We LOVED this restaurant and cannot wait to come back! The dogs are so creative and delicious - such a burst of flavors! The highlight was a real bread bun and not that cheap tasteless fake bread store bought hot dog bun you usually get at fast food places. I got the Louisiana dog with gator sausage. There are so many different meats to choose from, even snake (yikes!). The cocktails are just as interesting. We sat at the bar and really enjoyed it. The place is very modern and relaxing."
4,"My friend and I usually like to come here late night and do takeout since we live down the street. 
I have never actually dined in here but I would like to because I want to try other things on the menu. 
We usually try to order different destination dogs, but my favorite so far has got to be the Poi Boy (wild boar sausage, pork belly, teriyaki sauce, pineapples). It was so delicious. 
The service here for takeout is extremely well, the bartender was very friendly to us while we were ordering and waiting for our food. 
I really liked the atmosphere, and the layout of the restaurant (the bar in the front and outdoor sitting and the twinkle lights outside)."
4,"Had a friend tell me about this spot and so glad I stopped by! With COVID, they do offer outdoor and some indoor seating. The buns are HUGE and so is the sausage link! There&apos;s so many options to pick from to decorate your glizzy. They also have a full bar which is great! I&apos;ll be returning to try some other flavors they have to offer."
5,"Destination Dogs is a fun spot! They have hot dogs from all over the place (though, recently we popped in with a friend from out of town who noticed there&apos;s no Seattle Dog, or cream cheese to build-your-own!) and it&apos;s a fun way to try some new flavors and feel like you&apos;re getting out of town for a bit. I love the corn dog bites, but I wish they had a corn dog on the menu in some other way as meat on a stick is always fun.

The beer selection changes. On this recent visit they had Naturdays which I had never heard of but it&apos;s a lemonade type beer from Natural Ice (Natty Ice!) and was not as terrible as you might think. We actually picked up a case at the store after trying it here.

They have cornhole and other games in the back. I think most recently we noticed they have TMNT so you don&apos;t have to go all the way to Barcade for that joy.

Bartenders are a joy. Food and vibe is fun. Great beer selection. Definitely give it a try!"
4,"For bar only: 

I don&apos;t usually think of a hotdog joint as a great place for a drink but this was surprisingly enjoyable. Somewhat limited options but well-made drinks at reasonable prices.

Bar staff was friendly and prompt."
4,"Loved this place. They make their own hotdogs, which vary but meat and flavor based on the different country choice. The place wasn&apos;t too busy around lunch so we were seated right away. The service was great and speedy.

We got the breakfast hotdog and the bbq beef short rib hot dogs (forgot the country) and both were soo delicious and creative. I also have 5-6 other hot dog countries on my list for the next times I visit. The deviled eggs and truffle fries were also both super delicious.

Drink prices aren&apos;t too bad, but they have REALLY good deals during happy hours. The hot dogs are tasty but might not be filling enough for some (depending on the hot dog). That&apos;s fine though, since there are so many sides that are worth ordering to share alongside your meal.

Overall, I was a huge fan of this place. Can&apos;t really go wrong- it&apos;s unique, delicious, and not too hard on the wallet. I&apos;ll be coming back."
4,"I love destination dogs, as an aspiring comedian I would even say if you&apos;re looking for some quarantine fun, have a party in your mouth, theses hotdogs won&apos;t disappoint!! My significant other and I can&apos;t turn it the party down anytime we&apos;re around! Lol  We recently ordered take out from the limited menu and were quite satisfied as always with our hotdog selections. However the fries we ordered got really soggy and were supposed to have gravy on the side which I paid extra for so I took away a star. Even though there was a missing gravy for the fries, they put the other sauces requested on the side. One suggestion I would make, if you don&apos;t like a soggy dog, and are ordering take out, that is an dog with sauce, kraut, or cheese to get it on the side and get saucy and pour it on when you&apos;re about to grub. Otherwise you&apos;ll have soggy bread but some people like that too, so do you y&apos;all, and get your order in already!"
4,i&apos;ve been to destination dogs 3 times and really appreciated how many options they have - the traveling concept makes it fun and an experience to order each time depending on &quot;where&quot; you want to go. my only con is that the portion can be kinda small as the side is just a small tin of potato chips.
4,"The selection of sausages/dogs is the biggest I have ever seen, but since this was my first visit I opted for the beef dog and an order of fries.  The hod dog was amazing and I ordered with two sauces, I loved it.  The fries were fresh cut but well over cooked.  I didn&apos;t complain since I didn&apos;t have time for another order.  The craft beer selection was awesome and I tried the Lagunitas Day Timer IPA.  I will be back for sure and make sure to try an alligator dog."
5,"I was really surprised by Destination Dogs! I&apos;ve walked by it a million times, and it seems really non-descript but the menu is extensive and interesting, and the inside of the restaurant is actually very big as well! 

I came here to catch up with a friend, we sat outside and ate since it was nice but I did go inside briefly to use the bathroom and was pleasantly surprised by the roomy interior and the back area with a pool table and a few arcade games.  I&apos;m sure this place is popping during the weekend.

The idea of Destination Dogs is that it&apos;s a gourmet hot dog restaurant that also has a great selection of hot dogs inspired by other country&apos;s dishes.  In a move that&apos;s very out of character for me, I got the vegetarian hot dog, Veg Dog Meal-ionaire (cute).  It was incredibly delicious - the samosa filling with the sriracha mayo really did me in.  And honestly, I couldn&apos;t even tell I was eating a vegetarian hot dog, and I&apos;m a die hard carnivore.  Our waiter was so sweet, and super attentive - he also did a great job of answering any questions we had and giving us drink recommendations.  I got the Philly Punch and it was on the sweeter, fruitier side - exactly what I wanted to beat the summer heat. 

It&apos;s a really unique stop for sure - I&apos;d highly recommend if you want cheap and unusual bites, and I&apos;m to be honest not even that big of a fan of hot dogs but this place has me converted.  I can&apos;t wait to come back, which I most assuredly will be - so many of these hot dog combinations look incredible and I want to try as many as I can."
4,"I came here for lunch while on a business trip to philly. I saw they had a huge variety of hot dogs, in that variety, they have a Colombian version of a hot dog (Salchicha Vergara). As a Colombian, i was pumped to get to eat a Colombian hot dog. I took a seat at the bar and ordered my food, it came out pretty quick. At first I was a bit disappointed because Colombian hot dogs have an emphasis on putting a bunch of things on your hot dog and this one just had a few. Nonetheless i was very please once i took a bite, the bread was like no hot dog bread I&apos;ve ever had. It was really good. With my dog, i got a side of gravy fries and they were probably better than the hot dog itself."
5,"DD is an awesome pre-drink meet-up and post-drink sober up spot. In addition to the dogs, which everyone has already reviewed, the scotch eggs are on point.  Perfectly cooked with a semi-soft yoke.  
Staff is welcoming and food comes out pretty quick. No complaints!"
4,"So I hate hot dogs. I know, I know, but in my defense I don&apos;t always get to pick the Happy Hour spot. Sometimes you lose and gotta go with the groups pick and be a good sport about it. That said I, a person who hates hot dogs, ended up at Destination Dogs yesterday. 

I was prepared for, well the type of establishment that served &quot;artisanal hot dogs&quot; and what I got was a pleasant surprise. The bar was very nice, they played four different channels on the TV above and the playlist was very &quot;Golden Oldies&quot; with hits from Earth, Wind, and Fire and Bobby Caldwell. There was an arcade in the back that I thought I would enjoy for sure, because I likely wasn&apos;t going to be eating because of my statement above. 

Then I got the menu and noticed something that made me feel super goofy and it was that they don&apos;t just serve hot dogs here, they had other options for sides and starters and sausages! So while my friends, pictured, ordered a sort of build your own dog situation I got the Crab and Artichoke Dip to go with my Hurricane Cocktail. 

Everyone loved their food, myself included, I mean that dip was so good I did the move where you grab a utensil for support to get the last scoop on your tortilla. 

The service was phenomenal as well, they were accommodating and kind of funny. I like it when a bartender can crack a solid joke while also making sure I was okay. Overall, I&apos;m pretty sure I&apos;d go here and not eat a hot dog again. Maybe not for happy hour, because there didn&apos;t seem to be one here, thus the four instead of five stars."
