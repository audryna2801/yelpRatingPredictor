5,"Man I have been sleeping on this spot for years and years.  I&apos;ve had this spot bookmarked for so long, but I always put off going for some reason.  Well, I finally had the chance to come and I am so glad I came!  

Rangoon was my Christmas dinner this year.  I ordered a few items for takeout to eat.  The lady on the phone was so so so nice when I called in to make my order.  

Watercress Salad - omg this was so so so so good!!!  I ate this a bit cold/warm ish since I had to get to my hotel and it was still absolutely delicious.  Imagine if I hate it hot and fresh?  I highly recommend this!

Curry chicken - this was also amazing.  Some of the best chicken curry I&apos;ve had in a long long long time.  The flavors were all there and again, same with the eating it warm/coldish since I had to wait to eat it and it was still heavenly.  Imagine if I hate it hot and fresh?  My mind would have been blown.

Dynamite Tofu - I love tofu so much and I always get it.  I love different variations of it and this was absolutely delicious!  I highly recommend this.  It&apos;s not too fried where you feel gross.  It comes with some veggies too so this is perfect for the nonmeater and tofu lover like me!  I also ate this cold/warmish and it was still nicely fried and crispy.  Imagine if I ate it hot and fresh?  Wow!

Thousand layer bread with skewers - I am not much of a meat eater, but wow, the skewers here were delicious!  It was jam packed with flavor and it was so good even though I ate it semi cold/warm and not hot.  Imagine how much better it would&apos;ve been if I ate it hot and fresh?  The thousand layer bread though, it was a bit chewy since it got cold so that was the only thing that was just okay for me.  

Rangoon Night Market Noodle - this dish was my least favorite out of everything.  Not because it didn&apos;t taste good, but it was the dish that had the least amount of flavor.  It was a nice noodle, a bit bland so this is perfect for those that don&apos;t want a noodle that is too heavily sauced.  This was still good, but I will try a different noodle next time since I like a lot of flavor.

I can&apos;t wait to come back to try the rest of their menu.  I am so happy I finally tried this spot.  I hope they continue to stay open and people continue to support them.  Give this spot a try."
5,"I have loved this place since they opened and when I worked in town ate their lunch special once a week for a decade. The worst thing about having kids and moving to the Main Line is not eating here regularly (though I raised two children for whom frequent visits for thousand layer bread is a sacrament.  They are, unfortunately outside of my Gribhub / Doordash range. But now Chowbus makes them an option, and even though the delivery windows are not flexible, we CAN get delivery. Rangoon makes Thai / Chinese / Indian jokes. The quality of ingredients and subtlety of seasoning is like angels from heaven prepare your meal. I am still swooning half an hour after my last bite. This is a national treasure. Philadelphia is blessed by their presence."
5,Incredible Burmese food - run by 3 sisters.  Don&apos;t miss takeout during these challenging times.  Kung Pao chicken and Jungle chicken are my favorites!  It was so amazing that I got takeout 2 days in a row.  Yum.
4,"Ordered takeout on a Friday night. Grabbed a tea leaf salad, northern Burmese noodle and the banana leaf fish. 

The tea leaf salad is interesting. It&apos;s a nutty tart salad with a subtle bitterness from the tea leaf. Probably won&apos;t order it again but don&apos;t regret trying it. We got this more so as a novelty dish to try. 

The banana leaf fish was quite good. I think this would&apos;ve been better eaten fresh since it did get soggy by the time we got home. 

The northern Burmese noodles was not very good. It reminded me of a pad thai but lacked the same complexity. I would not order this again. 

Generally food is good and I&apos;d like to come back to try other things off the menu."
4,"I&apos;ve gotten so many recommendations for this place, and I&apos;m happy I finally got to try it! I called ahead and ordered for pickup and the food was ready in 20 minutes. I ordered the Watercress Salad, the Mandalay Nungyi Noodles, and the Coconut Chicken Noodle Soup.

Watercress Salad - This is a fried watercress appetizer with a tamarindy, green chutney flavored sauce that I used for dipping. Because I got takeout, it wasn&apos;t fresh and crispy due to the wait time between the dish being cooked and when I actually ate it, which made the texture less crisp. However, when I airfried the watercress for a couple minutes, it tasted as if it had just been taken out of the airfryer and was delicious.

Mandalay Nungyi Noodles - These cold rice noodles had a strong chicken flavor, as the noodles were cooked in chicken broth, and was topped with cilantro, shallots, a hard-boiled egg, and yellow cracker things. I couldn&apos;t stand the yellow crackers because they were too stale to chew. I ate these noodles with a bit of black rice vinegar and it was pretty good.

Coconut Chicken Noodle Soup - This was a creamy take on the classic chicken noodle soup. The coconut flavor was there but very very faint. This came with a hard-boiled egg, lime, cilantro, onions, and fried shallots. 

I want to come back and try Rangoon once it opens back up for dine-in after covid is over, because I think this food is best when eaten fresh. I would definitely recommend everyone try Rangoon if they are in the area!"
3,"This cuisine is presented and tastes like a mix between Indian &amp; Chinese. They use a fair share of spices, sweets, and sours -  which we enjoyed. 

The crab rangoon was tasty, a bit heavy on the cream cheese, but a delectable appetizer none the less. Would definitely recommend getting the 1000 layer bread - feels very authentic and filling. Must try the farludo and sweet rice with mango for dessert. 

Their menu is massive, but didn&apos;t feel overwhelming, and the pricing is extremely affordable. Lots of great options that left me wanting to try more. 

The restaurant itself leaves more to desire; it is just like a cookie-cutter asian decor (from the art on the wall to the tableware). This doesn&apos;t take away from the experience though."
4,"I&apos;m always on the lookout for a good Burmese restaurant, since options are beyond scant in NYC. Luckily, Philly came to the rescue with Rangoon.

Our group of seven ordered a ton of dishes: golden triangles, thousand layer bread with curry chicken sauce, rangoon crab meat dumplings, tea leaf salad, pork in mango pickled curry, Nga Chin Cho Sart (steamed fish filet in a garlic, basil, sweet and sour spicy sauce), mohinga (grouper fish cooked in lemongrass, garlic, and ginger served with thin rice noodles; listed as &quot;Festival Fish Noodle Soup&quot;), and Ahnyh Tamin (shrimp paste fried rice with sweetened pork and shredded omelette).

I thoroughly enjoyed the thousand layer bread with curry chicken sauce, the pork in mango pickled curry, and the Nga Chin Cho Sart. The latter dish was especially delightful with its spicy and sour notes. The golden triangles were also pretty tasty and reminded me of samosas. I was a little disappointed with the mohinga, which was fine but somewhat forgettable. I did enjoy getting to customize my bowl, though. As for the Ahnyh Tamin, the shrimp paste fried rice and sweetened pork were much milder than expected.

I&apos;d still return, though. There are so many things on their menu that I still want to try, like the banana leaf fish and Shan noodle soup."
4,"My wife and I and another couple picked this ethnic restaurant on a Wednesday night for variety and stimulation.  It was our first venture to a Burmese restaurant, and we were not disappointed.  

The style and taste are somewhere between Thai and Malaysian.  I ordered a Burmese specialty--Anhnawa Pan Naykyar-- which amounted to scallops, squid and mussels cooked in a spicy sour garlic sauce.  They were really good   My wife had the spinach and mushrooms, which they thought was good but not great.  I also shared the Thousand Layer Bread with potato curry sauce for a starter, which is the Burmese version of the Indonesian dish called roti-cannai. Very tasty.  My wife also had dessert which consisted of a mango with sticky rice and coconut sauce.  Also, pretty good.

The restaurant has a huge menu, which could take multiple visits to fully sample.  Here it is:  http://www.rangoonphilly.com/menu  

We&apos;ll certainly return when we are in Philadelphia.    It will be fun to compare the selections with more familiar (to us) Thai and Malaysian food.  You can also order both alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks, including regional specialties.   Park on the street, but we walked from our hotel half a mile away."
4,"Wow-eeee. This place is GOOD!

The folks at my office got a large take-out order to celebrate our co-worker&apos;s birthday. We got a wide range of things - from soups, to salads, to appetizers, to entrees. Everyone loved everything they got! I didn&apos;t hear one complaint from anyone.

Their thousand layer bread with potato dipping sauce is to die for. It&apos;s so spicy and delicious, I just couldn&apos;t believe how yummy it was. Definitely don&apos;t skip it!

The crab rangoons were amazing. I thought &quot;oh, these will be good&quot; but then when I bit into the filling I realized that they were really, really, really, REALLY good. I didn&apos;t even need any of the dipping sauce that came with them.

I was sad that their online menu didn&apos;t have the Northern Burmese Noodles as an option to order - because that&apos;s what I really wanted - but I got the rice stick noodles instead. They were spicy and delicious, so it all worked out.

I&apos;m down with Rangoon. I&apos;ll definitely return."
4,"Burmese cuisine is quite rare to find, so I was pleasantly surprised that there was an entire Burmese restaurant in the city. I came here with a Burmese friend, and she too had never actually been to a Burmese restaurant, only home cooked meals. The food was yummy and seemed to be fairly authentic.

We started off with the Thousand Layer Bread with Curry Chicken sauce and it was wonderful! The bread reminded me of Chinese scallion pancakes and the curry was flavorful. There were only like two little chunks of chicken in there, but that it was just a small appetizer.

I ordered the Banana Leaf Fish and it was great. The fish was perfectly cooked to be crispy on the outside, tender and fluffy on the inside. I could taste the coconut and all the spices in the yummy curry sauce as well. It was a big portion, but then I later realized how pricy the dish was comparatively and wonder if it was meant to be shared. My friend ordered a noodle dish that she enjoyed as well.

We came in at very off-peak hours and were the only ones in the restaurant for half of the meal with a couple more parties trickling later. The server and other employees seemed preoccupied with doing food prep in the corner, so we and the other customers did have to get up and get their attention whenever we needed something. Nevertheless, our server was very kind and courteous whenever we did interact, so considering the time of day I&apos;m not mad about the service.

Overall, we had a satisfying meal and I would definitely come back to try some more Burmese dishes here!"
5,"This was my second time coming to Rangoon, and the last time was a few years ago. The food was even better than I remembered. 

FYI - most people think they don&apos;t take reservations, but they will take reservations by phone. 

Thousand layer bread, crab dumplings (more cream cheesy than crabby), and chicken satay were delicious, and tea leaf salad was good as well (could use more tea leaf). We also got a noodle and curry dish that I don&apos;t remember the names of, but the chili chicken was really good. It was just the right balance of sweet, spicy, sour, and savory, and it tasted great with the golden rice. Just wish it wasn&apos;t so deep fried. 

Look forward to coming back again!"
4,Came here for dinner. Space is big on inside. We started off with the thousand bread with potatoe curry. The bread was excellent but sauce was v weak. Too much potatoes in plate and not enough sauce to dip the bread in. Felt overpriced. The entrees we got the beef curry and chilli chicken. Chicken felt like fried popcorn style. Was not spicy at all. The beef curry had more spice to it. The curry sauce was really tasty (wish they brought that out with bread to dip in). Overall was good.
4,"I&apos;ve wanted to eat here for ages and for some reason it took more than a year of living a block away to finally make it happen. Well I finally did this week and was very happy with it. I&apos;ve rated it four stars for now because that&apos;s how much I enjoyed my overall meal. But the thing is, I still fully expect to be able to move the score up to five stars as soon as I stop in again. I think the difference from a four-star experience and a five-star one here will just be a matter of ordering better, because they did a great job on everything I tried, it&apos;s just that a couple of those things aren&apos;t really in my wheelhouse.

My table shared an order of the thousand-layer bread with chicken curry, golden triangles/potato samosas, and spring rolls, and then I had an order of mango chicken with a side of coconut rice (rice does not come default with dishes here and will cost you $4). 

The spring rolls were my least favorite thing I had, but that&apos;s just because of how prominent the mushrooms were in it. A lot of southeast Asian spring rolls have some mushroom in them, but usually they&apos;re thin enough and balanced enough by other fillers that I can enjoy the rolls despite hating mushrooms. Not so here - these spring rolls have thick-cut mushroom slivers that really assert themselves on the whole chewing experience. If you like mushrooms and spring rolls, you&apos;ll enjoy these. I don&apos;t (I didn&apos;t pick them for the table) and so didn&apos;t.

The curried potato somosas had no such problems, though - crisp on the outside, billowy on the inside, and accompanied by a great, moderately spicy dipping sauce that you should definitely indulge in.

And then there was the highlight, the thousand-layer bread and chicken curry. This is a common find at places like Penang and Golden Triangle in Philly, but Rangoon&apos;s is a bit different. The bread comes out crispier and the curry has a distinct, buttery flavor that distinguishes it from its competition. It wasn&apos;t spicy at all (the potato equivalent apparently is), but each dip or bite was full of incredibly satisfying, rich flavor. I&apos;d eat a whole meal of it in a heartbeat.

The mango chicken was an atypical pick for me - aside from sweet &amp; sour whole fried fish, I&apos;m not really into this kind of sweet, Asian dipping sauce. But I do love mangoes and had gotten the dish into my head when I passed by Banana Leaf earlier (which advertises it on their door) and when it came time to order I swerved and got it. It definitely wasn&apos;t bad, but I won&apos;t be ordering it again. Like I said earlier, I think this was pretty well made - I finished it and didn&apos;t find it lacking flavor, chicken meat, mango slices, or peppers and onions - but it didn&apos;t change my take on this kind of sauce. I&apos;d much rather have something more savory, heavier, richer...less candied. But I enjoyed this well enough that it has me excited to try stuff that does fit my tastes more, and I plan to soon. I think there&apos;s something to be said for a restaurant that manages to keep me this eager to return after a meal that lacked certain things I usually look for in a great culinary experience."
4,"Given the shortage of Burmese restaurants in New York, we had to try this place for their mohinga. Their mohinga was so good, we came twice just to have it again. During dinner on a Saturday, the restaurant was busy but not crowded. We were easily able to get a seat for two. The next day for lunch, we were the only ones dining in the restaurant, but I saw many take-out orders.

For dinner, we ordered the mohinga of course, which is listed on the menu as Festival Fish Noodle Soup. It was chock full of flavor with added substance from the noodles. I&apos;ve only been to three Burmese restaurants, but this place has my second favorite rendition of this dish.

In addition to the mohinga, we ordered the Thousand Layer Bread w/ BBQ Beef skewers, the Banana Leaf Fish, and the Ahnyh Tamin (shrimp paste fried rice). I enjoyed the skewers and thousand layer bread which tasted similar to roti canai. The Banana Leaf Fish consisted of a whole fried fish covered in a sweet curry sauce. I didn&apos;t enjoy the fish as much since it was too sweet and tasted too much like Thai food. I wouldn&apos;t order the fish in the future. Out of the three, my favorite was the shrimp paste fried rice. I am a little biased though, since I adore shrimp paste fried rice in general. If you like briny-tasting foods, order this fried rice.

The next day we came for lunch just to order the mohinga. There was a little mix up because we asked to order two bowls of it. But the waiter misheard and gave us one bowl and two small bowls to share the dish. In the end, we also ordered the tea leaf salad to fill our stomachs. The tea leaf salad was tasty with all the different textures, but I would have preferred another bowl of the mohinga instead."
5,"I feel the need to increase this from 4 to 5 stars, after visiting several times afterwards. I still love the appetizers and the traditional Burmese tea. One of my favorites is the thousand layer bread with curry chicken sauce - the bread was similar to the texture of a scallion pancake and was perfectly fried, flaky, and delicious. The Burmese tea was basically this unique, dark black tea with condensed milk - perfect flavor and great way to end the meal. One of the entrees I had previously was a stir fry with curry - good, but I wasn&apos;t struck by anything special.

However, what stole the show was the banana leaf crispy fish I had on a subsequent occasion. This dish is addictive. The curry is rich and flavorful, spiced and sweetened just right to complement the tender flaky fish covered in an ultra crispy exterior. The service is very friendly too. This place has been around for awhile, and you can tell it has regulars. Definitely give it a try."
4,"I had a super friendly waitress who brought me a pitcher of water! I ordered the beef with basil lunch special which comes with steamed or fried rice and a soup or salad, I chose steamed rice and the salad. I also ordered a Singha Thai beer. Everything was delicious. It was not super spicy but just spicy enough. I am excited that I found this place. I will definitely be back to try other dishes!"
5,"Quite unique as it is Burmese cuisine, reminds me of a mix of Indian and Thai cuisine! A lot of sour, spicy, and curry dishes, fairly decent portions for the price. I&apos;ve had a lot of the noodle dishes, and everything is crazy flavorful (the thousand layer bread dip and watercress salad were so good but very spicy)!! I loved the watercress salad and noodles a lot! The interior is large and serene, and the staff is wonderfully sweet :)

Would recommend if you&apos;ve never tried Burmese cuisine or are craving some strong dishes!"
5,"You NEED to get the mohinga here. Ask your waiter/waitress about it. It&apos;s listed as something else on the menu. It&apos;s a very popular Burmese soup with rice noodles in fish-based curry broth. The noodles were tasty, but the soup was simply excellent. Rich seafood flavor, not too salty, but all the right curry flavors.

Also tried other dishes here. The basil chicken was average, and the thousand layer bread was great. Crispy and with delicious dipping sauce."
4,"Relatively spacious Burmese restaurant in Chinatown - the rest of the street seems very quiet.

Atmosphere: At around noon, it was completely empty on a Saturday. Must be a more popular dinner spot. Servers were kind 

Food: Great food for the sauces - thousand layer bread with curry is very popular. The curry beef (and the sauce that comes with) is a bit on the spicier side, but delicious. The chili peppers on the menu doesn&apos;t help indicate spice level very well though.

Overall: 4 / 5 - my main complaint were the portion sizes (on the smaller side, given the prices), but the food was very flavorful. I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s worth being on Philly&apos;s Top 50 because there are so many other great Chinatown restaurants, but I would come back!"
5,"What a perfect way to start the new year by dining in one of my most favorite restaurants in Philadelphia - Rangoon Burmese.  This eatery which is listed in Philadelphia Magazine&apos;s Top 50 Philly Restaurants deserves all its accolades and has deserved them for decades.  Greeted warmly by Christine the owner and we were off and running into a top culinary adventure.  I have eaten here so many times over the years that I have a long list of favorites but I was actually with two people who had never had the pleasure of eating in Rangoon before so I could also share in their experience as well.  btw - They were all thumbs up! 

We began our meal with a couple of my favorite appetizers - Golden Triangles and Crab Rangoon Dumplings. Both are superbly prepared and never fail to please.  For my main course, I ordered the Mandalay Nungyi Noodles which I found full of diverse flavors and the added chili flakes highlighted them even more.  My friends ordered the Shan Rice Noodles and the Northern Burmese Noodles - both were def hits although I think we all felt that the Shan Rice Noodles would have benefitted from a little bit more chicken and sesame flavor. My Burmese green tea was served piping hot.  And a bottle of red wine and a Singapore Tiger Beer completed the feast.  Happy New Year Rangoon Restaurant!  I hope I can say that for many many years to come!!"
