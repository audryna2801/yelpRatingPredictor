5,"I visited three times on a recent trip to Philly. Once I walked over in the rain during 3rd Quarter of my Chiefs game against the Raiders so if that doesn&apos;t speak to how much I liked this place I don&apos;t know what does. 

I first visited after dinner on a Saturday night and got the hot fudge sundae with rocky road ice-cream add marshmallow phluff. Holy wow!!!! I walked back to my hotel eating this and it took exactly 9min to polish it off. I was dropped my little to go container right in the trash out front of the Kipton.

The second night I walked over during the game for Victory dessert, thinking they were open until 12a but they were closed.

I then returned after lunch and before my flight home on Monday around 330P to have my final scoop of rocky road with marshmallow phluff. 

I do wish I were visiting during non pandemic times because this place just seems super cute, but I&apos;m happy to have still been able to try them out.

I think my two scoops will hold me over until my next visit to Philly.

If you&apos;re into ice-cream I&apos;d definitely recommend checking Franklin Fountain out."
5,"I&apos;ve been to the Franklin Fountain a few times for their awesome ice cream. I&apos;ve always gone for the milkshakes which thankfully last a few blocks back to work before being not so much of a thick shake.

Today, I went with one of their special flavors, honeycomb. An extra dollar can get you malted, and they have the regular size at $9 or the large for $10. The Fountain doesn&apos;t give you a free Philadelphia pretzel like Miller&apos;s Twist (see my review) but the shakes are very flavorful and tough to suck down the straw.

There&apos;s always multiple flavors to choose from including the old standards, but they also make their own creations which are hard to beat. They have custard, ice cream sodas, sundaes, novelties, and drinks. They even have vegan ice cream which I&apos;ve not tried.

Due to COVID-19, they have a setup like in the picture I&apos;ve posted. Outdoor corner ordering and then walking outside to the end of the shop to pick the order up. Today, there was only one staffer so it was a bit slow but worth it.

If you order online, your pick up place is Franklin Ice Cream Bar a couple of doors down the street.

A milkshake is a nice Summer treat. You&apos;ll like Franklin Fountain&apos;s choices."
5,"I love the feel of this place. Everything is old-fashioned and it makes the experience so much better! I also love that it is open all year round and late at night too. I came here and got the apple pie, a black and white milkshake and a sundae. It was all delicious and I would definitely get it again. They are also following COVID protocols which is nice to see. My only issue is the price. I bought three things and it cost 30 dollars. That&apos;s a little crazy, but the ice cream was delicious so I didn&apos;t mind as much!"
5,"I dream of the hydrox ice cream from Franklin Fountain! It&apos;s like a cookies and cream, but better because the hydrox cookie is flakier and somehow more chocolate-y, for lack of a better description.

The old-timey soda fountain seemed cool, too, but I couldn&apos;t fit a soda into me along with my ice cream. Next time, I&apos;m definitely going to try the soda."
4,"Atmosphere: Franklin Fountain has a welcoming, rustic interior. There was quite a line when we visited pre-COVID lockdowns, but it gave us enough time to decide on what flavors we wanted to try! The outside had a nice seating area with pretty lights!

Service: Great, friendly service! We were served promptly as the line moved quickly and efficiently.

Food: We ordered a scoop of mango and a scoop of black raspberry in a box with a cone on top. The ice cream was refreshing and sweet, perfect to enjoy outside. The portions were generous and felt that the quality and quantity were reflected in the price.

Overall: Franklin Fountain was a recommendation to us from some friends and they did not disappoint! There is a great variety to choose from and we especially enjoyed their fruit-based ice creams. A very solid visit and we would come back again!"
5,"Went on a secret mission to find  a great waffle and guess where that happened to be? 

Yep, at this Philly ice cream staple in old city, lives the best dang waffle in the city. Top it with ice cream or eat it as is. You won&apos;t be dissappointed.

They also have what could be the most safely engineered system to keep the staff and consumers safe during 2020 and we appreciate the safety precautions and flow. 

The ice cream sells itself, the charm, care and quality of this establishment and product warrants the lines."
5,"If your visiting Philly,PA this is one of spots that is a MUST go to spot. 

This ice cream shop has so many different flavors and the ice cream at this location is so creamy and so fresh. 

A place where you want to stop by for some ice cream or even while your visiting Penn&apos;s Landing please check out!"
5,"I can&apos;t say enough good things about this place. It has such an old school, classic ice cream parlor vibe. They also own the candy store a couple stores down (which has some of the best hot chocolate anywhere). My favorite flavor is Hydrox, which is just cookies and cream. And their sundaes are absolutely epic! The Mount Vesuvius sundae has vanilla ice cream, malt powder, homemade brownies, hot fudge, whipped cream, and a cherry. It&apos;s soooo good! The only downside is that it&apos;s on the pricier side for ice cream, but worth it for a once-in-a-while indulgence."
4,"I love the idea of offering the walk up window as an alternative with indoor dining being closed at that time due to COVID but man.. from the outside you can see the history behind those doors. Very old fashioned from the register, wall decor, to the homemade syrup flavors on display behind the antique bar.. it had a pretty cool vibe going on. Although the ordering system was contactless, they have all menus posted by the register to make it convenient and visable. And the options and combinations are endless. We were one of the lucky ones by walking up to absolutely no line compared to some of the other reviews I read so we were able to take our time deciding and ordering. I indulged in a couple scoops of rocky road in their homemade waffle cone. A friend had their Toasted &apos;Mallow Malt Shake and couldn&apos;t say enough about it. Everything was great and packed with flavor. Great choice if you are looking to feed your sweet tooth that is COVID-friendly. 

**CASH ONLY** and definitely on the pricer side. Expect to pay $10+ per treat. And street parking only."
5,"Been there a couple times and didn&apos;t write a review since I think it&apos;s already a well known and popular spot for ice cream in the city, but do you know they have cool sodas as well? Last time I have the lavender soda it was so good and refreshing, unlike anything that I had before, and during autumn you can have the apple cider soda with pumpkin ice cream! It&apos;s like getting the whole fall season inside a cup!"
4,"I know how long this line can be and I am high risk so I did not want to be anywhere near this place during peak times. I researched on google and found their least busy days and times. We decided to come on a Wednesday around 6:00. 

I saw someone standing by the door and was nervous because I know how tight it is inside of this place. Then we walked a little closer and I saw their AMAZING Covid setup! 

The door is closed and they have a window to order through with a megaphone so you are far away from the staff member taking your order. Everything is contact free and hand sanitizer is available. The person that took our order was pleasant and friendly. This isn&apos;t always my experience here. 

After ordering we walked around to the side of the building where two separate staff members (in masks) brought us our ice cream. Then we walked away with it. It was sooooo quick and easy! 

I was sad because we drove here from Delco purely for the maple walnut ice cream and they didn&apos;t have it! I got rocky road and butter pecan. It was my first time with butter pecan. It was SO GOOD! 

The prices are really absurd, though so I&apos;m docking a point for that. It cost us almost $30 for two cones of ice cream. It&apos;s delicious but it&apos;s not gold!

I appreciate that they allow credit cards now. 

I saw social distancing stickers on the ground. I still can&apos;t imagine what this place would look like during peak times if they still get the same crowds that they typically get. I feel like with social distancing, people will be waiting all the way at penns landing! I would stick to their non-peak times. They get 10 stars for their Covid setup!!! I really appreciated the fact that the inside is shut down and everything is contact free."
4,"The ice cream here is great! It&apos;s creamy and delicious and does not taste artificial at all. My go-to flavor is the Mint Chocolate Chip, and it&apos;s not the toothpaste green that most mint chocolate chip ice creams are. Seating is a little iffy, especially during COVID. When I have gone, I typically go on a day with nice weather and walk across the street over to the water by Penn&apos;s Landing and sit there. 

The only thing holding me back from a 5-star review is that it&apos;s pretty pricey for what it is. Their products are made from good quality ingredients, but just a heads up. One of my go-to places in the city."
5,I&apos;ve been here severs times in the past prior to covid and have always loved all their ice cream. My fianc√© and i came here for dessert on this cold and sleeting Valentine&apos;s weekend. I ordered the apple pie milkshake and it&apos;s the best thing I&apos;ve ever gotten here. The ice cream is delicious and the warm apple pie just takes it over the top.
5,"SO GOOD!!! One of my favorite icecream places. Despite the steep $6 price of a small, I will continue to come back. I ordered the hydrox cookie (aka cookies n cream) and absolutely loved it! Had the perfect ratio of cookie to cream. Consistency was perfect as well. Not too hard, not to melty. Serving was generous too. 

Covid situation: order at one window, pick up at another (with painted &quot;feet&quot; to stand on)."
5,"One of my favorite ice cream shops in Philly! I love their traditional vintage theme that they&apos;ve kept all these years and the ice cream is made to perfection. Their caramelized banana and coffee flavors are the best but also don&apos;t miss out on the floats they make, they make their own soda! Their ice cream sandwiches are something you don&apos;t want to miss as well, they are always curating new flavor combos. 

During COVID you have to walk up to a window, and then pick up your treats at another door while waiting in a socially distanced line. 
Before COVID, you got to see the inside of the building in all its vintage glory. Will always recommend this place to people visiting Philly!"
5,"I have always been a fan of Franklin fountain! The first time I came here was my freshman year of college the hydrox is always a good starter. It&apos;s a classic. 

Yesterday I got the seasonal blueberry and oh my...a new personal favorite! Light and refreshing on a hot summer day!! My friend is a fan of the coffee. She says it&apos;s very rich. 

As for covid precautions, they closed the store interior but installed a small window to order and towards the back entrance you can pick up your ice cream. They even sell their own line of hand sanitizer it&apos;s $22 for 1 L"
5,"Warm apple pie a la mode with butter pecan ice cream and caramel drizzle.  One of the most delicious things I&apos;ve ever eaten.  Service was excellent as well.  If I have to order from this place every night to help keep them from going out of business, well then that&apos;s just what I&apos;ll have to do. :-p"
3,"Good, but I wouldn&apos;t describe as top tier. ..3.49 stars. The staff was fairly friendly and I like the late hours. The line can look intimidating, but moves pretty quick. It&apos;s a good mix of locals and tourist. I recently learned the boxes we associate with Chinese takeout were originally made for ice cream. Worth trying out this Philly legend of you&apos;re in the area."
5,"One of the places I had on my list to get if I had the time/in the area! Luckily we had a little bit of time to be in the old city area so we stopped by for a treat! There were two lines- one to order, one for pickup. There was a line that had marks on the floor to ensure everyone were socially distancing which I appreciated! Lines moved quick for order and pick up! I got the hydrox which was basically cookies and creme. Part of the reason I wanted to come here was really for their cute packaging!! They scoop the ice cream into a small takeout box! It&apos;s small but it&apos;s A LOT of ice cream. It was around $6-7 for the small but I enjoyed it! Lots of big chunks of cookies in there and the ice cream itself was really creamy! They had a lot of flavors I wanted to try and asked if I was allowed to mix but they said no so I guess I&apos;d have to go back to try more next time!"
5,"My favorite Ice cream shop in Philly , freshly made ice cream very delicious highly recommend good vibes on a nice summer nice the cherry on top of your day every flavor is great !"
