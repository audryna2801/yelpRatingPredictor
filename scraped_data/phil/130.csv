4,"Looking for a place to get together with a friend on an unseasonably warm November day, I knew Silk City has an out door space (which is all that is now allowed in Philly during the pandemic) so I booked it for dinner.  The outdoor garden is colorful and I read they also had heat lamps.  When I arrived I was pleased to see the outdoor area looked as attractive as ever but I didn&apos;t feel totally comfortable as it was basically enclosed like a tent.  I was hoping to see more vents and windows open for ventilation as it was a warm day.  I&apos;m not sure during this pandemic - what the difference is dining in a tent like structure which is permitted if it covers a previous outdoor area and dining inside in a large dining room which is forbidden.  Anyway despite our reservations about it being totally safe, we decided to dine anyway.  And Silk City came through with good food as usual.

A jalapeno-cheddar-corn muffin is the way all corn muffins should be made in my opinion.  And my main course called &apos;Shaking Beef Bowl&apos; was very flavorful with soba noodles, beef tenderloin, greens, and various veggies.  I added a little cholula sauce and I totally got into it.  My side order of Peruvian purple potatoes and veggies in a salsa verde was also good although I could have used a little more seasoning.  A tasty strawberry cheese cake ended the meal.

Silk City is a long-running Philly institution.  Though it has changed owners over the years, the quality of food remains high and the service excellent.  And when you can park right in front of it, it&apos;s a great meet-up spot on the edge of Center City Philly."
5,"Been here a few times but went here again on a Saturday night and the food and drinks were amazing. Can&apos;t wait to return for other options.

COVID note:
Bring mask
Bring credit or debit card. (No cash accepted)
You order your food and drinks, you pay and find a seat and wait for your name to be called. No waiter service"
4,"I&apos;ve heard of this place for a while. It&apos;s just fun. They do a good job with COVID and they have a lot of great drink and food options to be hand. The ambiance is eclectic - lots of mood lighting and plants. It kind of sets the mood of an oasis in the middle of a busy industrial neighborhood. Still, this is a staple in the Philadelphia community and you should definitely come here at least once. (PS. The drinks are prettyyy strong too...)"
4,"Cozy diner with a classic American cuisine focus. The decor gives it a retro feel, kind of like stepping back in time. They have a huge menu with even bigger portions. 

They have a bar you can sit and drink at.

I felt that their veggie chicken wings were slamming, and that they had solid sandwiches. Would definitely come back."
3,"This was THE place to come to when you were hungry after leaving Shampoo or any club when it past 2am. Occasionally there was a wait, but it wasn&apos;t too bad as you checked out the scene. If you were a in a group, your wait was understandably a little longer where at least one member of the party was practically laying on the floor from being too cranked. 

For some odd reason, I clearly recall sitting across from a newer friend of our group, and being mesmerized by how precisely they sliced their banana over the bowl of cereal, don&apos;t ask; I don&apos;t know why I remember this of all things. 

My order was usually my diner go-to staple: hash browns and crispy bacon. That fact pretty much hasn&apos;t changed over the years if I&apos;m out so late. 

After checking out their site, it appears as though the Silk City I went to closed down in 2006, and was revamped with a new outdoor patio (I was going through photos first and sure as heck know that wasn&apos;t in existence prior) and the revamp looks as though it was well-received. One thing I sure noticed was that &apos;10% operational fee&apos; tacked on to every bill; evidently it&apos;s not just the state of California implementing such a cost to the consumer. 

I had some good memories here, and that is where they&apos;ll stay. I&apos;d like to remember this place as I knew it."
5,"This is a re-review. I gave it 5 stars last time and I&apos;m sticking with my rating. I don&apos;t live in the area, but whenever I visit, I try to make a trip to Silk City Diner.

Let me just say, the jalapeno cheddar cornbread with the honey chili butter is to die for. 

Also, the watermelon salad is more watermelon than salad which makes it worth it. 

And finally, there outside seating is great. They play great music, and the area is covered."
2,"I figured I&apos;d give them another shot, mainly since there aren&apos;t that many options in the area and it had been so long since my last visit. It&apos;s confirmed, I can&apos;t do it again. I had the watermelon salad (figured you really can&apos;t do anything to mess this up). Well, I am not sure who decided that season salt would be a good addition, that was a horrible decision. I couldn&apos;t even eat it. I had the crab cake added as a side, i asked if it were jumbo lump meat, the guy said it was a mixture of both. It really wasn&apos;t. It was more shredded than anything. My friend had the shrimp croquettes, which were the best things of all. I did enjoy those. The drinks were ok, more sweet that I prefer. I&apos;ve just decided to never return."
4,"We really enjoyed the vibe of this place. We had a few hours to kill before we needed to get to the airport, so we decided to stop for a drink and share a small bite. Although, there was nothing small about this side of fries. Fries were hand cut and you can customize your toppings. If you zoom in, those aren&apos;t bacon bits. Real thick cut bacon chopped up. 

Would absolutely come back and try an entree."
3,I love going to Silk City. I am in love with there Mac and cheese. The wings if it&apos;s they are fresh it&apos;s really good alway go for the Thai wings. And the drink called the X boyfriend. Is really good also!!!
5,"Came here with my friend last weekend solely to eat the Chicken Fried Streak and the consensus? Was not disappointed.

The steak came with a side of home fries and scrambled eggs along with a biscuit smothered in gravy. Personally, I would have preferred more gravy and the option to add peppers and onions to the home fries but that&apos;s just me...  
Despite those minor qualms, everything else was A.M.A.Z.I.N.G. The home fries were cooked to a crispy perfection and the breading for the steak was to die for. 

I also ordered the coffee cocktail and it was... alright. Probably wouldn&apos;t get again as it left me wondering why I spent $10 on watered down burnt coffee and vodka.

My friend ordered the tomato soup and home fries, and dipped her fries in the soup. Looked like a tasty combo but didn&apos;t have the chance to ask because I was busy cleaning my plate. 

The service was fine, nothing to applaud in the review. The menu is expansive and if you can&apos;t find something you&apos;d like, I&apos;d question you more than I would question Silk City. All in all, already looking forward to coming back and dining here by myself next week ;)"
5,"My friend and I came here around 11, and got a tan blue right away. I got a strawberry mimosa and the huevos rancheros, both INCREDIBLE! My friend ordered a pink panther (fun martini) and eggs. I tried her food, as any good friend does, and it was great too! Service was extremely fast and so friendly! I can&apos;t wait to be back in philly to eat here again"
4,"Brunch is always good.  Mimosas, pancakes with bacon, the ambience is chill and light.  It&apos;s a winner."
5,"Beginning to end - this was a lovely experience! 

I arrived 45 minutes early for my date and both Shelby (hostess) and Gina (bar-ista) made me feel right at home. 

I got to see them work for a while and they even handled a pompous woman very professionally. I was impressed! 

They kindly sat me outside to enjoy their awesome patio on a beautiful day. It&apos;s so private even though it&apos;s beside a busy street. Our server was friendly and attentive. And the atmosphere is fresh and progressive ‚Äç

We both had the commonwealth cider- (low carb! Low sugar). 
We shared the wings for an app- Shelby&apos;s insider tip was to mix the Buffalo sauce and and the Thai Chili sauce YUM.  
I had huevos rancheros which were too notch with that chorizo! And my date had the chicken sandwich (which Gina recommended). They served it GF on a bed of lettuce! 

Thank you SILK CITY!!!! Will BE BACK!"
3,"Decent brunch spot in Philadelphia, but nothing to write home about. We had a group of 8 on a Saturday Morning that decided to go here on a whim &amp; only had at wait about 15 minutes. We got a drink at the bar while waiting for a table to open up. 

Pros:
Friendly staff (our server was super nice &amp; good with getting us refills)
Outdoor seating 
Good for small groups outside
Bar seating
Reasonable priced food &amp; drinks 
Nice menu selection 

Cons: 
The bartender handed us 1 tab for our drinks. Would have been nice if he would have asked if we wanted them separate as we didn&apos;t order them all together. 
The inside is extremely warm (I felt like I was going to pass out in the bathroom, it was like a hot box) 
Food is mediocre (I had the shrimp &amp; grits which were recommended by our server and they were very tasteless)
Margaritas/frozen drinks are pre-made 
Small, tight spaces bathrooms that could use a good scrub 


Overall, I would probably return to silk city &amp; just try something else on the menu. They quickly accommodate our group and our food came out quick, which was appreciated."
4,"I loved this place! We went in on a weekday afternoon, and it wasn&apos;t too crowded, but it&apos;s not a huge place so I could definitely see it getting pretty crowded on weekend or at a popular time.

I can&apos;t speak for the breakfast food, but I ordered a grilled cheese and tomato soup which was excellent! One of the best grilled cheeses I&apos;ve ever had. The tomato soup was pretty decent too. 

The service there was good also. The waitress was super polite and let us know of different options we had to substitute sides. Prices were pretty reasonable too, and I&apos;d definitely come here again."
4,"Just went here on the first day of the New Year! Walked in to a cute diner set up, red lighting, and a nice little music playlist going (e.g., Bill withers). We were starving so we ordered a lot of food:

Thai Chili Wings- These were tasty. They had a nice crispy skin, and the chili sauce was sweet. My boyfriend enjoyed them, and so did I. I would&apos;ve liked just a little bit of spice. That would&apos;ve set them off. 

Order of fries- the fries were regular hand cut fries. They should totally toss these in some sort of Cajun seasoning or like an herb seasoning. That would really make their fries next level. 

Kabayaki Glazed Salmon entree- This was pretty good. The salmon had that perfect crispy skin on top. The flavor was nice, and the shrimp fried rice it came with was also pretty good. 

Salisbury steak entree- Overall this dish was nice, but I think my Salisbury steak could&apos;ve had more flavor. The mushroom gravy was yummy though. I think also the mash potatoes got a pass for not having a lot of flavor because they were covered in the yummy gravy. 

Bread pudding dessert - this was also yummy, and it seemed like there were little fudge pieces in the bread pudding. I am picky with my bread pudding, so it wasn&apos;t great. I am biased though because I prefer New Orleans style bread pudding. So, I was trying really hard not to compare it in my head lol. 

Service- the service was great! Very nice, quick and efficient. No wait for seating and our food came out quickly! 

Overall the food was good, and I was very happy with everything. I docked the star because there were just some things that could&apos;ve had a little more flavor/seasoning. 

We will definitely be back though!"
4,"I don&apos;t know how SCD was able to slip through the cracks of my consciousness regarding brunch locations but now it is firmly within the grasp of my cold and stony hands. 

This place finally came up at a reasonably high rank on my yelp search for brunch once the &quot;full bar&quot; filter was selected. My better-half (as all of my colleagues remind me) believes that we have exhausted the brunch options in center city and thus whatever this neighborhood is, was a reasonable option. 

No reservation was required at 12pm on a Saturday. This place is really cool actually, decor I would describe as &quot;retro&quot;. There was a large party seated next to us upon our arrival who had already received their food and their plates were outrageous. 

Service was great, we were tended to promptly. For drinks, my main squeeze went with the Pickle Rick which contains a large pickle. I went with the regular bloody mary because I was intrigued by the chipotle-infused vodka or some shit. I&apos;m a hard ass in terms of bloody marys but this one wasn&apos;t terrible, which is actually an enthusiastic endorsement coming from me. 

I ordered a coffee as well because i was coming off of an overnight shift and likely multifactorial due to it being la colombe and also because I put about a pound of half and half and splenda in it, it was spectacular. 

The veggie wings with spicy buffalo sauce was a NO-BRAINER. These were INCREDIBLE. We actually ordered omelettes as our main but I didn&apos;t want to waste gastric space given how fucking SENSATIONAL they were. The dipping sauce is especially drippy/not-viscous so that shit dripped all over the place after I dunked including my face but it was worth it. 

I ordered the south philly omelette which is essentially a cheesesteak in an omelette. I ordered it without sausage and onions, which unfortunately is mixed in with the peppers. Omelette was good despite my ingredient alterations and those home fries? shit....sliced paper thin gratin style. I was eyeing those babies and had to mobilize all of my will power to refrain. 

My favorite part of the meal was definitely the veggie wings but the numerous other enticing food and drink options on the menu make this place a solid choice."
5,"Breakfast at Silk City was shockingly good. I had zero expectations and I ended up loving their take on a smoked salmon avocado toast. Large portions, the food was fresh, and the mimosa was decent. Plus, they serve la Colombe coffee. I would definitely go back for breakfast. Who knew Silk City was more than a bar??"
3,"I wanted to check this place after hearing great reviews on the food and entertainment. The atmosphere is set up interestingly, When you walk in on the left-hand side is a club and then to the right is a diner, and then Outside bar lounge. We were seated outside the chairs was made up of kegs which was kind of cool. We had a plethora of waiters  since it was extremely busy. Because we sat outside we had to order from the bar which I was not a fan off.  Torthel- bar serve was not really pleasant, he seemed extremely nonchalant about anything we asked him and was giving us one word answers. I order the bbq wings which were fine, I tried the biscuit gravy combo which was not good there was no seasoning and we sent it back to get a burger. 

Now for the Club 
Pros- cheap cover fee 
Mix of music 
Cool enough space to dance but also breathe 

Cons- takes a while for people to start trickling"
5,This place has the most delicious food. Such cute decor too. Really looks like an old fashioned diner. I had the empanadas and the baked Mac and cheese and it was rockin. The drinks are good too.
