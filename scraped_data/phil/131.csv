5,"Today I enjoyed a lovely brunch at Green Eggs Cafe&apos;s South Philadelphia location. Myself and one of my girlfriends arrived a little after noon on a Wednesday. Due to COVID, they are offering both limited indoor and outdoor seating. We opted to sit outside although the restaurant is air-conditioned. We arrived on a good day and time as we did not wait for a table. We had a pleasant server (I failed to remember his name) but he complimented us on our positive energy and my mega wide smile.

I have previously dined at this particular restaurant once before, so I knew what to expect with regards to the quality of my food and I was not disappointed. I started off with a Oreo Latte followed by their Creole Shrimp and Grits topped with screambled eggs and a side of mild creole sauce. 

My brunch companion ordered the passion fruit lemonade and Salted Caramel Banana Stuffed French Toast. She wasn&apos;t too fond of the banana chips but loved her food. She ordered a side of turkey bacon (2 slices) which are very nice thick slices.

Our server checked on a few times to ensure we didn&apos;t need anything and when he noticed we were finished with our meals he asked if we needed a take away box for leftovers and brought us the bill. There was no rush to settle the bill so we sat and chatted for another 10-15 minutes before paying and getting up from the table.

A member of the restaurant staff saw us about to take a selfie in front of the restaurant and offered to take our picture for us. I enjoyed my food and the service and recommend this restaurant as there are quite for few delicious items on the menu to try."
4,"OMG! Bring your appetite! I had a friend take me here who told me I couldn&apos;t finish their food so I had to try it. When I saw other patrons have their food brought out, I noticed the large portions. I ordered the red velvet pancakes with strawberries. When I got the plate, it felt like a large cake was placed in front of me. 3 stacked pancakes and I looked around my friends hoping they&apos;d help me finish this. After finishing a third of them, I needed a box. They were rich &amp; filling and worth it for $16. Decent outdoor seating with Covid restrictions. Service was also good. Next time I&apos;m here, I&apos;m getting a real breakfast and not sweets."
5,"Had the Guacamole and Pepper Benedict, and it was divine. Really yummy  hollandaise sauce, the egg was cooked perfectly for a Benedict. The side of fruit salad was fresh and a generous portion! Everything was clean, the fireplace was cozy! Everyone was masked and friendly!"
5,"First off, they open at 9am, so don&apos;t get duped like we did from the Yelp hours (I will attempt to update them after I finish this review). We are here from out of town and stayed up late last night doing the tourist thing. We had another full day ahead of us today so we wanted to get to green eggs a few minutes before they opened in case there was a line. We showed up and there was no line, the chairs outside were still all stacked up and it didn&apos;t look like much was going on inside. Gave them a call and their hours are incorrect in yelp--not 8am, but 9am. (OK, sob story over...) 

Needless to say, we tooled around the neighborhood and stuck it out until 9 o&apos;clock rolled around for breakfast. 

The tables did in fact fill quickly so we were happy to be there early. My wife is a big sweet breakfast person and had trouble deciding between all the delicious looking French toast options. She eventually chose the pecan pie French toast and loved it. Lots of great flavors, more pecans than necessary probably, but still good. It was also impressive that the bread stayed as crisp as it did, even through to the last bite. I&apos;m not a huge breakfast person and don&apos;t usually eat much in the morning. I got one biscuit with gravy and it was great! Perfect consistency of gravy and the biscuit wasn&apos;t too dry. I enjoyed my bites of my wife&apos;s meal too! Great place, great service, and even though we had to wait an hour, we are glad we stuck around to give this place a try while we are in town."
2,"I hate to leave this place a bad review but today&apos;s (07/12/202) experience was just so bad. 

I&apos;d like to start with the good which is the food. When I go here the food have constantly been great. My go to is the chicken and waffle egg benedict. Previously, I&apos;ve had the kitchen sink, creme brûlée french toast, tiramisu french toast and few of their coffee and smoothies; all have been amazing.

The bad, it&apos;s today&apos;s experience and service. We were a group of 5 and was told 40 minutes wait. After a bit of a wait, we thought that&apos;s a long time and was about to go somewhere else but before going we checked with again just to make sure again before leaving and the guy inside told us there is only 1 more group before us but behold, 3/4 groups ended up being seated before us. But this time we already waited so long so we decided to wait it out. 

A waiter took us to a table of 4 when there are 5 of us... One of the 4 seats was DIRTY -- he replaced it and grabbed another chair for the dirty chair and placed a 5th on the street side. My friend were originally hesitant to sit there but it was impossible to sit on the curb so we just went along with it.

Moments later a female server took our drink orders and then came back with our water without our smoothies maybe about 10-15 minutes later. She said the smoothies were coming and took the food order. Then smoothie came out not to long after.

Our food order took awhile to come out and as the waitress were giving us our food she told my friend that was sitting on the 5th chair that was on the road side that she can&apos;t sit there and it needed to be moved because she was getting yelled at by her boss that my friend was sitting there. We certainly did not grab the chair ourselves and put it there. We didn&apos;t want to get killed either, YOUR WAITER PUT IT THERE. Then the waitress proceeded to apologize and told us to just stay as is. When you though that the fiasco was over.

When one of us needed salt and asked one of the waiter/server for some; with a mean attitude he ask, &quot;ok so anything else anyone want?!&quot; One of us wanted butter for the toast but by that time we were just a bit scared to ask for some because he was mean and just ended up not eating the toast. 

With outdoor seating we are at the mercy of mother nature and it was hot outside. Instead of them making sure our water were filled, we kept on having to ask and it take at least 15 minutes each time.

When we were done eating the waitress asked if we needed a box and as we were waiting for the box the UMBRELLA that they placed behind the tables FELL OVER US and luckily missed us because 2 of us that were sitting at the chairs where they would have gotten hit stepped away to the bathroom. 

The waitress asked us if we were ok because we stood up and were shock and shaken, the waiter just looked at us talked to someone else and  fixed a different umbrella instead. The check then was places on our table, waitress walked away, the pole were still next to my chair on the ground and the umbrella were still up against a car/truck. The waiter then walked to retrieve umbrella said sorry, but it didn&apos;t feel like he was genuinely sorry, but well it&apos;s my job so I have to say it.

Luckily, none of us got hurt so we didn&apos;t need to file a lawsuit but it was still not handled properly. No one from management came out to apologize or say anything... actually no one came out after putting the bill on the table. 

We were waiting for our last glass of water to arrive and to place an order for to go but ABSOLUTELY NO ONE FOLLOWED UP with us. One us ended up going inside to place a to go order but what she saw was the waiter was sitting down and eating then and proceed to tell her that kitchen is closed so she can&apos;t place an order. IF OUR TABLE WERE PROPERLY TAKEN CARE OF THE ORDER WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN LATE.

THE WHOLE SERVICE EXPERIENCE WAS AWFUL. OUR WHOLE SIDE BONDED OVER HOW BAD SERVICE WAS. A TABLE WAITED SO LONG FOR WATER AND DRINKsS, THEY WENT INSIDE TO GET THEIR OWN... ANOTHER TABLE TOLD US, THEY DIDN&apos;T EVEN PAY YET AND THEY WERE ASKED IF THEY NEEDED CHANGE. 

AGAIN, WE ALMOST GOT HURT FROM THE ESTABLISHMENT AND NO MANAGEMENT CAME OUT TO SAY ANYTHING. AFTER ALL THAT WE HAD TO WALK OUR CHECK TO THEM?!

Lets just say for now. I won&apos;t be eating there again. I probably won&apos;t suggest anyone to eat there for a bit until they get their act together.

With the amount of frustration, bad service and the shock of their umbrella falling over our head and didn&apos;t see the sight of management apologizing we really didn&apos;t want to tip them but there was not a choice because they included it in our total bill. Maybe that&apos;s how they can get away with bad service, tips are already guaranteed -- no choice on the customers end. 

2 stars are for the food because I never had bad food from them, even with to-go orders and the previous mediocre-good service. It&apos;s a shame this time the service was so bad."
4,"CASH  ONLY!! Pretty good spot for breakfast! There was four of us and we waited 5 or so minutes to be seated. We ordered a few different things- we had a three egg omlet with bacon, onion and cream cheese. The kitchen sink and the pecan pie French toast. The food was extremely filing. Staff was nice. 18% service fee on tickets more than $50"
5,"Delicious vegan breakfast!

Came here at 1pm on a Saturday afternoon and sat at their counter. I ordered their Tofu Scramble with the signature potatoes. The tofu scramble was so flavorful! The scramble was flavored with curry and lemon. I absolutely loved it. Honestly one of the best tofu scrambles I&apos;ve ever had. The signature potatoes were also super satisfying. I loved how the potatoes were cooked with peppers and onions as well. 

Service was excellent and our food came out very fast. I&apos;ll definitely be back!"
5,"5Sante Fe Chicken Benedict: This was really unique and had really good flavor with a little kick. This was a special but if it&apos;s available highly recommend!
4Chorizo Egg Benedict- This dish was definitely different but the chorizo over powered the dish.
5Short Rib Benedict- Had this dish a few times and it is always consistent and really good. Instead of a English muffin they do a grit cake underneath the egg. Highly recommend!
5Pecan Pie French Toast: Tasted great!
2Biscuits and Gravy with scrambled eggs: Taste and texture weren&apos;t favored.
Portions are always a good size, if you don&apos;t have a hig appetite you can always count on leftovers"
5,"It was me and my sister&apos;s first time here. We got seated quickly, everybody was socks distancing love to see it. I got the banana french toast!
it was a very nutty and creamy dish, along with my hot latte. But i wouldn&apos;t recommend it to someone who is not fond of sweets. also it&apos;s pricier than you would think it is I had got French toast, my sister had got waffles and mac &amp; cheese ,also we had two drinks. so they do charge you a service fee if the price is over $50 which I had known before coming in. but overall the experience was great the waitress were happy to help us and the food was bomb!"
5,"I went with my friends after hearing about this place for a while now.  It was during the lunch rush so there was a little bit of a wait, but they had some comfortable couches with a foot rest to put your feet up.  

When we got seated we were served quickly by two very friendly servers. I ordered the Short-rib Benedict, which came  with deliciously poached eggs over a cheddar tot pancake. The rosemary potatoes were also to die for.  I hated myself for eating the whole thing, but it was worth it. 

My friends got the Chicken and Waffles Benedict. I&apos;m not a big fan of fried chicken so I didn&apos;t get that, but I was pleasantly surprised to see that it wasn&apos;t overly breaded or fried.   I will be getting that next time for sure!"
5,"The review is for the tiramisu French toast. It has two slices of brioche bread, not too thick without thin layer of mascarpone. It&apos;s served with lady fingers soaked in coffee topped with pieces of coffee beans. Everything blends nicely and it&apos;s very delicious.

If you are ordering takeout you can place your order with the barista"
4,"Came here a few weeks ago on a Sunday with a group... luckily we didn&apos;t wait that long to be seated .. place is pretty busy place 

Staff was nice and had no issues 

Menu has a good selection 

The Nutella Latte is a MUST!

I had the pastrami ( rub) lox Benedict and I liked it .

We shared a few dishes for table which were great - the buffalo chicken Mac and cheese and short rib Mac and cheese called the &quot; cure skillet&quot;  were both excellent

Another friend had the creme brûlée French toast  and loved it!

Would come back again if I was in area again"
5,Go before 11 if you don&apos;t want a long wait on the weekends. We went for brunch with our 4 yr old. Wait wasnt too long and I really liked the room they gave us that had a fire. Very nice and toasty plus bathroom was in the room so it wasnt far for potty break. Short rib Benedict was very good. Comes with a side of potatoes or grits. Grits were delicious! Also got a nutella latte as well. Will come back to try other items on the menu.
5,"After stalking the Green Eggs Cafe&apos;s Instagram page and sending a billion photos to my boyfriend, we finally got a chance to check it out. The parking wasn&apos;t terrible and there was absolutely no wait to be seated. We went on an off time around 2pm. 

This is cash only, but there&apos;s an ATM at the front that only charges a 99 cent fee. Once we sat down, the wait staff were very tentive to our needs. They didn&apos;t rush us and they didn&apos;t forget about us, the perfect balance. 

Seeing their famous fancy dishes on Instagram- my boyfriend and I split the Salted Carmel Banana Stuffed French Toast. It was so decadent that we couldn&apos;t finish. However, we also order our own meals in addition to the stack full of French toast. 

I&apos;m a big avocado fan, so I got the avocado toast that came with the best french fries we&apos;ve ever had. It had arugula and tomatoes and balsamic. It was absolutely to die for. My boyfriend, being a hungry he-man, got the Kitchen Sink. The Kitchen Sink has potatoes, eggs, breakfast meat- you name it, it had it. 

Definitely two thumbs up for us and we hope to go back soon"
4,"Solid brunch spot that has great options for meat eaters and vegetarians/vegans. I got the multigrain porridge bowl which was outstanding! It costs $9 and is technically considered a side. It&apos;s pretty hefty for a side, but not enough to be its own dish. I sort of wish they&apos;d throw some fresh fruit on top, make the portion of porridge a little larger, and promote it to entree status. To round out my meal, I also got a side of cheese grits that were slightly too salty, but still good. The only thing I&apos;d really change about this place is the cash only situation."
1,"NEVER EAT HERE. The hostess and &quot;manager&quot; working Sunday, Feb 9, 2020 from 12:00PM-1:00PM needs to be disciplined. Both were extremely rude and ignored our party for an hour. We were never seated. Both the hostess and manager refused to provide their names because they knew they made a mistake and were being unprofessional. 

My party of 4 and a baby waited an hour to be seated but realized we were skipped over. Our party name was crossed out on their waitlist. No attempt was made to seat us afterwards by both the hostess and manager, so we had to leave.

We waited right behind the hostess and constantly checked in to see if our name was called. The hostess claimed she called our name three times &quot;15 mins ago,&quot; however that is impossible because I informed her the mother and baby needed to step out only 10 mins ago. We waited right behind her -- she never called our name once during the hour. She even glared at us when we repeatedly peeked over to check the waitlist. She crossed off our entire party, and we were never seated after waiting an hour.

We don&apos;t mind waiting an hour but don&apos;t give customers an attitude, especially when your hostess makes a mistake and then lies about it.

We were listening for our name to be called -- why would we wait for an hour just to waste everyone&apos;s time and not be seated?

We will never support this franchise or restaurant ever again. Consider fixing the attitude problem with your hostess and manager, who disgracefully would not reveal their own names. Shame."
5,"Food was fresh, great portions, truly delicious!! Can&apos;t wait to go back. The shrimp is grits is delicious as well. Presentation is amazing."
4,"This place was recommended by some friends  and they weren&apos;t wrong. We stopped in before heading to a wedding and needed to set ourselves up with some good eats before the festivities began. Service here is super quick so I suggest you read up on the menu ahead of time. 

The portions are super generous as well so you won&apos;t go hungry. I personally had the steak and eggs which was done to absolute perfection. The steak was super juicy and came with a nice chimichurri sauce. The other table favorites included the classic eggs Benny and their French Toast is out of this world. Seriously, I&apos;m not a sweet tooth person but this I could have this over and over again.

This will be our staple breakfast place when visiting the Philly area."
5,"I don&apos;t get the other reviews. This place is awesome. The staff was super friendly. The ambiance was cool and I loved being able to see out the windows during breakfast. The food was soooo good. I just have to say, This was the BEST BISCUIT I&apos;ve ever had. 

tip- Cash only so make sure you hit up the ATM before."
4,"This is my goto for brunch. There are several other Green Eggs in the city, but this one is one of my favorites for the convenient location, relative ease of finding parking, and gorgeous indoor seating. They have options to satisfy any taste buds. My girlfriend, her family, and I ended up coming for brunch based on recommendation and they still talk about how good this place was. Their red velvet pancakes are the size of small sheet pans stacked on top of each other. The avocado toast was piled high with roasted red peppers, arugula, and avocado. The butter pecan french toast was just as delicious as it was picturesque. The french toast was spongey and covered with pecans and mascarpone cheese. The buffalo mac and cheese was a mountain of cheese, buffalo chicken, and blue cheese. I personally think the blue cheese took away from the dish more than it added, but overall the dish was delicious. I highly recommend this place, and will continue to bring my out of town friends!"
