5,"One of my new favorite restaurants in Philly! Came here pre-COVID for restaurant week in January, and it exceeded expectations. I had first heard about the great deal that Osteria is (5 courses for $35), and it did not disappoint. 
They also have an outdoor seating section (looks like a garden with hanging lights). Wish I sat there - but was told that you can request to sit there in online reservations! 

The orders work in a family style, where the entire party decides upon which dishes to order, so make sure to go with people that have similar tastes! While most restaurant week menus tend to offer lower-priced items, Osteria placed many signature items on the restaurant week menu, which was incredibly exciting. The most memorable dish was the charred octopus - great texture and flavor. Overall, Osteria offers a great value for restaurant week and experience in trying new flavors and foods!"
4,"Today we arrived at Osteria during a visit to Philadelphia.   We were pleasantly surprised.   An early Saturday evening we were treated to the Happy Hour menu which allowed us to sample 3 pasta dishes to share for two.   Very pleasant and tasty.   The drink special was a Mango Gimlet.  Very good.   The appetizer was a carnival squash that we ordered solely on the aroma coming in the door.  

Sadly still Covid but the waiter was extremely pleasant and helped us making some selections

Worth a trip back

(The only thing personally we would not order again was the chicken liver pasta dish but the Francoboli Ravioli is first on our main course for the next visit."
5,"Best pandemic take out! Margherita and sausage pizza, daily special pasta and the chicken liver rigatoni! The daily special pasta wasn&apos;t an option in caviar, but we picked a pasta and added a note to sub in the daily special pasta they did it. So glad they opened back up!! We were worried about pasta traveling through delivery but the pasta traveled really well!"
5,"I have only good things to say about Osteria! My boyfriend and I came by during happy hour to treat ourselves after a long week. It was definitely a meal I will always remember. 

We went a little over the top and ordered 5 things off the menu just for the two of us. We started off with the vegatable antipasti, which was a delicious variety of roasted vegetables, arugula and other greens, and a few slices of parmesan. So good and beautifully seasoned! The mamma pina&apos;s polpette was also delicious. They gave two big veal meatballs. Next, we tried the lombarda pizza. That definitely was the star of the show. The egg on top surprised me (in a good way). Later, we got two pastas, the francoboli ravioli and chicken liver rigatoni. The ravioli melted in my mouth and had amazing mushroom flavor. The rigatoni had the subtle bitter taste of liver, so it was not my fave. However, if you like liver, definitely try it! 

All of this was a total of $35 during happy hour. I ain&apos;t mad about that! I hope to come back soon when I&apos;m in Philadelphia again :)"
3,"This is one of the few places I have been to, where I didnt necessarily love the experience, but I know other people will.

My concern(s)? I ordered a branzino dish that wasn&apos;t very good and I feel like there is a lost identity. My wife and I went to celebrate and got dressed up. We were surprised when the table next to us had guests with a hat on and slip on flip flops. 

We did take advantage of the chefs tasting menu, which felt fairly priced. Again the food was good, not great."
5,"Osteria has been on my bucket list after living far too long in Fairmount and never visiting - and I am pleased to say that Osteria exceeded my expectations! The restaurant is gorgeous inside and out, especially the sunroom, where we sat for dinner. The service was outstanding and our server was knowledgeable, friendly, and provided us with recommendations.

We visited for my friend&apos;s birthday and opted to split a margarita pizza to start. The pizza was cooked perfectly with great flavor. For my main dish I ordered the funghi pizza, which was amazing. I shared with my friend who had the francoboli ravioli, which was incredible. We ended the birthday dinner with tiramisu alla mamma pina and a mint ice cream sandwich - complete with a sparkler for my friend&apos;s birthday!

I will absolutely be back to try other items on the menu!"
5,Came here last night and had amazing food!!! The service was great and it was one of the best Italian restaurants I&apos;ve been to. Everything was priced well. We will be back!!!
5,This place has the best food I&apos;ve ever had in philly. I went during happy hour with my S/O and we each had 4 courses. I cannot stress enough how amazing this place is.
4,"The vibe here is so cute! I&apos;ve sat in the greenhouse the last two times I visited. I&apos;m pescatarian FYI. 

The corn pizza with truffle is amazing. Ravioli are good. Better than the pasta with the red sauce. The grilled octopus is perfectly cooked. I think it would pair better with something else instead of the potatoes, arugula, olives and celery it comes with. I could do without the tuna carpaccio - again with the celery and I think olives come with this too. The whole food was food. 

Honestly, the food isn&apos;t anything to write home about but the aesthetic and atmosphere is a vibe. The service is great. I&apos;d totally come back for pizza and I want to try out their happy hour which is EVERYDAY!"
3,"My wife and I made our way to this restaurant on a cool Saturday evening and decided to enjoy the outdoor dining option. Let&apos;s get one thing clear, the restaurant has a great ambiance. Inside the main dining, the greenhouse, or outside, they have taken measures so that everyone is socially distanced and comfortable (outdoor heat lamps). Unfortunately the food fell a bit flat

They have a great happy hour, with a nice spread of dishes to get a taste of many items so we decided to give it a try. On to the food:

Drinks: Spritz Rossa and House Cocktail (Margherita), were both refreshing 

Antipasto: Mozzarella in Carrozza and Copa Panino. The mozzarella dish was not that flavorful, the coating needed some seasoning to spruce it up and the cheese wasn&apos;t gooey at all, which is atypical. On the other hand, I enjoyed the Panino, all of the components came together well and it was a nice Italian sandwich on flatbread.

Pizza: Margherita was very good. I would return for this. Great bake on the crust (not too charred), and plenty of cheese and basil

Pasta: Chicken Liver Rigatoni and Paccheri. The chicken liver pasta was unique and was well executed, but I wouldn&apos;t return for it. The Paccheri on the other hand was not as good. It&apos;s a simple dish, so each component must be top notch, the pasta was great, but the tomato sauce lacked flavor

Desserts: Chocolate olive oil cake and Tiramisu. The tiramisu was delicious, and made the traditional way. The chocolate olive oil cake, didn&apos;t taste like chocolate or have the consistency of a normal olive oil cake. It was more like a gingerbread cake in texture and flavor 

Overall:
Mozzarella in Carrozza - 2/5
Copa Panino - 4/5
Margherita Pizza- 5/5
Rigatoni - 3/5
Paccheri - 2/5
Tiramisu - 5/5
Chocolate Olive oil cake 3/5"
5,"A 10/10 experience!

Came here for restaurant week, without knowing that restaurant week doesn&apos;t apply over the weekend. However, the servers were super understanding and offered a different kind of prix fixe menu set that was phenomenal. Throughout our whole evening, our server was very friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable with great recommendations.

The ambiance is warm and elegant; I was dressed up for the occasion, even though you wouldn&apos;t necessarily feel out of place without doing so.

Dinner was wonderful as well. I&apos;m always a fan of charcuterie boards, and I recall particularly enjoying the octopus. All the dishes were shared, and none of them were disappointing. The fig dessert is huge and amazing too, definitely can share with several people.

I&apos;m a fan of the Michael Schulson restaurant collection given my wonderful experiences so far!"
5,"I decided I wanted to try restaurant week again. We came here because Osteria seemed like they had the biggest menu and all of the food looked really good and creative. I can&apos;t stand when places only have a few items to pick from and they usually only give you the cheapest items on the menu. Not this place. Pretty much their whole entire  menu was available for restaurant week. 

We sat at a table along the side which was like a  covered patio and glass walls so you see outside. Really liked the atmosphere it had an enchanted  garden feel to it with the plants hanging and the white lights all around. 

Our server was very friendly and attentive. The cocktails we ordered we good. Bread was brought to our table and included some soft bread and some were like crunchy thin breadsticks. The restaurant week menu was the convivio menu that they offer all the time which included 2 antipasti, 2 primi, 1 picolli, 1 secondi and 1 dolici. The dolci wasn&apos;t originally supposed to be included but they decided to add it last minute. It was a great deal, normally this meal is $58, but for restaurant week it was only $35 a person. They didn&apos;t skimp on the food either, it looked like the same amount of food you would get on a regular night. I hate when places give you half portions for restaurant week. 

It&apos;s family style so everyone splits everything, so you are getting the same number of items whether you have 2 people or 10 people, they just adjust the food amount according to the party size. Luckily it was just me and my husband but I can see a big group having trouble agreeing on the same items. 

RIBEYE TARTARE- tasted very fresh and light  and the chips added a nice crunch. 

BURATTA- the cheese was very soft and almost melty  but liked it. 

Francobolli- this was what I was looking forward to the most. The pasta was melt in your mouth soft and I liked the mushrooms. However,  it didn&apos;t quite match the photos I saw on Yelp. On yelp it looked a lot bigger  and had a nice butter sauce under it. It was definitely a lot smaller than I was expecting and didn&apos;t have much of a sauce. Too much grated  Parmesan cheese on it too that overpowered it. would have been better with freshy shaved Parmesan  cheese. 

Candele- this actually turned out to be my  favorite dish. Long pasta with a generous amount of wild boar ragu that was delicious. Was kinda full after this but we still had 2 more courses! 

Veal tongue- surprisingly very good! My 2nd favorite dish of the night. Thought it was going to be rubbery or fatty but was very meaty. 

Duck breast- not the best duck I&apos;ve had but was ok. The wine reduction kinda overpowered the duck. And it was real small pieces. 

We wanted to order the chocolate tortino because we weren&apos;t supposed to get dessert with our meal. But we were given the polento budino as the last course  to our meal and were already stuffed so we passed on getting a 2nd dessert. It was probably for the best. This dessert was light and didn&apos;t stuff us more. 


Overall a great meal, great service, and great atmosphere. One of the best deals for restaurant week out there I think."
5,"We came here on a Monday for Philly Restaurant Week.  I think I was content on skipping the entire week, but we&apos;ve wanted to check out Osteria for awhile now, especially after the renovations. 

I knew it would be a great night when I found an easy free parking spota block away.  When we walked in, we were greeted and seated at the far end of the restaurant.  Throughout the evening, the service was among the best.  Very attentive, but not pushy.  An incredible balance, where I knew we were being taken care of.  I love my water test, where I believe a good establishment won&apos;t let your water go empty...  This place had large bottles of water at the table and I don&apos;t think this has ever happened to me before, but they swapped it out when it was getting low.  The simplest signs of care really mean all the difference to me.  

My wife and I split a family style meal that was the best  &quot;restaurant week&quot; meal we&apos;ve ever had.  It was authentic to their menu, items they generally always make, and worth the money.

Our meal started with ribeye tartare and burrata.   Both incredible flavor and filling.  Next up was the francobolli and candele.  Fantastic pastas and we were told two of their most popular items.  The candele with the wild boar bolognese was one of my favorite bites of the night.  Should we have boxed this up though?  No, that would have been foolish...  right?  Enjoy it now, while it&apos;s at its best...  

Veal tongue and the roasted duck breast arrived to our table as I was ready to give up eating.  Can&apos;t say I had veal tongue before this, but I enjoyed the dish.  The duck was cooked perfectly, but similar to other duck dishes we&apos;ve consumed in the past.  Again, I thought about taking some home, but we fought through it to finish our plates.  

I wasn&apos;t expecting dessert, but the chef added a polenta &quot;budino&quot;, which was a pleasant surprise.  We thought we had to order that on it&apos;s own and we would have gotten the warm chocolate tortino, but why not try this?  If we weren&apos;t so full, we would have gotten both desserts, but after so much food, the &quot;budino&quot; was a light and tasty ending to our meal.  I&apos;m craving hazelnuts now after this creative treat.  

Cocktails did the job and just the whole night was what I look for when I go out.  Good food, service, and company.  Free parking too!"
3,"I had high hopes for Osteria given its great reviews for its Happy Hour which is daily from 5 to 7 PM. But was sadly disappointed. 

I made the mistake of making reservations, assuming it would be for Happy Hour if I had specified that in the note section. When we arrived on Saturday night for dinner at 5:15 PM, we were seated in the covered glass patio area that&apos;s very charming with string lights. But was told we had to order from the regular menu otherwise it would be more than a 30 minute wait for happy hour which mind you, we arrived at 5:15 PM which happy hour just started at 5 PM...

So we ordered margherita pizza and francobolli. Both were tasty but nothing to knock your socks off. Pasta dish was a small portion. My friend and I ordered francobolli but the portion was drastically different. One plate looked like you could finish it in 3 bites. Luckily the waiter was nice enough to bring us a new plate. But still, I would be embarrassed to bring out a plate with 5 small pieces of ravioli and a few limp sad mushrooms. 

The dessert was the best part of the meal. It was a chocolate cake with warm fudge in the center and a scoop of pistachio gelato. 

Overall a disappointing experience especially since I had bookmarked this place for the longest time and decided to check it out when my mother was in town."
5,"We were visiting from NYC and stumbled upon this gem. We visited Italy about a year ago and have been dreaming of authentic pasta ever since; this came pretty damn close. The restaurant itself is cute, elegant and definitely romantic. We sat outside, but they also have an outdoor terrace enclosed in glass. 

To start, we got the grilled prawns and a bottle of wine. We were indecisive on a bottle, so the waiter brought us out a few wines to try. He even gave us a vegetable antipasti on the house because the bottle of wine took a bit longer to come. So sweet! My boyfriend got the tagliatelle while I got the corzetti. The portions are small, but filling, just like Italy. The pasta was cooked perfectly and flavored well. 

Everything on the menu is priced so fairly for the portion size/atmosphere. You leave feeling full but not overstuffed. So happy I found this place during my stay in Philly!"
4,"We came here for New Year&apos;s Eve. Fortunately, we were able to make last minute reservations online. The ribeye tartar and Brussels sprouts were both really good; flavored well. 
The mussels were made well with a hint of spice. Octopus was disappointing, lacking in flavor and not sure if it&apos;s suppose to be served cold since it was room temperature so I didn&apos;t even finish it. Branzino was made well, a bit heavy on the olive oil though. 
May come back to try the pizza next time. 
Street parking. Valet available. 
Nice decor. 
Service was great."
5,"This review is solely for the happy hour, which might be the best in the city.  

I arrived at 5:20pm and the restaurant was already jam-packed (note: the restaurant opens at 5pm on weekdays). I was initially annoyed because it took some time for our server to notice us after we sat down, but once she did, the service was swift and courteous.

Happy hour is only at the bar, so be prepared to sit elbow to elbow, but the food is worth it. Everything I had was fantastic, but the highlight of the menu was the chicken liver rigatoni, which is WAY better than the ingredients would suggest. The portion was very generous, and the chicken liver sauce was ultra flavorful. I&apos;d be remiss if I didn&apos;t also mention the $5 cocktails---the daily cocktail was a Bee&apos;s Knees, and it was good enough for me to get...more than one (I won&apos;t specify how many).

Just a warning though: every dish is so delicious and reasonably priced that you&apos;ll want to try them all, and in the end your bill won&apos;t be particularly low. That said, you&apos;ll have no regrets. Osteria will definitely become part of my permanent happy hour rotation."
5,"I have been wanting to come here for a while now and finally got a chance to for my friend&apos;s birthday. First off, the interior is such a beautiful, elegant space. It just oozes sophistication.

Osteria actually has a fantastic happy hour deal with both drinks and food! We arrived a little before 7pm so we were able to order a few things off the happy hour menu at the bar before sitting down. The spiedini are little skewers of meat that are both delicious and affordable little extras to tack on some protein. Ribeye was especially yummy. We also had burrata, a margherita pizza and rigatoni. The chicken liver rigatoni blew me away by its rich savory flavor. That was a favorite of the night for sure.

Everything we ate here was absolutely delicious. It is served as small-plates so that you can share and sample more dishes, which you&apos;ll wanna do. Some standouts included the pumpkin cappellacci which has such an unexpected, unique flavor and the duck breast which was cooked to perfection.

The only thing that caught us by surprise was that we brought our own birthday cake which the restaurant kindly sliced for us. Then we found out only when we received the bill that we were charged quite a high cake-cutting fee, I believe something like $15. I would&apos;ve knocked down a star for that but we also received some complimentary ice cream so I&apos;ll let it slide."
3,"I cannot explain how long Osteria has been on my bucket list of must try&apos;s. I went for happy hour and some small bites before a show so I was happy I was able to try a bunch of items off their menu. But I didn&apos;t expect to try a bunch of mediocre menu items and leave hungry. Me and my friend ordered tuna carpaccio, coppa panino, margherita pizza and ravioli to start. The only one that was remotely more than bland was the ravioli. I am a lover of all things alcohol and I had to send my cocktail back and just opt for wine instead. We then ordered the octopus off the regular menu and I LOVEEEEE grilled octopus. It was served with potato and arugula. It was way too charred to enjoy and was underseasoned. All in all the ambience is very nice, the food does come out fast and the pizza was pretty decent. The rest is pretty bland and I am not a fan of their cocktails.  I do not see myself coming here again however. I am glad I was able to experience it."
4,"I fell in love with the restaurant the moment I walked in. You can see the kitchen when you walk in along with beautiful tables for people to sit at. My friend and I were taken into the patio area which was absolutely beautiful. I wanted to live there - it kind of felt like I was in Europe. The marble tables, the glass windows, the chairs and the green plants, it was just all so beautiful! 

My friend and I wanted to try so many things on the menu so we decided on doing the convivio - Chefs family style tasting menu. It allowed us to choose 2 antipasti, 2 primi, 1 piccoli piatti &amp; 1 secondi, as well as 1 dessert.

For our 2 antipasti, we chose the tuna crudo and the ribeye tartar. The tuna crudo was good but a little too bitter for me. It comes with radicchio and grapefruit vinaigrette with the tuna and kumquats on top. The kumquats helped balance out the bitterness of the vinaigrette which I liked. 
The ribeye tartar I thought was just okay. It tasted normal but there wasn&apos;t anything amazing about it. 

For the 2 primi, we got the squid ink paccheri and the corzetti ai frutti di mare. I loved the texture of the squid ink pasta. It wasn&apos;t soft but it wasn&apos;t hard. It was the right amount of chewiness in my opinion. The sauce was also good filled with chunks of rock shrimp. 
The corzetti ai frutti di mare was interesting to me. It came out in circle pastas - almost like little dumpling peels so I really liked that. It was topped with littleneck clams and mussels along with cherry tomatoes. The thing that made this dish different from the other pasta was the sauce - it was a sweeter sauce that kind of tasted like apple sauce which is not something I&apos;m used to on my pasta so it was a interesting surprise.

Next we got the scallops for our piccoli piatti. The scallops were amazingly done. It was so tender, so soft, and just perfectly cooked! It came with 2 big scallops with some very fresh snap peas! Yummy!! 

Then we got the branzino for our secondi and boy was it amazing!! The branzino was cooked really well, the fish was super soft and not fishy at all like other restaurants. The sauce that came with the branzino (lemon, olive oil, and oregano) complimented the fish super well!! This dish was perfect. 

Our dessert was the poached pear crostata (comes with dark chocolate sorbet) and it was really well done! It was not too sweet and it was both flaky, soft, sweet and nutty at the same time (crystallized walnut).

All in all, the tasting menu was a good experience for $58 per person.
I didn&apos;t think everything was amazing so I docked 1 star. 
But the ambiance is really great and so is the staff. 

If you don&apos;t want to do the tasting menu, I would just recommend the branzino as a meal. It really is well done and very very good."
