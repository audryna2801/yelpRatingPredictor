5,"My first time at Lucky&apos;s, but it won&apos;t be my last. I have to practice discipline with pictures because I&apos;m always ready to eat, and this was no exception. 

First, let me acknowledge that the staff are acknowledging social distancing and doing what they can to keep you safe (masks, social distanced seating, sanitizer pumps along the bar, clean pens etc.). I sat indoors with my partner and we weren&apos;t near the next table. I also noticed that when a 6th person came to eat, he was offered outdoor dining, so they&apos;re adhering to capacity rules. 

I ordered the special burger for the day, the Rage&apos;in Cajun, a beef patty topped with caramelized onions, andouille sausage, a slightly spicy remoulade, and I believe cheddar cheese (I opted out because of dietary issues). You can order burgers in standard (two patties) or junior (one patty); I ordered mine in junior. The burger was FLAVORFUL, juicy, and just the right size. My only concern was there might be too much sausage (and not practical to eat), but it was sliced thin (discs)--smart! I ordered a side of plain tater tots (they don&apos;t come with) that were perfectly crisp, light, and salted...if you have tots, I&apos;m sold! I had a side of habanero Mayo with them--YUM. My partner ordered the bacon cheese burger that comes with onion strings. He devoured it before I could get details. Whoops. 

It&apos;s a dive-bar setting, and I feel like pre-Covid it was a fun place to hang out on a Friday night. I wish I would have gotten my server&apos;s name, he was attentive without being overbearing, funny and personable without being extra."
5,"Dude. Just go here. Whether you dine there (I haven&apos;t since COVID but I hear they&apos;re doing safe things and it was soooo fun back in the Great Before) or order takeout the service is amazing, staff are friendly and the food is stupid good. Got the blue burger with crispy onions and a side of Mac. The prices are ridiculously cheap for how much food they cram into your little to-go bag. Like a burger that would be $23 in cc is $10.50 here. Take advantage and tip these lovely staff members alright! So thankful for this place, hits the spot every time."
5,"We came here on a Saturday evening. We were able to grab some outdoor seating. The tables are nicely placed in the alleyway safely distant from one another. It got chilly at night, but they had giant heat lamps ready to go for when the sun went down. 

Our waiter was courteous, attentive, and witty. I went to Lucky&apos;s unprepared for the massive amount of burger choices on the menu. If you&apos;re menu indecisive, make sure to take a peak at the options beforehand. Every burger option has a huge amount of unique ingredients added to it. After much deliberation, I decided on the pickle monster. It came with fried pickles, regular pickles, pickle potato chips, pickle aioli, and relish. Pickles to the max. And it was PHENOMENAL. I demolished the entire burger and wanted seconds, but I controlled myself. However, I will return to try out some more of their options. 

If you&apos;re a burger or hotdog fan, check out Lucky&apos;s Last Chance. You won&apos;t be let down."
5,"If you&apos;re looking for a solid burger, run to Lucky&apos;s. This restaurant is one of the best in Main Street Manayunk, from their food to their service, they do everything right!

It took me a couple of visits before I got the courage to order their infamous peanut butter, jelly, and bacon burger because let&apos;s be honest it sounds so strange. But I&apos;m so glad I finally did. It&apos;s now my go-to item on their menu full of many, many other delicious options. In my opinion, it definitely deserves all of its awards. It&apos;s served on a crispy brioche-like bun, strips of bacon, slathered in melty peanut butter with a side of homemade jelly. Who knew peanut butter and jelly would taste so good on a burger?

All of their other burgers are solid choices as well. They have quite a few options to suit many palettes. I&apos;ve also tried their tater tots which are superb.-- served cripsy and hot just like any potato should be. 

The servers and bartenders are amazing people. Everyone I&apos;ve encountered here is always super friendly, there&apos;s absolutely nothing I could complain about."
4,"I absolutely LOVE this restaurant. I have been more times than I can count, and have thoroughly worked my way through their menu. 

Their selection of burgers are off the chain, and so creatively crafted. There are options for those who are more adventurous (like my personal fav - their Peanut Butter &amp; Jelly burger) or you can just try a stacked burger like their bacon cheddar cheeseburger. 

On top of that, they have delicious hot dogs and fries - again made with all differents toppings. Just a totally elevated experience for simple diner-style meals. 

They always have great beer selections as well. 

Something that I would list as a must try is their garlic &amp; butter fries - OH MY GOSH! Super rich and savory, and a great versatile side for any of the sandwiches."
4,"Friends and I hit Lucky&apos;s one Sunday morning recently when we were out on a bike ride. The outside tables along the side of the restaurant were nearly all full, so we were stuck grabbing the least desirable one in the back, which was on a bit of an angle and downwind from the dumpsters. Pandemic times, am I right? We were nonetheless happy to have a table to fit our group, and the staff who took care of us were great. 

Brunch goers won&apos;t have many options here, because Lucky&apos;s is all about the burgers, dogs and fried things. There is a brunch burger that has an egg, if that&apos;s your jam. All burgers come as juniors or standards, and I loved having that option! I went with a junior classic (american cheese, bacon, lettuce, tomato, onion) and a side of fries for just two bucks more. This was the perfect amount of food and I felt like I was able to indulge without going overboard. Also, shout out to the bun, which was light but sturdy enough to keep everything together. A truly excellent burger!

My brother and SIL used to live by the Lucky&apos;s in Queen Village and it was their go-to spot. Now I see why! Looking forward to more bike rides with burger rewards in my future."
5,"We got burgers from Lucky&apos;s and was really pleased. I went for the Cubano burger - which was a burger patty with pickles, mustard, and pulled pork. It was unique and delicious. 

We ordered fries and tater tots as sides - the fries were average, but the tater tots were excellent. 

The staff was friendly and helpful and I look forward to trying more of their menu."
3,"I ordered takeout here during covid and was pleased with whole ordering experience. I ordered online and it was ready for pickup within 20 minutes. The employee who gave me my food was very friendly and was wearing a mask. 

Mak Attack: Burger with Mac &amp; cheese. I had high expectations for this and was slightly disappointed. The burger was slightly dry and the mac &amp; cheese wasn&apos;t anything special. I wish there was more mac &amp; cheese on the burger. The crispy bun was the best part about this burger. 

PB &amp; Bacon: Burger with bacon, peanut butter and a side of jelly. It&apos;s definitely different but it&apos;s not an award winning burger in my opinion. I love PB&amp;J but it wasn&apos;t enjoyable on a burger. The homemade jelly was delicious though on its own. 

Blueberry Lemonade: Pouch drink with tequila. It was really good and stronger than I expected so no complaints here! 

Overall, I was disappointed in the burgers and didn&apos;t think they were worth $11.50."
5,"It is pretty awesome of Lucky&apos;s to set-up an entire on-line ordering system just so I can get my burger fix during COVID quarantine. Ok, I&apos;ll let you use it too!  Seriously, on-line ordering is another great aspect of Lucky&apos;s Last Chance.

Prior to COVID quarantine, Lucky&apos;s had become my go-to spot on main street.  Great food and drinks, friendly service, and anything else you can ask for from a bar.

The food - its burgers and dogs but also brunch!  They feature a burger of the month. At the end of the year, the favorite of that year challenges another for a permanent spot on the menu.  The pickle monster, my personal favorite, earned its spot this year.  Remember, you can get any of their burgers as a veggie burger option and adding a side of tots is the way to go."
5,"Whoever didn&apos;t give it 5 stars is a crazy person. Everything ordered was delicious. I haven&apos;t had anything like it since moving from NYC to Philly. 

I ordered the food to be delivered...COVID ...they put a nice note in the delivery. 

I&apos;d totally get them once a week, maybe more if my arteries can handle it."
5,"Perfectly buttery buns with richly flavorful burger combinations and an equally high quality of burger whether you dine in the alley or carry out. Can&apos;t decide which I love best: the Pickle Monster, the Gorgonzilla, or the Bacon, Egg, and Cheese. You basically can&apos;t go wrong here, and the service is always friendly and efficient, even in COVID times. Main Street Tots or Fries make a nice complement to their burgers and you can get some great draft beers and mixed drinks (even to carry out, if you order directly from their website). I&apos;ve tried a lot of high quality burgers but this is the one that keeps me coming back."
4,"Great place for unique burger flavors! The entire back-side of their menu lists the different burgers. Ranging from traditional to peanut butter and jelly to burrito style to vegetarian, there&apos;s something for everyone. I ordered the buffalo chicken burger and was very happy with my choice. The burger patty is topped with shredded chicken soaked in hot sauce, with a slice of pepper jack cheese, and then topped with a few blue cheese crumbles. It also comes with a side if blue cheese dressing to add more if you wish. The burger was juicy with great flavor and the buffalo chicken wasn&apos;t too spicy that it overtook the flavor. I highly recommend ordering a side of fries to share because your burger doesn&apos;t include them and you&apos;ll still be hungry."
3,"I knew I had to check out Lucky&apos;s Last Chance after exploring their menu and discovering their creative burger selections.

After reviewing the menu. My heart was set on this one particular burger called the PB and bacon.Yupp peanut butter on a burger! I knew that I would probably like it because I enjoy sweet and salty food combinations.

The PB and bacon burger came with a double patty, it had peanut butter, fried onions, cheese and a jelly dip on the side. It was definitely delicious and huge. I enjoyed every bit of my burger. 

I also decided to order their fries and I don&apos;t know why I did that cause it was a complete waste. The fries tasted like it set under the light too long which I can&apos;t understand cause order and pick up took no longer than 20 minutes . It was just stale and tasteless. I was a little bummed about that being as tho fries are my ish!

Overall pickup and ordering was a breeze. I would order from Lucky&apos;s Last Chance. I just wouldn&apos;t get their fries again. Three and a half yelps!"
5,"Yum.  This place knows their burgers. 

I got one called the Pickle Monster.  It was spectacular. Too bad it was a limited run, but if they put back on the menu, I highly recommend.  

Good area.   Good drink specials 
I will definitely go back.  
Will probably try one of the hot dogs, if they are anywhere as good as the burgers."
5,"I came here with one of my female friends and we had a good time. I ordered the chili and cheese hotdog and ate almost all of it. It came wrapped in a buttered sourdough slice of bread, which was a nice touch. 

I ordered two glasses of Pinot noir and the pours were heavy. Who doesn&apos;t like a heavy handed bartender? 

The service was AWESOME, but quirky. The big guys running the place were hilarious and had an interesting approach to customer service (asking questions like &quot;How the hell are ya?&quot;). They were very friendly and attentive.

I WILL be returning!
2 glasses of Pinot noir, a chili and cheese hotdog, an order of Mac and cheese, an order of plain to and 3 gin and tonics cost about $55, not including tip."
5,"I&apos;ve been here twice and trust me, order the PB&amp;J burger! It is seriously amazing! Second time I came here, I decided to try something new and it was just okay. I checked their menu to see what my burger was called but I guess it was just the special of the day. The tots and PB&amp;J is what you need to order!"
5,"I came here after seeing a couple of reviews on yelp for Lucky&apos;s Last Chance. The entire place certainly had a very cool vibe. By the way, have El Guapo, you will totally love it. The crew were super nice; If you haven&apos;t tried this place, definitely do."
5,"My friends were raving about the PB&amp;J Burger at Lucky&apos;s and my first impression was &quot;ew PBJ on a burger?!?!&quot;  Little did I know, it was surprisingly a great combo!

We went on a Saturday evening, so there was ~20-30 minute wait for a party of 4. It is a fairly small place with very few tables on the first floor and a bit more on the second floor. There is a bar on both levels as well, so we sat at the bar as we waited for a table.

We ordered the PBJ &amp; Burger, Cajun Mac and cheese, tots, and the Mac attack burger. The PBJ burger is definitely a really good combo and it has bacon as well, the jelly comes on the side and home made - it tasted better than any jelly I&apos;ve had! The tots &amp; mac was also very delicious but I thought the Mac attack was only ok after tasting the PBJ burger. 

There are also a number of drink selections and specials throughout the week as well! I definitely would recommend this place - but definitely try the PBJ burger!"
5,"I have to confess, I am in love with Lucky&apos;s Last Chance. Not only was I impressed with the ambience and the atmosphere, but the food and service were great too! If you do not know what to order, go for Bananas Foster French Toast, it is just amazing. Service was wonderful and every one working here was extremely nice and hospitable. Lucky&apos;s Last Chance, wish I could come here more often."

Overall: 8 out of 10

My friend and her boyfriend come here every Monday evening on Grilled Cheese night. When her boyfriend had to work late I got to fill in as understudy. 

Here is the order we placed, in store, on 02/03/20:

Mine:
Peace, Love and Veggie (black bean) Burger
Jalapeno Cheese Fries (small)
Dr Pepper

Hers:
Gorganzola Burger
Garlic Butter Fries (small)
Diet Coke

My first time coming here was during the Chowder Crawl. I got to try the cheeseburger soup which was phenomenal and, until we hit The Couch Tomato and their chicken corn chowder, a clear winner. They topped out at #2. 

We arrived around 8pm. The place seemed crowded compared to the other popular spots along Main on a monday. This may have had more to do with the fact that the upstairs dining area has been closed for renovation and the only place to eat is the narrow lower bar level. We sat at a two-person pub table when one became available and were immediately given menus and offered drinks before we ordered. 

The black bean burger was flavorful and came with guac on a huge bun. The fries were firm but didnt taste like much. I didnt finish it and took most of it home. This had more to do with my general inability to eat much after the sun goes down. I did reheat it and eat the next day and it was just as tasty on day 2. 

Honestly, burgers and fries arent my thing but I enjoyed the atmosphere and the great service. I would totally recommend this place for anyone that likes a super chill spot to get late night comfort food."
