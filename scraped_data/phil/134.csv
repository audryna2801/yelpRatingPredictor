4,"The food wasn&apos;t bad but the service was very slow. Right now they are low capacity indoor seating, and we got sat down pretty quickly. We had to wait a loong time to place our orders and even longer to get our food, despite there being not many people. I&apos;m normally very patient but it was to the point where I became conscious of how long I was waiting.

I loved the Hainanese Chicken Rice; the portions were good for $9, and the chicken was super moist and marinated in the soy mixture. Rice was soft and flavorful!
My friend got the Nasi Lemak since he&apos;d never tried it before; all the parts were flavorful and portions were good for $9!"
5,"The food here is good and cheap. Before covid the prices were so low they were practically giving it away. 

I&apos;ve been ordering the salt fish fried rice for twenty years, this is my go to order. 

Crispy golden squid is a new pandemic favorite. 

Roti cani has been rotated out of my usual rotation because the roti does not hold up well for takeout. I can&apos;t wait to come back here for a big steamy plate of roti cani when restaurants in Philly welcome patrons back inside."
4,"Their mee siam is packed with so much flavor. Every single bite is coated with savory goodness. I definitely needed to squeeze a lemon on top to cut some of the salt and richness. Roti canai was good in terms of both flavor and price. The roti could be a bit more moist, but I assume it dried out a bit since I did order it for takeout. It appears prices have increased since the pandemic (understandably so), but even with the price jump, I can see myself coming back and ordering some of their other specialty dishes. I don&apos;t eat Malaysian food very often, so it&apos;s a real treat when I do."
4,"We ventured into Chinatown for my daughter&apos;s 18th birthday and stumbled upon this restaurant. We were pleasantly surprised and the wide variety of options that were on the menu. Our food was hot upon arrival to our table, our server was friendly and hospitable. The restaurant wasn&apos;t that large. I was kinda of shocked to see that they were not allowing empty tables between diners. My party of 5 were seated right behind an already occupied table. As the night went on the restaurant began to fill up. At this time it was time fit us to go. 

Because the food was tasty and service was great I will frequent the restaurant again perhaps during a time that is not as busy or order our food to-go."
4,"Incredible food at very reasonable prices. 
Nobody does Malaysian better than Penang in Philly. 

Cant go wrong with Roti Kanai, Roti Telur, curried chicken. 
This is one of the best restaurants in Chinatown where you are spoilt for options."
5,"Absolutely love Penang! The food is phenomenal and the service is wonderful. It always hits the spot. After you try it once, you&apos;ll be craving Penang constantly, just like me. My favorites are the Crispy Golden Fried Squid, Fried Squid Tentacles, the Beef/ Chicken Satay, Hainanese Chicken, Shrimp Puff, Jumbo Prawns and don&apos;t forget the Chicken Rice. I can prob name the whole menu bc I really do love everything! Stop by and try it for yourself. Thank me later :)"
5,"This may be my new fav restaurant in Chinatown Philadelphia. Definitely top 3! My bf and I visited Penang for the first time over the weekend and had a wonderful experience! Our waitress was extremely kind and recommended the home made roti canai, satay chicken and chicken pad Thai. Everything was incredible! The pad Thai was the best I&apos;ve ever had. My bf and I are already discussing visiting this place again ASAP. Cannot wait to try more things here!"
1,"This was my to go spot for Southeast Asian cuisine...but now losing my appetite for it.

Found a nice big piece of metal in my take out order (Seafood Scramble Egg Chow Fun).

Was happily eating my food and then bit something I couldn&apos;t bite through and discovered this piece of metal. Looks like steel wool from a scrubber...am mortified"
5,"Finally Penang is available for delivery at Grubhub. I ordered Singapore fried noodles and wanted extra shrimp but the only options are extra chicken or beef. So I put a note to substitute chicken for shrimp and I called the restaurant to confirm. The lady at the restaurant was super friendly and helpful. I had two orders for my workplace and I asked if they could deliver them together. She was very  accommodating.

Singapore fried noodles: the noodles is rice noodles, a little bit spicy. Flavor is on point. 

Satay is very flavorful and even better with the peanut sauce.

Peanut pancake dessert is interesting. The &quot;pancake&quot; is thin similar to the roti canai with peanut paste and corn. Not too sweet, it&apos;s ok for me, not memorable.

Of course I couldn&apos;t forget roti canai which will be  much better if you eat it fresh in the restaurant. However, with this COVID-19 situation I take any canai from Penang. The curry dipping is spicy and full of flavor perfect for dunking the chewy canai."
3,"Very hit and miss depending on what you order.

I always end up at this spot when going through China Town. I believe this is the case as there is ample seating and they had an extensive menu in the past. For delivery they do not offer all of there menu options at this time.

Roti Canai - I really love this item and only have tried it twice in my life. You are looking at $5.00 anymore and I think your getting hosed as the naan bread does not cost alot for the portion size they give you and it comes with a very small container of sauce with two pieces of chicken and one potato in the sauce.

Seafood Lo Mein - I was not planning on ordering this but the menu states : Squid, scallops, shrimp, and vegetables in Lo Mein for $13. Well, There are about 2-3 Shrimps and the tail is still on them in Lo Mein? Really dude... There is also maybe 2 1/2 baby sized scallops, also some minced squid. The Lo Mein was different however, the noodles were very light / thin and not the normal Lo Mein I was expecting. It worked for the dish but I would not come back to order this item as it did not meet my expectations.

House Special Squid - If I saw a picture of this item before ordering it online I would have not ordered it. Back in the day this location literally had items on the menu that said ask your server if you would like as they had some interesting items that are local favorites from localities in Maylasia, Thai Land, and Cambodia. I was expecting something more unique then small pieces of squid and minced squid in an abundance of sauce. But sometimes we take chances in life right and learn from it.

What I have learned from my experience is next time I am in China Town to try another location. As always people SYOY!!!"
3,"Bestie was craving their spicy shrimp soup with noodles. I was craving roti Canai and beef Rendang. Bestie also ordered steamed vegetable dumplings. 

The roti was on point! Both of us wanted a bowl of the curried dipping sauce as our main meal! 

I&apos;m no longer craving beef Rendang and bestie is no longer craving the soup."
5,"Instead of the regular beef rendang, I tried the green curry chicken in clay pot and penang chicken this time - so tasty! Also tried the Rambutan drink - I was so excited to try it after recently being introduced to the fruit which tastes sort of like Lychee. Like another reviewer has mentioned, the drink is delicious and tastes like a cross between mango and lychee - MUST TRY!"
5,"Amazing food for an amazing price. I&apos;ve been to Penang countless times because they serve large portions of delicious food for a very reasonable price.

I always order the beef noodles and the roti canai! That is more than enough for dinner and some leftovers to take home. 

The roti canai is made fresh to order! It is just the right amount of crispy and flaky to pair with the chicken curry dip. You cannot go wrong with ordering this appetizer! 

As for the beef stir fry noodles, you will get a plate bigger than your face! If you were to order one plate and two appetizers, it would be the perfect amount of food for two. 

Besides the food, there is the decors! The place has a boat like vibe with the hostess dresses in a qipao. You have the option of ice water or hot tea! Get the tea, and they will bring you a mini kettle."
2,"After an extremely disappointing dining experience on Passyunk Ave trying Malaysian food (I won&apos;t even mention the place), we decided to go to a place we thought would be more authentic and flavorful. While the food was better, the service was unbelievably bad. We were seated for at least 20 minutes before a server even came to check up on us, and another 25 minutes before our food came out. However, when it came to giving us the check, they were instantaneous and actual confusion because two separate servers tried to take my credit card. 

The restaurant itself could also definitely use some maintenance: there were napkins folded and placed under the table to keep it level, the paper towel dispenser handle in the bathroom is broken, and their menu was falling apart.

While the food was better than the previous Malaysian place, it was still mediocre. The Nasi Lemak was a large plate with lots of side dishes, but the only one that really glowed was the chicken curry. House special pork with pickled veggies was extremely soupy, and I don&apos;t know if it was missed or rice was really supposed to be separate, but we had to get a waiter to bring us rice. And the most ridiculous part was that the rice was extra even though there was no way of eating that pork without rice because it was so salty. 

With so many other great options, you are much better off looking elsewhere."
5,"Let me just describe to you one of my absolute favorite dishes in our fair city. Crispy tofu with sliced cucumber and a peanut dipping sauce. I dream about this dish sometimes late at night. 

This is my favorite place in chinatown. Though it is not Chinese. 

This last order I got seafood Lo Mein. It was awesome as well."
4,"Came here for some good eats and the food was solid. I was a little disappointed in the roti to be honest, after reading all the reviews and watching videos about how tasty it was I wasn&apos;t impressed. 

Outside of that, the food and service was point. I ordered the shrimp pad Thai which was great. I would definitely come back and eat again."
2,Quality of food has greatly gone down over the years. Use to be one of my favorite restaurants.
5,"Just ordered takeout from here last night and my food was delicious!! I ordered the Mee Siam noodles for the first time, and it had an amazing flavor and some spice. It&apos;s a little bit pricey but I received about two meals worth of food. 

The lady that took my order was very nice and helpful as it was my first time ordering this dish and ordering from this restaurant. She gave me a call once my food was ready and it was super easy to pick up. I would definitely recommend this place and I&apos;ll be back to try some of their other dishes!"
2,"We stopped here for dinner on a Saturday and the wait wasn&apos;t long at all. We got there just in time. It was very packed there. I really like the rustic decor. 

They give you complimentary tea. Our waitress warned us that it was her first time working. This was strange because to have a first timer working the Saturday dinner shift is a recipe for failure. 

The service was absolutely horrible. She gave us warm beer. She didn&apos;t even open the beer she simply brought the bottle opener. She had zero knowledge of the menu and whenever I asked her a question about an item on the menu she had to go a get someone and bring them to our table and have them answer. 

It doesn&apos;t stop there. We had an issue with our order and she brought the manager over and he was rude. Just poor customer service all around. This isn&apos;t the only Malaysian and Thai place in the city. Go somewhere else. Lisa K. Was the name of the waitress. She was trash. 

 The food was mostly fine but one of the noodle dishes was horrific. Nasty. The payer omelette was fine until you get to the center. I did let like the texture. It was slimy and nasty. Don&apos;t order it. 

If it weren&apos;t for the trash service I would give this place 3.5 stars."
5,"I approached this Restaurant by reading the reviews on yelp and decided to give it a try. 

They were fairly busy around dinner time on a Saturday. Luckily I was able to get seat for two people. 

We ordered water for drinks initially and the waiter did not bring it until our food arrived which was alittle disappointing but the food make up for it. 

I ordered pad thai the waiter said they don&apos;t have drunken noodles. 

They give a yummy tea as well well which was nice on a cold day."
