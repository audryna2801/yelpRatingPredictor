5,"Yummy &quot;junk&quot; food. We had the philly (vegan- which I loved) and the fried chicken sandwich (vegan-my husband loved). And of course we had to get potatoes. We did plain waffle fries and vegan cheesy tots, yummm! For covid there is no indoor seating and they have two tables outside. This place gets traction so you&apos;ll likely not be able to sit for a while. We just took ours to go. While you wait it&apos;s a great spot to people watch."
5,"There are not enough words to properly express how much I love Tattooed Mom. If I were a bar, this is exactly the bar I&apos;d be. So much personality. Incredible food, incredible drinks. I&apos;ve driven to Philly from NYC just to eat here and I&apos;ll do it again. I hope this place stays around forever"
4,"Came in for happy hour/taco tuesday with a couple coworkers. As a happy hour experience I have to say I was quite pleased. The food came out quick, prices were reasonable, and the staff super friendly.

We got the mango bubble rita, tiki kitty, 5 of their special tacos (ginger lemongrass beef with miso mayo, daicon and carrot) and cheese fries. 

The special tacos were $1.50 each and worth every bite with no sign of fusion confusion in sight (their regular beef and vegetable tacos were $1 each).  I was also surprised to see these tacos were hard shell as i was expecting cantina tacos in a corn tortillas.  The cheese fries were nice and crispy and covered in thick cheese. Definately one to share.

I didnt get to explore upstairs, maybe next time.  What I do know is I&apos;m definately coming back for tacos."
5,"What a find! Fun and eclectic. My kinda perfect place. 
Happy hour every evening 5-7?
Even better. 
The upstairs bartender was friendly and very very welcoming. There weren&apos;t much people hence lots of seats were available. 
The prices are great and ask him to make you anything and I guess he will be able to do it. 
When I am back I&apos;ll be visiting this place for sure."
4,"Tattooed Mom is not like any bar/ restaurant that I have ever been in. 

Located on busy South Street in a shopping area, parking is a challenge! I had to circle the area a few times before finding metered parking. 

Once we found the place, the guy at the door carded my daughter. As I sat there and saw other patrons enter, he carded (i believe) anybody that looked under 30 years old.

Like i said......I&apos;ve never seen any place like Tattooed Mom! Everywhere you look, there is something to see. All kinds of crazy decor all around even on the ceiling. 
I would describe it as a Punk Rock aesthetic.  Also very collectic with the seating.  Mismatched tables and chairs and even a couch and coffee tables to eat at. Even though I was clearly out of my element everyone was so nice. Waiter, very pleasant!
Bartender equally as nice!

Now......for the food, me and my daughter have completely different eating challenges,  but what brings us together is places like Tattooed Mom. They have a great variety of Vegan and Non-Vegan options which is hard to find at most restaurants.
I decided to be nice and get a Vegan option so we could share. I got a Chubbsteak wrap and BBQ Tater Tots, my daughter got a Pickled Fried Chicken Sandwich and Cheesy Tots.
I was surprised that everything was fresh and really good!  The portions are a good size and I was satisfied with my meal.
We didn&apos;t get anything from the bar, so can&apos;t speak of the drinks.
So sorry we didn&apos;t go upstairs,  but hear it&apos;s even more interesting stuff to see up there.
Overall, I would go back for the food if i were in the area."
5,"I absolutely love this place! They have a ton of delicious, inexpensive vegan (and non-vegan) food, draft beers, and cocktails. The cocktails are a bit expensive at $10-$11 but definitely worth it. The atmosphere is perfect- bright green walls that are currently beautifully decorated for Christmas. The staff are very friendly and helpful. Can get a bit crowded but that&apos;s just because its

UPDATE: I&apos;ve now tried the vegan cheesy tots and vegan cheesy fries and I was so impressed by how delicious the cheese is! This has to be one of the best vegan spots around!"
4,"Tattooed Mom has been my favorite dive bar in the city for YEARS. I remember being a broke 20something in the early 2000s and frequenting Tattooed Mom for their affordable menu prices. As a 30something, I find that I STILL enjoy their amazingly low menu prices. Taco Tuesday happy hour? NO CONTEST!

I like going there for the atmosphere and the punk music always on rotation. Grab the pool table upstairs if it&apos;s free for a good time.

The beer list is decent. It&apos;s got a few standards, a few good crafts on rotation. But it&apos;s small. Again, can&apos;t beat those prices though. It&apos;s definitely the best spot on South Street to hang out.

I&apos;ll forever go to Tattooed Moms. It&apos;s not only an awesome place, it&apos;s a stark reminder of what South Street has always been about. As the storefronts become a lot more commercialized and corporate, Tattooed Moms is there to remind us of what made the area great to begin with."
5,"Tattooed Mom is one of my must stop spots anytime I visit Philly! The bar itself is rad, the food is good and they also have a lot of vegan/veggie options as well as a lot of non veg options. Great bar food. Cocktail menu is fun and very unique. I really recommend the pickletini! The staff is also really cool and also very nice and we felt very at home visiting. Even though I&apos;ve been here so many times I never went upstairs until the last visit and it&apos;s incredible, totally different vibe, more dark and like a dive then the normal downstairs. Miss you Tattooed Mom!"
5,"Tattooed Mom is more then a restaurant dive bar... it&apos;s an experience.
Sensory overload is delivered everywhere you look. Walls, ceilings, floors, couches, doors, lights and more. You can&apos;t help but feel you have entered a throwback psychedelic experience. 
This is a place where people of all types, ages and persuasions can feel comfortable having fun.
You can enjoy good food and drinks at moderate prices...especially during happy. 
The bartenders are not afraid of pouring you a good drink. BTW, Tattooed Mom makes a great hamburger. 
There is plenty of room with two levels and two full service bars. But get there early for a good seat at the bar."
5,"Tattooed Mom is a MUST if you&apos;re ever on South Street and looking for a good meal. Lots of vegan options, too. 

Seating is &quot;sit wherever you&apos;d like&quot; so it&apos;s cool that you get to choose a table when you walk in. There is an upstairs lounge area that I didn&apos;t get a chance to check out. 

Our waitress came over for our drink order and we also put in an appetizer order of mozzarella sticks. The mozzarella sticks were hot and very cheesy. Strings of cheese kept oozing out. That&apos;s how you know they were good. 

None of the sandwiches/wraps come with a side. I guess that&apos;s why the menu has one section of only fries and tots. I&apos;m assuming the fries and tots come in shareable portions. The pricing is a bit high for a sandwich and nothing else. But the food is delicious and fresh so I can&apos;t complain. 

I ordered a Beyond Mom burger. For those who don&apos;t know, it&apos;s a plant-based patty. The patty sat beneath  pickles, lettuce, tomato, fried onion and Beyond Mom sauce. It was cooked perfectly. I enjoyed it. 

My boyfriend ordered the Honey Sriracha Fried Chicken wrap. He said it was great but too spicy for his liking. They also make a vegan version of this wrap. 

Definitely recommend. It&apos;s an awesome spot for foods and hangs!"
5,"If you&apos;re looking for a totally different bar experience, checkout Tattooed Mom! Its super eclectic and what&apos;s even better is you will find lollipops on every surface, along with leap frogs and other strange findings. 

The food is decent and if you find yourself there on a Tuesday you&apos;ll get $1 tacos and $2 Tacates (beer). My last visit was for a special art show for local artists. Since the place itself is covered from floor to ceiling, it was hard to tell the art from the wall, but that only made it all the more fascinating. 

Drinks are moderately priced and you get that South Street Philly experience we all crave! Don&apos;t be afraid to order an artisanal beverage, they can do it all! I got a dirty martini and it was amazing! Love coming here and definitely recommend to anyone from near or far."
5,"While visiting from California, a friend brought us to this bar before our visit to the Magic Gardens. It&apos;s definitely an interesting bar. Very unique, a little unconventional, but a fun experience overall. Their drinks are definitely worth a try! I tried the pop rockets drink, and while a little fruitier than what I typically get, having ACTUAL pop rockets in my drink was sooo cool! 

There&apos;s pool and plenty of seating space. You could stare at the walls for hours reading posters and what previous customers have written. It&apos;s a fun bar to try out, as long as you don&apos;t mind the metal-esque music. :-)"
5,This place is out of this world especially the vegan food .(wow)A must try for the Vegan world.Vegan
4,"Super cool place, if I lived in Philadelphia I think this would definitely be my hang out. The food wasn&apos;t out of this world but everything was great, the environment and scene were super fun."
4,"I&apos;ve come in here a couple of times and this place has really grown on me!

I like going to places that don&apos;t remind me of anywhere else I&apos;ve ever been.. Tattooed Mom doesn&apos;t just have a unique name! The green walls and decor all the way to the goofy finger toys at every table, this place is eclectic and wonderful.

The best part however is the food! A great mixture of soul and comfort food and a delight for the vegan in all of us! My favorite of everything I&apos;ve tried on the menu is the vegan chicken sandwich! Crispy, light, wonderfully flavored on delicious bread! I highly recommend this. The vegan cheese fries are ok.. not totally my thing, but it pairs well with the waffle fries. I also think this only one of a couple of spots to get a vegan cheesesteak. If you&apos;ve never had one before I recommend you try it if it interests you!

Overall, a fun spot with great food and great staff!"
4,"So originally me and my friends planned to sit down and eat but it was so crowded that we decided to just get take out. The decor of the place is exactly how all the pictures look. It is really cool and definitely good for some pictures , however it is type dark. It is also loud but not too loud where you can&apos;t hear the person by you but you might have to speak up a little.

The wait for the takeout was about 20 mins so I would suggest you call in advance so the food could be ready. I ordered the Honey Sriracha Veggie Chick&apos;n Wrap and my friend ordered the Vegan Pickle Fried Chick&apos;n both with waffles fries. The food was delicious and I would highly recommend to any and everyone. The waffle fries come with a lot of fries definitely shareable for two people so we had a lot of fries. The fries weren&apos;t seasoned well so that was a little bland but overall the food was worth it ! 

Next time I&apos;m in Philly I&apos;ll definitely go back again."
5,"Alright, Ill be real with you, Yelp, I could talk about Tattooed Mom for a long time. I could talk about the bathrooms smothered in marker ink and stickers, I could talk about the fantastic beer selection, I could talk about how weird and cool the alley art is. I could go on and on, but here is my suggestion; just go here. Just go here and see what it is for yourself and take it in for what it is. 

Take in the awesome vegan food. Take in the boisterous personalities that fill this bar. Take in the gaudy decor that makes this place incredibly unique. This place is special for so many reasons and those reasons are hard to describe so my number one recommendation is to experience all of it first hand. I have never been in a bar that I love more and have so many awesome memories in. 

If you&apos;re reading this review and you feel what I feel for Tattooed Mom, hit that MFin like button and give T.M. the love that it deserves. Tattooed Mom forever"
5,"This bar is eclectic, quirky, inclusive, and awesome all rolled into one. Their menu options have something for everyone of all dietary ranges to enjoy, and they also host small art shows that support local artists. SUPPORT LOCAL ARTISTS! 
 
Stop by grab a bite to eat (I have to come back to try the Pierogies!) and check out the upstairs bar with the walls covered in stickers and wheat pasta of your favorite philly artists-- Marisa V.R, Nero One, Sixteen Cats, Amberella, Hope Hummingbird, inphltrate, Angry Elephants, and many more!"
3,"#vegan 
Location is on the south side. It was a bit of a walk from the city where we were staying. It is on the &quot;rougher&apos; side of town I would say. But I always choose those places :) 
The places itself is so weird. It is green inside with very odd decor. It is LOUD. Music is blaring, everyone is yelling. Definitely a hang out spot and good for drinks, not good for a first date where you may want to talk. I did enjoy the variety of people that were eating there. 
Prices were pretty good! I got the cheesey fries, which was a huge serving size. I got the chicken burger which was phenomenal. And I tried the cheezesteak... which I think without the onions and if the bun were toasted, I wouls have enjoyed.more. 
It was definitely a funky little place, worth checking out, great food... just location is a bit out of the way and loudness was not my thing."
5,"This is such a great bar! They have a great happy hour and a menu to satisfy all. Their vegan options are amazing, constantly changing​ but still delicious. They are bike friendly, support local artists, and have an eclectic​ inside. I love, love, love their vegan burgers. 

I do think it would be better if they had more than one person on busy nights​. Some nights we have to wait 20 mins (or more) to get food or drinks. Regardless, I will continue to go here at least once a week.

If you&apos;re vegan, try the pickle fried chicken steak! It&apos;s​ SO GOOD. I don&apos;t know what the real version​ tastes like but my friends (who eat meat) have remarked that it&apos;s delicious."
