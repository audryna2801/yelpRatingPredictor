5,"I worked at an authentic Mexican restaurant for years and was spoiled from all of our homemade tortillas, chips, salsas, etc. so when I moved to Philly, I was looking for a new place to satiate my hankering for these items. My friend introduced me to Tortilleria San Roman and instructed me to eat a (warm) tortilla as soon as I walked out of the store. I&apos;m happy to report I have been passing this tradition on to all of my friends when we go. I honestly always forget the cross streets it&apos;s on, but you can hear their tortilla machine squeaking from a block away so follow that noise to the promise land.

Amazing chips for $7 for 32 oz (or a smaller bag as well) that take forever to get stale because they&apos;re so fresh (or maybe I&apos;m just eating them too quickly?). A dozen fresh corn tortillas for less than $2 (1/2 kilo)?? Buy a whole kilo (or 4), and you won&apos;t regret it. You can make homemade chips with the leftover tortillas or rejuvenate them by warming them up. They also sell sopes, which freeze easily for whenever you need them. Awesome pico and guac (with a kick) obviously. If that&apos;s not enough, you can purchase a variety of cheeses, beans and jarritos (Mexican sodas).

If Tortilleria San Roman didn&apos;t exist - all jokes aside - I would not be alive right now. They are my lifeline, and they should be yours too. *They are also on Mercato so you can get their amazing food delivered to your door while you practice ~social distancing~*"
5,"As someone longing for the return of international travel to Mexico, Tortilleria San Roman is a staple in the Italian Market latin food scene. I prepare a delicious pico de gallo but walking in and out with a tub of theirs is equally satifiying. Their salsa verde and chips are the starters in our Saturday morning chilaquiles.  Prices high if you&apos;re living on pesos but more than fair with US$.  I love tortilla&apos;s and tlacoyos and until i find another spot that&apos;s more convenient, this is my jawn!"
5,"I was making homemade crunchwraps and needed tostadas. Harder to find than you might think, even at the giant grocery stores I occasionally visit in the &apos;burbs. That said, I knew exactly where I&apos;d find them in Philly, so I sent my husband on a mission to Tortilleria San Roman, where he secured a fat stack. 

The tostadas are perfectly crunchy and ideal for recipes, or breaking apart and dipping into every last queso/salsa/hot sauce you&apos;ve accumulated during this crazy year. The bonus was getting to support a local business, even whilst cooking my own dinner for a change."
5,"Super fresh and cheap tortillas as they are made from the machine in the store. You can choose between 15 or 30 tortillas. 

I recommend enjoying it the same day because it gets dry after you put it in the fridge."
5,"Delicious and cheap! Authentic corn tortillas, delicious chips, awesome pico de gallo and guacamole. I got a big bag of chips, pico and guac for only $11. Chips are a bit hard than I expected. Very crunchy."
5,I order freshly made tortillas every weekend for my tacos &amp; they make all the difference. Love love love them!
5,"Tortilleria San Roman you are really fantastic, I had a spectacular experience here yesterday. Loved the atmosphere, and style of the decor. I was very impressed with Kilo, it was prepared perfectly. Amazing food. The team was very welcoming and service is amazing. Definitely check this place out."
3,"Maybe I had them on a bad day. When I went I didn&apos;t see any soft tortillas on display, which was a bummer. I ended up getting a big bag of nachos along with some pico de gallo. Pico de gallo was great and had a nice kick from the jalape√±os. However the nachos were super hard wish they had a better consistency. It was like as if it was left in the fryer too long. Ehh disappointed 3 stars maybe I&apos;ll give them another chance next time"
3,"The tortillas and guacamole are very good. 

I have an issue with the man behind the counter having his mask pulled down even though there is a sign on the door stating that masks are required for customers. All 3 customers inside had their masks on.  I almost did not go in but parking was a pain so I decided to anyway. 

It&apos;s also obnoxious that he asked me to use Venmo instead of card. Merchant fees are tiny. Give me a break. Just do cash only then, maybe they do I&apos;m not sure."
5,"Amazing chips, torillas, and salsas to go. Literally the best part of having taco night at home is being able to pick up ingredients from here for an awesome dinner. 
Fairly inexpensive for what you get! And defintiely worth checking out!"
5,The best handmade tortillas were amazing. I used them the same day to make tacos and they were so good. First time coming to this establishment and will be coming back. They also have salsas and pico de Gallo.
5,The only place to go for fresh tortillas and salsas. I try to always keep the green sauce in my fridge to throw on top of meals or into beans for that extra kick. Don&apos;t walk by this place!
5,"Best tortilleria around! They make the tortillas fresh everyday. You can opt for the fresh tortillas or by their chips (which I am addicted to). While they may be more expensive than any store bought ones, nothing else compares. They also offer fresh salsas, pico de gallo, and guacamole! All of which are pretty good too. You cannot go wrong with anything here. Best of all, they&apos;re super nice and friendly. 

P.S. I love their blue corn chips too, but they only make them on the weekends!"
4,Chips awesome n amazing. But I ordered wrong... I ordered chips and tostadas with no type of meats
5,"This small store front mass produces corn tortillas all day, every day. If you aren&apos;t interested in buying, go in and experience the production process as it&apos;s pretty cool. They have one large machine where they load in the corn dough and out comes tortillas. They serve them to you wrapped in paper and you can buy 1/2 kilo which is about 12 or a full kilo of 24ish. Super cheap too- half kilo is $1.25. 
They also make their own chips and have Mexican sodas and a few other food items for sale. 
You will want to eat the corn tortillas just as they are- warm and delicious!"
4,"Located on a corner of the Italian market, this is a great little tortilla shop. The minute you walk in, you can smell the fresh corn flour tortillas being made. You can also watch them making the tortillas. We got a small bag of tortilla chips for $1.50, and they were some of the best tortilla chips I&apos;ve ever had. The dip was a little expensive, so we decided against it, but I wish I got a larger bag of chips. I definitely recommend this place for some fresh tortillas!"
4,"Like others have said, fresh tortillas at a reasonable price and an alternative to grocery store bought corn tortillas.  The homemade chips were also good."
5,"I thought that this place was a restaurant. 
I saw 5 stars and the pictures of tacos and made my way there. Thankfully the staff are really nice and helped us. They gave us fresh tortillas samples. We purchased a large bag of tortilla chips and guacamole. I highly recommend it 

Imagine how amazing it would be if this place was a taqueria."
4,"Very good fresh hot tortillas at a decent price!

They also have house made chips and salsas!

Surprisingly they accept credit card for even a charge of $5! Win win."
5,"They made great homemade tortillas. If you grew up around homemade tortillas then you will be happy to find they are doing it right. That being said, its as good as a freshly made tortilla can be. Nothing more and nothing less. The 5 stars is for consistency and quality. It is cool to watch if you have never experienced it! They use a machine that flattens out the tortillas. They also make yummy tortilla chips but I have often found them to be super hard and almost painful to eat on occasion. They have cheeses, an assortment of salsas etc at the counter in addition to various mexican items for sale. If your recipe ever calls for cotija or another variety of white mexican cheese, they have it!"
