5,"I haven&apos;t been to Eastern State Penitentiary in many years, and thought it would be a good time to revisit. Eastern State Penitentiary is currently doing night tours in the fall, starting at 6pm and closing at 10:30pm. 

They are still of course doing daytime tours, and tickets for daytime tours are a few dollars cheaper too. But I opted for the night tour for that extra eeriness, not that I expected to see real ghosts. I just thought it would add to the fun. 

My husband and I spent more than 2 hours exploring the whole place. It made for a fun date night activity. If you&apos;re going to visit in the fall or winter time, definitely dress warm. You&apos;ll be walking through cellblocks with the doors opened, and the place does not have indoor heating. 

It&apos;s really worth a visit or a revisit, especially if you haven&apos;t been there in a while."
5,"Highly recommend doing the tour at Eastern State! It was so well done and the voice guide truly told a story but was very informative. I had never been on a better self guided tour before. I felt completely safe and everyone followed local CDC guidelines of wearing a mask, staying 6 feet apart etc. if you are visiting philly for a long weekend or a resident that wants to explore more of the city you definitely should put it on your list! It&apos;s also very well priced too for the experience you get."
5,"Great place. As a history lover, this was a perfect place for me to nerd out. Overall a great experience and hope to come back when COVID is over to experience everything I couldn&apos;t the first time."
5,"absolutely loved my visit here. I am all about the creepy places to see. It was actually not as eerie or dark as I thought it would be and I even went alone. Their audio tour is great and full of information. They also have a lot of signage as well so there is no lack of information for you.

I found parking literally across the street. It&apos;s for 3 hours I believe. The surrounding area is cute and has a good cafe and restaurant too. 

I highly recommend stopping by! I am definitely coming back hopefully for the night time tour."
5,I remember my friends and I used to go here for fun growing up in middleschool/high school. I&apos;ve honestly only had amazing times visiting this place
5,"There&apos;s something beautiful about buildings maintained enough to keep them from crumbling.  Eastern State was clearly well built, is maintained, but also showing it&apos;s signs of age and the dust of a thousand inmates (the number is poetic license) still lingers in the halls.  It&apos;s really cool to see, particularly the areas that are being worked on.
It&apos;s a definite life goal to go back for Terror Behind the Walls."
5,"I&apos;ve lived in Philadelphia my whole life and I&apos;ve only ever been to Eastern State Penitentiary for their Terror Behind the Walls Halloween haunted house, but I&apos;m so glad I finally got to visit for the historial aspect. 

Pro Tip: Being that this is an abandoned prison, if it is cold outside it will also be cold for the duration of your visit inside the grounds. For whatever reason when I visited on February 29th I had anticipated at least a slight break from the cold (like maybe less wind??) but I basically froze my fingers off. They did have heat lamps in the more commonly trafficked areas, but that&apos;s definitely something to consider. Bundle up&apos; 

The purchase of your ticket includes and easy to use audio guide, with numbers clearly marked throughout the tour. I&apos;m a huge history person, and to be able to learn as much as I did from an audio guide that was included is fantastic. I will say that some of the clips were a little bit lengthy in relation to the small area covered, but I&apos;d personally rather more information than less. There was so much to learn about one of America&apos;s most famous and most expensive penitentiary ever built. 

I spent about 3 hours thoroughly wandering the grounds and listening to most (if not all) of the audio clips on the guide. My absolute favorite part of the entire tour was Cell Block 7-- one of the newer blocks built with two floors. You&apos;re able to wander up the steps to get a higher vantage point which is very cool. 

Overall if you&apos;re someone who likes history and learning, this is a great way to learn something different about the past America&apos;s prison as well as Philadelphia."
4,"What a dump!  Broken windows everywhere, dirty rooms that haven&apos;t been touched in years and a complete lack of heat and A/C.  I definitely would not want to spend the night here.  (Shoulder Tap)  Oh, it&apos;s supposed to be like that?  Well, they nailed it then!

Eastern State Penitentiary in Philly is a great way to kill a few hours.  The self guided audio tour is very well done and lets you listen to Steve Buscemi tell you about various aspects of the prison as you walk around.  Simply enter a number and press play and you&apos;re told where to go, what to look at, and you get to learn about the history of this magnificent prison.

After the &quot;guided&quot; tour which is about 10 stops, you can wander around and check out other areas that aren&apos;t part of the tour.  There are many so make sure you get a map and check out what you want to see.  I wish the guided tour went to some of these areas as it can be tricky to find some of them.

Weather can also play a huge factor so if it&apos;s cold out, dress like you&apos;ll be outside.  I can imagine in the summer it gets pretty hot in there too.

And even if you&apos;re not going to buy any souvenirs, head to the gift shop as you can see the visitation area where prisoners met with their visitors.  That&apos;s prior to where they check tickets, so that&apos;s a freebie!"
4,"I&apos;ve been wanting to come here for a really long time. I always try to go to the haunted house they host but could never make it. I was finally able to take a regular self guided tour through the facility and really enjoyed it. You&apos;re given head sets and can walk through the facility as you&apos;re told about it&apos;s history at your own pace. Just a warning, if it&apos;s cold out, be sure to dress warm enough because the penitentiary is cold and damp. Occasionally you&apos;ll come across heaters so that the staff doesn&apos;t freeze but I wish I&apos;d dressed a little warmer. 

Despite that, I really enjoyed all of the history and stories. Being able to walk through the halls of the penitentiary and see old cells, gave you some insight on the conditions. There was also plenty information on how this correctional system compared to others and evolved."
5,"What a creepy fucking place.  This prison, dating back to almost Revolutionary times, is smack dab in the middle of Philadelphia.  The city effectively built up around it, and given that it looks like a damned fortress from outside, this serves to make it even more imposing.  Price to get in was reasonable and staff was all at least moderately friendly.  The audio tour worked well ~95% of the time which just 1 area (forget which one) being a little off.  The whole place is in a state of ruin, so you have to be careful where you walk; I got stuck in the mud on more than 1 occasion in the yards as it had just rained.

I really liked the colonial section they walked you through first, although the Steve &quot;Crazy Eyes&quot; Buscemi narration made it a bit funny.  The Pep the Dog stuff was funny, the synagogue was weird, the art installations (especially the one about queens) were good, and death row was pretty oppressive.  Al Capone&apos;s cell was closed for renovation when we came which was the only downside.  We spent a few hours here and probably could&apos;ve spent at least 2 more.  Can&apos;t complain though from a value standpoint, as they&apos;ve clearly done a good job presenting this prison and making sure it&apos;s relevant for modern audiences.

Would definitely come back for the Halloween shows they do!"
5,"ESP is a great place to visit and learn about the world&apos;s first true &quot;penitentiary&quot;. We did the audio tour which was narrarated by Steve Buscemi. It didn&apos;t have the human interaction that we would have had with a tour guide but Steve Buscemi did an excellent job explaining what we were looking at and gave us the history of the prison. 

Taking a tour of ESP really opened my eyes to all the things that are wrong with the jusicial system. I really enjoyed learning about the history of the prison and those who were incarcerated there. Although there are a lot of things unknown about the prison before it was shut down in 1970, a lot has been learned from the warden&apos;s writings. If you&apos;re ever in Philly looking for something to do then I highly recommend visiting ESP and taking a tour. Conor who was working the &quot;How to open a lock&quot; station was very helpful and knowledgeable in answering all my questions."
5,"My boyfriend and I visited back in September and we were not disappointed. It was favorited as a place to go in Philly. 

I typically am not interested in Historic Sites, but this one intrigued me because of the notorious prisoners.  I enjoyed the headset &amp; audio tour, it was informative and brought me through each section.  It was pretty creepy &amp; eerie, but very interesting.  I can&apos;t imagine how scary it is during the Halloween season where they do Terror Behind the Walls.  I always wanted to visit during that event, but can&apos;t seem to find friends willing to go with me haha 

I definitely recommend everyone take an hour or two to visit the Eastern State Penitentiary."
5,"What an interesting place! The base ticket includes narration by Steve Buscemi, which was honestly fantastic. As you go through each section, signs on the wall will tell you what number to listen to on your audio device. There were so much to learn here--history of the prison, specific inmates, inmates who escaped, facts and stories about other prisons. There was even a dog inmate! I imagine the place is terrifying at night, and I think it would be super cool to go to a haunted house there, which apparently they do!

They also have a cute little gift shop at the end."
5,"Came for 2 reasons - terror behind the walls and daytime viewing of a delapidated prison.

Terror behind the walls was fun. Not too scary for me since there were so many people around and I chose not to get the necklace that allows the actors to touch you. I did find myself running at times but also laughing. I screamed at the most stupid things like puffs of air.

We went during opening weekend so the lines were crazy. They have separate lines for each time slot. We waited an hour outside to get in. Seemed like people just kept showing up for the 9pm time slot line even though it was well past 9. We had the 9:30 slot and were first in that line. There were creepy costumed guys scaring the people waiting in line.

The next day I enjoyed the self guided tour of the prison which is narrated by Steve Buscemi and others. Very easy to follow the narration and stopping points along the way. We saw Al Capone&apos;s old cell which has been recreated to look like it was when he lived there. Several artists did some work inside some cells, including a whole car that must have been disassembled and reassembled inside. I hoped to see some ghosts in my photos but no dice."
5,Great Historical place. Nice day tours &amp; awesome at Halloween !! Can&apos;t wait to go again this year as last year was cancelled.
4,"I&apos;ve always wanted to visit mainly because of the notorious prisoners and the supposed &quot;haunted&quot; history of the building. I wasn&apos;t pushed or pinched today but was very happy nonetheless to be able to visit. 

It was so interesting to see the first Penitentiary that gave rise to 300 more prisons to be built after Eastern State. It&apos;s a step back in time with the pealing paint, ceiling falling in, old hardware that you can imagine must have creaked and groaned even in its heyday. 

The guides to help you along if needed were nice, especially the young  man in the gift shop. Informative and funny, I wish I&apos;d caught his name. 

Don&apos;t forget to pass through the gift shop to listen to a short movie and sit in the prisoners visiting room. It&apos;s amazing to think back on such an isolated period they would have had."
4,"Eastern State Penitentiary is in downtown Philadelphia.  It was built in the late 1800s.  It operated as a prison until early 1970s when it shut down and became a tourist attraction.  It is said to be haunted.  The structure is built out of very thick stone and concrete.  The entrance cost is about $14 online, $16 at the door.  I spend about 2 hours checking out the place.  An audio device with headphones are included with admission.  It&apos;s worth checking out this place.  Lots of history and stories to told. There is a parking structure about a block away which costs about $4 hour.  Worth checking out if you are into history or just want to checkout one of the oldest prisons in the U.S."
5,"Eastern State Penitentiary is the world&apos;s most expensive prison that looks more like a castle from the outside. Opened in 1829, its first inmate was Charles Williams, who was a farmer sentenced to 2 years because of theft. When he was escorted to his cell, he had an eyeless hood placed over his head. This was done so other inmates would not see his face and make it easier for him to be released into society once his sentence is up so no one would recognize him. Wearing the hood also made sure that inmates would not see the layout of the prison and figure out an escape plan. Each time the inmate would leave their cell, they were required to be hooded. 

Through the audio tour, narrated by actor Steve Buscemi, which is included with admission price, you will learn numerous of interesting facts like the one above. There are 15 cell blocks and featured exhibits to occupy your time while you tour the grounds here. Please note that there are free docent led tours, but are only available at 2 pm. Spots for the tour run out, so make sure to reserve early (as it is first come/ first serve).

During the time of operation of this prison (1829- 1971), most cell blocks had a barbershop, complete with the originally preserved barber chair used. There would be one inmate that would be assigned to cut and shave other inmate&apos;s hair. It was interesting to learn that those inmates would be given sharp razors (only when they work).

Although most of the prisoners during the time of operation were adult males, they did take in females and children. But they were in a separate block. 

Being the most expensive prison, cells were centrally heated and equipped with running water, a flushable toilet, and a skylight. Al Capone, the famous gangster, was imprisoned here for 8 months in 1929 and he had a very fancy cell that was believed to have a second bed (unusual since the other cells only had 1 inmate per cell), oriental rug, oil painting and radio. Definitely much more inviting than any other cell here. 

In the mid 1920&apos;s, Pep the dog (a black labrador) was sentenced to life at Eastern State for murdering the governor&apos;s wife&apos;s cat (say it ain&apos;t so Pep). He got his mugshot taken and even was assigned an inmate number, C2559. He was not kept in a cell and was free to roam the the cell block. Pep the dog had articles written about him being a cat killer and slandering the poor pup&apos;s good reputation, which eventually prompted the governor&apos;s wife to clear Pep&apos;s name and had said that he never killed her cat and just wanted to give Pep to the prisoners to help boost morale. Definitely ahead of its time, Pep was like a therapy dog for the prisoners. 

On the day my husband and I visited Eastern State, it just happened to rain and pour during our visit. Completely forgot to bring the panchos that I packed in my luggage and umbrella, we ended up purchasing 2 panchos at the gift shop which were $3 each ($6.48 after tax for two). The majority of things to see are indoors but not everything is connected. Some of the exhibits are air conditioned but the cell blocks are not and can imagine it can get really hot in here. 

Because of the heavy down pour during our visit, there were a few parts that ended up having to close because of the flooding between cell block 7 and 8. During our 2.5 hour visit, we saw most of everything but would definitely come back to see the parts we didn&apos;t see and also check out one of the docent led tours to learn more. 

Please note that it is cheaper to purchase tickets on line, you save $2. There are restrooms but only right when you start the tour. They are porta potties but the nice ones you would rent for an event. Running water, soap and paper towels are available. 

Eastern State Penitentiary has also been featured in music videos, TV shows and movies that include Twelve Monkeys, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, TV show Ghost Hunters and Tina Turner&apos;s One Of The Living music video. 

If visiting Philadelphia, I highly recommend that you consider making Eastern State Penitentiary on your must visit list."
5,"A gothic castle structure in the middle of Philly? Why yes of course I&apos;m interested. My
Mom jokes that I&apos;m interested in anything old and decrepit. She&apos;s not wrong. A beautiful ruin of a building: flaking paint, rusted metal, rotted wood and dusty, broken skylights. It is atmospheric, moody, tragic and sad. There&apos;s also a lot of history here. How America and society attempted to address the issue of criminals and crime. It&apos;s a thoughtful and intelligent exhibit that outlines the mistakes made and changing attitudes. Is your debt to society ever really paid or is that stigma branded upon you for the rest of your life? The self guided audio tour is well done and informative. I could&apos;ve easily spent all day here exploring this preserved ruin. But even a history nerd  like me needed a mental and physical break. The art scattered throughout was neat and the selected photographs of the prison&apos;s history well displayed and well done. Kudos to the city of Philly for seeing value beyond dilapidation."
5,I used to come here every year as a kid during the Halloween seasons for the haunted house attraction. This place is always up to something--Every time I come back they add a new feature!! I wonder if fall tours will go on during COVID-19 but I certainly look forward to attending again!
