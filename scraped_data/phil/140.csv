5,"Sang Kee Peking will forever hold a special place in my heart. 

Hands down, the best poultry restaurant I&apos;ve come across. Nothing compares, not even Boston Chinatown. I wish I lived closer, but I make it a point to come by every time I&apos;m in town because I&apos;m obsessed! I loved this place before covid and if anything, I think they taste even better now. It amazes me that they maintain the same taste every time I visit. Roasted duck, pork, and chicken with green veggies over white rice? A must-try. 

My boyfriend and I usually dine in but due to covid, we had to order online. The process was effective, fast, and easy. First-time orders receive a discount AND you earn points every time you order, what more could you ask for? Overall, everyone is extremely friendly and their contact-less pickup is a huge plus! 

We can&apos;t wait to come back!"
5,"Their duck with plum sauce has helped me survive covid quarantine, and I am not in the least bit joking. The duck is so plump juicy and delicious I am salivating as a write.They have a large menu and I have a habit of freezing and not sure what to get when I am presented with too many choices. So I almost always stick with the duck with plum sauce, eggplant, and green beans. These are three solid dishes that I have to recommend if you&apos;re unsure of what to get.
I have also tried the peking duck here, however I am not a fan of the pancake they use, it feels like a tortilla and it should NOT feel like a tortilla. 
Thank you Sang Kee Peking duck house for getting me through the pandemic!"
4,"We preordered our Christmas dinner from Sang Kee because we wanted to support local and because we were too lazy to cook. We got the peking duck dinner for 2 (sorry, forgot to take pictures). They called me in advance to let me know they were running behind on orders and asked if I could come pick up my food at a later time. I appreciated the call in advanced and gave them an extra 45 mins for my order. 

Boyfriend loved our meal, especially the peking duck and fried rice. I thought everything was decent. My favorite dish was the house special fried rice. Since it was takeout, the peking duck skin wasn&apos;t very crispy by the time we brought our food home. Our meal could&apos;ve fed 3 people so we definitely had leftovers. I&apos;ve been to Sang kee in the past to try out their roast pig and it is pretty good. It is on the fattier side but the chinese five spice flavors are more prominent than other roast pig places. Only thing I did not like was that they include bones. Some other places cut the meat to exclude the bones which makes it an easier eat."
5,"Really had a craving for a rice and meat plate and paid a visit to Sang Kee. They are hidden in the back of Chinatown and I can only imagine how busy they can get if they were more centrally located. I ended up getting the roast pork, duck, and chicken rice platter. Reminds me of the take out places where I grew up in San Francisco. One thing to note is that their roast pork is cha siu. They do serve roast pig, but only on the weekends - I have to make a visit again to try some."
1,"What was once a pillar of the Chinese community is now on my do-NOT-go list! I ordered $72 worth of food delivered for Chinese New Year and my expectations were not met... not even close. First, the steamed dumplings, which we expected to be har gow (shrimp dumplings, a dish that most every restaurant has) but ended up being shrimp wontons. Second, my son&apos;s roast pork rice platter had a long hair in it (see picture). Third, the Peking Duck we ordered was nothing more than Cantonese style roast duck that was deboned, not the crispy duck that Peking duck is supposed to be. Fourth, my other son&apos;s salt baked seafood platter had mealy-tasting scallops in it.  I am thoroughly disappointed in my order. ((( review edited after reading the owner&apos;s response ))) I am still dissatisfied with my order, especially as it fell on such an important time as Chinese New Year."
4,"Me and my sister took a trip to philly and was craving duck so we placed a takeout order. I had heard great reviews from a coworker. I ordered the roasted duck wonton noodle soup. The broth was delicious. The flavor had an extra level to it with the saltiness from the duck in the soup. However kinda disappointed the wontons literally fell apart. The filling separately from the wrapper when I took it out of the takeout container. I do have to say the filling was legit shrimp and pork, no fillers. The wontons were spiced well. You can taste an umami flavor. The noodles were standard. The family raves about the duck and roast pork. Crispy duck skin with salty meat. Definitely stop by if you love duck!!!"
4,"Solid go-to in chinatown with lots of great options, and I&apos;ll put in a special plug or their duck because it is consistently delicious imo.

Their duck is famous for its juicy yummy flavors. Their peking duck is the real treat and a bit pricier than other items on their menu but so worth it. Their portions are pretty generous so with their chow fun type dishes, you can easily stretch it into two meals. 

When it was open in-person prior to covid, I felt that their service wasn&apos;t particularly stellar, but they have a really efficient system set up for pick up during covid. One time they seemed to forget about our orders or something so it took a bit longer, but otherwise the ordering has been very seamless and safe. Overall, it&apos;s a solid spot that I frequently visited this past summer and fall."
5,"Chinatown in Philly is overwhelming with so many amazing options! 

We picked Sang Kee Peking Duck House because they were highly rated for their Pekin Duck. Great classic Chinese restaurant with some top food and service. The serving sizes were generous. 

It was my first time trying Pekin Duck and I have to say it&apos;s was DELICIOUS &amp; FLAVORFUL! The Singapore noodle were sooo good. The curry they used for the noodles was some of the best curry I have had. 

COVID - Excellent online ordering and contactless pickup system. Planning another trip to Philly just to come eat here again."
5,"COVID19: Pickup available. No dine-in. They placed pickup table by their door. It&apos;s by the edge of Chinatown.

I only got the to-go duck because I needed protein for my rice and salad. But all you need to know was that the duck was delicious - included the duck sauce even without asking.

I never knew the name of this place, but I remember my friends taking me to this place all the time when I was young. I discovered this place when Ting Wong was closed and they didn&apos;t offer duck. I&apos;m glad they didn&apos;t.

The guy taking the order was super friendly! He suggested their $30 peking duck was worth it. One day I will try that. This has become my new go-to place for duck dishes."
5,"Update: we ordered takeout and it was prompt and still piping hot! Seriously the best Chinese food you will find! I&apos;ll breakdown what we got:

Spring rolls- the most crispy wrapper I&apos;ve ever had! Get the house duck sauce and mix in a little of the house hot mustard. You can thank me later.

Seaweed soup- y&apos;all. This could possibly cure covid its sooooo good! Also good for breastfeeding moms! 

Lobster- hubs loved it! Literally was taking closeups off it! 

Snow pea leaves- perfectly tender with still a little crunch. Whole garlic, so easy to eat around for those of us who have, ahem, stomach aversions to garlic. But still added the appropriate flavor.

Fried chicken wings- I have no idea what kind chickens they are having lifting weights in the back, but these are HUGE! And the crunch on them is amazing! 

Beef chow fun- perfect preparation of a classic comfort take out food. 

Peking Duck-the best. Tender, flavorful, not greasy. Perfectly prepared! If you don&apos;t go for anything else, go for this. Get the buns to wrap with. You won&apos;t be disappointed.

Can&apos;t stress enough how great the food and service were. Make sure you order extra house duck and mustard, you don&apos;t want that prepackaged stuff. They also even delivered plates and utensils since we ordered to a hotel. Amazing experience all around.

Oh yeh, and get a Tshirt!"
5,"This is one of my favorite restaurants to go to when I&apos;m in Philly. I would go with my roommates before and my friends when they visit. I normally would dine in at Sang Kee but due to COVID, I ordered pick up. 

I was very happy when they finally opened up. I ordered the salted chicken fried rice, vegetables, beef chow fun, Peking duck, roast pork, HK style duck, and white rice. Everything was very good but my favorite dishes would be the duck and the salted fish fried rice. I would sometime order the noodle soup and other specialty dinner dishes.

The food is always fast but the service I have to say it&apos;s not the best."
5,"Sang Kee&apos;s finally back up and running for contactless pick up and delivery and I have never been more stoked. 

My fave things to get here is the beef chow fun, roast duck, pork &amp; wonton noodle soup and essentially any dish with duck, either hk style roasted or peking style. If you have haven&apos;t tried peking duck before, give it go - it is absolutely delicious. 

If yall grew up on congee and this entire quarantine has gotten you down then I highly encourage you to order the congee. It is a true comfort food. They have it available all day long. I went for the classic pork and century egg congee and it hit the spot! It also comes with a stick of fried dough and who doesn&apos;t like fried dough?!

Oh and another tip - first time orders on Sang Kee&apos;s website gets a 10% discount added in. So when all is said and done, you get to support a Chinatown business, eat some delicious food and save some dolla dolla bills along the way. Ya just can&apos;t beat it."
5,"This place, like many others, is my place to go for peking duck. Since 2014, I try to make a trip here everytime I visit philly. Usually takeout to bring back to my family or friends (they love it too!). FYI half duck = one whole plastic takeout container with 5 buns/pancakes, full duck = two whole plastic takeout containers with 10 buns/pancakes

They have options for buns or thin pancakes. I can never choose betwen the two so I always ask for half and half when I call. They are usually pretty receptive.

In terms of COVID pre-cautions, I&apos;d say theyre doing their due dillegance. There are social distancing lines outside of the restaurant, screens providing safety for both workers and customers, and signs with directions on how to order and pick up your food!"
5,"Wow! The quality of their roast pork and duck is excellent and this review is mainly for that. I&apos;ve gotten both of the platters and they were delicious! The platters come with rice and veggies and it&apos;s a generous portion! I&apos;m from new york and there&apos;s some pretty good chinese food but this spot is equivalent or better than some places I know for roast pork . Their roast pork is juicy, tender, and lean. I highly recommend coming here if you&apos;re craving for that and there&apos;s also a location in the reading terminal market."
5,"Good food , great service !!!! Even take out only they do not make a mistake on your order!!! Peking duck is very good and the noodles are great !!!!"
4,"The Peking Duck here is yummy. If you were curious like me, no, they don&apos;t cut up the duck tableside. Presentation is very important and once you&apos;ve been to a delicious Chinese restaurant that does cut in front of you, you might wonder why other places don&apos;t! More importantly though, it takes skill and a special knife to cut up a duck well to maximize the amount of meat from the bones, which is the real reason why seeing it be cut matters.

Anyway, Sang Kee serves amazing food! The only real problem is that you might not have enough table space in a bigger group ordering dish after dish! Don&apos;t come here and not get some duck because that&apos;s their specialty. Be smart and get some rice and/or noodles and some veggies to go with your bird.

Thank yee, Sang Kee."
5,"My favorite Chinese in Philadelphia. Massive menu, high quality ingredients, and authentic options"
5,"This is one of my BF&apos;s favorite restaurant that he used to come here with his Dad. I took my BF here for his 32nd Birthday and we had dinner here.

The restaurant is spacious with two floors. Restaurant is super busy especially on Friday nights and weekends. The quality and style of food is comparable to what we have in New York City&apos;s - Wonton Garden, except there are mixed drinks and cocktails available. We tried the following:

Peking Duck - similar taste if not better then some of the Peking Ducks I&apos;ve tried in New York City. It&apos;s rich, meaty, and juicy. My BF and I usually get 1/2 a duck and their special duck sauce.

Wonton Noodles - this is absolute comfort food and tastes amazing. Their wontons are wrapped perfectly and meaty. 

Steamed Dumplings - these are huge and packed with flavor and just the right filling. 

Roast Pork - these were mediocre and I believe New York City has some of the best roast pork.

Sang Kee is definitely a must visit in Philadelphia&apos;s Chinatown for Chinese comfort food. It&apos;s definitely been one of my favorite restaurants in Philadelphia so far."
5,"Hands down the best duck I&apos;ve ever had, it&apos;s so tender and flavorful. The covid set up is it&apos;s just a window where you can pick up so you might as well just call in your order. Despite Covid at during time there was a long wait to order but totally worth it."
5,"If you&apos;re looking for old school roast duck, roast pork, Sang Kee is the place! The Mrs. likes old school Cantonese and was thrilled with the place. 
Order online, then swing by and pick it up, plenty of space to park and dash in. Some &quot;musts&quot; on the menu are 1lb pork spare ribs, fried flounder with candied walnuts, and Congee! You might think that 1lb of spare ribs is a lot for 2 people -it&apos;s not!! SK is now our &quot;go-to&quot; for old school Cantonese!"
