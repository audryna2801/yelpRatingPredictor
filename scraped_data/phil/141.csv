5,"This is some of the best French food in all of Philly. The crepes are out of this world, the real deal. The ratatouille is my go-to; it is really good. That delicious little cocktail &quot;Sumer in Paris&quot; is a delight. Pricey but worth it for a splurge."
5,"This review is just for the bar.
On a recent day in Philadelphia, celebrating the Christmas season, we stopped into Beau Monde for cocktails. We were the only people in the restaurant at this late time on a weeknight. But, that didn&apos;t prevent it from being a cozy, warm place for a late night drink .
The fire was going in the centraly located fireplace and the bartender was happily manning the bar.
I love a warm dark spot on a cold winter night.
Our barman was so nice. Friendly and accommodating.
I ordered a Veuix Carre and F ordered a Pimm&apos;s cup (not your every day drinks). So help was recruited from a veteran bartender. She was a total pro, and patiently explained the drink to the newbie. It was wonderful to watch.
Both drink were delicious and the conversation with our servers was just the icing on the cake."
5,"My Mom and I enjoyed a wonderful dinner here while we were in town. It was also Valentine&apos;s Day, though we didn&apos;t realize that at the time. I love that you can schedule a reservation here on OpenTable. I learned quickly in Philadelphia that you shouldn&apos;t go anywhere without a reservation!

I adored the ambiance here and its slightly off-the-beaten-path location. Its a cozy, fireplace roaring, dimly light French-inspired restaurant. It feels &quot;good&quot; to just pull up and see the building. There&apos;s cute details like an endearing host in a french beret, the coffee creamer comes out of a pig-shaped saucer (see my photo) and it is the type of place I could sit for hours.

The scallop crepe was one of the best crepes I&apos;ve ever had. The batter was delicious and there had to be at least 8 pieces of scallop inside. When you order scallops, you get desensitized that you&apos;re going to receive 3 artfully placed scallops, so this was a nice surprise. The seafood sauce inside was creamy and gave the crepe such a satisfying flavor. We will absolutely return the next time we are in Philadelphia - it was a lovely experience!"
4,"I made reservations online for 2 and we were quickly seated. From there the service was trash. It took forever to get water and when we did get them we got cracked glasses. So we asked for new ones. 

The only thing that saves this place was the food. It was actually extremely good. We started with the pizza as an appetizer, then order two savory crepes (ham egg &amp; cheese and some fish), then we ended with a sweet crepe banana Nutella CrÃªpe with ice cream on top. Delicious!"
5,"Ohhhh I am just going to rave about this restaurant. First timer having crepes. My sister suggested anything that involves mushroom sauce. So went with chicken and arugula. Sweet baby Jesus!!! I wanted to just drink the sauce out of a cup! Amazing! The crepe was so wonderfully delicious! The chicken was tender and tasty. 

The very close tie for first place was Amie, our sparkling, charming and so very endearing waitress. She was so very attentive, friendly and lovely. Amie made lunch so enjoyable. 

So go eat a crepe, especially on Tuesday when Amir is definitely working! Haha!"
5,"Beautiful place, relaxed atmosphere with a huge menu. We started w goat cheese / strawberry compote which came with crepe dics. Absolutely delicious. CrepEs and salad we&apos;re equally impressive and the service was perfect. I look forward to coming back"
1,"Bought VIP Tickets for a valentine&apos;s show where we were supposed to have RESERVED SEATING!  I EVEN CALLED to see if we needed reservations to see the show. The guy assured me that because I had a ticket I didn&apos;t need a reservation.  My date and I drove an hour an a half from Lehighton only to discover after wondering around the venue for 10 or more minutes looking for our RESERVED SEATS only to have received an email 1 HOUR PRIOR TO THE EVENT ON THE DAY OF saying &quot;Unfortunately, you&apos;ll no longer be able to use your voucher/ticket for the show sorry for the inconvenience, you&apos;re welcome to use the ticket 4 months LATER in June&quot;

No apologies from staff or owners. Very disappointed in the way it was handled and will NOT be making a trip in June to MAYBE get to see the show again unless they cancel it AGAIN THE DAY OF THE EVENT AN HOUR BEFORE."
3,"This review is based on 3 visits and with each visit I really wanted to love this place because it&apos;s so cozy inside and looks like it should be a pleasant bistro vibe. However, the service is standoffishly meh and the crepes are good but lack texture. 

The plus side, well, decor is nice and inviting, the space has nice natural light to take food pics  cuz you know this matters!!! The Kobe beef burger is pretty delicious even when the kitchen over cooks it and the onion soup has a very nice broth with gooey, stretchy cheese. 

No condiments on the table, as in many restaurants that prepare things the way they want you to eat it but they left the buns bare on my beef burger (try and say that 3 Times fast)."
3,"Formage plate was good, cheeses were great! Would&apos;ve been better with less grapes and maybe a compote of some sort. Also has the French onion soup, turned out to be nothing but broth despite asking for extra onions. Coworker had the andouille sausage crepe and I had the Kobe beef burger. Both were AMAZING!!! Dessert was the crepe Suzette and the banana, Nutella, &amp; hazelnut gelato crepe. Both were pretty good, worth a try. It was a decently good meal, good enough to return as long as the tall thin guy isn&apos;t your server. 

He was the downside of the experience. Everything we needed we had to get his attention and call him to the table. When at the table he acted as if we were interrupting him or a bother. It was frustrating. Coworker is from the area and said the girl with the short dark hair is an amazing server. Wish we would&apos;ve had her.

I come to the area often and love trying the local restaurants, can&apos;t say I&apos;d venture there again when I&apos;ve tried numerous other spots and had a better experience. A good place for locals but if your passing through you might want to try somewhere else."
5,"2017 Edition!

Stopped by this past weekend and enjoyed the Coq Au Van crepe which was amazing. It was the first time I ever had Coq Au Van in any form and was pleased with how tender the chicken in the crepe actually was. It was so tender it seemed as if it were slow roasted for hours! The crepe also had pearl onions, shrooms, and carrots which worked really well this the chicken  and its juices.

Service was perfect as usual. Friendly and not overly pushy. Prices were on point for what they normally are."
5,"My friends &amp; I decided to explore this place for a girls night out! It was a perfect place where we could spend long hours drinking, talking, and eating. We started our evening sitting at the Bar trying a few cocktails. Bartender was very sweet and helpful to get you the right drink per your taste. I tried a cocktail with Blueberry Vodka in it and was spot-on to my taste. 

Our server for the table was also very sweet, polite and patient while we took time to place our order between the chit chat :) 

We tried variety of dishes including Beau Monde Pizza, Soup of the day - Tortilla soup (Heaven! Best soup ever). Made my own Crepe with all veggies and it was simply delicious. Overall had a great time."
4,"Not a brunch review: This was the perfect date night meal before Painting with a Twist; even on a Friday night, the restaurant was not packed and incredibly romantic. It&apos;s very intimate with a lot of candlelight, big windows, and beautifully painted decor. We had the escargot to start and it was divine. It only came with five snails but the garlic and butter it was served with also came with bread to dip.

We had a beef short rib crepe as our savory entree and a banana hazelnut as our sweet. The beef short rib was a daily special and it was to die for. Ask your server for the daily specials; I&apos;m sure they will be fantastic. The menu has a lot of interesting flavor pairings for both sweet and savory. You can be adventurous if you wish or stick with something tried and true.

For us the beef short rib was expertly cooked and the crepe itself was filled with a spiced mashed potato that paired expertly. The sweet hazelnut banana crepe was the perfect end; just as you would expect.

Our drinks were on the stronger side which we appreciated. The servers were very professional and didn&apos;t check on us too much which was preferable. It was a great Friday date night spot and I would love to go again."
5,"We had such a nice time here on a Tuesday night that we overstayed our welcome. We had two savory crepes for dinner that were delicious and cute, with a little bit of the contents arranged as a decoration on top. Then we split a sweet crepe - warm banana and coconut? Delectable! The waitress gave great recommendations for the food and answered my questions about the wine. It was a quiet night so we sat and chatted, enjoying the atmosphere. We looked up and realized the place was empty and it was 50 minutes past closing. I feel so awful for keeping them so late. They were too kind to not kick us out. We really had the nicest time and we&apos;ll be more careful with keeping track of the hour the next time we visit.
The duck with fig jam and goat cheese - yum!!!"
4,"My wife absolutely loves crepes and we used to be regulars here about 15 years ago when we lived in the vicinity. We returned here on New Year&apos;s Eve 2019 and the place still looks the same. A special menu was being served and it didn&apos;t disappoint ; 
the sweet crepes were better than the ones that weren&apos;t. Personally Iliked the wild mushroom crepe- cheesy but very tasty and filling. I&apos;m a big eater but somehow my wife ended up going for a second crepe! Hers was a Nutella/Hazelnut combo.The service was pretty good. 
Overall, would certainly go recommend."
5,"The warmth of this restaurant is only superseded by the outstanding service of the staff and chef. 
I am on medication and really challenged the chef. The chef made for me the best meal I have had since I have had dining restrictions. The wait staff was never put off by my needs. They were completely honest and went above and beyond for me. I cannot thank them enough."
5,"Went here on a Wednesday night for a girls night out. There was maybe one just other table occupied! The bartender is super sweet and helpful. The server was really great too. Service makes the whole experience so much better! 

The food was outstanding, specially the dessert crepes! Will definitely be going back there.

For 5 alcoholic drinks, 1 non alcoholic drink, 1 appetizer, 1 soup, 4 savory crepes, and 1 sweet crepe we paid $160 before gratuity - which is awesome price wise!! The food was so tasty, I ate more than I should have haha"
4,"Came here last night for the Misses&apos;s birthday. We came for crepes, stayed for the happy hour. Here are the good, and the slightly better and less than good:

Good:
Everything was at least tasty. For dinner, I had the French Onion soup, steak brochette, and duck steamed bun. For the table, we got a semi-soft cheese and fruit platter. The cheese platter was scrumptious. I don&apos;t remember what the exact cheese was, but it was delicious and came with grapes, apple slices, dried cranberries and figs (and baguette, natch). The steamed bun was SUPER INSANELY soft and came with arugula and creme fraiche (side note, almost EVERYTHING came with arugula.) It was very tasty. The steak brochette was just a skewer of steak (on a bed of....you guessed it, arugula), but was cooked to a nice medium (they didn&apos;t ask) and came with a warm potato salad, also tasty. The French Onion soup was a BIT of a disappointment, but was still tasty. The misses got the appetizer pizza (&quot;meh,&quot; and is consistently the lowest reviewed item) and ratatouille for dinner. Her entree was plated BEAUTIFULLY (topped with....wait for it.....arugula ha!) and was very tasty to boot. 

Everyone was really nice, and our waitress gave us our space but wasn&apos;t absent. 

Better than good:
First off, they had a boulivardier, which made me impossibly happy, since any other place I order this at, they look at me like I asked them to do quantum physics. Secondly, the dessert crepes were fantastic. Not too sweet, super thin, flavorful. I opted for the chocolate and Grand Marnier crepe, which came to the table literally ablaze, and the misses got some banana and coconut piece of heaven that came with ice cream and chantilly cream. Mine was really good, hers was DELICIOUS. 

The space is very nice and inviting; cozy and intimate without being dark or congested. 

Less than good:
Its not exactly cheap. Even with half of my meal coming off the happy hour menu, our bill was about $135 after tip. Its not exactly highway robbery either though, which is why its just &quot;less than good.&quot; 

Something that I really didn&apos;t like is that there are only THREE entrees: ratatouille, &quot;kobe&quot; beef burger and a 10 ounce strip steak. Everything else is a crepe. You can get multiple iterations of savory crepes or even make your own which, crepes is why you came here, but I&apos;m sure a LOT of people are in the same boat that we were in which was, &quot;I want crepes for dessert, so I don&apos;t want a crepe for dinner too.&quot; 

Still, it was a good meal, and I wouldn&apos;t mind coming back for a savory crepe sometime."
3,"Went in for breakfast this morning, and the waitress who waited on us just seemed like she had an issue from the first moment we walked in. We waited 50 minutes for a cup of soup and 2 crepes; the restaurant was hardly crowded so we didn&apos;t understand why there was such a delay in getting our food. Also, our waitress seemed particularly standoffish. 

The downgrade is primarily from the service. Food was okay but would have been excellent had it come out fresh. Seems like it was just sitting in the back for a long time."
4,"On a recent trip to Philadelphia my traveling companion and I joined a large group of local friends at Beau Monde for brunch. There were 11 of us, so we called ahead and were seated with no problems. The interior is stunning and evokes false memories of elegant tearooms from the turn of the last century. There was a chill in the air that day and so the cozy fireplace was going, which further added to the already great vibe.

The food, and there was a lot of it at our large table, was all beautiful and delicious. If you don&apos;t want crepes there may not be a lot of other options to choose from, though one friend got the French Onion Soup and another got a really lovely salad with roasted beets. For the rest of us it was crepes all around, and most of us went with some sort of savory egg option. They have a list of combo suggestions, or you can strike out on your own and fill your crepe with whatever you prefer. I chose scrambled eggs, spinach, and mushrooms, and a mimosa, and the four people at my end of the table also split a Nutella banana crepe for dessert. They had a nice drinks list from coffee to cocktails to champagnes, beers, wines, ciders, and softdrinks. 

Next to us was another large party of around the same size - a baby shower - and this seems like a great place to hold such an event. My favorite crepe place on my home turf is a dive that can seat 6-8 people max, and they drop your check off by the time you&apos;re half done so they can turn the table over, so this lovely place is palatial in comparison and the prices are about the same. We actually had to run off to an appointment right after brunch, so it was shocking to this here New Yorker to discover that when you ask for the check, unless you specify that you&apos;re in a heck of a rush to go, you&apos;re going to have to wait quite a while until it is dropped off and then a while still more for them to come back and process the transaction. I&apos;m told this is normal for Philly in general but what do I know, so I can&apos;t fault the staff, all of whom were really great throughout our meal and very accommodating of our large party. 

We enjoyed the ambiance so much we ended up meeting up with a couple of other people for Happy Hour drinks the next day before catching our bus back home. They told us that it was funny we chose this place, as it used to be their favorite spot to meet up. They also recommended we come back for Drag Brunch or any number of other great events hosted in their performance space upstairs, so next time we&apos;re in town that is definitely happening. Check the website for details on who / what / when. This place is absolutely on my When In Philly list!"
5,"Came here for the first time with my mom and 13 year old sister. They&apos;ve been here before and they said i need to come immediately (my mom apparently comes to eat here 4x a month!) 
So anyways..... our waitress was Lynnea and she was super nice, awesome and hospitable! And gave great suggestions and made everything sound so tasty. And everything was absolutely delicious!
The ambiance is quaint and cute and i highly recommend coming here for brunch. SOOOOOOO many crepe options it&apos;s overwhelming but in a good way, and if you a good server (like Lynnea) then you are guided through and it&apos;s a treat!"
