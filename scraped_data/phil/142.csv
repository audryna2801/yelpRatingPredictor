5,"During COVID I have had to alter my dinner plans in PHL while traveling. The Capital Grille remained open throughout the shutdown for takeout orders. Wasn&apos;t crazy about a 21$ Burger but with the quality of the meat, service and attention I was glad to spend it. The asparagus is tender and tasty as well. I have added The Capital Grille to my list while in PHL."
5,"I got creme brûlée takeout for my sisters birthday since it her favorite dessert and yes I know this city has multiple French restaurants but their creme brûlée is hands down the best. Even though we got takeout, it was still elevated, our creme brûlée didn&apos;t fit elegantly in the takeout containers but it was beautifully garnished with mixed fresh berries and mint. We got metal appearing, plastic cutlery neatly wrapped in a thick paper napkin, again it made the takeout experience luxurious, like dinning at this steakhouse. Also the creme brûlée was still amazing and my sister was very happy."
5,"First time out since the pandemic started. This place couldn&apos;t have made me feel more safe. All tables distanced perfectly, staff was wearing masks and gloves at all times. Our server Rob was amazing.  I could tell he was the only server on duty and he was getting pretty busy but yet he still took excellent care of us. He provided top notch service and knowledge on the menu selection.  He hit every step of service not missing a beat which is very hard when you have so many tables at once. I could tell he is a professional and experienced server.  Even provided us with a few jokes that kept myself and my guest laughing the day away. Much needed time out!"
5,"This was my first time coming here and I&apos;m so glad my boyfriend recommended this place! We came down from Jersey to get away for a day in Philly so this was the perfect gem to go to for a nice romantic dinner.

We were only able to get an reservation for 9:45 pm which i was worried about being they close at 10:00pm but the hostess reassured that they just close doors at 10:00 and you won&apos;t be rushed. When we sat down at 9:45 as the hostess said there wasn&apos;t any tables available yet at 9:30 (i called BS because i saw tables available. She also wasn&apos;t very friendly) but our waiter was very nice and helpful so that changed the mood around. 

-We ordered a whiskey Manhattan and Tito&apos;s and vodka. 
-Two lobster bisque - which were amazing! They actually put lobster pieces in the soup! Unlike other places that just purée and cheat you out the lobster.
-Two filet Mignon steaks that were delicious! And cooked to perfection.
- lobster Mac and cheese !! Omg so this was the best dish! It was so damn good i definitely and highly recommend this one.
- cream spinach was a hit to!

And to top it off we ordered warm chocolate cake with ice cream! 

I will be back and multiple locations now :)"
2,"Mixed bag roller coaster ride of highs and lows, typical for this brand. Don&apos;t miss the Strawberries and Cream (add mint, balsamic reduction and black pepper).

ARRIVAL
* valet is $24, not related to restaurant. Time your departure because it takes 20-25 minutes to pull your car
* coat check available, so no need to leave your stuff in your car
* check-in took 12 minutes and we had a reservation. so sick of &quot;we&apos;ll be ready for you shortly&quot;. Send us to the bar for a drink if it&apos;s not ready!
* asked for a quiet table, but there&apos;s no such thing in this madhouse of a steakhouse turned pricey diner.

AT THE TABLE
* martinis will arrive in the shaker, so be ready for a glass of water when you do eventually get to it
* machine ice for rocks drinks, so again be ready for watery booze

MAINS
* bone-in ribeye was far too fatty for my normal mid-rare. Parts were raw and others were gristle and all fat
* gratin potatoes covered with cakey breadcrumbs. but that&apos;s not gratin.
* mashed potatoes were little better than grocery&apos;s grab-and-go packs. Gluey and sticky. YUCK.

BEST FOR LAST -- DESSERT: Strawberries and Cream
So glad to have ordered this.
* fresh, ripe and flavorful strawberries
* rich, thick cream
* add mint, freshly-cracked black pepper, and ask for the balsamic reduction.
Perfection!

TIP
Get a free dessert by telling them it&apos;s your birthday. Every table around us was having a birthday. So lucky!"
5,"I have been to some of the best steak houses on the east coast, from Michelin starred places in NY, to steakhouses where the best and brightest policy makers in DC frequent and I typically am not a fan of chain restaurants. However, it was my parent&apos;s in law 30th anniversary and my wife and I wanted to take them to a steakhouse to celebrate. My father in law loves steak, but doesn&apos;t have the means to eat at nice steakhouses too often, so he frequents one about once a year and it&apos;s always Ruth&apos;s Chris. I&apos;m not a fan, so I was able to convince him to try something new. It was my treat so he couldn&apos;t say no. That&apos;s where capital grille comes in.

The ambiance is your typical old school steakhouse, Wood interior, dim lights, white table cloth, great service, those are all a given, so on to the food.

Drinks: We got glasses of wine to pair with each of our courses. This wasn&apos;t a formal wine pairing, but we just ordered one for our apps, entrees, desserts etc. You order from an iPad, which is modern, but not my preference. It makes it hard for multiple people to look at drinks and it&apos;s a bit bulky. But, I can see the appeal for some.

Appetizers: They start with bread and butter. It&apos;s your standard fare, I love bread, but tend to try not fill up on them when at a steakhouse, just because the main course is so heavy. Unless, they are popovers like the ones some competitors serve. We also got the Cast Iron Garlic Shrimp, Caesar Salad, and Fried Calamari. All were delicious.

Entrees: My wife and mother in law are pescatarians, so they got the Salmon and were satisfied with the flavor and perfect cook. My favorite steak here is the Porcini Rubbed Bone-In Ribeye with the 15-year aged Balsamic. OMG! This is scrumptious!!!!! It&apos;s ribeye, so of course I&apos;m going for bone in, but that rub and balsamic are to die for. It&apos;s hard for me to go back to normal steaks with just butter, it&apos;s that good.

Sides: We got the Mashed Potatoes and Green Beans. Mashed potatoes were a hit, the green beans were just ok.

Dessert: We finished it off with the Apple Pie/Tart/Crostini A la mode and boy was it tasty! Great way to cap off the dinner. And most importantly, my Father in Law is convinced this restaurant is better than Ruth&apos;s Chris so I can finally never return.

Overall:
Bread 3/5
Fried Calamari 5/5
Cast iron Shrimp 4/5
Caesar Salad 5/5
Salmon 5/5
Porcini Rubbed Ribeye 5/5
Mashed Potatoes 5/5
Green beans 4/5
Apple Pie 5/5"
3,"Due to lack of things to do, I&apos;ve really dug deep to finish these drafts of venues that aren&apos;t just in another city from the past, but also places that don&apos;t even exist anymore...Capital Grille is in the former in this case.

I was only here once, a spur of the moment visit where I wasn&apos;t in proper dress code, but they were kind to let me in. I was with a few other girls, and come to think of it, none of us were properly dressed (I was covered decently at least but I cannot say the same for the other people I was with).* 
 
Since I was still in my chicken phase, I remember ordering that dish (whatever it was at the time) as the girls loaded up on martini&apos;s and steaks. Back in this day, we girls still ate meat. They lied to the server about me by telling them it was my birthday (it sure wasn&apos;t) and they brought me a slice of key lime pie (which I don&apos;t eat but to be in the spirit, took a few bites and let them finish it off).

Besides that, the service to us was great, the men sitting around us were cordial as they can be to females who invaded their domain, and I don&apos;t have any complaints. 

*This is the kind of visit you have when you go with a bunch of strippers from Delilah&apos;s."
5,"OMG, I love this place! Dave took such good care of us last night! The food and the wine was amazing! THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!!!
We will definitely be back!!!"
5,"Short and sweet update almost 5 years later. Returned for a restaurant week dinner with the family. We got a cozy, charming table towards the back with flawless service. 

Ironically, I ordered similarly and couldn&apos;t have asked for a better filet (unless it was wagyu, I suppose). Top notch clam chowder and a flourless cake where I didn&apos;t miss the flour.

Maybe my 5 years of age helped me get better service, or I previously caught them on a bad night; but Capital Grille is one of the top (chain) steakhouses in Philly."
5,"AMAZING SERVICE AND EXPERIENCE!! First time here and it was nothing less than spectacular! From host to chef/cook that randomly walked by and tried to unexpectedly adjust my appetizer for me, which is appreciated, but i guess i beat him to it. Host and waiter occasionally checked in on us to make sure our dining experience needs were met. Thanks Amy!"
5,As always the service was excellent and the food was delicious and super fresh. The best part by far was the bartender. She visited with me and was able to tell when I was game to talk. Great experience.
5,Everything about this place is amazing from the ambiance to the waiter being funny!! The food is just amazing!! To think I never been here before not sure why but I will be back! No complaints just all compliments!
5,I really think capital Grille is an excellent restaurant. The food and the waiter service was excellent ! My husband and I celebrated our wedding anniversary and the restaurant was very gracious and gave us a wonderful anniversary dessert . I love how they have  outside dining and the dining  tables were very distant and I felt very comfortable eating . I would recommend this restaurant  to anyone who love great cuisine.
5,"Went there for a late night drink and snack after a long evening. Met some friends to catch up and prep.

Had a terrific glass of wine from the wine glass menu while burgers were enjoyed. 

Overall it was ight easy bar experience

I would go back!"
4,My boyfriend and I were looking for somewhere nice to eat for lunch on our trip to Philly. The food was absolutely amazing. I ordered the roasted chicken which was so juicy and tender. My boyfriend had the NY steak strip medium rare was well worth the price. We also ordered the lobster mac and cheese which was probably the best i have ever had. The reason for only four stars was the fact that they didn&apos;t offer sides with the main entrées which was kind disappointing for the price. I was also a little disappointed there was no lunch menu. Overall the food was absolutely delicious just a little pricy for lunch.
5,"Capital Grille has always been a favorite of ours, but this was our first time at the Philadelphia location. Our waitress, Heather was so helpful, sweet and attentive. 

Of course at Capital Grille, ordering steak is a must. The 32-oz Porterhouse Steak was juicy and cooked to perfection, we ordered it medium rare plus. Half NY Strip, half Filet Mignon. The meat basically melted in your mouth. The perfect crisp to juicy ratio. 

If you&apos;re ordering sides, the lobster mac and cheese is a must-try. It comes in a hot skillet with bread crumbs and large pieces of lobster. The cheese is so creamy and delicious, while the bread crumbs add a nice crunch. Definitely a favorite from the meal.

Another favorite was the dessert. The best for last! We ordered the Warm Apple Crostata with Vanilla Ice Cream. This was SO delicious. The cold ice cream is a perfect contrast to the hot apple pastry. The outside of the pastry was crispy, while the inside was soft, warm apple filling. We somehow had enough room (after being stuffed from dinner) to eat this dessert because it was so incredible. 

Overall: the steak was a classic, and the dessert was beyond delicious.

3,Went to have a nice meal with family. They have outdoor seating which was nice. The service could of been better or they could at least have more servers outside. The crab cakes were good! The salmon was a little salty. The sea bass was not good!! Sent it back and the manger stated &quot;yea it&apos;s not been good really&quot; crazy the manager would say that.  Over all it was just a ok experience. I don&apos;t know if I will be going back
5,"This was my first time going to The Capital Grille in the city. It was around lunch time with a large group but the accommodations and service was great. They had a Restaurant Week menu and their regular menu available which they gave you the option to pick either one (some places make it where if 1 person is getting the restaurant week deal, everyone in your party has to do the same and here you don&apos;t). We had Calamari as an appetizer, I had the lobster burger for lunch and both were delicious. I also shared the coconut cream pie which was also very fresh and delicious. I would definitely go back."
4,"3.5 stars 

Service was awesome! Love our waiter and the  basket of bread with amazingly soft butter! that was about it. 
I asked for a medium bone in filet mignon steak but it came out well done. So I didn&apos;t really get to enjoy what a good bone in filet mignon really is. I ate it half way and my boss asked the waiter to get me a new one that is actually a medium steak. It was less chewy this time but compared to the simply a filet mignon I had at the Capital Grille in Baltimore, MD, it&apos;s no where as good and since I was already half full from the &quot;bad&quot; steak I&apos;ve lost my appetite when the correct steak was served. Quite a disappointment since I was waiting for good steak just like I had in Baltimore. 

I also got to try the lobster tail, it was just lobster tail. The meat was crisp and not soggy which meant they were fresh, good quality. I didn&apos;t see anything special about it though, I could have made that for myself easily at home. 

For the shared appetizer ahi tuna, it did not have enough flavor to make me want to eat the last piece of it. I had wayyyy better elsewhere. The calamari was somewhat soggy and served with poor presentation. If the chef took a little time to organize it a bit better it might have looked more appealing than that plate of messy fried stuff."
5,"I went for my first dinner at this Capital Grille location on Sunday, July 14th at about 7pm for a party of four. 

The restaurant was pretty empty; however, the city in general seemed pretty quiet that night.  

Our entire experience from the service to the food was top notch!  Our server was friendly and explained everything in detail. 

I started with a cup of the French Onion Soup.  It was perfectly portioned between onions, broth and cheese.  Simply delicious.

I then had the sea scallop entrée.  The scallops were cooked to perfection, lightly browned and had a perfect flavor to them.

The table shared a side of the mashed potatoes and a side of the asparagus.  Both were great; however, Capital Grille mashed potatoes might be super high ranking to you.  (At least, they are in my book)

Overall wonderful experience, and I would certainly return again."
