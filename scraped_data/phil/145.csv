5,"I was introduced to this bakery by a friend and initially was kind of confused about what was so special about their cookies. Do not let looks deceive you. These are no ordinary baked goods!  These classic cookies are simply delicious! 

I am a huge fan of the cookies! The ricotta cookies are soft with a light icing on top. The pignolis are covered in pine nuts and soft in the middle. I particularly like the cookies with jams and preserves. The fruit is lightly sweetened so it not overly sugary so I think they&apos;re awesome!!! 

During COVID they&apos;re limiting the number of guests in the bakery at a time and they have plexiglass between the customers and staff. Masking is a must to enter! Appreciate their efforts to keep everyone safe! 

They also have other baked goods like cannoli and really pretty pastry tarts! They look delicious but I haven&apos;t tried them myself."
5,"I live 3000 miles away. Born and raised on the west coast. If given the chance, I would fly back to Philadelphia just for Isgro&apos;s cannolis. I have had the &quot;best&quot; in Boston &amp; NYC. They don&apos;t compare. Go to Isgro. The rest of the baked goods and the service are amazing as well. In these difficult times, we all need to support places like this. This is their second pandemic. They know what they are doing. Please support Isgro and help make sure they last at least another 117 years. Your great, great, grandkids will thank you."
5,"I do not take my baked goods lightly. As a self proclaimed icing connoisseur, I have to say the cannoli and cupcake were just delux. Obviously a bit pricy, but worth it for a weekend treat. We did have to wait outside as they are  only allowing four customers inside at a time. You can always order ahead and pick up to avoid the line!"
5,"Mmmmmm

Only warning: the grandma in there is old school, she&apos;ll tell you off. If you&apos;re like me and eager for that &quot;I&apos;m really home&quot; feel, it&apos;s an added bonus."
4,"Last week I had a cannoli from Termini. This week I decided to compare them to this legendary spot in the city. 

The Isgro cannoli is certainly nothing to sneeze at. It&apos;s pretty amazing. I devoured a chocolate chip one happily. 

To be fair, I personally like Termini just a tick better. But it&apos;s like a 1A and a 1B at this point. You&apos;re not going to go wrong. 

But where Isgro stands out is the cookies. These are truly special. I sampled a ricotta and a traditional Italian. This is where I believe Isgro has truly earned their reputation. I&apos;d drive in from Delco for these cookies anytime."
5,"My daughter got us a book of cookies and a babka. 
Now I have eaten a lot of cookies and baked a lot of amazing recipes in my life. 
I would compare these to Libby&apos;s in New Haven - Where I grew up. 
These were amaaaaaaaaazing. Not heavy but fresh - smothered with nuts or jam, marzipan filled - just an amazing variety of cookies. 
This is now my favorite bakery in the entire north east- get used to me coming here - and hopefully on line order since I drive in from Delaware."
5,"Ricotta cannoli is highly recommended, great crispy shells.
Everything here looks very enticing. The papal s&apos;more has a beautiful browning of the marshmallow."
4,"Delicious ! Went day before Valentine&apos;s Day and was able to order ahead. There was a line outside but moved quickly. We got a cake, crème brûlée cannolis and a Napoleon.  All delish and fairly priced for such a popular bakery."
4,"It is quite surprising that after living in Philadelphia for three years, running by this shop on a regular basis, it required a world-wide pandemic for me to shop at this well known gem after doors began to re-open. Truth be told, I&apos;ve always been partial towards Asian bakeries, with preferences for subtle sweet treats over extravagant desserts, but Isgro managed to convince me to reconsider.

Due to the regular interruptions from COVID, the store hours and entrance policies may change regularly, but as for mid-July, they allowed 4 people to come into the store without pre-ordering the treats online. The store staff are friendly, knowledgeable and clearly worked extra hard during the pandemic to ensure their daily supply of baked goodies. My favorite, of course, is the tiramisu cups, which had numerous layers of dense cream, soft wafers and topped off with a little espresso bean. We also tried the peach-shaped cake, the raspberry ganache, but I personally found them to be too singular in their flavor profile and too rich for my taste.

Overall, I think this is one of the must-visit sites if you like Italian pastries and worth the trip to the legendary South Street when you visit Philly! Wear a mask!"
5,"Delicious cake! Was surprised by my husband for my 30th birthday and it was definitely worth it. We moved out of south philly and I loved that I got a South Philly birthday cake. I don&apos;t know what the icing is but my daughter said that it tasted like there was a hint of cheese. Whatever it was, it was perfect"
3,"The 3 star is because of the amazing 2 young women working the counter-
Not the old nonna! She could smile and say HELLO, happy holidays-something! Not snarl 
Spent a small fortune on mini cakes, cookies and such-
All were stale
Al had to be tossed 
What a shame-
Obviously selling Christmas cakes and such that were made days before Christmas for full price...
The frosting was rancid in one
What a waste of a trip back to an old favorite"
5,"A 2020 habit has become slowly working my way through the pastries of Isgro ... a place I have biked by many a time, enjoying the waft of sugary bakery smell as I pass. But it took this year to become an acolyte of the cannoli, a patron of the pastry... The shop (at this time) allows a couple people inside at a time, and/or you can pre-order via the app (there&apos;s a first-time order discount code!)."
5,"I can&apos;t believe I&apos;m saying this but I had my very first experience at Isgro&apos;s yesterday. I&apos;m sure I&apos;ve had their pastries before as they&apos;re a Philly institution, but yesterday marked my first visit to the store for my own order. 

I placed an order by phone on Friday for a mini desserts tray that would serve 10-15 people for an event on Monday. I said I would stop by in the afternoon to pick it up, but I was out a bit earlier than expected, and got there around 1:30. The tray was nearly finished but the mini cannolis still needed to be stuffed. To me, this was a good sign because cannolis definitely have a shelf life. 

The tray was gorgeous and had really nice variety: cannoli, cream puffs, pumpkin cheesecake, coconut brownies, eclairs, and more. The mini sizes were great so you could try a couple at a time. My first pick was a cannoli and it was phenomenal. I&apos;m not typically a big cannoli person but Isgro&apos;s may have converted me - their shell was crispy crunchy and the filling had that light ricotta taste with enough sweetness to give it depth. The chocolate chips capping each side were just right. 

I will definitely think of Isgro&apos;s the next time I&apos;m having a party and need some sweets!"
5,"Wow delicious pastries and cookies. Ordered two different selections eclairs , single portion cheesecake, assortment of cookies. All were scrumptious. Thankful for the tip from hotel staff where we stayed for the night traveling thru area.

5,I googled best tiramisu in Philadelphia and decided to check Isgro Pastries out. Best place ever and I 100% plan on coming back to try all of the other pastries. The store was so cute inside and everything looked amazing. I bought the small tiramisu cake for $25 and it was absolutely delicious. My bf and I could not stop eating it. The cake itself is very light so it is very easy to get carried away. This place is seriously amazing and I highly recommend!
5,"Holy cow - these cannolis are amazing. I&apos;m not personally much of a cannoli person because I feel like sometimes the filling can be a little too thick or the shell is a little stale, but this was perfect. The classic cannoli had a light filling and the shell was crispy and delicious. I haven&apos;t found many great cannolis in the city - but this definitely makes the short list. The people are friendly too and it is a great place to walk by (they have a pretty cute storefront!)"
4,"​Isgro&apos;s is the kind of place that when you get home and realize that they accidentally gave you the wrong cookie, you love them anyway!

I used to live around the corner but moved away nearly 15 years ago. I got off the flight from Florida and drove straight there for a cannoli.

I spied the Pastachine and asked for four, I got down the block and realized the young​ lady had given me four Pignolia Cookies. And they were AMAZING.

The cannoli shell was crisp and crunchy​, the filling was smooth and creamy with just a touch of sweetness, and it was dusted with powdered sugar.

Everything I remembered and everything I craved."
5,"Update: 
Six years later I still drive all the way in from Media. Delaware County. 
Unfortunately for me I forget to check in when I&apos;m here but I&apos;ve probably been here 30 times in six years. It&apos;s always  a &quot;must stop in &quot; 
Whenever I&apos;m in this part of south Philly. And frankly when I have a craving for something great I just get in the car and drive to Isgros. 
Some Of my suburban friends are now doing the same thing.

They&apos;ve been in business over 100 years. Here&apos;s to 100 more!"
4,"I stopped at Isgro by chance as the other dessert shop I was going to  visit was closed for the week (vacation).  It was meant to be.  They&apos;ve been around for over 100 years so must be doing something right!

Cannolis was what I was looking for and they had a few varieties.  Ordered some of the chocolate dipped, pre made as well some with &quot;filling to order.&quot;  I asked what else must I order.  Answer:  Tiramisu.

Cannolis were some of the best I&apos;ve had and the Tiramisu was very good.  Many varieties of cakes, pastries &amp; cookies.  Parking is street so can be a bit tricky depending on when you visit.  I found a spot about a block away.  Overall, they had a Service mindset and were very helpful.   I will be back!"
5,"One of my favorite local bakeries! They are always reliable for yummy sweets and pastries. 

They always have a variety assortment of small pastries, cakes, and cookies. They also have the BEST cannoli!! 

I love a little something sweet with a cup of coffee after dinner and their cookies and biscotti always hit the spot. 

A few favorites are the Apple puffs, chocolate Italian, and raspberry filled butter cookies, but they are all delicious. I try something new every time! 

Their lobster tails, tarts, and cakes are always a hit!"
