5,"This review is actually the compilation of a couple different visits to K&apos;Far over the past few months. On my first visit, I was astounded by the Jerusalem bagel. I had mine with cheese, and it was perfect. Warm and crisp on the outside, gooey cheese inside. I also had the Yemenite latte, which was maybe the best latte I&apos;ve ever had. With a wonderful blend of spices and espresso, it&apos;s like the love child of chai and a latte. On my second visit, I ordered a 3 pack of borekas to go, and enjoyed them in the park. I loved all of them, but especially the potato one.
Overall, this place is great. I like that you can place orders for future pick up. Makes it super easy!"
5,"To be honest, I had avoided K&apos;Far because I&apos;d heard about long lines and I am not about the line life. One weekday morning I was out for an early walk with my husband and we ended up in K&apos;Far&apos;s vicinity, so decided to pop over. There were only a few people waiting for orders so the timing worked out perfectly! 

We ordered two egg and cheese Jerusalem bagel sandwiches, a hot coffee and a tehina chocolate chip cookie. My only wish was that I had the foresight to order more sweets to-go. The egg sandwiches were perfect! The bread was absolutely incredible, and the egg to cheese ratio was just right. The chocolate chip cookie that we shared at home later was delicious. 

The good news is you can also place pick-up orders online which will soften the blow if there are any major lines happening. I&apos;ll be scheming my next visit for sure!"
5,Great outdoor covered seating with a heater- hard to find during these covid times. You can&apos;t go wrong with any menu items here although I am particularly fond of the pistachio sticky bun!
5,"Loved the smoke salmon bagel sandwich and the puff pastries! The baklava is a bit too sweet for me, but does have good texture

I will definitely come here again the next time I am in Philly."
4,"I&apos;ve only gotten take-out from K&apos;far post-covid, so I fear that most of these comments may not be applicable to those who can dine nearby or with heaters. 

I was able to pre-order a few bagels, sandwiches, and salad online, knowing how quickly they sell out. I showed up on time and picked up the order without issues, although, as you can imagine, most of the food was cold after a 20min commute. However, my family loved the flattened bagel sandwiches, the smoked salmon was a bit on the extra salty side, but the puff pastries were on point! I did not try out the sticky buns, but heard great things.

As far as bagels go, K&apos;far is a bit expensive, but if you&apos;re a bagel enthusiast, K&apos;far is worthwhile place to visit if you have time and a little extra cash to spend for brunch."
4,"Fantastic cafe with a Mediterranean flair. I&apos;ve tried and enjoyed the grilled cheese Jerusalem bagel, borekas (mushroom with cheese and walnuts, potato, and feta), and tahini chocolate chip cookie. I especially liked the grilled cheese - the sesame seeds on the bagel and roasted tomato in the sandwich offer unique touches on a classic dish.

While the cafe menu options are a bit limited (perhaps due to COVID-19), I recommend coming to try the flavorful selection (especially the grilled cheese Jerusalem bagel)."
4,"I&apos;ve always heard amazing things about K&apos;Far, so I finally succumbed to the hype and came. We got the smoked salmon Jerusalem bagel, 3 set of pastries, and a sticky pistachio bun. I really like their puff pastry, super flaky and a million layers! The bagel was good, I want to try the other flavors next time. The sticky bun was a very cakey texture (as opposed to chewy) and super sweet, so I&apos;d recommend splitting it and not only ordering that!"
5,This place is outstanding and must try. After eating at Zahav this place was high on my list since they are the same owners. The Jerusalem Bagel Sandwiches are possibly the best sandwiches I&apos;ve ever had. They are pressed down so that they are crispy and light. The sticky buns are a perfect treat with the savory sandwiches. Everything I have had here is a home run. They are now on caviar too so that is also convenient. I am starting to crave this every Sunday and it takes everything I have in me not to order it.
5,Eeeeeeek where do I begin. Their salmon Jerusalem bagel sandwich.  OMG TRY IT please. Their coffee and desserts are incredible. Went on a dinner date here too and it naturally was perfect
4,"I&apos;d travel near and FAR for this place. This cute little cafe attracts quite the crowd on the weekends (so be prepared for a wait or order ahead!) The inside is very vibey, but is currently closed due to COVID. However they have a few outdoor seats! I got a chocolate babka and the Yemenite latte. Both were quite delicious, but wouldn&apos;t get the latte again. Overall this place was K!"
5,"When the man (Michael Solomonov) can make Zahav become the number one restaurant in all of America with his mind blowing traditional Israeli cuisine. Mr. Solomonov is also hitting you with those donuts. Yes, I said donuts that everybody loves, that has an unbelievably flavorful rush hitting your taste buds. Always warm, always fresh from the oven amazing donuts, with that double fried chicken known as Federal Donuts. That is the perfect combination, a one, two punch to the taste buds if you ask me. So with that impressive resume (partial, there is more to him) we surely can expect K&apos;Far to be nothing short of spectacular.  

Alright my Yelp family I guess you would like a little more information than a &quot;Just go in there, he knows what he is doing&quot;, so  let us dive into this review as I scream Mazel Tov! 

What to get if you are wondering? How about ALL OF IT! There is no wrong decision by the way, plus this will give you another reason why you should return. I know I plan on making frequent trips to K&apos;Far. 

- Jerusalem Bagel ~ I went with the egg and cheese , and this was simply on point my friends. This bagel panini style has so much flavor to it with the herbs and spices all baked into it.This is a must, I could&apos;ve devoured three more of these if it wasn&apos;t for my family wanting and waiting to experience what I was. Yes, there is no shame to my game.

- Brown Sugar Kubaneh Toast ~ Words can not describe the amounts of pleasure I was experiencing with this. This had a ricotta spread over top, a blueberry type of compote drizzled all over it, with a fig sitting on top. Simply delightful. 

Now when you enter K&apos;Far, if that heavenly aroma isn&apos;t making you go crazy, their enticing desserts display will. This is where you separate the fools from the diabetics. 

- Pistachio Sticky Bun ~ The Pistachio Sticky Bun is the ruler, the godfather to them all. I&apos;ll kneel down now and kiss the ring. Just prepare yourself for an euphoric bliss once you&apos;ve bitten into this sticky decadent sensation. 

Mr. Solomonov, you must have the blueprint to winning, because you did it again my friend. In all I will clearly be returning to experience more from K&apos;Far and their delights. I highly recommend this amazing establishment, where everything is a must order.

I am Nando, and I approve this message."
5,"Cheese bagel sandwich at K&apos;Far. &apos;Nuff said. This place is the bomb. Michael Solomonov does not disappoint. I wish I could eat here everyday, only my arteries might mind all the fat. They have bagels like no other. I&apos;m usually not a bagel fan but Jewish bagels are amazing. Makes me want to travel to Israel once the pandemic ends. 
K&apos;Far is taking very good covid precautions, including limiting the number of people who order as a walk in. I ordered the cheese bagel sandwich and the egg and cheese sandwich. Both were amazing but the plain cheese one was my favorite. I also got a dessert box to go which honestly is just too good. You can order online and select the time when you will be picking up your order so they keep everything hot and fresh. Definitely go there. You won&apos;t be disappointed."
5,"I cannot believe that I have not written a review of K&apos;Far yet! It is one of my go-to spots and I love so many things that they have to offer.

Pre-COVID, K&apos;Far was a spot where I always had to mentally prepare myself to wait in the (relatively fast moving) line to get my goodies and then do some good old-fashioned hovering to get a seat in their trendy, yet first-come-first-served seating area. As much as this was a bit of a hassle, this never deterred me from bringing my out-of-town guests here for some delicious pastries and breakfast sandwiches.

During COVID, I have continued to enjoy K&apos;Far. Over the summer, they had some great outdoor seating (shaded, which was great during the heat). Nowadays, I prefer to order ahead and pick it up to go. However, if you forget to order ahead of time, you can always go and place your order in person. While I&apos;m waiting the 15-20 minutes for my meal to be ready, I always pop into into target to run a quick errand.

Regarding food - their pastries are super, super sweet. Their pistachio bun is a little too sweet for my taste by itself, but when I pair it with their strong coffee, it is a hit. If you&apos;re going to order their Brown Sugar Ricotta Kubaneh toast, you should also get your sweet tooth ready. I personally prefer their savory items - their Jerusalem bagel is melt-in-your-mouth delicious and crispy. Their borekas are worth a try too (my favorite is the potato)."
3,"Pretty disappointed by the service and quality. Ordered food a day in advance online, and was able to choose a pickup time - understandably, things are hard during COVID, but my order wasn&apos;t ready until 40 minutes after the scheduled pickup time. The line to pickup/order was a mess as well. 

It wouldn&apos;t have been a big deal if the food was good, but sadly it was not. The egg and cheese bagel sandwich was very greasy. The fig toast was better, but still not worth the $7. Hoped to make this a new breakfast spot, but this is my first and last time eating here."
5,"This cafe is my favorite brunch spot, and I always look forward to the weekends when I can get my favorite Grilled Cheese Jerusalem Bagel. I&apos;m not sure if it&apos;s the crispy bagel or the delicious melted cheese, but this grilled cheese is the best I&apos;ve ever had! For a sweeter end to brunch, I absolutely love the Brown Sugar Ricotta Kubaneh Toast. I&apos;ve also tried the Mushroom Kubaneh Toast and Tunisian Salad, and you really can&apos;t go wrong here. For drinks, their Guava Island is extremely refreshing! Their coffees are said to be great as well by my fellow coffee drinkers. 

I would definitely recommend placing orders online ahead of time, to make sure that no items are sold out before your visit. Definitely allot some extra time for pick-up, since I always had to wait an extra 15-20 minutes after arriving at my designated pick-up time. 

Best of all, the cafe is located right by Rittenhouse Square, which is the perfect spot to picnic with a K&apos;Far brunch!"
2,"Mediocre food and ambience. 

It looks better in the pictures but nothing special about it."
4,"I went there for breakfast with a friend at 8 am. Im glad they still have early morning hours during the pandemic. I love their savory pastries, and avocado toast. The persimmons were a nice touch and really added some unique flavors. I enjoyed the Babka, however the pistachio bun was my absolute favorite, it almost tasted like a kouign amann covered with glazed sugar with pistachio toppings and layers. I will definitely be back here to try another toast and get a pastry! It&apos;s also very close to rittenhouse square park, picking up a pastry here and then sitting on a bench in rittenhouse to people/dog watch can definitely become a routine of mine."
4,"Recently I tried some of the K&apos;far weekend pickup items and was not disappointed. I recommend ordering ahead of time as early as possible for a couple reasons: 1) their popular items can sell out (as with the egg and cheese bagel for us) and 2) it takes them a while to make the order.

Friends and I shared a grilled cheese Jerusalem bagel and the Boreka Bundle, which consists of a Bulgarian feta, a potato, and a Swiss chard pastry. 

The grilled cheese bagel was so simple yet packed a powerful punch. I liked the tartness of the Kashkaval cheese, the herbiness of za&apos;atar, and the freshness of the tomato. The bagel itself was the standout, with a crispy shell of sesame seeds. Really lovely combination overall. It&apos;s pretty expensive for such a petite bagel sandwich though.

Out of the three savory pastries, I liked the feta one the most. It was probably the simplest but tasted the freshest in my opinion. The potato one had a curry-like seasoning. It reminded me of potato salad, and I mean that in a good way! I think it would taste better warmed up though. The Swiss chard pastry may have been my second favorite. Again it was simply executed but I liked how refreshing it was on a hot summer day. 

Hopefully I can come back someday when they&apos;re open for indoor dining (so I can enjoy that beautiful interior), but otherwise I was satisfied with my takeout breakfast."
5,"I rarely do this but the egg and cheese Jerusalem bagel is so good, that that alone earns K&apos;Far a 5 star review. This is despite being underwhelmed by the Harira Soup - flavorful but essentially spoonfuls of chickpeas versus tomato soup.

Just a really effective execution of simplicity with an edge. Crisp bagel, a kempt egg with melted cheese and a knockout spread. Nice change up from the average breakfast sandwich."
5,"Ok K&apos;far is Philly&apos;s newest hot spot from
The creators of zahav. This place has the ambience of an upscale Mediterranean wine bar, with the laid-back vibe of Philly!! 


The appetizers and breads alone were remarkable. The main entrées were a little underwhelming for those who might not be a fan of vegetable stews but overall a five out of five experience. I keep Zabihah / halal so defaulted to all the pescatarian options and they didn&apos;t disappoint. 

They do tend to have a wait list on the weekends so highly recommend reservations!!

Great for date night or girls night, coffee, lunch or dinner. Jerusalem bagels and moussaka on point and the service was very attentive and immaculate"
