5,"Ever since Jason Segel held up the sold out sign for this place, I&apos;ve been wanting to try it and finally got the chance to a few weeks ago. We ordered delivery and it DID NOT DISAPPOINT. Everything we had was super good and really satisfied my long standing bbq craving. Obviously we didn&apos;t dine in but the service was awesome with just the delivery. They gave us 3 large containers of their sauces (vinegar, sweet heat, and another one) and I loved all of them and I&apos;m typically not a vinegar person.

Half rack of ribs - talk about fall of the bone soft. Perfectly seasoned and tender. I loved dipping every piece into all of the sauces. A must get!

Brisket - Also very soft and tender and well cooked. I think I just prefer ribs over brisket generally but this was just as delicious

Gritty cheesesteak - Loved the sauce drizzled on top and the little crispy fry chips gave it a good crunchy texture

Gouda mac and cheese - MUST ORDER.

Collard greens - was a tad too salty for me given the rest of the meal was pretty heavy as is. This would be the only item I probably wouldn&apos;t order again

This was also a TON of food and we were able to make 2 meals out of it between 2 people. We will certainly be putting this into our regular takeout/dining rotations."
5,"I used to think there wasn&apos;t any great BBQ in Philly, but I&apos;ve been proven wrong. The original reason I found Mike&apos;s is because I heard about their interesting take on a cheesesteak. It has smoked brisket and homemade cheese whiz. It&apos;s phenomenal! Definitely recommend getting it your first time there.

Another must-have item is their crispy pork belly. It&apos;s earth-shatteringly crisp, fatty, juicy and delicious. If you like some nice fatty pork, you&apos;ll love it. That and the brisket are my two favorite proteins, but we always need to get the Gouda mac and cheese and cornbread too. When you&apos;re able to dine-in, they have free beers while you wait for your order. Right now, they do pickup and delivery, but plan ahead because they do sell out!"
5,"Oh YUM!  Visited daughter as she suggested takeout for late lunch/early dinner.  Maybe she thinks we eat dinner at 3pm... regardless we ordered brisket sandwiches, Mac n cheese, wings, coleslaw and the banana pudding.    Bit of mixup in order pick up, but made the food that much more delicious!   Suggest sharing the sandwich- it was a lot of food and despite the cold and our appetite we could barely get through a half.  Brisket was delicious, and with the added toppings, great combo of bread, meat and crispy onions.  Coleslaw was spicy- Mac n Cheese a meal unto itself- more like a Gouda than chedder taste and very rich.   Had one bite of the banana pudding- could tell that dear daughter wanted it  for a midnight snack.  We will be back!"
4,"This was a good bbq meal. I ordered brisket and wings.

The brisket was fatty and well executed (soft on the bite and smoky). Not the absolute best I&apos;ve ever had, but in the top 3rd of briskets.

The wings were very flavorful and smoke, but I found the interior to be not quite juicy enough and the wing size to be slightly on the scrawny side."
5,"I always on the lookout of their specials on Instagram. The smoked brisket pizza cheesesteak looked awesome. Along with $5 off from Grubhub and my friend&apos;s Instagram post and review , I decided to order. It was sooo delicious. The tender brisket is on the bottom, topped with fried mozzarella, and finally the pizza sauce with shredded parmesan on top. The mozzarella melts as you bite it, perfect combination of sweetness from the pizza sauce and the savory of the brisket. It comes with fresh abd crispy potato chips. Definitely get it when it is available"
5,"Ok it&apos;s official, I&apos;m a major fan of Mike&apos;s BBQ. came here months ago for the chicken special and absolutely loved it. Most recently came to try the brisket cheesesteak and was just as impressed! They really have awesome food at Mike&apos;s!"
5,"I came across Mike&apos;s BBQ randomly 1 night so I decided to try it.
I went with the Gritty sandwich and it was fantastic. One of the best sandwiches I&apos;ve had in a long time. The brisket was nice and juicy, it came with lettuce tomato, potato sticks, onions, gritty sauce and like a bbq seasoning on top. It seems so random to put this all together but it was great. The Gritty sauce was like a spicy mustard in a way which was great. The potato sticks were alright, they kept falling out of the sandwich unfortunately. 
It also came with chips, they were delicious.
I also tried the banana pudding, it was really good. Very caramel based.
Overall great meal. Will definitely be back to try the BBQ"
5,"The food was AMAZING. I really appreciate that the brisket cheese steak had cheese on the bread, then the brisket was laid, and then more cheese on top. The layering was perfect. The ribs fell right off the bone, as it should. Will definitely be ordering from here again. You won&apos;t regret it!"
4,"I read all the reviews and drove an hour round trip bc what else am I going to do with corona.

Any legit chef will tell you they check the bathroom when dining at new places bc they know if the bathroom is clean then all the other details in the kitchen are given proper attention if the least popular spot gets attention.

That&apos;s how I feel about sides at a BBQ place. Mike&apos;s has amazing size. I got all that was available and I endorse all of them. Cole slaw was not from a big deli carton but made with love and mustard base. The potato salad is the cold version in case you were wondering and the kind I like. Beans are some of the best I ever had and carefully mixed with some meat. Greens were legit and I&apos;m an expert on greens.

Bbq - just get the ribs. To be honest they were great but I think comparable to the mission BBQ chain on their best day which has only been like once out of 8 visits.

Brisket was great but it&apos;s the moist kind as they say in tx aka fatty vs lean but I prefer moist

Pulled pork was tad dry and not much flavor unless you dump sauce.

ORDER online bc corona and they only do weekends at the moment but online orders start at 8

Staff was AMAZING. Also they may not call you to pick up as much as 10 mins over so don&apos;t freak out if not exactly on time."
5,"Finally tried Mike&apos;s BBQ over the weekend and we loved it! We got a lb of brisket, half a rack of ribs, a pulled pork sandwich, and corn bread, pickles and mac &amp; cheese for our sides. Everything was so fresh and so delicious. 

I have to say the ribs were my favorite. Perfectly smoked, moist and peppery. The brisket was good too. Very fatty and completely melts in your mouth. After eating the delicious ribs and brisket, the pulled pork sandwich tasted okay to me. It&apos;s got nice smoky, sweet and spicy flavors; but just hard to stand out next to the ribs and brisket. 

The pulled pork sandwich also came with a side of house-made kettle cooked potato chips and a teeny side of coleslaw that I loved. Kinda made me wish I got a large side of coleslaw with our order. The corn bread was cake-y and slightly sweet, it was so yummy I devoured the whole thing and I don&apos;t normally care for cornbread. The smoked gouda mac &amp; cheese was rich, creamy, and so comforting to eat.

The sauces didn&apos;t do much for me, I thought the flavors of the dry rub and the smokiness were delicious enough on its own."
5,Well worth the 40+ minute trip from Central Jersey for this bbq.  Smoked chicken is excellent and brisket cheesesteak is a revelation.   They aren&apos;t Best of Philly for nuthin&apos;!  Best part - owned by a genuine Good Guy who consistently gives back to the community.
5,Got the brisket. Didn&apos;t know good bbq like this existed in Philly til someone from Maryland suggested Mike&apos;s. It was delish. I added black pepper to the Mac and cheese (because yes Mac and cheese still need seasoning too) and it was good. Wish they were open more days but it&apos;s okay since the prices have me only ordering to treat myself. It&apos;s quality bbq though so I understand.
4,"Got here at 12:20pm on a Saturday and it was already a full house. We ended up ordering our food as take-out. Waited about 15 minutes for the food which isn&apos;t bad being how busy it was. 
We got a 1/2 rack of ribs, brisket, pork belly, and mac and cheese.  
The ribs came right off the bones. Decent flavor but nothing out of the ordinary from BBQ ribs. 
The brisket is definitely something I would go back for. It was moist and so soft that it just melted away in my mouth. 
We loved the extremely crunchy skin on the pork belly. The meat on the pork belly didn&apos;t have much of a flavor, but the skin was the star of the dish. 
LOVED the gouda Mac and cheese. It was super thick and cheesy."
5,"Everybody I spoke with was incredibly nice and understanding. I was with my 5 year old so I was distracted and probably not an ideal customer. They went out of there way to be helpful and courteous. I would have wrote a good review on that alone but then I tried the food and it blew me away. Their Mac and cheese was like my dream woman; thick, rich and probably bad for my heart. The brisket sandwich was amazing and then got even better with the slaw and sauce they provided on the side. If I am ever back down that way I will be stopping there again. I would give more than 5 stars if possible. Thank you for being the best part of my day"
5,"I&apos;ve had a lot of brisket in my life, and this is something special! The brisket cheesesteak was LOADED with brisket and cheese &amp; onions. Perfectly cooked and not dry at all. This is my new go-to bbq AND brisket place in Philadelphia! Can&apos;t wait to try more items on the menu."
5,"So I&apos;ve been stalking this BBQ spot on IG for months and even checked their hours to make sure I didn&apos;t miss out on an opportunity to try this place when visiting Philly since they are often sold out. 

We got 1/2 Rack Ribs, 1 lb Brisket, Bacon Wrapped Burnt Ends, Gouda Mac N Cheese, and Carolina Slaw for 2 people for about $77 including tip.

In order of deliciousness:
Brisket - juicy, fatty, tender, eye rolling and mouth drooling good.
Carolina Slaw - tangy, crunchy and just yum.
1/2 Rack Ribs - falls off the bones but definitely needed bbq sauce to accompany it.
Gouda mac N Cheese - I liked the gouda spin on basic mac n cheese which is creamy, nutty and salty.
Bacon Wrapped Burnt Ends - 3 pieces to an order, much too dry, we didn&apos;t eat it.

We went on a Sat at 11:45 am and there was a small line of people outside.  After sitting down and getting our food, the line inside certainly got much longer."
4,"Hole in wall deep in South Philly. With that being said, it is probably the best BBQ you&apos;ll find in Philly. They&apos;re also very hospitable here: grab a complimentary High Life to wash down the &apos;que. My girlfriend and I ordered a ton of food and left stuffed. 

The brisket was incredibly tender and I wish we had ordered more. The ribs were okay but to me could have had more flavor. I guess that&apos;s why you load up on homemade sauces. I think the smoked wings were my favorite: that dry rub is peppery and savory and oh so good. One pound consists of 10 whole wings, i.e. drums and flats connected. I would for sure recommend the pickles as a side because the acidity helps cut through the endless flow of meat. The cornbread was moist and not too sweet, which also added a much needed additional layer of flavor to our meal. 

The only bad part about of meal was that the staff completely forgot part of our order. They brought out everything else we ordered and our waitress said the last item, the fried brussel sprouts, would be out soon. Almost half an hour later, my girlfriend goes up to counter to ask about our food only to have half the kitchen ask each other about it and realize no one ever put them in the fryer....

If I&apos;m ever in the neighborhood, I guess I&apos;d probably stop back for more brisket and wings. Be sure to get here early though, they tend to start selling out of items within a couple hours of opening."
4,"Vegetarian Review: Mike&apos;s is NOT to be missed by us non-carnivores! While Mike&apos;s is obviously known for the heaping mounds of bbq meats, served appropriately on those silver platters, their sides are soooo bangin&apos;!!

The Gouda Mac &amp; cheese is to die for. It has a slight smokey taste and is ultra creamy!! You will not regret getting a large tub of this to-go, because I guarantee you&apos;ll be craving this again later on! I actually plan on stopping in and grabbing some cartons for a side dish for Thanksgiving! I think my guests are going to flip!!

The cornbread is definitely one of the most delicious ever! It&apos;s a huge square for $3 and it can surely be split. It&apos;s super buttery and crisp around the edges with a hot soft middle. YUM!!! Although we took out, it still held it&apos;s own and didn&apos;t get soggy at all! 

Their homemade sauce selection is unreal! It&apos;s honestly really hard to choose a favorite, although their traditional comes close. Perfectly tangy, thick and smoked! Wow! They encourage lots of sampling and I say go for it, because it&apos;s so much fun! They even have little sauce containers for takeout! 

Hanks root beer In a bottle completed our veg-tastic takeout meal, although they are BYO and we plan on bringing back the whole fam for what we can imagine will be a fun, casual great night out! 

The place is small but homey and when I called ahead to see the wait, the guys couldn&apos;t have been nicer on the phone and then so sweet remembering me again when I arrived! It&apos;s such a South Philly style spot! And what else would you expect from Mike, who also owns Taproom on 19th on Ritner. 

I would give a 5 star for these few items but I&apos;m not sure that&apos;s fair since I didn&apos;t taste the meat. I dunno. But definitely don&apos;t skip the sauce bar and sides! For me, worthy of a stop alone. 

*easy unmetered street parking and no wait 2pm on a Sat!"
4,"Right in the heart of South Philly is the very popular Mike&apos;s BBQ.  This establishment replaced a favorite barbacoa spot that moved up to the Italian Market hood. Mike&apos;s has received great reviews from Yelp and professional food critics and in general I concur but just not to the same degree.  I stopped in recently to try their &apos;Gritty&apos; cheesesteak.  Of course using the descriptor &apos;Gritty&apos; every Philadelphian will know right away that the sauce has to be orange and there will be an orange theme to this sandwich.  It was made with brisket as well as onions, lettuce, tomatoes, and potato sticks ... and was very good but I expected just a little bit more meat.  After all, this is a Philly sandwich! A little more meat would have let the brisket shine more and to be honest that&apos;s what I expected from a bbq spot. 

btw - Mike&apos;s has a few condiments you can add to your order for free including homemade sweet and spicy bbq sauces."
4,"Best Philly Cheesesteak in the city! Now I know, if you&apos;re a purist, then a brisket cheesesteak doesn&apos;t count. Well, I don&apos;t care. This cheesesteak is amazing!!! I had the brisket cheesesteak, Gouda Mac and cheese, pickles, chips, coleslaw, and collard greens.

Here is the problem, the sides aren&apos;t good, the Cheesesteak is singlehandedly bringing up this review. The Gouda Mac and cheese was pasty and overpowering. It&apos;s settled, Gouda should not be in mac. The greens were sour, the chips were somehow bland, and the coleslaw was nothing to write home about. 

Overall:
Brisket Cheesesteak 5/5
Sides 2/5"
