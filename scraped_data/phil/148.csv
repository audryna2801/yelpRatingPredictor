4,"Food is great, just note it&apos;s a bit expensive for what you get. 

LOVE the ceviche, margaritas, enchiladas and salsa. Highly recommend... but if you are balling on a budget, you can get good Mexican in other areas of Philly at a better price!"
3,"The staff and decor were top notch! Very attentive and friendly. The bartenders were great too. 

The food on the other hand was less than I expected for the price. You can easily tell that the food was not made to order, but was previously frozen as the food was lukewarm when received. Disappointed for sure."
2,"Tequilas used to be a favorite of ours. It&apos;s where my boyfriend and I had our first dinner date. We were so excited to return here for dinner for indoor dining to celebrate my promotion. Unfortunately it missed the mark tonight. Many items from the original menu were either discontinued or not available - if related to Covid-19 that&apos;s fine. But overall the service was not the same, and the chicken mole poblano dish was almost not worth eating due to lack of flavor. The ceviche appetizer was small and made with hardly any fish at all. We left feeling slightly hungry, unfulfilled and just off, after spending over $100. 

The one saving grace was my margarita - it was extremely delicious (Tequilas margarita). 

We won&apos;t be returning here for a while unfortunately."
5,Came here after being recommended by a bartender at a speak easy. The craft mezcal cocktails were top notch! The crab guacamole was a nice touch!
5,"A consistently delicious favorite of mine. I LOVE a good taco, so trust me when I say I have tried a ton of Mexican restaurants throughout Philly. Nothing compares the the chicken molcajete Tequilas serves. I crave it weekly. The margaritas are absolutely incredible, and the guacamole deserves an honorable mention as well. Over the last 3 years, I have shared amazing conversations with many of the staff, and each of them is so lovely and kind. This restaurant holds a special place in my heart and I would thoroughly recommended it to anyone looking for delicious and authentic Mexican food, incredible margaritas, and a beautiful ambiance."
3,"Came here for NYE dinner and I&apos;m glad we made reservations because it was pretty packed. We were seated in a move private back area which i was grateful for because the bar area was &quot;turnt up&quot; 

Our waitress was super nice and took our orders as soon as we were seated. I got a mango Mojito which was good and we ordered the crab mango guacamole (it was tasty but wish it had more of a kick) they should probably add some jalapeños.

For my entree i went with the carne asada a la tampiquena option. The steak was nice and lean but wish it had a tad more flavor. I didn&apos;t enjoy the tamal or the chicken taquito but the rectors brand, guacamole and rice were good. 

Overall food was good but more so appreciated the drinks and ambiance."
5,"I&apos;ve been to Tequilas twice now and both times have had a great experience from start to finish. The staff are so friendly and funny and they really interact with you. We were most recently here for a bachelorette party and that did not go unnoticed. They even brought the bride a free shot and sang her a song. Great service all around. 

The margaritas here are THE BEST. So fresh and perfectly sweet. Get the large pitcher and they just keep flowing. The food is delicious too. They bring complementary chips and homemade salsa. We ordered a couple of things to share - queso fundido, shrimp civiche, enchiladas playa, Chile rellenos, and molcajete de pollo. Everything was delicious and I would definitely get it all again. Fresh ingredients, great seasoning, super flavorful."
5,"Came here for restaurant week years ago and had such a great time! So when my cousins and I wanted to arrange for dinner, I had to recommend this place. It didn&apos;t disappoint this year either! 

Majority of the cousins got there on time but we had 2 that were late. I talked to the host and he said he had to wait for the full party to arrive before they seat us and we would lose the reservation if they didn&apos;t show up in the 15 minute window which it course they didn&apos;t. Luckily the host told me to find him when they arrive and the max wait would be 30 minutes. Once my cousins finally arrived, it didn&apos;t take more than 5 minutes to be seated! The host even made jokes about them paying for all of us haha 

The restaurant week menu was full of options and we decided to order as many items as possible to sample the menu. We also got complimentary chips and 2 salsas which I definitely over ate cause they were so good! 

We ordered all the appetizers: ceviche, empanadas, and tortilla soup. The ceviche was SO fresh and tasty as well as the empanadas. I personally thought the soup was bland but some other cousins liked it. For the entrees, we got the chochinita pibil (pulled pork), mar y tierra (surf and turf), enchiladas playa, and the chiles rellenos (poblano peppers). The mar y tierra was amazing and I really regret not getting that! The pulled pork was really good as well and we were given tortillas along with it. The poblano peppers are listed as vegetarian but they gave my cousin one vegetarian and the other was pork or beef. 

My favorite part of the meal was the dessert! The tres leches cake is engrained in my taste buds and it tasted exactly the same years later. The chocolate mousse was good as well but too soft in consistency. I thought the flan was okay and would recommend the other 2 options."
5,"Totally blown away.

I live in South Philly, and have always been partial to the cheap, no-frills Mexican restaurants sprinkled throughout the Italian Market: Veracruzana, El Jarocho, La Prima, El Rodeo. In my brain, &quot;upscale&quot; Mexican usually veers into white-people-making-Mexican-food territory: bland and overpriced (cough, El Vez; cough, Distrito.) Tequilas misses that trap entirely. Don&apos;t let its location just off of Rittenhouse fool you: Tequilas is authentic, cozy, insanely flavorful, welcoming, and situated in an absolutely breathtaking old building on Spruce. I think I&apos;ve found my new favorite restaurant in Philly. 

(Sidebar: I have to thank my favorite Yelper, Warren W., for his glowing review of this place! If I hadn&apos;t read his fantastic take, I might&apos;ve never given Tequilas a chance.)

First things first: tequila. 

There are nearly 10 menu pages of specialty tequilas to taste. From the Mexican highlands to the lowlands; from the blancos to the añejos... the sheer variety of tequilas offered is worth the visit alone. If that sounds overwhelming, don&apos;t worry: each option is accompanied by a short description outlining its flavor notes and production intricacies, and our bartender was helpful in guiding us towards our selections. My favorite was the Cascahuin Extra Añejo. A new arrival, it was amber brown with notes of caramel, honey, oak, and pepper. Warming. Delicious. 

Onto the food. I went with the tuna ceviche, and my boyfriend opted for the steak. The ceviche was delicate and beautiful: the sushi-grade tuna was plump, fresh, and coated in a refreshing citrus dressing. My boyfriend&apos;s steak was out of this world. A juicy ribeye, perfectly tender and cooked to a medium rare, seasoned deliberately, and absolutely bursting with flavor. After my first bite, I felt ashamed that I&apos;d ever spent more than $50 on a single steak at nearby steakhouses. The chicken enchilada that came with it - intended to be an accoutrement - could have stood alone as its own dish. Just, wow. 

The complimentary chips and salsa is always a nice touch as well :-) 

Since the night was rather unplanned and my boo and I came here on a whim, we left in total shock at just how lucky we struck it. I can&apos;t wait to get back."
5,"It&apos;s delicious food, entertaining and friendly service and a great atmosphere. What more could you ask for? We loved our meal here. We ordered ten different drinks (two per person) and each one was flavorful and well-balanced. Our food was no less impressive. Although the portions weren&apos;t huge, we were all full by the end. 

We will definitely be returning any night we need upscale Mexican food."
4,"We came here for happy hour and it was a nice experience. The bar was slammed, but the waiter allowed us to sit at a table (if we were getting food), so that worked out. 

We started out with a margarita and a beer. Margarita was a tad on the sweet side, the beer was... well it was beer. 

For food we got the vegetarian empanadas which were nice and filling. The happy hour version had 4 pieces, and was mushroom filled. It was presented very nicely. 

We also got the chips and guacamole which was good! 

We would come back for sure as the ambiance, the service, and the food was worth it."
5,"We had a group of 10 on NYE at Tequilas. I feel like larger parties on busy nights often don&apos;t end well but Tequilas was amazing! Our waiter was friendly, funny and attentive. Drinks came fast and we&apos;re all delicious. Food came quickly as well and we weren&apos;t disappointed! The restaurant was decorated festively and it made for a great experience. Really loved it!"
5,"I usually go to tequilas for the excellent happy hour, and by excellent I mean it. The drink specials are great and there area ton of great apps available (recommend the homemade guac). But I have only had dinner here a few times. I&apos;m actually writing this review because my husband and I had dinner there last night and it was amazing and it reminded me to make sure I put in a review. 

We made a last minute reservation and the restaurant was pretty booked but they got us a table. We started with the homemade guacamole (again delicious and comes with amazing pico and spicy salsa). Then my husband had a spicy grilled chicken dish served in a lava plate (see the photo below) it was spicy and delicious and honestly  I had forgotten how amazing the food was until I had it. Highly recommend (the name of the dish was Molcajete De Pollo) I ordered the chicken tortilla soup - it was standard and honestly after tasting the entree my husband got I wish I had ordered more food. 

For dessert we had the chocolate mousse cake. It was also great. 

Also solid plus if you enjoy mezcal they have a great menu of them and highly recommend."
5,"I love Tequilas (and tequila)! I&apos;m a firm believer that high end Mexican restaurants are never as good (or worth the prices) as your local $2 taco spot but Tequilas is the exception. This is so far my favorite upscale Mexican spot in the city. 

Ambiance and Service:
Tequilas is surprisingly spacious and has multiple dining tables and a full bar. A reservation is still recommended though. It has a nice ambiance with unique decor and the space is dimly lit. 

Service is top notch. Our waiter was fast, attentive and polite. One of the best service I&apos;ve had in the city.

Food and Drinks:
The menu has plenty of options and offers some unique dishes.

They get extra bonus points for offering complimentary chips and salsa considering many upscale Mexican restaurants would charge extra. The chips are just how I like them, thick and crunchy! The chips also come with a generous amount of pico (which was very good) and a spicy sauce. 

For the entree, I ordered the Carne Asada a la Tampiquena. It was delightful and the portion size was more than enough. Their website says, &quot;artwork you can taste&quot; and that&apos;s exactly it. I almost felt bad for eating it because the presentation was so nice. 

Saving the best for last, the margaritas! Best margaritas I&apos;ve had in the city. I prefer flavored margaritas so I was pleased that they had my two favorite flavors, mango and strawberry. Both were delicious but I&apos;d recommend the strawberry margarita over the mango."
4,"This place was amazing. My childhood friends and I gather once every year after Christmas to catch up since all of us live in different states. Once you enter the restaurant you feel an ambiance of classiness and culture all in one. The restaurant decor and different sections are beautifully detailed. We first stopped at the bar to wait for the rest of our party. 

In the picture, you&apos;ll see Roses Margaritas which are strong and absolutely delicious! We were able to munch on some perfectly mixed/seasoned guacamole with the crispy golden chips. 

We then transferred to our reserved table in the back of the restaurant once all of our party arrived. The servers were very friendly, personable, and professional. 

Since there was 7 of us in our party, I thought our entrees came out in a timely manner. We were busy catching up, sipping on our drinks, and munching on the complimentary chips and salsa, so the wait time did not seem long at all. 

The food was delicious and we even had space in our tummies to share one of each of the desserts from the menu amongst the entire table. I&apos;m very happy we did this as we were able to taste test the sweet treats. My personal favorite is the tres leches cake! 

The items seemed just a tiny bit pricey for me, but aside from that, the experience was amazing. I definitely recommend for the food and as an ambiance for intimate dinner events."
4,"We came here this past restaurant week. I got the rose margarita, tortilla soup, seafood enchiladas, and tres leches. If you go- definitely get the tortilla soup. It was bursting with flavor and hands down my favorite thing we had."
5,"This place has been on my list for years and it was well worth the wait!  I always thought it was gonna be more of an Americana style of Mexican fare like El Vez and El Rey, but it&apos;s so much more authentic.

Came for restaurant week a few weeks ago with 6 others and we were all surprised at how large the place was.  Decorated nicely and felt like a fine dining steakhouse on the inside.  We were sat at a large table in the back dining room.  Our server was really funny and congenial and really on point with serving our very loud group.

Tequilas has a great, well, tequila selection.  We all thoroughly enjoyed our many rounds of drinks.  I opted for the standard &quot;Tequila&apos;s&quot; margarita with orange liqueur which was probably the best margarita I&apos;ve had in recent memory.  Made nice and strong, not too sweet, perfect salt rim.  My friends opted for more adventurous numbers, like the coco loco and one that had rose in it.  All were perfectly made.

The food was stellar.  It was a limited selection for restaurant week, with a lot of seafood, but I was fine with that.  

Appetizer: Fresh, filling and fantastic ceviche.  I dipped those wonderful homemade chips in it when I ran out of the tasty housemade salsas.

Entree: Absolutely wonderful surf and turf.  The grilled shrimp was juicy and plentiful and full of flavor.  The ribeye steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare, so tender and seasoned nicely.  Side of fluffy rice and fantastic black bean puree was a nice addition.

Dessert: Fluffy tres leches cake.  Not too sweet and such a perfect way to end a great meal.

We finished our meal and sat in the bar in front and had a few Mexican beers to end the night.  I will 100% return back on a non-restaurant week night to explore the rest of the menu and imbibe on those outstanding margaritas."
3,"Tequilas feels like a hotel restaurant/bar in terms of their ambience, fairly upscale, though I was not very impressed by the rest. I came for happy hour at the bar and the bartenders were not very attentive and seemed to be joking with each other most of the time. 

I heard about their rose margarita so I ordered that and my friend ordered the regular marg. The rose margarita was very light and refreshing, not too sweet, so I definitely enjoyed it and would get again. 

The food I was less than impressed with. We got their HH empanadas which were a little soggy when they came out. The veggie enchiladas were fairly average, and the ceviche was good though nothing to write home about. The best part of the meal might have even been the salsa to their complimentary chips.

Overall, not a place that I&apos;m eager to go to again, though if I had to choose one thing, I would go for the rose margarita."
5,"Fancy, fun decor and excellent food and drinks. 

By far my favorite restaurant because I tried 3 different drinks and all of them were FABULOUS! I am going crazy just thinking about their drinks menu. I love love love their complimentary guacamole. It is spicy, there is salt, there is lime - just everything you want in a guac!!! I lovvveeee avocados and anything made out of them so obviously I am in love with their guac.

Drinks are EXCEPTIONALLY good, a word which I have never used in yelp review. Roses Margarita, Margarita Diablo, and Short Rib - try these and let me know if you didnt like any of these. Absolutely fantastic and delicious! Best margaritas I have had (well, I have only Mexico and Puerto Rico to compare to).

OMG, and the bartender brought all my drinks on only three of his fingers!! (see pic to believe it)

Their food is infused with Mexican culture and drinks - the lamb chops we had was flavored with Tequila, Beer and Wine! The Tuna Ceviche was great and we happily devoured all of it.

Food or not, I am definitely definitely coming back for drinks!"
4,"I&apos;m so glad that this place was open during restaurant week especially during these times. First off, I&apos;ve heard such great things about this place and it really stands up to its reputation. I came here with some friends and we all loved everything! The enchiladas playa was definitely the dish I favored the most out of all of the other dishes. This restaurant isn&apos;t shy of what they can bring to table!"
