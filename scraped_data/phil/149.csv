5,"Holy sh*t this place is a gem.

I&apos;ve been holding off on reviewing this place until I&apos;d visited a few times, and today I could no longer hold my tongue.

I&apos;ve found a home away from home. 
Butcher bar is everything I miss about Los Angeles. It&apos;s intimate. It&apos;s intentional. It&apos;s inviting.

Let&apos;s get the food out of the way. The reason the average foodies come to these Yelp reviews. Because we all know the real ones come for atmosphere, the food is just a bonus.

First:
The Royale with mf cheese. 
I&apos;m 100% a Pat LaFrieda slut. Craft meat is a thing you nerds. Get woke.  
Here we have a place in Philly paying Homage to the great, the almighty Quentin Tarantino.
If you didn&apos;t pick up the reference, go home. You don&apos;t really deserve to order this burger anyways.
Because you wouldn&apos;t get it!

It is the quintessential quarter pounder. A big middle finger to the metric system and another slam dunk for the USA. Bravo butcher bar. Bravo.

Brussels and cauliflower. One word. Win.
It&apos;s simple. But! BUT! 
I still couldn&apos;t make it at home. So again. Bravo.

Rigatoni. And my most recent meal (enjoyed this fine Valentine&apos;s Day 2021. 
Special. It was special. 
Why order a pasta dish at a &quot;butcher&quot; forward establishment? For the sausage of course. The dish itself was amazing, and I think a solid balance to let the sausage really shine.

Now. Environment.
I&apos;ve now encountered a number of staff here by now, and I kid you not EVERY single one has been kind. Plain and simple. Southern hospitality in Philadelphia. Who would&apos;ve thought?
I pray butcher bar maintains that. It&apos;s something special that few restaurants ever have.

The layout is a gem. Such a well designed space. You&apos;ll appreciate sitting in any section available. I guarantee it.

Overall come here. 
Eat goddamn meat. (There is a vegetarian eggplant dish I also LOVED. And again the Brussels are so good)
But eat the goddamn meat.

Will be back.
Often.
Bravo."
4,"This was my second visit to The Butcher Bar, but first time for brunch. My boyfriend and I split the Butcher Mimosa, which supplied two small drinks each to us. My brother and friend had the Spicy Butcher Bacon Bloody. I ordered the Breakfast Toast and a side of roasted potatoes; boyfriend had the BLT; brother had the poached eggs; and friend ordered the special which was make-your-own salmon, lox, and cream cheese bagels.

I also had the Blackberry Brunch Potion and do not recommend. It wasn&apos;t mixed (which I thought was intentional since it did not come with a straw or stirrer), but really did not taste good un-mixed. And even when I did mix it up, it still tasted too syrupy. Adding some water helped a little but I still did not enjoy it. 

I love how the back patio is set up. At first we were very comfortable and warm, and then the heaters actually became too hot (which was easily fixed when a server turned it down for us). But overall, the service was great, we felt COVID-safe, and enjoyed our experience."
1,"The hostess gave away a table I had reserved. I called ahead to let them know I am on my way. The hostess said that she is clearing a table in 10 minutes and we could get that. However, when we arrived the hostess gave us a long winded, BS riddled-roundabout way of saying &quot;We gave your table to someone else.&quot; 

Felt slighted, was handled very poorly, and wasted a trip out to this part of the city. Thanks Butcher Bar."
4,"This was the first restaurant that we went to in Philadelphia. We got there 40 minutes before closing, and you can tell that they were getting ready to close. I was able to order the garlic bread and mac &amp; cheese. The garlic bread was delicious. It was hot and crispy, and it had a different flavor to it. 
The mac &amp; cheese was excellent. It had Gouda, and the best part was the topping had sweet potato crumbs on top. He gave it a whole new type of flavor. The thing that completed the mac &amp; cheese was I was able to get some of the sausages from my sister&apos;s meal, and it gave it a sweet and salty taste. 
Overall the experience was pretty good. The only reason I&apos;m giving it four stars was because the service wasn&apos;t the best. You can honestly tell that they were getting ready to close and the whole thing experience was kind of rushed."
4,"We came to Butcher Bar for brunch during a bachelor party weekend. And what better way to cap off a weekend with a bunch of guys than to take on the enormous &quot;brunch trough&quot;. This thing was absolutely insane. They brought it out on a giant wooden slab, which was piled up with tons of breakfast/brunch food. It had bacon, sausage, steak, egg frittata, hash browns, biscuits, pancakes, and even cheeseburgers! I think it was something like $250 and could feed a crowd, so not a bad deal at all. We had fun tackling it, but couldn&apos;t quite polish it off... My favorite item was actually the cheeseburger and would definitely come back to just get that."
4,"I enjoyed my Restaurant Week (RW) dinner on a lovely warm Friday evening. Myself and three other ladies were seated on their nice back patio area. There were three courses available for RW and very filling and delicious for $34 per person. 

Since we had a 5pm reservation we were on time for Happy Hour which was available until I believe 6:30 or 7pm.

I truly enjoyed my wedge salad with strips of pork bacon, tomatoes, crumbled blue cheese with blue cheese dressing. I also had the cast iron chocolate chip cookie with vanilla bean ice cream.

I plan to go back to try the Gouda Mac and cheese with a sweet potato crust. It sounds delicious."
4,"This place has been on our list for the longest time. The highlight of the meal was the House applewood smoked slab of bacon with maple-bourbon brown sugar glaze  
Loved their fried chicken sandwich and steak as well. Definitely a must try."
1,I had a reservation for a outdoor table as that was the only option to reserve on open table and what we wanted. When I arrived we were escorted to a table in a room with 6 other tables with 20 plus people in a room maybe 16x20? I told the hostess that I reserved a table for outside. I was told that their wasn&apos;t one but if we could wait 5 mins we can get the table we originally reserved. So I said yes. After waiting for 15 mins outside I came back in and ask them if our table had opened up. They told me they gave our table to a walk-in and they didn&apos;t have a table for us. The manager came over and yelled at us for not taking the table inside. I called him out on his BS  and after half-hearted apology we left. Luckily TÃ­o Flores on South had an open table and salvaged the night.
4,"My first time having wild boar ribs and they are wonderful. Based on how good the ribs are, I will definitely come back to try their &quot;Through dish&quot; which includes all their meat dishes in one singe order."
2,"Love the decor and ambiance of the place. The service leaves very little to desire. Burger was delicious, not to mention the chicken sandwich. Mac and cheese was watered down. The biggest problem was the lack of service. After being severed, no one came to check on us. The only time we saw our waiter was when it was time to pay."
4,"Came here for a dinner on a Friday evening with an 8 person group and enjoyed my experience from start to finish.

A reservation had been made and my group arrived together so we were seated right away AND a waiter came to our table very shortly after. Several starters were ordered but I only tried the Confit Duck Wings, the Sloppy Joe Poutine and the Roasted Cauliflower &amp; Brussel Sprouts - the Cauliflower &amp; Brussel Sprouts were delightful; I am not much of a beef eater so I picked over the Poutine but the fries and cheese sauce were good and so were the wings, which were flavored and cooked to my liking.

For an entree, I split a Rotisserie Game Hen which was very tender and well-seasoned; I also ordered the Smoked Gouda Mac &amp; Cheese along with more Roasted Cauliflower &amp; Brussel Sprouts... It was oh-so-good! 

I didn&apos;t think I had room for anything else but then the Dessert Trough was brought out (check out the pic)... The desserts that had my interest were the Chocolate Chip Cookie and the mini Belgian waffle sundae (ummm, ummm, ummmm)... 

I would definitely recommend this spot for groups or to grab a quick bite. The atmosphere is laid back and inviting; not too noisy but definitely not stuffy.

Additionally, the food was served quickly and all of the items that were ordered came out as requested; the staff were also helpful and professional."
5,I celebrated a friend&apos;s birthday here during restaurant week and it was amazing! The duck confit wings were incredible and the skillet chocolate chip cookie for dessert was divine! Definitely will be coming back!
5,"Came here for the meat trough and it was pretty amazing!! Even though it&apos;s probably way too much meat for a human to eat in a day, I wasn&apos;t disappointed with any of the meats I tried. My favorite was probably the bacon and the ribs. The rib bones fell out of the meat so easily, and everything was flavored so well!

They also give you so many different types of sauces, which were all delicious. 

Definitely coming back for the dessert trough"
1,Had been planning a trip to Philly and saw this place on Yelp and wanted to check this place out since the menu looked awesome but they were closed for the whole length of our stay. During our trip we were looking to kill some time in the late afternoon and checked out their website again and saw all sorts of stuff about their Monday to Friday happy hour which was about to start. So we walked the 5 blocks to the restaurant and sure enough completely locked up. Wish they&apos;d used some time in the last 6 months to do an update on their site. Hopefully someday I can revise this review.
3,"This place is pretty small. It&apos;s cute inside. It has a cool vibe. It was very crowded on a Friday evening. 

I would say it has one of the most unhealthy menus I&apos;ve ever seen in my life. I ordered gnocchi because it sounded amazing and had a lot of vegetables but even though came out fried and sitting in a pool of grease. 

We asked to split a wedge salad and they split it on two plates which I always appreciate. However, we asked for no bacon and it came out with bacon anyway and when we let them know, they took them back to the kitchen and pulled the bacon off instead of making new ones. We know this because there was still some bacon. It&apos;s a good thing we just don&apos;t eat pork versus having an allergy. 

My fiancÃ© got a burger which he very much enjoyed. 

There&apos;s one teeny tiny bathroom upstairs and one downstairs. The bathroom upstairs was suuuuper cold. The coldest place in the restaurant (which I appreciated). 

The seating wasn&apos;t very comfortable. 

Our server was nice and tried her best. 

They claim to have warm, fresh baked Nutella stuffed cookie sundaes yet the cookies are sitting out on the counter downstairs and did not come out warm so that was false advertisement which was disappointing. 

I&apos;m happy to have tried it but I wouldn&apos;t return here for food. Maybe for a drink? Definitely check out the menu before dining here...especially if you are counting calories."
5,"Came here for a Friday night dinner with 6 other friends. We came here for the Meat Trough. Meats consisted of game hen, assorted sausages, beef brisket, burgers, korean short ribs, thick cut bacon, racks of lambs, and boar ribs all served on a bed of pita with fries plopped on top. The meal was fantastic. The meats were cooked to tender perfection, so much so that the bones came right off with little effort. The service was superb 10/10. Few things worthy to note, for the Trough experience, you must call for a reservation and then fill out an online deposit form for a $150 deposit (half the cost of the total meal). Be prepared to eat! The Trough is enough to feed 7-10 people. You&apos;re able to take left overs home too. 10/10 experience."
3,"FYI: They have way more seating than what their store front gives off

WHAT I GOT: Peanut Butter Bacon Bison Burger

PROS: The flavor of the burger was pretty solid, and I loved the uniqueness of the burger. Never have I ever thought about combining that kind of protein with peanut butter but it worked so well. The fries that came with the dish were also pretty good in terms of flavor and texture. The sauce that came with the fries was absolutely phenomenal though. Not sure if you&apos;re suppose to eat it with the burger and/or the fries but I just dipped the fries in and it changed the entire game for me.

CONS: So...if you don&apos;t really like the taste of peanut butter, or you just want like a hint of the flavor, definitely do not get this dish. Honestly, it&apos;s a good thing I love the flavor of peanut butter cause that&apos;s seriously all I could taste. It calms down a bit once you get to the end of the burger but the first couple of bites were pretty overwhelming. Also, the menu options were definitely lacking if you&apos;re looking for like a meal meal and not a bunch of happy hour like small dishes. If you&apos;re looking for like tapas style, small bites then this is definitely the place for you."
4,"Really cool vibes at this bar! Love the decor and the setup, it was very clean and a great place to outdoor dine. Food was pretty good, was a bit pricier. I would love to go back and try the cheese plate!"
2,"Extremely mediocre, left wondering what happened to Butcher Bar. I&apos;ve eaten here at least half a dozen times, and it&apos;s always been great. In the past it&apos;s been big, flavorful portions, fantastic cocktails, and great service. 

This time was the opposite of every other time I&apos;ve been to Butcher Bar. First, the drinks. I ordered a burbon cocktail, the Cigars and Leather. Burbon, Apple Brandy, Cynar, BÃ©nÃ©dictine. All that came through was cheap Apple Brandy. Almost no Burbon, and the Cynar and BÃ©nÃ©dictine was nowhere to be found. I suspected they had gone light on the burbon so I ordered a city wide and dumped the whiskey into the cocktail and sure enough, it brought through more flavors and made it palatable. Absolutely not worth $13, unless you like sipping apple brandy then you do you. 

Now for the food. It was mediocre at best. I got the Grilled 8 oz Hanger Steak, and I will tell you there&apos;s no way it was 8 oz. I measure almost everything I eat for dietary reasons so I know what 8 oz of steak looks and feels like. This was more like 5 to 6 ounces, and the side was roasted veggies of which I was barely given 2 or 3 oz of bland mixed vegetables. The steak was actually cooked perfectly (rare) and the chimichurri was delicious. 

We also got Pretzel Monkey Bread which we&apos;ve gotten at least half of the times I&apos;ve been here. It was noticeably less tasty than the other times the pretzel crust hardly tasted like pretzel. So it was basically just...bread. Aside from that there was a noticeable difference in the quality of service overall, although our server was good. Everyone working there seemed very low energy, which is obviously not their fault, probably has more to do with the environment and conditions. 

All in all I&apos;d say Butcher Bar has had a noticeable decline in quality, very unfortunate as it used to be a great restaurant. We won&apos;t be returning."
5,"This was a visit to a client that included a dinner out. This was our second stop and we loved it!

Wet started with a meat tray, that was great for our table. It had meats, cheeses, nuts and dried fruits. It was very good and everyone had favorites forum the tasty. We also ordered the Brussel Sprouts and Cauliflower, which was also excellent, especially the Sprouts. Fora drink I had a Yards Pale Ale - loved it. I also had a Tired Hands HopHands and really liked it.

For dinner multiple people offered the Peanut Butter Bison Burger. It was excellent and I would order it again. Overall, I loved the entire meal."
