5,"Be prepared to wait and if you arrive hungry make sure you have a snack and bring a foldable lawn chair because this place takes FOREVER. Visited during covid and the line only had about 15 people head of us. It took a total of 2 hours to get our food. An hour wait to order and another to get the food. My suggestion to you would be to order online ahead of time. I believe they use some service called &quot;bump&quot; (I&apos;m from out of town so I&apos;m not as familiar with the app) it allows you to order ahead. 

Even though the wait is long I will say the sandwich is delicious. I would order again and would opt for this place over a tourist spot (which you will also wait forever for) so if your going to wait, wait for these guys! 

The only negative thing I would say about the sandwich is this, as others have mentioned before: I do wish they put the cheese on top or evenly across the bottom because the only time you get a full even bite of bread, meat, veggie and cheese ratio is when you reach the end or crease of the sandwich. 

Another thing to note: the area can be off putting to some. I wouldn&apos;t come here at night or without another person esp if your a girl. In general, just keep to yourself, don&apos;t wear flashy stuff, be respectful and you will be fine ;) 

Enjoy! And remember that foldable chair!!"
5,"Max&apos;s Steaks is awesome! I prefer it over Dalessandros although they&apos;re not too far behind. I ordered the whiz cooked in peppers. My only complaint is that they only put the cheese whiz on the bottom only. The seasoning of the beef and peppers are good but the bread is the backpack of this sandwich. The area is not sketchy like some people say but there are some loiterers which freak some people out but it is a great place to get a steak sandwich. As of September 14, 2020, they are take out only."
5,"Out of towner (from NNJ) who was near by and told this was a must visit place. The sandwiches were all that! Well worth the 30 min detour. And the wait after ordering was 30 mins or so. That wasn&apos;t too bad though- the crowd was social and entertaining.  The only bad thing were the flys that swarmed outside the place and with COVID we could only be outside in 85* super sunny weather. . And that payment guesstimation thing the cashier does is little , but when she calls you to give back your exact change- I didn&apos;t complain and neither will you."
5,"Ha haaaaa I can&apos;t believe I haven&apos;t wrote a review for Max&apos;s yet. Wow. Well hands down the best steaks within a 5 mile radius. I went somewhere this summer I won&apos;t say where (south Philly) because that&apos;s shady but they definitely gave Max&apos;s a run for their money. 

If you&apos;re from north Philly you know this is the go to place. It&apos;s not really for the tourists I&apos;ll be honest they don&apos;t always go this far into &quot;the hood&quot;. They stick to places that they&apos;re recommended to go to, this just so happens to be a staple in the community for decades. I loved coming here as a kid and hearing the &quot;Ching. Ching ching, Ching&quot; sound of the spatula hitting the flat top where the meat is being cooked. It&apos;s a constant high pitch tune that means your steak is being made with love.

A water ice, a cheesesteak and a plain bag of chips is a summer time classic. Nostalgic , just memories of sharing one large sandwich split between 5 kids. What then seemed like a humongous sandwich what now seems like a meal for your and one other adult lol. The bar next door was a place my aunt frequented. I wasn&apos;t much of a bar hopper then so I couldn&apos;t tell you about the vibes. I can assure you one thing..... if you find yourself here it&apos;s probably because someone you know brought you here. This is a hardcore locals spot so reader, if you happen to not be from Philly and appear to be lost or look game goofy you might be prayed upon. Nothing to do with the establishment, everything to do with the area. 

I&apos;ll wrap it up by saying Kevin Hart showcased this place on a movie of his a couple years ago and I&apos;m sure the prices went up by at least a dollar afterwards lol. It&apos;s really worth the wait, it&apos;s really worth the pricey tag. My cousin says they&apos;re over rated ....BUT ...NO its not smh. It is a no frills place that welcomes everyone, I doubt they&apos;ve changed anything in their day to day operations in years. Max&apos;s runs like a well oiled machine!!!"
4,"Ordered 3 whole cheesesteaks and one half chicken. Service was pretty quick. You can tell it&apos;s a go to spot for many locals and those from neighboring cities. 

The kids had the steak said it was pretty good. I had the chicken which ended up being soggy by the time I began to eat it which was about 15mins after ordering. 

They only take cash but there&apos;s an ATM on site. For the money it&apos;s not bad but I have to compare it to something else to see if it&apos;s the best."
5,"Not being a native from Philly it&apos;s always a great joy when I get to taste of Philly cheesesteak from a local place. I&apos;ve only always tried Pat&apos;s or Geno&apos;s but this time my friend wanted Max&apos;s. Don&apos;t judge me but I didn&apos;t know Max&apos;s was in the running. However , I certainly know now. 

I am certain of two things after trying Max&apos;s. My preferred sandwich is a Chicken Philly, whiz cheese, mushrooms, fried onions , ketchup and mayo. It&apos;s taken me years to figure this out lol. And in one time at Max&apos;s I got it down. And the second thing I am certain of that out of my local Philly findings Max&apos;s is my place of choice upon return so far! 

Sandwich was seasoned well ! Fresh ingredients and good bread. 

Major S/O to my friend that suggested this spot because she already knew how it was gonna go down ! The pics aren&apos;t all mine , I had to bring back sandwiches for everyone , lol. 

Good stuff!"
4,"As of late September 2020, they do not stay open all the way to 3AM. Found myself waiting outside tapping in the window as they cleaned up. 

But you can usually trust a place that has a steady line at the order point, for which Max&apos;s fits the bill.

The steak sandwich is big enough to feed a small Asian family, or a regular American adult (of which I am one) with steak to spare. To bonus points on value. 

I know this is sacrilegious; but I like my cheesesteaks with lots of trimmings like sautéed peppers and onions, etc. which isn&apos;t really an option here; so I won&apos;t go chasing Philly steaks, just stick to the diners in New Jersey, I&apos;m used too (bonus points if you get the homage). 

Menlo Diner in Edison, NJ has a mean cheesesteak. :))"
5,When I tell you this cheesesteak is good I mean it. We drove up from Baltimore to get them. Say no more my man........
1,"Me and my hubby visited this place from out of town, wanted to visit Max&apos;s the tourist spot.  We ordered our food, while waiting on our sandwiches, I noticed a roach crawling on the counter.  I informed the lady behind the counter discreetly, she came from behind the counter; im assuming to see or kill it?  her only response was that they spray weekly and its cold outside!! REALLY.... there was another customer, who said you saw it too, I kindly declined our sandwiches, and the other customer said I should too... however, I didnt stick around to see if she did or didnt purchase hers, we left quickly. 
Be careful when eating here.  Disappointed we didnt get to eat here; sorry but not sorry!!"
5,"Bucket list goal complete! This place was amazing the food came out fast especially because the line was pretty long. I got one philly cheesesteak for 9.50$ which is pretty good. The Philly cheesesteak tasted amazing, I wish the inside was open so I could see it being made."
2,"As an out of towner who was around looking for a yummy phillycheese steak place, I didn&apos;t think it would suck...just conveniently in the area. I came with my boyfriend and luckily the line wasn&apos;t so long. We ordered a sandwich, but my boyfriend wanted american and provolone on his half and I only wanted american, the lady taking our order gave him an attitude and proceeded to say &quot;we can&apos;t do that, that&apos;s against our protocol&quot;...not sure why adding extra cheese on half a sandwich is so against the law, but my boyfriend was not happy. We ended up only getting american cheese since we were unable to be accomodated. The steak was cold and the bread wasn&apos;t toasted one bit. Disappointed for wasting money and time here..."
4,"Best cheesesteaks! Went home for Labor Day weekend and stood in line for over 2 hours for a cheesesteak.  That was the longest line I&apos;ve ever stood in here at Max&apos;s. Do yourself a favor, call or place your order online then pick up!"
5,"We got there around noon and the line was out the door. We were maybe 4 people from the door and in total I think it took us about 45 minutes from when we arrived to get our food. The line does move slow but the people behind the counter clearly have an organized process of how they move the orders down the line, so you just gotta be patient!

-A sandwich is like $20, but understandable because they are huge
-They use a ton of mayo on the bread before loading it up, I think this really helped combat the sogginess you typically get with a cheesesteak- great move!!
-Everyone was ordering their steaks with ketchup so we ordered our steaks with ketchup..also a great move. 
-I&apos;m usually all about the wiz but the guy behind the counter recommended provolone and it was nice.

I thought the meat might end up being dry in the absence of wiz, but it still tasted really fresh and juicy. Beers are cheap and was the perfect pairing to the sloppy sando. 

There&apos;s a small seating area with tables right off the area where you pay or you also have the option to sit in the bar next door. I do wish it was less of a trek to get here from Center City, but SEPTA drops off literally across the street, so you really can&apos;t complain."
5,"Hands down this place is voted the best philly cheesesteak in Philly, possibly the world cause they originated in Philly so who can do it better??

After leaving my friend waiting in line, I walked over to the bar (which is attached to the restaurant) to order a drink. While waiting for my Tito&apos;s &amp; vodka a fellow patron of the bar told me that I can order my sub at the bar. Lo and behold it was true! I called up my girls and 20 mins later we were all at the bar eating steaks and taking shots."
2,"Truly disappointed that a road trip for some good eats turned into wishing I had stayed in MD fir a better hoagie. There was no line which was a true indicator that the quality has went down. We ordered two subs one with two types of cheese, mushrooms, onions and green peppers and another with fried onions and provolone. The bread was not toasted which to me should be a given, the steak wasn&apos;t seasoned and was over cooked due to being on the grill all that time waiting for patrons to order. Both subs had nothing but onions and provolone. I will try again if in the area but will not make a special trip just for Max&apos;s."
3,"I&apos;m glad people like them because they have been in business for ever. But they&apos;re not the best. If you must experience, ask for salt pepper lawrys or all and any of their seasonings. Huge helpings that&apos;s great but chewy tasteless meat is not the biz. But like I said, glad others like them. I&apos;ll stick to Larry&apos;s"
4,By far the best chicken cheese steak ever. The only downfall is the crazy line and how devastatingly slow it moves.
1,"Ordered using the online site. I added my requests for salt, pepper, ketchup, Mayo, fried onions, and peppers in the &quot;special requests&quot; space and just received plain cheesesteaks. The online option is nice since the lines are long, but messing up my order sucks."
5,"This puts the best cheesesteak in philly debate at rest for me as this was head and shoulders above any other!!

Be prepared as even though there may not be a ton of people in front of you, the line does move fairly slow. A full sandwich is really two sandwiches and is HUGE, but they pack it full of insanely moist meat. I&apos;ve never tried putting ketchup on my cheesesteaks before but I have no complaints about the ketchup + provolone combo here. 

Far from the city center but super convenient to get to as its right off the BSL. Cheap beers at the bar that&apos;s connected to the place -- a 10/10 experience."
4,Best cheesesteak place I&apos;ve tried in Philly so far. Their flavor and portion sizes exceeded my expectations. Kind of hard to get in (compacted when busy). Best to get in and out.
