5,The Rim Cafe was real fun! Rene the owner is a riot! &quot;MAKE IT HAPPEN&quot; as his motto states in person and on their website!!! Got some cannolis at the Rim Cafe after eating those delicious Philly cheesesteaks at Geno&apos;s Steaks and Pat&apos;s King of Steaks; the birth place of Philly cheesesteaks which is across the street! These cannolis were BOMB AS HELL!! Rene told us he uses Mascarpone cheese inside his cannolis which is a different cheese than the traditional Little Italy NYC style ricotta cheese. They were exceptional! I loved both the regular and chocolate covered cannolis. The cannolis are filled with cheese right when you order so they are always fresh. There is a reason the Rim Cafe has been featured on the food network and a ton of food blogs for their cannolis and Hot Chocolate &quot;Volcano&quot;. I didn&apos;t get the Hot Chocolate &quot;Volcano&quot; because it was 90 degrees outside but they look really good from the videos I saw online! Rene kept telling us about making the &quot;First baked cannoli in the world.&quot; Next time I am back in Philly; I will try those! Saluti! Thanks Rene for the cannolis! They were great!!
5,"My daughter and I just (around 830p) had the most amazing experience at Rim Cafe, quarantine and all. We stopped in on a whim as she was picking up food across the street, home for 4 days from Pittsburgh but we are South Philly all day, and never went in, so glad we did  this time, she got a cannoli which we were told are imported from Sicily and you could tell with every bite, and then she got it filled with vanilla gelato that is made by the owner from scratch, it was smooth, and indescribably good! But on top of that, from the guy outside to the owners wife, the customer service was amazing! Beyond amazing! We thank you so much and thank you for welcoming her back home!!!!"
5,"If you&apos;re looking for a delicious hot chocolate spot, THIS IS IT!!! 

I can&apos;t believe I&apos;ve never been in here before and I pass by it almost every day! This was recommended to me by a friend so I had to stop by. I&apos;ve been craving for a good hot chocolate after having some in NYC last year and this is by far better than the one I had in NYC. Saves me the trip to NYC! 

I ordered the Spicy Volcano Hot Chocolate and the Marshmallow Brulee Hot Chocolate. The spicy hot chocolate had just the right amount of spice! The marshmallow was a little too sweet for me but the hot chocolate was good nonetheless. They both had chocolate shavings in them, which added an extra flavor of richness! 

It is a bit pricey but the quality is there! The most amazing hot chocolate ever. I&apos;m definitely going to be a regular here. The staff and owner was lovely as well!

Side note: This is better than Max Brenner and Magnolia Bakery Hot Chocolate. (Don&apos;t get hot chocolate from Magnolia Bakery - Tastes like instant Swiss Miss)"
5,"I was in Philly just for the Cheesesteaks but right down from Gino&apos;s and Pat&apos;s was this little gem.  I was REALLY in the mood for a cannoli.  It is one of my all time favorite desserts.  So, as it turned out The Rim Cafe specializes in coffee and Italian desserts.  I walked down the block and found this slice of Heaven.  The store is the ultimate in niche chic.  Pictures and memorabilia cover every square inch of the store.  They have a coffee roaster and roast their own coffee in house.  They make their own gelato.  They have a wonderful collection of chocolates.  But their signature item is the cannoli.  They actually import them from Paloma, Italy.  They are fresh, thick, flavorful and come in about a dozen different flavors.  They are filled to order.  The mascarpone filling is light, creamy, sweet and orgasmic.  The owner was there that night and it was so nice to see how proud he was for the absolute perfect cannoli.  I look forward to going back to Philly, not for the cheesesteaks, but for this wonderful cafe with a great staff and the best damn desserts this side of the Atlantic!

Trust me... you do NOT want to miss this hidden gem!"
5,"The hot chocolate was AMAZING. It&apos;s almost like
I was drinking a chocolate bar. The staff was super friendly and welcoming. I definitely willl be returning soon!"
3,We decided to visit this place in little Italy Philadelphia to try their hot chocolate because Max Brenner are temporarily closed. This is a very unique place. The whole store is covered in paraphernalia from many locations. There is no rhyme or reason. The owner has been at this establishment for 17 years but he told us he has other stores in Nice France. Apparently they are known for their cannolis but we were in the mood for their hot chocolate. I ordered the marshmallow brûlée hot chocolate. It came is a styrofoam cup. The taste was ok. The chocolate was thick and real but I thought $13 was too pricey for what you get. I was not impressed with the store&apos;s ambiance either.
5,"There&apos;s not a more fun place to get your chocolate fix than Rim Cafe!! It&apos;s a place I take out of towners and those new to South Philly. It&apos;s an experience, one I think everyone should have, and one people always love and certainly remember!!

The leopard covered, chocolate salami filled cafe where you may just hear bongos playing is the best! Their truffles are to do for (hummus is a vegan favorite of mine-OMG!!!) the cannolis are so fun (chocolate, pistachio and candy-covered shells properly filled to order with the creamiest ricotta and marscapone filling) and the hot chocolate is made from a hand shaved chunks, sometimes as many as a dozen different kinds, and on occasion lit on fire with a handheld torch by non other than the &quot;Chocolate G-d Father&quot; himself!! He&apos;ll sing to you, make you sing, and ladies, he&apos;s sure to make you blush! Rene is the coolest, jolliest, most creative guy around. Chat him up if you&apos;re not sure what to get or if you just want to smile. 

All this &quot;show&quot; and the place is super solid and legit too!!

I URGE you, if you&apos;ve never been, make sure to stop by this cozy corner joint the next time you&apos;re near The Italian Market! It&apos;s totally worth circling the block a few times for parking. 

I&apos;ve never met anyone who didn&apos;t absolutely fall in love with this unique place! My kids beg to come here and even older folks fall in love. 

The decadent truffles are sold by the piece and are TO DIE FOR. The grab ana go desserts like their thick tiramisu isn&apos;t to be missed either. But definitely get the hot chocolate...even if it&apos;s summer. Trust me!"
4,"Great service, a little pricey but the coffee was great. Costumer service was immaculate!"
5,"Love love this place. Tried during a day trip to Philadelphia and walked in a bit clueless on what to order. Woman at register was very polite about it.

Got two hot chocolates and two cannolis. I&apos;m in love with the hot chocolate dirty espresso. Sipped it for a while then eventually it got cold. The taste was so rich and it was pure comfort in a cup. I&apos;m going to be craving it all week!"
4,"After eating dinner at Double Knot, I definitely had a food baby and a half. I was freezing in the night winds of Philly and immediately craved some hot drinks. I picked this cafe near my Airbnb and coming inside was quite interesting. They had homemade candy, chocolate, apparel, tv playing The Godfather in the background, great music and vibes. I got green tea and it was pretty standard, really good. The hot chocolate was like giving into all your guilty pleasures. Melted chocolate, cream,
And more chocolate to overwhelm your palette. Definitely a great spot to check out! Also there&apos;s Geno&apos;a Philly steak right around the corner."
5,"Awesome cafe friendly people... When up from Florida I always go see them ...
BEST COFFEE IN PHILLY..."
5,The best espresso in the United States. Renee is the owner and is great business owner
4,"The hot chocolate preparation is QUITE a production - whipped cream, chocolate shaving and rich hot chocolate melted into a cup. Aside from that, there are a selection of delicious desserts and coffee drinks. It&apos;s a cool concept with retro cafe vibes but 9-15$ for a hot chocolate is no joke."
5,"We visited here on our trip and omg, the hot chocolate was the best we have ever had. My fiancé is still talking about it and it&apos;s been over a month! It was so Rich, definitely recommended this place."
4,"Cute cozy little cafe near Pat&apos;s and Geno&apos;s cheesesteaks. 
The cappuccino I had was just made perfect, rich and smooth and not sweet but not bland. 
I&apos;m upset that I didn&apos;t try the cannolis, hopefully in 2 weeks when I have a chance to stop by. 
The front has chocolates and sweets for sale, on the side has an interesting display of very interesting chocolates! See pictures hahaha 
The waltz was on that day and my legs wanted to dance as I was sipping my coffee."
5,"This hot chocolate is to die for! They add whipped cream and chocolate shavings to your drink. You can choose from various flavors if you&apos;d like, I had the regular. 

The cafe is adorable with a lot of Italian flare! You&apos;ll see posters from The Godfather and leopard print couches. The owner is very friendly and is happy to give you the history of the restaurant. Highly recommend!"
5,"If you&apos;re never been to Rim Cafe on South 9th, I highly suggest it. A French Cafe situated adjacent the Italian market makes for quite the juxtaposition, but the decadent chocolate desserts and showmanship alone are worth the visit. Make sure to say &quot;hello&quot; to Rene the master chocolatier when you visit, he&apos;ll whip you up something fancy on his little chocolate wheel that&apos;ll surely put you in a sugar coma, but it&apos;ll be worth it I promise! 

Try the crème brûlée cannoli, it tastes like France and Italy had a baby!"
5,Really lives up to all the five star reviews. The friendly service alone is worth a visit. The Original Volcano hot chocolate is a work of art. All chocolates are made in-house with three varieties being used to top the already decadent hot chocolate. Add the cannolis with homemade filling and shells sourced from Italy and you have an amazing experience. A block from Genos steaks.
5,"How have I never reviewed my favorite place in the city? Whenever I talk to anyone about places to go, I always recommend the greatest hot chocolate I&apos;ve ever had. Seriously this place is insanely great.

Rene&apos; is amazing and makes this place an experience as much as a great place to grab chocolate. He&apos;s so full of life and energy, truly epic person running an epic place.

Bell&apos;s also awesome and wonderful to talk with.

There&apos;s nothing else to really say. Place is possibly the best hot chocolate ever with tons of sweets, amazing atmosphere, great owner. If you aren&apos;t going to RIM Café you&apos;re doing yourself a disservice.

Peanutbutter Hot Chocolate and Peanutbutter shell Cannoli are my go-to&apos;s."
5,What a cool little place this is. The decor is so neat and the people are so nice here. The snacks and beverages keep us coming back for more. They are located on 9th street in the Italian Market. We love coming down here and this is one of our favorite spots to visit. We will continue to frequent this establishment
