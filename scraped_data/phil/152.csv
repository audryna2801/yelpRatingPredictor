5,"Some of the best sushi I&apos;ve ever had. Really creative rolls but they also do the simple stuff well. My wife didn&apos;t like sushi before we tried Umai Umai, and now she craves their sushi at least once a month.

During COVID, they&apos;ve been doing pickup and limited outdoor dining so you&apos;ll have to call ahead to get their food either way. Highly recommend!"
5,"Hands down best sushi in Philadelphia. Umai Umai&apos;s rolls are so unique, each with a different flavor profile. Our favorites are Eternal Sunshine, Henrietta, Spartan, and Godzilla. Spartan has steak (don&apos;t be intimidated, it is unreal) and Godzilla is made with strawberries. The brussel sprouts are well balanced, sweet and spicy, and never soggy. This place is byob and reservations are recommended as it is small. Takeout is great too!"
5,"Support your local gems. We called ahead for pickup on a friday evening. The staff was lovely and greeted us at the door with our beautifully packed order. We feasted at home on amazing sushi rolls (tuna and avocado) gyozas, and brussel sprouts. This is a very special restaurant that philadelphia is lucky to have
can&apos;t wait to return on my next trip to phila."
4,"Great, affordable BYOB sushi spot. As a vegetarian, I was happy that the restaurant offered a vegetarian version of the tapas for two appetizer - I especially like the edamame and vegetable gyoza. As a vegetarian, I enjoyed the vegetable and ume shisho cucumber rolls. My fish eating friends were also impressed with the sushi quality.

Overall, a great sushi place with the added benefit of BYOB."
4,"We made it for outdoor dining late on a Friday a few weeks back before the weather started turning uncomfortably cold.  I got stuck &quot;at work&quot; later than I&apos;d anticipated that evening, but they were very flexible and accommodating when my husband called to ask about pushing back our reservation at the last minute.  Service was very warm and friendly, and we thoroughly enjoyed the outdoor dining ambience, which featured appropriate spacing, small candles on the tables, and nice chairs.

The sushi is &quot;fancy,&quot; by which I mean the rolls involve all sorts of unique ingredients (steak? strawberries?), but that&apos;s not necessarily a bad thing.  I&apos;m not sure I&apos;d come here in search of the highest quality &quot;simple&quot; roll in the neighborhood -- for that, try Engimono -- but the combinations are very creative and flavorful.  We ordered three rolls and an appetizer combo platter, and that filled us up even though it was on the later side and we had big appetites.  I don&apos;t remember exactly what the final bill came to, but I distinctly remember being pleasantly surprised by how much lower it was than whatever I&apos;d vaguely expected in advance.  BYOB is always a plus!

We&apos;re excited to go back again as soon as we can, and in the meantime, it&apos;s certainly on our list of places to try takeout while we ride out this COVID winter."
4,"We had heard a lot about this awesome sushi joint in Fairmount so my girlfriend and I decided to give it a try. We were greeted by extremely nice and knowledgeable wait staff. This place was byob which helps cut down spending on alcohol. We started out with the crispy rice, crispy Brussels sprouts and shrimp tempura which all impressed us. The shrimp tempura was better than Nobu rock shrimp! We got three of their specialty rolls which were all unique, cleverly infused with fruit and nuts, all of which were outstanding. We had just hoped for some other star menu items that were maybe more classic to compliment the other, more inventive items. We definitely would come back again and consider this a premier sushi spot in Philly."
5,"Ummm, so this place lived up to the hype. Both the waiters were friendly and attentive. We ordered the Brussels sprouts (10/10), Krakken roll (9/10) and pingu roll (7.5/10). 

Overall, can&apos;t wait to come back here! Great food and service!"
4,"So we came here for dinner on a weeknight. We had made reservations a few days prior. The food is very good, very tasty, however portions could be bigger. It is BYOB so that was a plus. The outdoor dining experience was okay, it was very dark out there. I wish they had better lighting. But the service was amazing! Our server definitely went above and beyond and made our celebration meal special."
5,"My friends and I spent an afternoon at the art museum and we were all craving some good sushi. With a quick Yelp search we discovered Umai Umai was within walking distance to the museum. When we arrived, we realized how small and intimate this restaurant really was. We didn&apos;t have a reservation but somehow they were able to seat us and we were so thankful. But, if you plan on going in the future, especially on the weekends, make a reservation!! Also, after sitting down, we learned this place is BYOB. We didn&apos;t have anything with us but definitely a bonus for future visits!! 

As for the menu, they had a nice selection. We started with the brussel sprouts per the waiter&apos;s recommendation and WOW, just wow. They were some of the best brussel sprouts I&apos;ve ever had. They had a tangy type of sauce on them and a variety of toppings. If you like brussel sprouts, get these. You won&apos;t regret it. Additionally, we ordered sushi of course. I ordered the king kong roll and it was fine. It was basically a really big california roll with more fish. But I got to try my other friend&apos;s rolls (godzilla and henrietta) and they were delicious. 

Overall, great experience at Umai Umai and will definitely be returning the next chance I get. Also, our waiter was amazing!!! I wish I remembered his name."
5,"All I can say is WOW

We had decided to try a new sushi restaurant while in town. We had not made any reservations, but they were great enough to squeeze us in before the dinner rush had started. And boy are we lucky that they did!

It&apos;s a very small restaurant, but we were given a booth in the back corner. It was a tight booth, but we managed and we had a nice big window to look over onto the street. The menu is fairly priced. We ordered some spicy tuna rolls to start, and also an order of the brussel sprouts.. which were out of this world!! 10/10 recommend-actually our waiter is the one who told us to order them and good thing he did. Fantastic. 

We also ordered speciality rolls. I had the king kong roll. I wish I had tried a different one, it felt like a glorified california roll, but it was delicious nonetheless. My friend had ordered the henrietta, and that was a FANTASTIC roll. Whatever sauce came on it was the best part. 

Make sure to make a reservation, but this place is definitely on the list to come back to!"
5,"This is one of the best and most innovative sushi restaurants that I have ever enjoyed. The addition of fruit to their creative line of sushi rolls is something to definitely try. BOYB makes it a true bargain. The Brussels sprouts is a must. But, the highlight of this place is the knowledgeable and welcoming staff. Will be back again and again."
5,"Out of the many sushi restaurants that I&apos;ve been to in Philly, this one ranks in my top three. My friend and I always order the crispy brussels sprout salad to split and I normally order the Henrietta roll with lobster tempura and mango (fruit with fish is a great concept) and piled with spicy tuna and avocado which I love. It&apos;s always very crowded and I never feel rushed despite consistently staying for a long time.  Really what sets it apart is its vibe- the place is pretty small, nestled in a neighborhood, and it feels very local and intimate, normally packed with young couples. It&apos;s a hidden gem and BYO, so it&apos;s the perfect place to get a nice dinner away from campus."
5,"I&apos;ve only had the the speciality rolls and they are unique and tasty. Small space, nice staff, and, best of all, BYO."
5,"I have to admit, Umai Umai was definitely wonderful. They have great selection of items with reasonable prices for what u get. After going over the reviews, I tried Henrietta, and I must say it was a solid winner. Service was fantastic and everyone working here was really nice and hospitable. I will certainly come back to Umai Umai."
3,"I was sooo excited to try Umai Umai after reading all of the wonderful reviews and obsessing over the delicious food pictures, but was underwhelmed by my experience. While the service, outdoor ambiance and BYOB option were all fantastic, this review is directed at the food. 

We started with the Brussel sprouts, which were crispy and flavorful but overpowered by the amount and variations of onions - red onion, scallions, shallots overload. For rolls, we ordered the 4-8-15-16-23-42, Krakken, Spirited Away and Eternal Sunshine. I was unable to decipher the quality of the fish because all of the rolls were so fried, sweet and smothered in sauces. The Krakken, Spirited Away and Eternal Sunshine all tasted the same to me. The 4-8-15-16-23-42 roll was more unique and fresh because it was wrapped in pickled daikon. I think that if you&apos;re not a serious raw fish lover, it makes sense that the bold flavors and sauces at Umai Umai cater to your palate. Perhaps I should have ordered more of the nigiri and basic rolls."
4,"A VERY small location just off of BF Parkway that I decided to go to for a celebratory dinner. I knew it was going to be small based on reviews, but I did not seriously expect that size.

We ordered the Tapas, which were filling, but a bit odd, and three rolls, which sated the sushi craving, but nothing more. Definitely a quaint place to visit if you&apos;re in the mood for some sushi, but definitely not genuine."
3,"Went for dinner with a friend. Enjoyed the Crispy Brussel Sprout salad &amp; Edamame as starters. Then split the Pingu, Traffic Light &amp; Spicy Tuna rolls. All were delicious. We had just finished eating (not even done 10 mins) &amp; we&apos;re finishing up our wine (BYOB) &amp; the server came over &amp; said the next party is here for this table. If we had been sitting there for a long time I would not have found it so odd but it was only maybe 10 mins since our last plate had been cleared &amp; the table next to us which was also a two top had been sitting empty &amp; uncleaned for at least 15 mins.

Would recommend the food but not the service."
5,"The best sushi place in Fairmount. A bit pricey, but worth it! It&apos;s a small quaint space with outside seating when it&apos;s nice out! Definitely make a reservation, I&apos;d rather die than show up without a ressy. 

Great apps and unique rolls. You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu. I think my favorite is the shrimp tempura appetizer and the Poseidon roll! It&apos;s cool they put unique things like fruits and nuts on their rolls. You think that would be gross, but it works. 

Service is always on point and it&apos;s BYOB! Like I said, it&apos;s more expensive than your average sushi spot, but you pay for what you get and that is delicious, quality food!

Highly recommend!"
4,"Umai Umai is an experience I would say. Hailing from training from the lovely Morimoto we have this place. 

Ambiance: it&apos;s tight and byob. It&apos;s dark and romantic like so taking good food pics is hard but it&apos;s a great date place. There&apos;s some outdoor seating but don&apos;t recommend in the humid summers.  

Service: our waitress was knowledgeable, kind, and understood our needs. I only wish it wasn&apos;t wicked busy so we could get our water filled more often.

Food: we got the following:

oyster shooter:  YOU NEED TO GET THIS. Honestly I still think about these. The quail egg is such a unique touch and added and creamy complexity to the shooters I never knew I even missed

monkfish pate: it made me think of steak tartar. I really liked it and it tasted different as well. Worth a try if you&apos;re curious about tasting a unique marriage of savory and sweet.

crispy brussel sprout: these were ok. Nothing really special here except we loved Brussel sprouts and wanted veggies. 

seafood paella (green curry base): I thought this was a really great fusion take on paella. It&apos;s a green curry base so it reminded me of having Thai food in paella form. It&apos;s definitely shareable and a great cozy fish to have. The don&apos;t skimp on the fresh seafood so you&apos;re getting your moneys worth

traffic light sushi: this was most memorable next to the shooters. Each color represented a flavor and you ate them in an order from yellow to red. I thought this was so ingenious and different. But it wasn&apos;t just that there was a gradient of flavor but that each different flavored roll built on each other. So the yellow was light then green was a limey light flavor. It was so beautiful just eating that. Compliments to the chef on this awesome idea. 

salmon sashimi: extremely fresh and I use salmon sashimi to test how fresh a place&apos;s fish is. 

banana spring rolls: tasted like Thai fried bananas in spring roll wraps. They do have nice flavor options"
4,"I&apos;ve heard lots of good things about Umai Umai and I have to say my expectations were met! They must have read the reviews here because I didn&apos;t think it was super crowded inside - still pretty intimate but I wouldn&apos;t say you&apos;re on top of your neighbor (definitely less so than some smaller Italian BYOBs in the city).

I give props to the creativity on the menu incorporating fruit, nuts, and other unusual ingredients into the rolls, and the price tag is very reasonable for these specialty rolls, BUT it does get expensive since the regular rolls are $8. 

I shared the crispy calamari salad and got the Krakken (shrimp tempura, eel, avocado, soft shell crab, cherries, worcestershire aioli, almond bits) minus the cherries and a basic spicy tuna. Salad was good, Krakken was great, and spicy tuna was decent (can&apos;t really go wrong with this). 

I wish I had known their regular rolls were so basic, I would rather have paid a few extra dollars for one of the specialty rolls!"
