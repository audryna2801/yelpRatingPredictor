5,"As a lover of ice cream, I&apos;m on the crusade to find the best ice cream in each city I go. Now that I call Philly home, I researched different ice cream spots in the city, and I was very intrigued by Weckerly&apos;s. With an unexpected closure and some personal changes of plans, our visit kept getting delayed, but we finally made it out last night. And man oh man was it worth the wait! 

Weckerly&apos;s is an adorable store front right in Fishtown, but if you didn&apos;t know it was there, you probably would walk right past! In COVID times, they have an employee working the window, with plexiglass separating you from them and massive container of hand san there for use too. The menu is very limited, and it changes often - highly recommend following on Instagram to stay up to date with the offerings. We had our eyes set on their ice cream sandwiches, but they also do scoops and pints. My fiancee went for the blueberry sandwich - graham cookies on the outside, an oatmilk ice cream, and some blueberry jam slightly spread in between. He was a big fan - the flavors were right on. I went for the OG, the black + white with choco chip cookies and vanilla and chocolate ice cream. I was super impressed - the cookies were substantial enough to hold up the ice cream without crumbling right away, and the ice cream was so creamy and perfectly portioned between their holders. I was so sad when it was over!

We were pleased to learn that Weckerly&apos;s sells these beautiful creations at other retailers, so we will 100% be checking them out in the interim before visiting in Fishtown again. While Philly has only been home for ~2 months, I must say that Wecklery&apos;s is a strong contender for the finest of Philly ice cream!"
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to try weckerly&apos;s for awhile now, always seeing their unique flavors and ice cream sandwiches on their social media.  This did not disappoint ! Tried a pint of the &apos;Pie buddy&apos; recommended by the friendly gentleman helping me out and it was delicious.  The hint of citrus was perfect with the chunks of cornbread croutons and caramel.  Yes, I ate the entire thing in one sitting.. no shame.  Definitely will be heading back to try other flavors.. With covid, the takeout window allows for transactions to be safe and quick as well."
5,"I can never have enough of Weckerly&apos;s ice cream. I mean they continue to impress me with all the unique flavors. Truly phenomenal. 

Honey lavender is my all time favorite.  Hands down the best burst of flavors and the sweet lavender smell. I was recently at Weckerlys and Honey lavender was not there. So, keeping my fingers crossed N waiting patiently. 

Vietnamese coffee needs a big shout out. I mean truly strong coffee flavored ice cream. Reminded me of my trip to Vietnam enjoying their iced coffee with condensed milk. So, its a must try.

Coney Island and Pineapple berry with short bread are 2 other flavors that I recommend for my sweet tooth yelpers. Both these have distinct taste and flavors. These 2 are on the sweeter side satisfying that sugar taste buds. 

I must commend the business. They continue to come up with unique flavors N continue with seasonal favorites. All flavors very impressive. Must try...."
4,"Ever since I moved to The City of Brotherly Love, I have been curious to find the best ice cream in the city. There are lots of good contenders all over the city and Weckerly&apos;s Ice Cream is no exception to that. 


The ice cream shop is a tiny store located on a busy street in Fishtown. If you weren&apos;t actively looking for it, then you might just miss it. During the pandemic, they take orders from a window and get served in minutes. My girlfriend and I came here after brunch on a Sunday and it was the perfect way to end brunch. I will say that the options are quite limited. I ordered the sweet cream cookie dump, which tasted very good. There isn&apos;t any outdoor seating at the moment so we went back to our car and ate it while listening to Spotify. 

The price is kinda steep for one scoop, but if you&apos;re treating yourself then it is totally justifiable. 

Will definitely recommend to my friends in the area and will come back to try the ice cream sandwiches"
5,"Was excited to try this after passing by and it looking cool and appealing from the outside. All the flavors were super unique, I got the chocolate cookie drop it was chocolate ice cream with several different types of cookies, soo good. But the best part was the waffle cone which had a sweet cinnamon flavor, so unique and would come back just for the cone. Love it!"
5,"I can&apos;t believe I have never reviewed Weckerly&apos;s. I am a self proclaimed ice cream snob who hates regular ice cream. I do like a good gelato and absolutely any flavor of Weckerly&apos;s icecream. I did mention I was a snob. So this place is on girard and they always have a line going out of the door. You wouldn&apos;t miss it. They have the best and most unique flavors. Honey lavender? You got it. Vietnamese Caphe? Hell yes! I always get pints but their sundaes and icecream biscuits are great too. If you live in Philly or are visiting Philly and don&apos;t get yourselves some Weckerly&apos;s, your visit is incomplete. This is the new &quot;cheesesteak&quot;"
5,"I&apos;m new to the Yelp world so my review is from my initial visit 3 years. YES, Weckerly&apos;s is THAT memorable. As far as I&apos;m concerned they have long ago set the standard for not only a mondern ice cream shop, but as a business who cares about their community. 

Thank you for sources your ingredients well and coming up with out of the box flavors. The cheese and crackers sandwich has a sweet cream ice cream with salty cheese crunches sandwiched between house made buttery cracker."
4,Cute little ice cream shop. Limited flavors but interesting flavors. They also offer lil pop. My friend ordered the cantaloupe rose ice pop. She loved it. I ordered the Vietnamese coffee ice cream. First time trying this flavor. It was good but not enough that I would crave it. A little pricey in my opinion. $4.75 per scoop. Would return just to try new flavors.
3,"I&apos;m probably the exception but I wasn&apos;t overly impressed by the ice cream. It is a cute shop with extremely friendly service. 

I tried the vanilla, oat pecan and peanut butter sorbet. All flavors weren&apos;t overly sweet or creamy. It tasted like healthy, homemade ice cream which is fine if you&apos;re looking for that. But when I go for $6 to $10 ice cream, I&apos;m going to splurge and look for overly decadent ice cream."
5,"As far as cute/trendy ice cream places go, Weckerly&apos;s is IT! They have amazing flavor options and you can get scoops or ice cream sandwiches (10/10 recommend). If you&apos;re feeling a little spicy, they have some more adventurous options, but you can&apos;t go wrong with a simple vanilla scoop on a cone. I got a brick of a peach and praline ice cream sandwich that was smushed between two delicious sugar cookies. It was just the right amount of sweetness for an afternoon treat on a hot day!"
5,"The ice cream sandwich is really good. Thick ice cream but not too sweet, it&apos;s balanced with the sweetness of the cookies. Perfect portion size"
4,"I&apos;ve been here a couple of times whenever I visit fish town. The flavors offered here are very unique and change with the season. There is seating but very limited. I love how they give you free water here.

If you&apos;re looking for something different in terms of ice cream I would highly suggest stopping by. It is a bit on the pricier side for the portion you are given the ice cream always tastes so good which makes it worth it. Also staff are very friendly and helpful if you won&apos;t know what to pick. They let you sample flavors if you&apos;re not sure."
5,"It&apos;s everything everyone has said and all the things you have read.

Im only writing this review to keep track of my check-ins, they really don&apos;t need the extra 5 stars :)

I literally could have one or more Ice cream sandwiches every single day. ALL FLAVOR ARE GOOD! 

Fresh, consistent, and the cookies always compliment the ice cream that is sandwiched in between.

I see a couple places trying to imitate what has been done here, they fail to get close. 

Tip from a pro: Get two, you will need one later."
5,The ice cream and ice cream sandwiches are amazing. The reviews don&apos;t lie. I got a peach flavored ice cream sandwich and the flavors were on point. Each bite was savored. I just wish they were a bit bigger for the price. The person who took my order was very nice and patient. He explained what was offered as the menu changes. I&apos;m excited to get another ice cream sandwich!
5,"This place lived up to the hype! 

A lot smaller than I thought but still a great experience. The staff was very friendly and the ice cream was top notch. 

What I love most about this place is how unique it is. The moment you walk in you know it&apos;s special. The ice cream selection is unique and changes. We tested some out and they were packed with flavor. 

Now the ice cream sandwiches... Dear lord they are magnificent. Please go experiment one for yourself!"
5,"Whenever my fianc√© and I are around the area, Weckerly&apos;s is our go to after dinner. This is a cute little shop. There&apos;s some seatings indoors and outdoors. Very eco friendly too!
The ice cream flavors changes quite often. Every time I go I try a different flavor and its always so worth it."
5,"Weckerly&apos;s catered a work event I was at today. The two men scooping and serving the ice cream were quite friendly and helpful. I walked up and asked them to pick something they thought I&apos;d like and they picked well. The ice cream itself was delicious! Not too sweet. Good flavor balance. Nice textures. The perfect afternoon pick me up! I&apos;ll visit their location when in the area. 

I definitely recommend!"
5,"Where have you been? Or rather, WHERE HAVE I BEEN?

I&apos;ve walked past, and walked into and back out of this place so many times. Every time I think-- &quot;ONE DAY, but not today.&quot; The long lines and happy faces surrounding Weckerly&apos;s are enough to pique anyone&apos;s interest... as it should and well-deserves. 

GO. NOW. 

You will not regret it. Order something new and different. Cone, cup, or sammie. No matter your ice cream preferences, Weckerly&apos;s has it-- whether you knew it before or not."
5,"I finally made it out to Weckerly&apos;s and am so happy I did! 

The first big thing to take note of is the homemade waffles cones - that is an absolute must-order!! The waffle cone is so light, not too sweet, a little bit crispy and just an incredible experience to have with the ice cream. 

The ice cream flavors themselves are so good as well! Incredibly creamy in texture, and super flavorful.  The flavor varieties change pretty often if I&apos;m not mistaken and when I was there, I got the BFG (which was Black forest cake with chocolate ice cream).  I thought there was maybe a little bit too much cake in my scoop and I would&apos;ve dialed down the ratio in favor for more of the ice cream but overall I was super satisfied and very much impressed.  The chocolate ice cream though was one of the best I&apos;ve ever had.  

I went with a group that got other flavors, and so my other favorite of the day was the Blueberry ice cream.  I would for sure stop by here again and try their other flavors.  They give you a pretty generous (and perfectly round) scoop, and the servers are super friendly.  Definitely worth the price I&apos;d say and I for sure will be back."
5,"I have not been to the bricks and mortar store so I can&apos;t comment on the location or the staff. With SIP, I am still trying to support local businesses, so I purchased a JoyBox (they offer food, coffee bean and booze selections from various local vendors) for myself and included 2 pints of Weckerly&apos;s ice cream in it. Thus, that is what my review is based on.

Ice cream has always been one of my favorite food groups, starting with what my grandparents used to hand churn as an occasional summer treat and from there-Carvel&apos;s, Mr. Softee, Good Humor, the ubiquitous Neopolitan from local grocery chains, Abbot&apos;s, Dreyer&apos;s, Bassett&apos;s, Bryer&apos;s, then Hagen Daazs, Baskin Robbins, Mashti Malone, gelato (not true ice cream) and so on. If I don&apos;t watch myself, it is very easy to sit down with a pint and as I absently scrape the bottom on the cardboard carton, wonder where it all went. To avoid that, I use a small rice bowl when I dish out and eat frozen confections. My ice cream eating spoon is a small demitasse one that allows me tiny tastes of the ice cream. Keeps the pint going longer, keeps me from horfing and as well-keeps my pants fitting comfortably without resorting to elastic waists or months of prophylactic Pilates sessions. 

My 2 Weckerly&apos;s purchases were vanilla with roasted strawberries and mint with chocolate cookie crumbles. Here is a caveat if you have never tried this brand-it is not punch you in the taste buds SWEET-as in, this is not the ideal stoner or little kid birthday party ice cream a la Ben and Jerry&apos;s-and to me, that is a very good thing. Also, these pints are solidly packed. No air whipped in, no fluffy stuff. A real, true, heavy pint of goodness.  

Of the 2, I preferred the pint with roasted strawberries because-damn!-every flavor, every component stood out yet made a harmonious symphony as it melted in my mouth. Weckerly&apos;s bases are French custard and I could taste the richness of the eggs, the cream, the tickle of sugar and the heightened, early summer perfume and intensity of berries that had been roasted. There were no brain freeze inducing frozen strawberry chunks. Instead, the base had Impressionistic swirls of deep Queen of Berries that had been reduced to her best self. Not too sweet, smooth and rich with an unctuous mouth feel that almost made me moan. Okay. I did moan. A few times. 

The mint with crumbled chocolate cookies was enjoyable but I did not love it because I was expecting a blast of mentholated tonsil chiller via the mint and didn&apos;t get that. Did that make the ice cream &apos;bad?&apos; No, not at all. Just like the aforementioned pint, it tasted very much home made small batch and I could tell that the very best ingredients, including house made chocolate cookies, were used. I would serve this with flourless chocolate cake and a fresh mint garnish or be a real pig and make my own chocolate waffle cones at home as a worthy throne for this ice cream&apos;s goodness. It IS subtle and that is not a bad thing. 

Having found a new local frozen goodie to love, I now cannot wait until I can actually go to Weckerly&apos;s store, stand in line and enjoy the smell of their house made cones as I anticipate what new flavor needs to be my date for the evening."
