5,"Union Transfer is a solid concert venue for artists of mid-size popularity. Because it&apos;s standing room, if an artist has a sold out show it can get pretty crowded; but all things considered it&apos;s still a good place to go. They have a few bars, a mezzanine area which is a good &quot;secret&quot; spot to see the show in a slightly less crowded area, and their bathrooms are clean (sadly sometimes a rare find at concert venues). The mezzanine might be 21+ though because they did check IDs at the foot of the stairs.

Next time an artist I like is here I would definitely go back!"
4,"I saw the band Cigarettes After Sex at this music venue, which used to be a luggage transfer station next to the Reading Railroad. The concert hall is small enough to feel intimate, but the riff raffs outside who harassed us while we waited in line almost killed the vibe here. They need better security for sure! I&apos;m not sure how safe the neighborhood is around here, but after the concert was over. I caught an Uber Pool, and the app forced me to walk in a very sketchy part of the area. Other than that, the venue was suitable. The acoustics and the staff were friendly. I bought a few merchandise before the show, and the coat check girl allowed me to keep my stuff back there, including my poster. Be sure to tip!"
3,"The space and layout for this place is kinda confusing at first. They have a certain area for you to stand if you&apos;re VIP or 21+ with a drink in your hand. It can be hard to see if you got a group of middle aged women, drunk, standing on the railing in front of you. VIP is pretty much a joke...anyone can stand inside. 

Security outside is a little rude. They groped my husband for at least 3 minutes, all while barking at me to stand inside and wait for him. It made me a little disoriented having so many people yelling from the time you walk in. 

The sound wasn&apos;t as good as other venues I have been too. I certainly wouldn&apos;t be running back here to see a show anytime soon."
3,"I&apos;ve gone here a few times for concerts and the first time was such a bad experience, the second time was not nearly as bad - so I think it all really depends on the bands playing and the crowd size. 
The last time I went it was very chill. They have a coat  check, a small snack offering which was nice. They have a bar which is also the same direction as the bathroom. The bathroom is pretty tiny, but adequate. I like that this place is multilevel, although the upper level does not offer a lot of room to see. There also is a slightly raised lower level and then the ground floor. The acoustics were decent and virtually any spot in here will be a good show. We used their parking as well which is a lot behind the building. The lot is big but the guys running it really cram you  in there and the lot it&apos;s self could be in better shape. But it&apos;s secure which is nice considering the surrounding area  is not so nice. All in all it&apos;s a good venue if the crowd is good."
5,"Great venue for a concert! Every spot has a great view of the stage, even in the rear balcony. There are at least two bars available and they can move your tab around so you can order from any one-and service was so quick that I never had to wait more than five minutes to place my drink order. 

I also really appreciated the back room where one could take a breather from the loud sounds or the rowdy crowd for a moment. There are even screens there so you won&apos;t miss what&apos;s happening on stage!  What a renovation--hard to believe this was an old spaghetti warehouse!!"
4,"Honestly, this is as good as it gets when it comes to live music venues. It&apos;s quaint and personable, there&apos;s no bad views of the stage, and the best part? The alcohol here is actually reasonable! Sure, you&apos;ll drop $30 on two big Bud Lights at a Wells Fargo Center concert because you have no choice. Union Transfer offers drafts and cans in the $5-8 range, which is awesome for a live music venue. 

The place is quite roomy for a small venue, with different levels which makes it easy to appreciate the music from various different spots. The bathrooms are pretty, uhm...gross? I mean, they were clean enough for me to use, and they were pretty big (no lines!), but the scribbled stall doodles and dingy floors reminded me of the dive bars that offer a $3 city-wide, nah mean?

Location is pretty awesome. There&apos;s a couple of decent bars and restaurants within walking distance. There&apos;s a plethora of free street parking in the area if you&apos;re early enough, but there&apos;s also a couple of lots if your keen to splurge. 

Honestly, I really enjoyed the concert I saw here, as much, if not more than shows I&apos;ve seen at similar venues. Decent alcohol, cool architecture, casual vibe. I&apos;m here for it."
5,"Caught Sharon Van Etten yesterday at UX and found it is still a great place to see a show. We found a free parking spot easy and got through will call and security quickly. The show was sold out but we were far from packed in, and it was a piece of cake to get a really good (but not cheap) beer at the bar. The space is intimate with a variety of ways to watch. Tickets were only $25 for SVE and Amen Dunes was just $18 last week. 

Great musicians, reasonable prices, excellent views without being packed in like cattle. I do love a good divey venue with some edge too and UX is not that kind of place, but it&apos;s hard to find fault with the experience here."
5,"I saw Turnover here a few years ago, and Pinegrove more recently, and I&apos;ll be seeing AJJ here in the spring. Large, very spacious venue. Both times I&apos;ve been here I haven&apos;t had too many issues with it being too crowded and with not being able to see. There&apos;s a bar and designated areas for drinking (which I prefer at a concert venue). Overall the Union Transfer is a very beautiful venue, and I&apos;ve enjoyed every show I&apos;ve seen here so far."
5,"Seriously one of of my favorite venues not only in Philly, but anywhere! 

Love the exterior with murals on the side of the building. And the fact that it&apos;s an old spaghetti factory. Too cool. They don&apos;t try too hard to be cool though, some places i don&apos;t like just try. Too. Hard. Union transfer owns its vibe.

In my opinion, there&apos;s not a bad seat in the house. You can grab a drink at the bar and stand elevated behind the sound booth, or head upstairs to the bar and stand along the railing to get the view from above.

I love to be out on the floor in the crowd, though. Keep in mind you can&apos;t bring your drinks out here though! The sound is awesome too, no matter where you are. Bummed the Fillmore is pulling more of the acts I used to see at union transfer, but thus is life. Need to get back here more!"
4,"This is a great standing room only, general admission concert venue in the Philly area.  We went to a concert here on a Thursday evening.  Even though our show was sold out, there was plenty of room and options on where to view the stage.  There is not a bad location in the house.  Great view and acoustics from every angle. There is a bar located in the back of the hall. 

The interior has a very hip, yet old-time feel.  It feels like a train station from a small dated European town.  Very high ceilings, hanging chandeliers with balcony viewing options. 

Tickets and IDs are inspected upon entering and bags are checked.  Parking is available behind the concert venue for a $15 flat rate.  If you are lucky, you may find street side parking nearby.  Just be careful, a few blocks this way or that were a bit sketchy looking and had homeless people camped out."
5,"This venue is a breath of fresh air. It&apos;s easy to get through security, air conditioned, and you&apos;ll snag a great view of the stage no matter your location.

It&apos;s standing room only with a bar located in the rear. Most of the time they only allow drinking in that area near the bar but the last show we were able to take our drinks on the floor."
5,"I was lucky to once have the owner of UT give me a private tour of the place. I was a promoter looking for a venue to host a show. Sean was really chill and clearly had a passion for the events he brought to the city. He gave me great advice as he brought me to know the ins and outs of the venue. One thing most people don&apos;t know about it is that the stage moves forward and backward to accommodate different audience sizes. I think that&apos;s just so cool! UT competition should take note. It never feels empty there.

The venue is an old bank converted to a spaghetti factory converted to a concert hall, as legend has it. I went to see Diplo there a few years ago. It was a truly unique experience for a couple of reasons. Diplo came up in Philly so I guess he had connections with UT and they threw together a show and announced it less than two days before it happened. Tickets were sold cheap and the show sold out. The stage was all the way back for this one. It was also unique because there wasn&apos;t any additional lighting like EDM shows usually have. Just Diplo on stage rocking out. It was a great vibe and a great experience.

They don&apos;t usually have too many artists that I am into that come to play there, but when they do I will be really happy to go again."
5,"My favorite indoor venue in the city.  Some thought went into the layout here and it paid off!  

It&apos;s spacious for a smaller venue, and there really aren&apos;t any bad viewing areas.  There are 3 main sections to this venue.  Main vestibule, the bar area, and the main concert area.  The vestibule has t-shirts\posters, non alcoholic beverages and snacks like candy and soft pretzels available.  I generally start here with some peanut M&amp;Ms, a soft pretzel, and a Mexican coke. You can then show your ID and get stamped for entry to the bar area.  I usually head here after I pickup my snacks...Note: this is also the only way onto the balcony.  

I&apos;ve lucked out with parking on my several visits, not paying a dime and getting good spots, altho YMMV.

One thing I&apos;ve noticed...Seems to be quite a few panhandlers that target the patrons of this venue, in the parking lots around the venue and right out front where you may be standing in line or having a smoke.  Drawn to the crowd, it&apos;s really not the venue&apos;s issue, but I thought you should know!

Check it out, great venue!"
5,"One of my favorite concert venues in Philadelphia. It&apos;s a smaller, more intimate space- so no matter where you stand, you have a great view of the stage. I am on the shorter side so standing in front of the stage can be troublesome... I personally like to stand on the second floor balcony. You have an excellent, unobstructed view and have a ledge on the railing in which to place your drink. There is no seating anywhere here. Standing only. They have several bars, and the prices are reasonable for this type of place. Beers start at $6 for Bud Light and go up from there. They have a pretty good selection of craft beers to choose from. You cannot smoke inside, but can go out and in freely and use the smoking area outside. I would definitely recommend seeing a show here."
5,"I was a little taken aback when I checked into Union Transfer and saw it had a 4.5 star rating out of 252 reviews. Admittedly, it&apos;s been several years since my last visit, however I was intrigued by the high rating. I haven&apos;t seen a ton of well received concert venues in general, let alone in Philadelphia. 

It almost felt like my mission to find a flaw in my experience. I&apos;m happy to report, this venue is as good as everyone says it is. 

Check in was a breeze. The bouncer frisked my purse quickly, but thoroughly, my ticket was scanned by the next employee and then finally the next staffer checked my ID and stamped my wrist. With that, I was on my way to the larger bar to the left of the entrance. 

Although our timing was poor, arriving between sets, we were able to walk right up to the bar and order. There were a few other bars throughout the venue. Perhaps that helped stagger the crowds and allow for speedy service. The draft and canned beer list was solid; and inexpensive for a concert hall! I was thrilled to enjoy a can of the Star Hill Northern Lights for $7.50. For a 6% IPA, I&apos;ll take it!

Having arrived at the venue on the later side, we weren&apos;t expecting too much in terms of a good spot to stand. Our group divided and conquered to find the best available spot still remaining. I was about to rally the troops to the balcony, when I received a text that they found a gap large enough for our whole group to comfortably stand about halfway down the floor. We positioned ourselves next to the elevated section, which gave us the comfort of a partial wall to lean against.  

I was fearing my next decision, which I think helps to push my overall experience to a 5. I used the restroom! Despite the room being dimly lit, I did not wait in a line, stall was clean and there was soap! Those things sound like basics, however I was expecting a long line, a pee covered seat and then to have to make use of the antibacterial gel in my purse. 

The (New Found Glory) concert began and the rest was history. Usually, even if my experience has been less than stellar at a venue, the actual show changes my tone a bit. As an already happy camper, I was able to enjoy a great concert, in a great acoustical space. 

The show ended after the typical concert curfew of 11pm. The crowd politely and relatively quickly shuffled out the door. 

I&apos;ve provided my list of positives for Union Transfer, but cannot come up with a single negative relating to my experience. I could only hope that more of my favorite artists can pay this GA gem of a venue a stop along their tours. 

Not for nothing, knowing this was the former Spaghetti Warehouse location, I did have quite the hankering for a pasta dinner throughout the evening."
4,"Cool venue to catch a show! Large standing room area, with a second floor balcony. 3 bars (1 backroom area, 1 inside the show area &amp; 1 on balcony), coat check, ticket booth, restrooms. 

The place was clean and had a cool ambiance. Beers seemed to average about $8 per beer. Parking is behind the venue for $15/car. Not bad to get in and out of. 

I dig it."
5,"I love this venue.

Saw the old 97&apos;s perform - it was a great show, albeit long...but..that&apos;s the old 97&apos;s for ya!

Alil meh on the area its in, but there is parking around the block from the venue for a nominal fee and there is an attendant there.  

The bar area outside of the main stage area is great, lots of tables and stools to sit on to grab a drink prior to the show, and we did just that.  The bartenders were very nice and friendly, and they had a bartender come around to take empty cups and take orders right there - I thought it was a great touch.

I made the mistake of not going up to the balcony, and went down to the stage area.....by the time the old 97&apos;s went on, I could not see a thing.  We retreated towards the back, up a step and I still couldn&apos;t see.  Damn being short.

The bartenders inside main stage area were just as friendly and poured a good stiff drink.

Acoustics were great, so while I wasn&apos;t really able to see, I was able to hear and it was nice and clear.

Cannot wait to go back - a 5 star venue for me!"
5,The acoustics in this venue make it ideal for concerts! I&apos;ve seen at least a dozen shows here... usually tend to migrate upstairs bar for quick drinks.
5,"Just saw Rex Orange County here last night and it was a 10/10 experience. It&apos;s the perfect size for a lowkey artist like Rex, it was very clean, and there was a very nice security guard who gave me friends and I two bottles of water. A not so nice security guard was also there but we did not let him drag us down. Not a ton of frills which is good because it made entering and exiting very simple. Made some lifelong friends in the line as well as inside the concert. My friends and I were second row and it was perhaps the peak of my existence.Excellent acoustics and an overall amazing experience! Absolutely ill be seeing a concert there again!"
3,"Venue - cool air conditioned temperature &amp; nicely finished inside, bathrooms were nice, tidy and clean. It&apos;s not the biggest venue but there&apos;s a balcony level and for some reason like 3 or 4 bars. (Overkill) Professional staff, security checks as well. However I did not like that as soon as I walked in there were people inside trying to get me to register to vote. 8pm on a Friday inside an alternative music venue, that is not the vibe I&apos;m looking for.

Prices- $8 for a 12oz can of beer, not great by any means. Pre-game the venue and/or bring a flask. It was $63 for just two tickets to the venue &amp; only two bands played and one of them was a local band. Also parking in their lot was $15 even though there was free street parking available. I know the area isn&apos;t the &quot;best&quot; but that was absurd. And despite having &quot;security&quot; and a private parking lot they didn&apos;t bother doing anything to keep people from being accosted by local scammers, their outdoor smoking area was just a temporary metal barrier set up on the front sidewalk. People were just walking up and trying to scam the smokers out of money and the &quot;security&quot; guys didn&apos;t do anything. Weak. My local punk dive bar has 0 security and does a better job keeping its patrons from being harassed. 

Between the $15 private lot parking and the random street guy I witnessed pressuring a sad young couple into paying him $5 for &quot;helping&quot; them parallel park in the street, it was difficult to decide who the &quot;real&quot; scammers were out here. That same guy tried to get me to pay him for telling me a joke while I was standing in the smoking area??? If staff doesn&apos;t even have the balls to clear the area then wtf did I pay all that extra for??

I don&apos;t really see what all the price hiking was for except for having AC and no stickers on the toilet seats."
