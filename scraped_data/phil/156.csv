4,"My friends and I scheduled for 5 and were promptly seated even tho we were not given the option to sit inside. There was no problem with bugs, yet a cool breeze. (I am fully aware fall was near) 

We were given a choice to order for restaurant week menu or the main menu. (This must have been a device issue, as she had a hand held device)
The items came out timely. The presentation was beautiful. 

The empanadas were delicious. Half chicken was divine especially with the sauce. Rice well cooked and the black bean sauce was not over powering. The rice pudding was delicious. 

We were kind of rushed at the end. Not sure if it was the timing or covid dining regs or the next up yet it didn&apos;t seem like we were in the way. Martha was a joy! The host was too. 

I wont be back to eat downtown until we can eat inside. 
I would still recommend the experience. Especially when dancing   becomes a thing there again."
5,"My parents came into town and decided this place would be a nice change in pace from what they have in New Jersey. This was my second time getting food from this restaurant, this time take-out, and the food was still a 10/10!!  I hate when take out portions are very tiny compared to what you get eating in but that was not the case.  The meals were still decently sized and plated nicely.  My parents can&apos;t stop talking about how good their meals were!  We got the guac and plantain chips to start and each got either paella vegetarian or paella mixta.  The plantain chips and guac are seasoned perfectly!  The paella  is so flavorful, everything is cooked perfectly, and the meat is so tender and moist.  We couldn&apos;t go to Cuba Libre without getting a mojito and thankfully they serve mojitos to go!! They are a little pricey but worth it.  Can&apos;t wait to go back."
5,"We made indoor reservations for Friday night for an early Valentine&apos;s Day dinner. Temperatures were taken at the door, everyone was wearing a mask and the tables were spaced appropriately as well as having plastic dividers between them. We ordered the chicken wings for an appetizer which were very flavorful, extra crispy, came out hot and were overall delicious. My fiancé and i ordered the plato Gaucho mixed grill with rice and beans and the maduros as our sides. All the meat was cooked perfectly and was flavorful. The sides were delicious as well. I ordered a mango mojito which was sweet but perfect. My fiancé ordered flan for dessert and said it was delicious as well. Our waitress was very attentive, knowledgeable and gave good menu suggestions and super friendly."
5,"I came here for a birthday celebration during restaurant week a while back and had a great experience! First, their decor is really unique. The main dining room is surrounded by balconies so it feels like you&apos;re outdoors. Also pretty spread out so you can hear the table talk even when there&apos;s other patrons sitting nearby. When I called ahead to tell them that this was a birthday celebration, they even added a little birthday candle on the dessert, which was a really nice touch. 

For appetizers, we had Malanga Fritters (crispy with a sweetish sauce) and Pineapple Guacamole Cubano with crispy plantain chips. All were very tasty. The complementary bread was also good. For entree we had Pez Cobia and Lechon Asado. I ate the Pez Cobia and thought it was pretty good. Not the best fish I&apos;ve had but also not the worst. The Tres Leches for dessert was great though and I would definitely get again. Overall though, each of the items paired nicely together for a good meal."
4,"I&apos;m so happy that they are finally delivering to West Philly. I ordered chicken empanadas, ropa vieja and guacamole and it was all DELICIOUS. 

I was worried about the empanadas being delivered from so far but they were crispy and perfect &amp; STILL WARM. Everything was packaged perfectly. Plastic wrap on anything they thought needed it, which is always appreciated. 

Bf and I have been craving good quality authentic empanadas .. after ordering from other places w no luck ... we were overjoyed to have Cuba libre delivered this might be a weekly thing now!!"
5,"Went here for drinks and a snack since I was craving a caipirinha. Tried the winter special, an apple cider caipirinha and it was amazing. I inquired about the guava caipirinha, and the server told me it was sweet. I asked for a less sweet version and they were able to accommodate that request perfectly. The drink was delicious beyond words. We tried an appetizer as well which was amazing. Can&apos;t wait to go back!"
3,"Quarantine Post!

Outdoor seating plenty available out onto the street. Very nice area very close to the water. Drinks were amazing, must try their specials. Do not recommend the bloody mary. Otherwise recommend drinks here, but if you dine, they require you to order at least 2 appetizers.

Friend and I were very unhappy with the quality of the food. The crispy pork shank was way too overcooked and had very little meat on it, disappointed for the price. We did address it with the restaurant and they were receptive to the feedback. Looks like the menu changes every now and then so I recommend taking a look before going to make sure there&apos;s something you like. I am looking to hopefully try other dishes and give this place a second chance. The tuna ceviche is more asian than cuban, it uses seaweed salad which is interesting.. did not taste bad but not a ceviche. 

Service was very pleasant and it is nice on a summer day. We overall had a nice time, not such much impressed by the food served."
5,"I was just walking by and the music playing and lights pulled me in. It&apos;s a Tuesday around 5pm. I was greeted immediately and given a table outside. They quickly turned the heated lamp on and I was very comfortable. I started my meal with a hot caramel apple cider (spiked with rum), and it was delicious and not too hot. They served me bread with... wait for it... Mango Butter!! Like, what!?  I ordered the churrasco a la Cubana. OMG it was sooo good and cooked to perfection. I&apos;m glad i took a picture before i devoured it for proof. My server Steven was amazing and very knowledgeable and very nice. I eat out alone a lot and this a place i would recommend for eating alone or larger parties."
5,"I LOVE this place and am so happy indoor dining is back! The interior decor really adds so much to experience, every detail is great. On top of that, the food is delicious and so flavorful. You will not leave hungry for sure! I got the Visit to Havana which gives you a great tasting of several items and we shared guac for the table, all so yummy!!"
5,"As soon as I entered the restaurant I feel like I was transported to Cuba. The salsa music definitely creates the atmosphere too. Great settings with palm trees and fans on the roof.

My waiter Eric is super friendly and attentive. Even the manager was checking each table to make sure everything is ok. 

Complimentary warm bread and mango butter is awesome and addicting. 

Pineapple guacamole with fried plantain is a must have. Guacamole isn&apos;t spicy and the pineapple gives more flavor and freshness to it. The long crispy fried plantain isn&apos;t greasy at all.

Three dips appetizer is ok. It has black bean hummus, salsa, and cauliflower pure served with malanga and plantain chips. Nothing special about it.

Shrimp entree is small. The shrimps are fresh and perfectly cooked. It&apos;s acidic but still enjoyable. The maduros is good too not to greasy or over charred 

Dessert:  chocolate torte with dulce de leche and blueberry compote is awesome. It has crunchy crust. Perfect sweetness.

Flan is delicious too. Perfect firmness and not overly sweet.

Tres leches is your ok and the cake taste grainy. I don&apos;t recommend it. The table next to mine also commented that it is just ok."
5,"Loooove this place. It&apos;s a beautiful restaurant, delicious food and the staff was great specially the manager. He was very on top of things and made sure all of our needs were beyond fulfilled."
5,"I am so happy that this gorgeous little restaurant was able to participate in restaurant week. They had indoor seating that was very spaced out and even had safety walls in place. The restaurant menu was hard to find online prior to going but upon arrival they made up for it. Small bags were provided for masks, hand wipes were given out between courses, and menus were online. I was happy to to have so many options on the restaurant week menu in general and was surprised to see so many vegetarian options. Complementary bread was brought to the table with a zesty butter. All the food was extremely flavorful and creative. The churros we probably my favorite!"
3,"I&apos;ve been to Cuba Libre a handful of times over the years. You can&apos;t go wrong starting the meal off with a mojito. They have a great selection of mojitos here and on my most recent visit I had the classic mojito, and it was as good as always. My meal started with a plate of both chicken and beef empanadas. They were tasty but the sauce they came with didn&apos;t add much. My entree was the Vaca Frita, a shredded steak with rice and beans. The meat was overcooked and way too dry. The sides were good. For dessert I had the tres leches. It comes in a tin of the milk so that the cake can absorb as much as possible. A nice sweet ending to the meal but I have had better versions of it elsewhere. 
Overall, i expect better from Cuba Libre. The food never seems to quite match up to the drinks and fun decor."
5,"Cuba Libre has been on my list for awhile and I finally had the chance to go this weekend. Due to COVID, the city has shut down car traffic on 2nd street to allow for more outdoor dining for restaurants like Cuba Libre. As a result, it was easy to make a reservation and you felt safe throughout your entire dining experience. The waiter informed us that they were known for their mojitos so I took his recommendation and ordered the coconut mojito. It had the perfect combination of mint and coconut and was so refreshing on the warm day. As an entree, I ordered the Tour of Havana. The tour included a Cuban sandwich, plantain chips, salad, and black bean soup. I certainly did not leave hungry and even needed a box! I highly recommend Cuba Libre for either a date, a drink with friends, or a dinner with the family!"
5,"We had a fabulous time at Cuba Libre! The ambience is fantastic. We enjoyed the outdoor seating with the heating lamps. Located in Olde City Philadelphia...it was perfect. Dinner was awesome, we ordered the Seafood Paella Marinera which was so delicious! And service was great."
5,"I am so glad to have visited Cuban Libre this evening. They are taking COVID precautions seriously they take your temperature, ask you questions, wear gloves, and sanitize often.  

The food was delicious; full of flavor. I strongly recommend the wings and empanadas (chicken was the best). For dinner we ordered the seafood paella and ropa vieja, which was accompanied by white rice and sweet plantains. 

For dessert we had tres leche, which was good but not amazing compared to my past experiences. 

The ambiance was chill and the server was personable and attentive even though it was very busy. 

When in Old City, Cuba Libre is worth the visit, enjoy!"
3,"3.5

Spent a day in Philly and came here for drinks and dinner. We were welcomed in, it wasn&apos;t busy at all so we sat at the bar for happy hour. I got some rum and a regular Bay Breeze cocktail. Friends for the mojito &amp; Moscow mule. 

We got complimentary bread with a really nice mango/butter type spread. And then my boyfriend and I ordered the Vaca Frita which was good! The steak was marinated so so well. The rice wasn&apos;t the best but the beans were good. 

Our bartender person wasn&apos;t the most attentive throughout the night which wasn&apos;t the best but overall, solid night out. It got busier as the night went on as well."
5,"This place has the best drinks and splendid service. They start out with amazing (and complementary!) mango butter toast while you wait for your food and provide mini paper bags to hold your COVID masks as you dine. All staff wears masks and face shields, so I felt safe dining indoors. I had the chicken empanadas for starters and the ropa vieja for my main course. The empanadas were top notch -- crispy and fried, but still a light taste. I will say the ropa vieja could use a little more flavor and salt but I still finished it all. 5/5 would recommend."
5,"I&apos;m passing through town, a coworker recommended we give this place a try, 
We had mixto ceviche and these delicious entrees below, Erica gave great service too! She was very descrIptive when suggesting dinner specials."
4,"Due to lack of things to do, I&apos;ve really dug deep to finish these drafts of venues that aren&apos;t just in another city from the past, but also places that don&apos;t even exist anymore...However in this case, I&apos;m happy to say:

Wow, Cuba Libre still stands! 

Here is where I had my very first mojito. Living in suburbia, I was exposed to zero culture (and food), and ventured into town as much as I could. This was a happening place when it first opened, and I remember we were lucky to snag a table for our party of 6. 

Since I still ate chicken, I remember I had something with that (looking at the menu now, it might have been some variation of arroz con pollo) and everyone had a mojito...except me.* I did have a sip of someone&apos;s, and I remember my favorite part was the mint and sugar cane. These came in tall cylinder glasses which they appear to still have. In more recent photos, I don&apos;t see the sugar cane stick, unless it&apos;s hiding in the glass. 

The decor was the typical Old Havana style, which for Philadelphia was amazing since it wasn&apos;t about a light show or modern decor with leather banquettes. Here, everything just seemed to work which made this a hotspot early on. Looks as though it&apos;s still doing well. 

*I was driving this evening, but was able to return to enjoy my own on a future visit."
