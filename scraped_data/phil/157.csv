5,"Super good sammies! Two of us shared the Woodrow&apos;s Wit Wiz and the Cuban. For the Woodrow&apos;s cheesesteak, I couldn&apos;t really tell that it had truffle cheese and cherry pepper mayo, but it was good nonetheless! The Cuban was also good, I felt that it needed more zing, so I added yellow mustard. There weren&apos;t many pickles in it for me, but I&apos;m a big pickle fan! There was a good amount of the pulled pork, but barely any of the other deli meat.

Logistics of January+COVID: so Woodrow&apos;s has only online ordering, you can&apos;t go into the shop. We walked there before we ordered, I should have ordered during our walk. Our sammies cooled on our walk back, but we made sure to put them horizontally, so one side of the sandwich wouldn&apos;t be soggy. When I got home, I put the broiler on to warm them and crisp the bread up, definitely recommend!"
5,"Woodrow&apos;s Whiz Wit is the Shi-- can I say that on Yelp? 
I&apos;ve been a long time fan of Dalessandro&apos;s but now I got a new fave in town -- WOODROW&apos;S! Truffle whiz cheese! How can you not. Seriously one of the best cheesesteaks of my life. AND they offer contactless pick up, you just order online on their website, so easy. MUST. GO.

UPDATE: GET THE COFFEE BBQ BRISKET SANDWICH! And eat it fresh!!! The shoestring fries add a nice crunch to the moist, fatty brisket, and the sauce kicks it up a notch!"
5,"I dragged my partner to Philly because I really wanted a philly cheese steak. I was hoping to go to Dalessandro&apos;s Steaks but it was a bit far from where we were and from the looks of it on google very busy during that time so we decided to look for a cheese steak shop near by and that&apos;s how we found Woodrow&apos;s Sandwich Shop. 

I have no regrets coming here at all. Their shop was very clean and simple. I believe there is outdoor seating as well but it was a bit chilly that day so we decided to sit inside. We order a wiz whit and one of the specials of the day. They were both fantastic choices. I was also able to wash it down with my favorite Maine root ginger brew!

If I&apos;m ever going back to philly, definitely coming back here!!"
5,"Their spin on the cheesesteak is quite good.

It is unique with a truffle sauce. It is priced pretty much the same as every cheesesteak that you can get in Philly. So you get that fancy aspect without paying an insane premium.

It definitely is a unique take on the Philly Cheesesteak."
4,"Must hit sandwich spot in the city. Under the radar, but I believe their cheesesteak rivals most big names you hear about in the city. Even their other sandwiches are delicious - I had an Italian hoagie and tried the tomato mozzarella sandwich - both of which were no joke. 

Great spot to eat in or just simply do takeout."
4,"This Whiz Wit is a pretty special sandwich. It&apos;s packed with flavor. The truffle whiz is pretty amazing and makes the sandwich. Very tender and juicy beef. 

In my city cheesesteak top 10 it&apos;s probably 4th. I gotta give a little more props to the places that do amazing sandwiches without kicking the cheese up a notch.

So what&apos;s my top 10 cheesesteaks in the city? I thought you&apos;d never ask. 

1. Angelo&apos;s 
2. John&apos;s 
3. Dalessandro&apos;s
4. Woodrow&apos;s
5. Philip&apos;s 
6. Tony Luke&apos;s 
7. Max&apos;s 
8. Joe&apos;s
9. Jim&apos;s 
10. Steve&apos;s 

Honorable mentions: Gooey Louie&apos;s, Ishkabibble&apos;s, Pat&apos;s"
4,"Excellent cheesesteak that rivals the best of Philly!!!

I would say closer to 4.5 stars.
The least impressive aspect is the roll. More on the soft and chewy side, I think a little crispy crunch would bode better.

Upfront steak seems expensive but Woodrow&apos;s does not skimp on the meat.
Fancy truffle cheese is a nice touch.
I enjoyed mine with onions and I believe there is a flavored mayo as well.

Easily the best steak on south street!!!

Highly recommend"
5,Truffle cheez whiz? Yes please. Perfection. A home for eagles fans and people who love cheese  steaks. This is the only one I&apos;ve ever had in the city of Philadelphia and this may be the only one I ever try because the bar was set so high. Juicy cheesy tender fluffy the fries were on point and did I mention the truffle cheese whiz? Holy S$&amp;@ so good.
5,"This review is a little late, but totally necessary. 

I mean honestly, just look at that picture of cheesy perfection. The tender shaved ribeye, to-die-for truffle whiz, cherry pepper mayo and caramelized onions just melt together in every bite - absolutely a king of cheesesteaks. Even the bread was perfect in that it was thin enough to let the fillings shine and somehow still hold all of it in (and trust me, it was LOADED) without getting soggy or falling apart.

Note: They&apos;re doing online ordering only for takeout in observance of COVID and everything, so make sure to factor that into your plans for your next visit.

Standing. Ovation. Woodrow&apos;s. 
Can&apos;t wait to stop by again the next time we&apos;re in town!"
4,"For eating on South Street, this is the best you&apos;ll get in steaks. It&apos;s a bit different than other places in that they minimize customization. I didn&apos;t have a chance to get mushrooms on my steak, at least with COVID and online-only ordering. Maybe in person they have more options, so I will retain an open mind.
The kid and I both agreed the truffle &quot;wiz&quot; is top of the class. It&apos;s really a gourmet melted cheese sauce that accentuates the sandwich just right. It&apos;s not the biggest sandwich out there, but it eats bigger than it looks. The beef is good quality but you do pay for the South Street location and upscale orientation. Is it worth a few bucks more than a comparable sandwich at other places? Is it worth the same price as, say, Leo&apos;s outside town? (A half at Leo&apos;s is almost as big as a full here.) I guess it depends how addicted you are to that cheese sauce. I won&apos;t blame you if you are. The only cure is more wiz!"
5,"Heeeeeeeyyy Yelpers,

All I wanted yesterday was a delicious CHEESESTEAK without the hassle of a long drive. If you review my post, you&apos;ll see that I search for some of the best steaks in the City of Philadelphia. I never thought cheesesteaks got better than Max&apos;s or Dalessandro&apos;s Steaks; I was wrong. PLEASE DON&apos;T SMACK ME.......LOL Anyways, I had to share with YOU my favorite cheesesteak thus far that left me wanting more. Here we go...

Woodrow&apos;s Whiz Wit
shaved ribeye, truffle whiz, cherry pepper mayo, caramelized onions

I give this steak a 5-Star!!! Very flavorful and loaded with finely chopped (shaved ribeye) steak with an amazing twist, Cherry Pepper Mayo. WOW! It isn&apos;t spicy at all. If you&apos;re looking for &quot;spicy,&quot; order the Cajun Fries with it to give you the Ultimate Satisfaction!!!!  

Note to Owner: If your rolls were a bit better (because rolls make a cheesesteak) I would&apos;ve given this an off the chart rating; 5++++++++++++++++++

Yelpers: Try one (two or three) and drop a like and follow!!!!!

Signing Out, 

Food Junkie J"
4,"One of the best cheesesteaks I&apos;ve ever had. I went on a recent trip to Philadelphia. I don&apos;t normally like cheese whiz, but their homemade truffle cheese whiz is to die for. They give you a normal sized sub with a good amount of steak. 

The location I went at was dead when I went there on a Wednesday around 5pm. They didn&apos;t have a person taking orders, but there was a machine that you could place orders on. The food came out quickly. I would definitely go back."
5,Woodrow&apos;s cheesesteak has been on my radar for a while but I would always end up getting a cheesesteak closer to home. Being stuck home during the pandemic gave me the perfect opportunity to order a cheesesteak from further away. I ordered a cheesesteak with truffle cheese sauce. It arrived quickly and was still warm. After one bite of this chesesteak I was in food heaven. The truffle cheese sauce is awesome. I devoured that thick juicy cheesesteak like I was a starving man who hadn&apos;t eaten in days. Then I licked the juice and truffle sauce off of every finger. This is my new favorite cheesesteak. Where has truffle cheese sauce been my whole life?
4,"If I had not gone to John&apos;s Roast Pork, I would safely say Woodrow&apos;s makes the 2nd best cheesesteak in Philadelphia. But John&apos;s does it one better for consistency sake. However, Woodrow&apos;s gets a ton of credit for their take on a cheesesteak.

Unlike most cheesesteak joints in Philadelphia, Woodrow&apos;s takes it to another level. They use a cherry truffle into their cheese and it makes it taste absolutely delicious. Bite after bite this thing just got better and better. I mean, this is a crazy good cheesesteak that they should just keep to themselves and shut out Pat&apos;s and Geno&apos;s, because those two do not have a leg to stand on compared to Tony Luke&apos;s, John&apos;s Roast Pork, and now Woodrow&apos;s.

I also loved the cashier. She was super chill, but brutally honest. She allowed me to try the truffle cheese before buying the steak to see if I would like it. Props to her for making me a believer and giving me a chance to try something so crazy, but so unique and delicious.

I only have two minor complaints. The sandwich is a bit on the small side considering the price, and the roll is a bit on the softer side. Other than that they make a killer steak that simply leaves me wanting more.

Job well done Woodrow&apos;s."
5,"Cheesesteaks in Philadelphia are as iconic as Rocky and The Liberty Bell. However the scene is much more than dueling Geno and Pat&apos;s.

A little under a mile away on South St is one of the newer joints on the scene, Woodrow&apos;s. I strolled in on a Sunday after a very long Saturday night out on the town. While some eat their cheesesteaks after a few at 3 AM, I prefer to enjoy my steak and cheese after sleeping off a few of those drinks.

Given my current ability to talk to humans I was happy to see I could order off an iPad station without having to interact with anyone.

As my Woodrow&apos;s Whiz Wit and Cajun fries were being assembled I slowly came back to life with the smells of house-made Whiz and the sizzle of the grill.

Upon first bite I was whisked away to a world of beef, truffles, and fake cheese.

Really though the truffle whiz is an ingenious idea, it adds a richness to the traditional shaved ribeye and caramelized onions. The thick cut fries with Cajun actually had heat and not just salt like other cajun seasonings. 

I was absolutely delighted with my hangover Cheesesteak. Good thing I don&apos;t live in Philly or else I would be at Woodrow&apos;s every Sunday."
5,"Sorry it took so long to write this review! 
I loved it I promise
I&apos;m born and raised in philly and I 
Freakkkken lovvved IT!! 

Not many places can travel off the beaten path and succeed. I chose this place because of the truffle cheese and it didnt disappoint me. I don&apos;t know what I was expecting it&apos;s been a while since I had the meat and cheesy bread combo but I was jumping out of my seat with joy when I got it. It wasn&apos;t too oily but also wasn&apos;t dry. It had the right ratio of cheese to meat. That is a crucial part, I don&apos;t know the history of woodrows but I hope the shop is still there when I return. You know when the food is so good that you don&apos;t want it to be gone so you begin taking smaller and smaller bites in order to savor the flavor? Well if you&apos;ve never had that happen I feel for you. But if you know what I mean then treat yourself to a second one, they&apos;re that good. I got another sandwich I think it was the brisket but it didn&apos;t even compare to the cheesesteak with truffle wiz. Thanks for helping me expand my horizons because I&apos;ve never had the wiz style but I&apos;m open to this in the future."
5,"WOW. I mean seriously wow. We got takeout from Woodrow&apos;s yesterday and it was just out of this world good. Sure, we&apos;ve had the cheesesteak from here before and it&apos;s always been delicious, but last night I ordered THE BEST ITALIAN HOAGIE I HAVE EVER HAD! From the delicious hoagie roll to the arugula, the meat, the cheese, the cherry peppers, that damn herb mayo...I was truly blown away. It was delicious, it was fresh, and it was huge! I ended up eating the other half for breakfast this morning. We also ordered fries and a side of the truffle wiz because how could you not? 

I think I have been converted and will settle for nothing less than this perfection of a sandwich. Keep up the good work, Woodrow&apos;s...I&apos;ll be back!"
5,"Let me tell you guys a story. I ate a Cheesesteak from Woodrow&apos;s and it blew my mind. End of story. 

I&apos;d seen this place on top ten lists and videos on YouTube and this and that, and I decided that I had to try it. Not because people said it was amazing (which they did), but because they said it was unique. 

See, at the time of this review, I&apos;m 34 years old, born and raised in Philly. I&apos;ve had all the cheesesteaks. Tony Luke&apos;s, John&apos;s, Chinks, Chubby&apos;s, Steve&apos;s, Dalessandro&apos;s, whatever. So, whenever I hear someone say &quot;You gotta try this Cheesesteak!&quot; I&apos;ll typically say &quot;No I don&apos;t.&quot; because (to me) there&apos;s not much more you can do with cheese, a roll, and some steak meat. 

But shiiiiiiit! Their own homemade Truffle wiz and a little cherry pepper mayonnaise completely flipped the script. It&apos;s like nothing I&apos;ve ever tasted in my life. 

About four years ago, I moved out of Philly and into Jenkintown. I tried Woodrow&apos;s for the first time in April of this year. It&apos;s now September, and I&apos;ve made the drive through all that traffic on 76 and center city to get Woodrow&apos;s at least five times since then, but my family only knows about three of those trips. Lol it&apos;s worth all the gas money and screaming at idiots on the road to get my hands on this food.

Last thing before I go: over the summer, my cousin suggested we try the Cubano, and I genuinely may like it even more than the cheesesteak. Ridiculous."
5,"The Honey* honey mustard &amp; onion pretzel fried chicken, pepper jack cheese, honey mustard, pickle- Flavor of this was definitely on point! Woodrow&apos;s Whiz Wit* shaved ribeye, truffle whiz, and added pizza sauce - Truffle wiz with the shaved ribeye was really good for a cheesesteak with wiz!! Truffle Whiz Fries- the truffle wiz is pretty much good with anything!!
Overall 5 would definitely go back as they have a lot of other interesting sandwiches on the menu!"
4,"We wanted cheesesteaks but weren&apos;t going to pack the kiddos, lose our parking spot and drive out for the sandwiches.  So, Caviar delivery - it is!  The order was seamless from Woodrow&apos;s to the courier and then, to us. 

Anyways, onto the sandwiches: roast pork roll and the cheesesteak.  Both were delicious.  My husband is picky as he&apos;s had plenty of cheesesteaks but inhaled his.  The truffle whiz makes it a little more refined.  A little.  It&apos;s still a cheesesteak.  They make their own cheese whiz so no neon orange stuff here.  There was flecks of truffle. My pork roll had just enough heat from the hot aioli.  I do wish there was a bit more cheese but I should&apos;ve asked for that.  

The fries were thickly cut and still crispy when it got to us.  We got the truffle whiz for a dip.  Yum!"
