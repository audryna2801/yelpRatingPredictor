5,"One of my favorite food trucks in the ucity area! Grab a friend and go together because there&apos;s a bit of a wait here but the food here is worth it.

My go-to is the fish (tilapia) over rice which is the $7 platter. It comes with a generous portion of fried tilapia over rice with salad and avocado. If you&apos;re up for spice, I would recommend getting both the sriracha sauce and the mayo. 

The food itself is so delicious. They&apos;re not skimpy with the fish and it&apos;s slightly crunchy with the soft tilapia giving it great texture. Coupled with the sauces, the food is a great example of Asian fusion. I particularly like how fresh everything is because they make it right then and there (hence the wait) but if you haven&apos;t gone - you&apos;re definitely missing out"
4,"Super interesting ffood truck establishment. 
I love the creative dish Cap&apos;n Crunch tilapia. I have a fond memory of going when I was significantly more overweight. Unfortunately today when I returned expecting a very high bar I was met with a tasty treat that did not quite satisfy my Flavor pallet. That being said, the spot is still hip and Extremely quick service even with a line. My friend Larry also says &quot;that actually that was kind of true.&quot; You gotta Trust Larry!"
5,"Cucina&apos;s is one of the best food trucks on Drexel&apos;s campus. It&apos;s also a quick walk over from Penn&apos;s campus. You get delicious food and huge portion sizes for cheap. The food is a fusion between Asian and Mexican. The Cap N&apos; Crunch Tilapia platter is $7 and the burrito version is $6. I love how they&apos;re really generous with their sauces and they cover the entire tilapia with sriracha and mayonnaise. The food truck is really popular so whenever I go there&apos;s always a line. But they get the food out really quickly and I&apos;ve never had to wait that long.

My only complaint is that their hours are really short. They&apos;re open from 12pm-6pm on Monday-Thursday and 12pm-5pm on Friday&apos;s. Note they&apos;re closed on weekends and it&apos;s cash only."
4,"Cucina Zapata is a hopping food truck offering an eclectic fusion of Japanese and Mexican cuisine. Enjoy Japanese katsu, panko-breaded fish, or a burrito, all with copious amounts of sauce and sriracha. My katsu entree was quite good, though the accompaniments of rice and lettuce were a bit dull. I&apos;d recommend adding the fried egg for just $0.50, to make the meal a bit more interesting. On the whole, the flavor intensity was high, and the prices were fair (around $6), so check out Cucina Zapata next time you&apos;re around the Drexel campus and want a casual lunch."
5,"Cucina Zapata is the best food truck on Drexel&apos;s campus in West Philly.
I saw that they had their Captain Crunch Tilapia burrito and asked if I could order the Tilapia tacos instead? They said they can make the tacos for $3 each. They put avocados, spicy mayo, salsa, cabbage and lettuce in my tacos. In addition to asking whether you want your food spicy or mild. I usually tell them to add that Sriracha sauce for the extra kick. They do not take phone call orders, It is first come, First serve. Cash Only. Their menu is a mix of Asian Fusion and Mexican. Their other menu options are Chicken Katsu tacos or over rice. If you like short ribs, they have that option too. If you&apos;re into something more savory, their Thai curry is also delicious. Lunch  hours can get crowded around 12:00 to 2:00 P.M. The truck is worth the stop, visit and catered for foodies ;P"
5,"This is, honestly, the best food truck in Philly! Their price point is perfect for a filling meal for lunch. I usually get the chicken katsu platter, which costs $6. Some days, I like to add on an avocado or egg for a small, additional fee. I&apos;ve also heard good things about the Cap&apos;n Crunch tilapia burrito/platter.

Every time I&apos;ve gone, there&apos;s been a bit of a wait, both with ordering and finally getting the food. I&apos;ve learned to come a couple of minutes before noon, which is when they open, to be one of the first people in line.

Also, they&apos;re responsive on their Facebook page and make sure to post when they take the day off.  If you post photos of your meal and tag them, they like sharing them to their page as well. And on my recent birthday, they were super nice and treated me to a refreshing thai tea (:"
5,"When I first started at Drexel, this was the place everyone suggested, and boy was it a game-changer throughout my undergraduate career. The first time I tried it, I had the tacos, and they were absolutely delicious - if I wasn&apos;t a fan of tacos before that point, these ones made it so.

Every subsequent time, I&apos;ve had the Cap&apos;n Crunch Burrito, which is a divine combination of crispy crust and fish that beats all other burritos out of the water. The chicken katsu is fantastic as well, but is always beaten out by the burrito."
5,"Long line waiting for this food truck and there&apos;s a good reason why. It&apos;s close to campus, cheap, quick and delicious. It&apos;s impressive how quick they get the food out to you considering how many people wait in line. I had the Cap&apos;n Crunch Burrito and it had a good serving of fish (3 large pieces!) for only $6. I plan to come back again to try more from the menu!"
5,"I love cucinas! It&apos;s very popular amongst the Penn and drexel students and theres so many reasons for why it is. I get the fish platter and it&apos;s only $7 for such high quality food! the fish is very fresh, crispy, and not too bready. the sauces aren&apos;t too salty and go very well with the fish, and there&apos;s rice on the bottom with a side salad. The fish doesn&apos;t have that &quot;fishy&quot; scent or taste which makes it so good and I can tell they use fresh ingredients. Moreover, they give so much for $7! even though $7 is sort of pricy for a food truck, this food is very good quality and i love their green and red sauces because they add a slight kick to the fish. One of my favorite food trucks here and I don&apos;t get tired of eating it, highly recommend!"
5,"One of the most unique food trucks around, which is visually apparent when you walk past a slew of sandwich trucks to get to this brightly-colored vehicle. As popular as this place is, I&apos;ve never had to wait more than 10 minutes for my food; big props to the staff for running an efficient and delicious operation! To Penn students - it is worth the hike!

My favorite order, and the most famous one, is the Capn&apos; Crunch Tilapia Burrito, consisting of lettuce, tomato, avocado, and two big slabs of cereal-encrusted fish, all covered in sriracha mayo and bundled in a flour tortilla. As weird as it sounds, the breading only imparts a slightly sweet touch while still giving the fish a satisfying crunch. The mix of textures and flavors in this burrito is amazing!

Another classic order is their twist on chicken katsu, a sizeable breaded chicken cutlet (but not with Capn&apos; Crunch) served with rice and salad. It comes topped with that yummy spicy mayo, and a more traditional brown savory sauce with sprinkles of dry seaweed. Once again, what a great combo of textures and flavors! 

I once tried their chicken satay platter, since I&apos;m a fan of those skewers in most Southeast Asian restaurants. The meat was dry for my liking, but the peanut sauce was as good as any. I tried getting the peanut sauce on my katsu once for kicks - nice that they let you customize.

Last but not least, the Thai tea! Wonderfully sweet and milky while still having a deep tea flavor. It&apos;s cheaper than standard bubble tea places but comes with a lot of ice, so the value for quantity is probably comparable, but the quality of the drink makes it still worth it."
5,"This place sounds scary at first... Fish, captain crunch, and a burrito? Excuse me?

But do not worry, it is not the berry captain crunch. Its a crunchy captain crunch encrusted fish with some beautiful sauces and vegetables all wrapped in this delicious piece of warm tortilla. I just love it so much. Please do not skip on this meal!

Their chicken katsu is also an amazing twist on deliciousnessssss. highly recommend!

also get here when they open, since the line tends to be kinda long.

tldr: amazing. just amazing. 8/8 mate"
5,"Cucina Zapata is an Asian and Mexican style food truck located at 31st and Ludlow in University City. You&apos;ll know you&apos;re in the right place when you come across the long line of trucks parked on a single street. I had never eaten here before but according to their Facebook page, they serve &quot;Asian and Mexican fusion dishes that combine bold and exciting flavors with modern comfort foods.&quot; I don&apos;t know if there&apos;s a better way to describe this truck because after one look at their menu, you&apos;ll see what I mean. Some of their menu items include the Cap&apos;n Crunch Tilapia Burrito, Chicken Katsu Platter, and various taco options. What&apos;s great is almost everything on the menu is only $6.00!

I wanted to try everything but decided to go with the Cap&apos;n Crunch Tilapia Burrito because I needed to know what this was. I&apos;ve had Cap&apos;n Crunch, tilapia, and burritos before, but never in the same meal. I was very curious to see what this was going to taste like. After a short while, I was served and for $6.00, it was even more food than I was expecting. The tilapia fillets are breaded with the cereal crumbs and then deep fried to perfection. They&apos;re packed inside a flour tortilla with red cabbage, iceberg lettuce, diced tomatoes, and sriracha mayo. You&apos;re able to order it spicy or mild (with extra sriracha or without). I obviously went with the spicy option because I&apos;m a big fan of sriracha.

This burrito was probably one of the most unique foods I&apos;ve ever tried. I&apos;ve had breaded fish before but never with Cap&apos;n Crunch, let alone cereal crumbs. This added a sugary flavor you wouldn&apos;t typically expect from a fish burrito, or really any burrito for that matter. The extra sriracha sauce also gave it that spicy kick you&apos;d expect from Asian food. This appears to be a very popular item on the menu because as I was waiting, I noticed other people were ordering it as well.

What&apos;s interesting about this place is that the menu is written on a blackboard and often changes from day to day. Some of these items are staples that are served regularly every day, but you could likely come here for lunch two days in a row and have some very different items to choose from. If an item sells out, they even cross it off the list so you&apos;ll know prior to ordering. You won&apos;t have to awkwardly order something that isn&apos;t available and have to make an impulse decision while others are waiting behind you (we&apos;ve all been there, haha).

Cucina Zapata is definitely a truck I&apos;ll be visiting again, and I&apos;m excited to see what&apos;s on the menu the next time I stop by. If you&apos;re coming here for lunch like most people do, make sure you get there right when they open. The wait isn&apos;t long and the service is quick, but this place gets busy fast. Cucina Zapata is open Monday through Friday from 12:00pm to 5:00pm and is cash only."
5,"Okay first things first: you&apos;re probably wondering why the lines for this truck are always so DAMN LONG. Perhaps you were on your lunch break trying to decide what you wanted to eat, and... what&apos;s this? A zombie filled line of hungry lunch goers willing to wait in rain, sleet, snow, and scorching heat for ... FISH TACOS? (and more!!)

That&apos;s right. This truck is brilliant in the way they&apos;ve mastered their delicious captain crunch fish taco for literally just $6. It&apos;s filled with a wonderful sauce, vegetables, crunches, and amazingly cooked fish. Honestly sometimes waiting in line is enough for
me to enjoy the food here. 

A plus for students on Drexel and Penn&apos;s campus as it is literally worth the walk to and from. Give this place a try and walk over to Penn Park to enjoy the view of the skyline from a park bench on a warm summer day. (That&apos;s what I usually do)"
5,"Food truck got legs! I have been visiting Drexel University for about 5 years now and I&apos;m lucky to still be able to get the chicken satay tacos from Zapata. These people have been the first truck I go to and the first truck on the street since forever. A short bit sweet menu and everything comes out hot fresh and fast. The people are friendly and the prices are great. 
This food truck is awesome. Come here get some Thai fusion street food from them and see what I mean."
5,I moved to Boston 2 years ago and I STILL think about my lunch breaks here when I worked at Drexel. The chicken katsu is the best i&apos;ve ever had in my life. Next time I&apos;m back in Philly this will be one of my first stops!
5,"The hardest part about working in Philadelphia is trying to not spend your whole paycheck on food. I work directly in between Drexel University and University of Pennsylvania and this section of Philly has an abundance of food trucks to choose from. One of the most well know and popular food trucks in the area is Cucina Zapata. Their food truck is always located in &quot;Food Truck Alley&quot; on Drexel&apos;s campus on the corner of 31st and Ludlow and it&apos;s almost guaranteed to always have a line.

Cucina Zapata is owned and operated by the Zapata family and states on their Facebook page that they have Asian and Mexican fusion dishes that combine bold and exciting flavors with modern comfort foods. I really couldn&apos;t have explained their style of food better myself! The offer gourmet tasting food at college budget based prices and I will warn you, it&apos;s addictive!

They are best known for, my personal favorite, their Cap&apos;n Crunch-Crusted Tilapia Burrito. It&apos;s a huge burrito that includes two filets that are breaded in cereal crumbs and deep fried with red cabbage, iceberg lettuce, diced tomatoes, avocado, and sriracha mayo on a flour tortilla. The combination packes a punch of flavor, crunch, and spice that is seriously delicious and like nothing I&apos;ve ever tried before! It comes in an option of spicy or not. I&apos;ve tried both and I personally prefer not spicy but my coworkers strongly disagree as they feel the extra sriracha is the perfect touch. The best part, it&apos;s all for only $6 (cash only).

I&apos;ve also tried their Beef Short Rib Tacos. These are served similar to the burrito, with red cabbage, iceberg lettuce, diced tomatoes, avocado, and sriracha on a flour tortilla. They come as a choice of one, two, or three tacos. The short rib is juicy and flavorful and the combination of everything together is amazing!

They also have other menu items that I still have yet to try. One of my coworkers eats lunch here everyday (no lie literally everyday) and always gets the Chicken Satay or the Chicken Katsu. Also, while waiting in line I&apos;ve noticed that their Thai Teas are very popular with the college students. I&apos;m going to have to give those a try next and report back."
5,Great captain crunch fish tacos. I also love their chicken satay. Its one the best food trucks in the city.
4,Great tacos! I will definitely come back and get other foods to try!
5,"hands down best value for money food in town. You can get $20 quality food wrapped in a $6 container. Have tried everything on their menu but their capn crunch burrito is by far the winner earning 95% of my orders.

Place could get 10/5 stars if I could so I retain the 5 star rating for the negatives which are the very long lines during business hours, cash only service (meh - who cares) and rarely inconsistent business hours.
The people that run in are super into it and friendly and if anything goes wrong they definitely make sure to correct it in the most professional way."
5,"Having done my research on Cucina Zapata ahead of time, I knew I should get there early to avoid the lunch rush. I got there maybe 10 minutes before noon and was the first one to order-- score!

I ordered the Captain Crunch Tilapia Burrito, which did not disappoint. Two crisp fish fillets with red cabbage, tomato, lettuce, avocado, drizzled with spicy sriracha mayo in a soft floury tortilla and all for $6.00. It look less than five minutes from the time I placed my order to the time I got my food.

Delicious food, quick service, cheap price. You couldn&apos;t ask for more. I would definitely come back in the future."
