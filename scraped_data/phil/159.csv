5,"I absolutely adore this place. 
We happened to take a walk down south street during Covid season and came across a couple of empty tables, we asked the hostess if they were accepting walk ins and she was more than happy to accommodate us. We were seated and I immediately started wiping the table with my Lysol wipes, the server saw me and said that they do wipe each surface between each guest and I did see them so that while we were seated. Phew . 
They explained the rules- masks at all times while moving around, food is provided in biodegradable single use plates, that need to be discarded by the customer in the bins provided. QR code menus! 
We ordered a couple of drinks and the watermelon salad. This salad is AaahhhhMazing! It&apos;s a seasonal one, but it was healthy sweet with a  hint of heat! We also got the fries which were fresh and delicious. Can&apos;t wait to head back there for some fried chicken! 
Oh and puppies are allowed!"
5,"I have grown really fond of Rex takeout this year. You&apos;d think ribs to-go would be kind of weird, but Rex does them really well, along with other takeout options like mac n cheese and salad. In addition, they give you potato salad and veggies with the takeout. You may spend more here than you would at other places, but you get a ton of food, and will likely have leftovers."
5,"My husband and I just moved into Philadelphia, one block from South Street. Needless to say, the restaurant experiences we have been looking forward to are just not there, during the pandemic.  I happened to see a re-run of PBS&apos;s great series, &quot;Check Please, Philly,&quot; which had a review of Rex 1516, taped before the pandemic, and having lived in the suburbs of south jersey for a couple of decades, they just don&apos;t have this type of restaurant there, which is one of many reasons to live in the city.

It was well reviewed on the show, so we headed out to pick up our dinner. We both ordered fried green tomatoes, with comeback sauce, essentially a remoulade, which is traditional for this dish. The tomatoes were wonderful! The sauce was right on the edge of spiciness that my palate can handle, so it was perfect for me.  My husband, who likes more heat was also thrilled with them, so the heat was a great compromise for us both.  I ordered the crawfish pot pie, and I could not have been more pleased (I could only eat half at a time, so the portion was a good size.  The rest heated up in the toaster oven beautifully the next day, on a low heat (200 degrees), for about 15-20 minutes). I had never had this dish before, and I am now in love with the flavors. The pastry was light and had a lovely bite to it.

My husband had the smoked wings with Memphis BBQ sauce.  He said they were very good, but not an all-time favorite; however, he said the smokiness was enough for him to try out the other flavors they offer. He also had the garlic spinach. He said it was fine, but he makes this himself at home, all the time, so he has perfected it to his own taste.  Having just moved, our kitchen is not yet set up to cook, and he missed this dish, so no points taken off for his opinion.

Rex 1516 is not doing brunch during the pandemic, so I am anxious to try some of their offerings once there is a vaccine, and life gets back to a more normal state.  I understand their Huevos Rancheros are phenomenal, as noted in the TV show mentioned above. While we did not have a normal restaurant experience, I can say that the server came to the door (with mask) in about a minute, informed me that the food would be a couple of minutes to come out. He was very pleasant with his initial greeting, as well as when he brought the food out to me. Overall, I have every reason to visit Rex 1516 again and again. Can&apos;t wait for an effective vaccine to get life back to normal. BTW, I looked in the window, and the interior appears to be very charming -  hope to see it soon."
5,"Rex 1516&apos;s Turkeyday package for two was so delicious, we decided to celebrate Christmas with its package for two, too: White Bean Stew, Ham, Gravy, Stuffing, Biscuits, Au Gratin Potatoes, Bouche de Noel with Raspberry Coulis, and cookies.

We picked up the Christmas Eve day and followed the reheating directions to get everything piping hot for dinner on Christmas Day. Everything was delicious: I could eat the raspberry coulis on its own and those chocolate chocolate chip cookies were so fudge-y!

Happy holidays, all!"
3,"Over this summer, I had a major craving for a pot pie (probably because during the pandemic, I was reading a lengthy British novel that frequently mentioned pot pies). So I stumbled upon this place while searching online for nearby restaurants that served pot pies. 

Since covid was still going strong, they only had takeout so I ordered the crawfish pot pie over the phone for pick up. One thing to note is that on Yelp photos it says that the crawfish pot pie costs $9 but they said on the phone that it was actually more ($11 I think). I picked it up eagerly and heated it up when I brought it home - the pot pie isn&apos;t large but definitely enough for a solid meal. While it did fulfill a craving, the pie was a bit too salty and heavy for my taste, so I just had half of it with a side salad and saved the rest for the next day. I did appreciate that there was a fairly generous amount of crawfish and the crust was delicious. 

I think Rex 1516 might be one of those places that is better in person, so I&apos;d want to try it again another time!"
5,"Attended (on 3/7) with 3 other couples for a birthday celebration for my brother- in- law.   The place is small quaint and cute - more long than wide.  The staff including our waiter was welcoming and gracious.  Even suggested favorites from the menu. 

Our reservations were around 8:30 pm - late seating. When we arrived, our table wasn&apos;t ready but it was ok since the guys were still looking for a park.   The 3 of us decided to hit the bar while waiting.  The drinks were strong and good.  

Within a few minutes, we were seated at our table.  We started off to share with the table with skillet cornbread, fried tomatoes and shell and cheese.  All very good.

Our entrée&apos;s:  Shrimp &amp; Grits, Ribs, Sweet Potato Fries and Rainbow Trout.  Everything was delish.

Thanks Rex 1516 for a celebratory evening with family and friends."
5,"This was one of the more memorable and better staffed dining dates that I&apos;ve had in awhile. Recommend coming here on Sunday nights.

Must get: turkey tails, cornmeal pasta w/eggplant, mussels, hushpuppies, biscuits, porter on tap
Meh: banana pudding, cheese platter, escargot
Missed out: blackened fish

I&apos;m not a connoisseur of cajun cuisine, but I was delighted to be one of the only two parties on a quiet Sunday date night at Rex 1516. The most charming aspect of this contemporary cajun establishment is not the food, but the attentive staff, who moved tables, folded napkins and frequently checked in on us. Granted we were the only people there, but it was well noted.

Our favorites selections were definitely the pasta, mussels, hushpuppies and the biscuits. The hushpuppies have a nice kick to them, a little bit too much actually, that lingered on and stayed for 5-10 minutes. The cornmeal pasta was tasty and a bit grainy, but we wished there was more vegetables on the plate than what the descriptions let on. The mussels portions were very generous and I loved the broccoli and sausage added to the dish (albeit slightly salty). My favorite was definitely the biscuits, made in house, perfect blend of salty, sweet, and soft in the center. In short, it was heavenly.

Unfortunately, the banana pudding and cheese platter were misses. The pudding was layered with an inch of molasses that was hard to eat and vanilla waffers were too dry and soggy. The cheese platter was very nonspecific and the escargot was a bit too salty and cheesy.

Overall, this was a great place with memorable dishes and great staff, would come again during off-peak hours.

Food: 4 stars
Service: 4 stars
Price: 4 stars
Ambiance: 5 stars (loved the jazz and quiet)"
4,"We ordered Christmas dinner and their ham is superb, but some of the side dishes like salad is not good, deserts and ribs are ok. Overall I still gave it 4 stars because their ham is really good. So just avoid certain items"
4,"Rex 1516 is just amazing. The menu is amazing and the atmosphere is perfect. I was extremely impressed with Catfish Po Boy, it was prepared perfectly. Outstanding food. Crew so very kind, fun, and attentive. I&apos;ll always return to Rex 1516."
4,"My fiancé and I decided to roam around the area to see what was in town and we stumbled upon this cute little spot. This place has a cutesy, antique, Victorian feel to it. The dark colors on the wall, the ceiling lights, and their accents definitely adds to the feel of this place.
Unlike many brunch spots, they don&apos;t have an unlimited/ bottomless brunch menu. However, I feel like the food and drinks makes up for it. I ordered the shrimp and grits and the grits were the best I ever had; it&apos;s very flavorful. The shrimp was very limited in number; they only gave 3. I forgot the name of the drink I ordered but it was pretty good and strong.
Since I don&apos;t eat meat I&apos;m not sure what else I can try on their menu but what I tried was pretty good and worth the visit."
5,"Rex 1516 is my new favorite brunch in Philly! My friends and I came here on a Saturday morning at 11am. We had made a reservation in advance which we were thankful for, as the space is relatively small so tables fill up fast. The atmosphere is very cozy and antique-feeling.

We split a Skillet Cornbread for the table which came with blueberry compound butter. It was excellent! For my main meal, I got the Green Eggs (baked eggs, creamed collards, herbs, swiss chard, and ricotta with grilled sourdough). It was unbelievably delicious. Despite the small list of ingredients, the flavor profile was absolutely stunning. Even the simple step of grilling the sourdough really added to the depth of flavor. I could eat this dish for breakfast every morning.

Our server was great and got our orders 100$ correct without writing them down, an impressive feat considering the number of substitutions/choices to remember for our group! Overall I highly recommend Rex 1516 for brunch, and I can&apos;t wait to return for another meal!"
5,"We picked up our Thanksgiving meal for two here the day before, and weren&apos;t expecting anything amazing considering we were going to have to heat everything up ourselves. Nevertheless, every single dish was DELICIOUS. Stuffing, turkey, mac and cheese with brisket, sweet potato pie, and everything in between was amazing. The instructions were well written and easy to understand. On top of everything, there was way more food than we were expecting, and we ended up getting 3 dinners out of it. Thank you Rex 1516."
4,"Ordered fried green tomato and the crawfish pie. The fried tomato was too salty. The crawfish pie is perfect, plenty of crawfish and very savory but not too salty. The crust is flaky as well, pretty good."
5,"Center Philly has a lot of really large restaurants.  This isn&apos;t one of them.  Cozy, dark, with a few tables and an intimate bar.  The bartender knows his drinks and the cocktail menu has something for everyone.  If you tell him your booze of choice - he&apos;ll make you something special.  

Southern cooking with an upscale twist.  The smoked wings were excellent bar food with a tangy Carolina sauce.  The rainbow trout was rich, with velvety sweet potatoes and sautéed broccoli rabe.  

Unexpected...special...delicious!!  Sit at the bar!!"
4,"Super happy hour vibes @ Rex 1516 @rex_1516 . This small yet comforting establishment has a really dope happy hour. Their happy hour menu is very straightforward and easy to read. They also have a citywide special throughout the week that comes with a burger and fries and their house whiskey and IPA. On the weekends you are allowed to purchase this city wide by itself for only $5. (only on the weekends) wow here I chose to sit at the bar and the bartender was really nice and very new and was willing to learn about the menu along the way with us. Which made us feel very comfortable with her serving us. We ordered the shrimp Caesar salad and The PEI MUSSELS that came with Broccoli, andouille, tomato broth, Sourdough toast that was a really different yet satisfying taste and flavor. If you ever find yourself wanting to try a new happy hour spot that&apos;s really affordable yet very close to Center City try @rex_1516 and it&apos;s still the same let them know that shimmy sent you.#happyhour #drinks #whiskey #wine #salad #shrimp #water #cheese #food #philadelphia #philly #foodie #foodstagram #foodporn #foodblogger"
5,"So glad we found this gem! Every dish (wings, brisket) was well executed and the horchata and fried chocolate dessert is dangerously good. Definitely will be back for more!"
3,My best friend and I stopped here for a quick bite during our visit in Philly. The place was super nice and chill. We tried to order from the brunch menu I believe but we were told they were not serving brunch anymore. We ever up getting burgers and a chicken burger. I believe we walked into the restaurant about 20 mins before closing time. We felt super rushed during our meal. We ended up inhaling our meal and leaving. I was still hungry after I left. My chicken sandwich had more fried batter than the actual chicken. It was very disappointing.
3,"Have been here a few times for brunch and dinner. 

Service: great! Everyone here is super sweet. I will never forget how quickly my water and drinks were refilled, but especially that each time I walked to the restroom, there was a gentleman (bartender I think) that always beat to it first to turn on the lights for me. I thought that was very kind since the place is a bit on the dim side. 

Food: Based on the few times I&apos;ve been there, I have never been wowed by anything. 

I&apos;ve had their special, which was a play on Big Mac which consisted on overcooked (obviously pre cooked) beef which we drenched in ketchup because we were unable to get any more of the sauce since it was limited. It did not have any flavor and I couldn&apos;t finish it bc it simply wasn&apos;t good. 

Fried green tomatoes and fried oysters were my favorite. Batter tasted great and it was fried perfectly. 

For brunch we had huevos rancheros which I felt was just okay. It was probably the most simplest huevos rancheros you can get and make at home. Avocado and pico de gallo needed more flavor (lime juice &amp; salt?) and my sister had the shrimp po boy which in my opinion was very bland. I had the shrimp and grits and was hoping it would blow me away bc I was referred their brunch so many times! I was disappointed because I had 3 shrimps which were overcooked and grainy grits that did not have enough cheese. A nice touch was the crispy pork belly on top. 

Drinks : Bloody Mary wasn&apos;t the best I had but it wasn&apos;t horrible. My sister had a mimosa, which in my opinion was a bit too tiny lol. 

Overall, everyone has different taste!! This place is definitely worth a try. My 3-Star rating won&apos;t deter me from returning because everyone here is super sweet, and some things they hit right in the nose.. such as their sweet potato fries!!!!!"
5,"Went on a Friday evening with no reservation around 6pm. They had nothing for us, but did have a really cute couch that&apos;s just beyond the bar where we ate. Everything tasted really good! My only note (which my s/o didn&apos;t mind) was the comeback sauce with the  pickled fried green tomatoes. The combo was overwhelming, like the sourness from the pickle and the sourness from the sauce was very strong. Still ate it all though ;) 

We also got the cornbread and I must say my s/o does not eat butter, but it was this bright pink butter... couldn&apos;t remember the flavor but it was some type of fruit and he absolutely loved it and wiped the container of it clean. 

We then got the shrimp &amp; grits and the delicata squash salad. Both were yummy! We are for sure adding this onto our list of go-tos."
2,"I was craving shrimp and grits so we got take out because of COVID-19. I don&apos;t know why the shrimp and grits have good reviews I found it off-putting. Shrimp and grits are a low country dish. It&apos;s not an Italian or French dish which is what this tasted like. Imagine it...me waiting for the delicious cajun(ish) harmony of spices and flavors with delicious andouille or smoked sausage and tail on perfectly cooked shrimp atop a mound of cheesey and creamy grits with someone diced tomatoes, onions and peppers and instead of that I get the creamy cheesey grits that seem more like polenta than grits AND full PRAWNS with the shell along with an Italian flavored tomato brothy type sauce. It wasn&apos;t terrible and it may have been good if I&apos;d never tasted ummm shrimp and grits. Anyway that&apos;s my p.o.v. on shrimp and grits here."
