5,"Stopped by during COVID times to get a few cheesesteaks. Got 3 cheesesteaks with whiz and a soda for $40. Mine was extra whiz and hots. I&apos;ve been coming to Philly the last few months and trying new cheesesteak spots and this place is now at the top of my list. 

You order at one window and they call your name over a loud speak and then you go to another window to pick up. Service took maybe 15 minutes, not too long. 

The cheesesteaks is overflowing with meat. More then anywhere else I have tried. The meat is a bit more finely chopped then places like Joes or Pats. You specifically have to ask for whiz here as it is not their default cheese. I got hots and extra whiz. The hots were the right amount of hots. I do recommend the extra whiz because then each bit was ooey gooey. I liked it because it was  not dripping with grease and was toasty warm. The bun/roll that housed all that meat had good chew and was fresh and soft through out. So many places have hard stale ends on their rolls. The roll was also strong enough that it only got a little soggy towards the end of my cheesesteak. I&apos;d return for sure!"
5,"Bread - soft and chewy but slightly crusty

Meat - juicy and ample

Cheese - concentrated I the center but once I got to the middle, it wa s cheese lava heaven 

Order system - 1 line is to order and another for pick up and pay. Barelt and contact so covid protocl8are in place!

All in all, I&apos;m still dreaming about the cheesesteaks. 

Pro tip- u may want extra cheese and I&apos;d u like it spicy aak for extra banana peppers and hot pepper flakes!"
5,"Dalessandro&apos;s came on suggestion to me when I asked about best cheesesteaks in Philly and I&apos;m sure as hell glad that it did.

This was my very first authentic cheesesteak experience in life.

Snagged a street parking spot right in front, and then proceeded to wait in a fairly lengthy line to order. Naturally, they had the Eagles game on the TV inside which seemed like a really fitting time on a Sunday to be in line for a cheesesteak in Philadelphia. 

I noticed it was CASH ONLY while in line BUT you can order and then go get cash. You don&apos;t pay when you order. I ordered a cheesesteak with onions and American cheese.

I then went across the street to grab cash from an ATM and when I returned the wait wasn&apos;t long before they called my name. This means you then proceed to wait in the pick up line. Once reaching the front, I gave my name and was told it wasn&apos;t ready and wait until they call my name. I heard them tell two other groups in front of me this exact same thing, yet they called all of our names. So the system is not ideal here. I left the line, only to walk two feet and hear them call my name AGAIN, then proceeded to get back into the pick up line (mind you, is not short) and then make it to the window with my fingers crossed that my order was in fact really ready this time. It was and I paid and was on my way.

I ate at a nearby park, which allowed my order to soak in a bit on the drive since it wasn&apos;t the field right across the street. Once I opened my cheesesteak I was quite impressed. 

This was hands down the best cheesesteak I tried out of the three I ordered to try  on this visit to the city.

I highly recommend this spot over many of the other really well known spots. I despise waiting on anything in life, especially in a line but you know it makes it that much more rewarding once it&apos;s in your hands.

Good Good Stuff here. I&apos;ll most definitely be back on my next trip."
5,"Everyday I don&apos;t eat this cheesesteak I die a little inside. 

UNREAL. Worth every bit of the wait too. This was my first stop in Philly and it set the bar high.

Recommendation- get it with wiz, fried onion, and ketchup.

I thought it was weird too, but I won&apos;t eat it any other way now!

This place is exactly what a cheesesteak should be. Forget the &quot;chains&quot; go here."
4,"Top 3 best Philly cheesesteak in Philly! Tried the 2 most famous, search this place in Yelp and it has the greatest review!

Location: It is located in Wendover St in Philly, there is no indoor dining but few seatings outside maybe 2 tables.

Service: the servers are in a hurry. It has a huge line when we came, I believe it is like this everyday. Quite confusing cause they have two lines. One is to fall in line so they can get ur order and give you a number. When they called your number then you have to fall in line the second time and they will ask again your order, they will prepare and give to you the order. Too much process for me.

Food: Well we ordered afcourse cheese steak here, it is ground beef not the usual strips of meat that you expect on a regular cheesesteak. For me I like the strips better cause being it ground I felt like I am just eating corned beef from a can. But in a bright side it is juicy and taste really good, it is just that I prefer the strips beef. MUSHROOM CHEESESTEAK: this is my favorite! the steak is juicy, the mushrooms are well cooked and the cheese melts inside the ground beef. PEPPER CHEESESTEAK: same juicy ground meat, the peppers are soft and tasty. BANANA PUDDING: omg I don&apos;t like it, it taste the puddings in the nursing home. I thought it is home made but I saw the labeling they didn&apos;t make it, they bought it from a local store.

Price rating: 7/10, the price matches all the deliciousness!

I will come back here because it is good, I just prefer the strips philly cheesesteak but still good because the ground beef is juicy and delicious."
5,"If Dalessandro&apos;s is not on your &apos;cheesesteak must eat&apos; list please add it. We visited during the day while the weather started to drop in temperature so between that and COVID, there was absolutely zero line. Ordering system was quick and easy. Cheesesteak with mayo, provolone, and wit (onions) out the door. We did not wait more than five minutes for our sandwich which is much appreciated in the cold as there is no indoor dining due to COVID. They were nice enough to cut the cheesesteak in to fourths for us to split, no problem. I&apos;d come back here every time I&apos;m in Philly. 

A heads up, the parking can be hit or miss as there is only street parking on a residential street. The area itself seemed a bit busy and I want to say it&apos;s because of Dalessandro&apos;s. Excellent cheesesteak."
3,This place gives you enough steak and its great! But its bit too salty for my taste. Heard it was the best around philly but guess not to me. Always other places to try out! But you should def stop by and taste it!
2,"Their new system for customer service sucks and they&apos;re @$$holes about it.

They ask you to place an order, then call your name when it&apos;s ready, and then you&apos;re allowed to stand in line for 20 minutes to actually get it.

Ok, fine. I get it, protecting your staff should take priority, even if this is a bit convoluted.

So I call in an order, get told &quot;30 minutes or so&quot;, get there in 20 to make it easy on them, and stand under the speaker to be sure.

15 minutes go by, no name. So I ask, &quot;Nope, not on the list, give it a few minutes.

10 more... again, nope.

Finally, 10 more... &quot;Let me look. Oh, it&apos;s been out for a while, go get in line&quot;

I look over: 15 people in line... &quot;ok, fine, but no one called my name&quot; &quot;you must have missed it.&quot;

I wait another 20 minutes in line. Get handed a cold cheesesteak, and I&apos;m just like &quot;yea, forget it.&quot;

Again, I understand and support wanting to keep your staff safe, but if you can&apos;t find a way to offer the most basic customer service, then do that by SHUTTING DOWN FOR THE DURATION.

Or at least take responsibility and apologize when you screw up.

Anyway, once I cool off I&apos;ll be back.

Just annoying as heck."
5,"Off the beaten path you will find the finest Philadelphia has to offer at Dalesandro&apos;s. The freshly shaved steak is piled high, the cheeses and options seem limitless.

I&apos;ve been here three times since I discovered it and any trip to Philadelphia would not be complete without the trip to North Philly to this sandwich mecca.

I get a little crazy when I come here and order provolone and whiz, topped with pepperoni (death wish or opportunity to support the antacid industry?). They even scoop out the roll for me every time (diabeetus is real my friend).

I always wash it down with Philly&apos;s own Hanks diet root beer and take an extra bottle for the trip home."
5,"There is always a debate about the best cheese steak. Some like to stray away to tourist traps but some know the real deal. If you&apos;ve found your self waiting in line at Dalessandros for 30 mins don&apos;t worry the wait is worth it, and your the real winner. This is the best of the best. And my fat *** can tell you!

Consistency is key, and every time Dalessandros doesn&apos;t miss. Even if your if your one of those weirdos who adds lettuce and tomato to your cheese steak (i don&apos;t even know if they do that here) 

The quality of meat is amazing juicy and flavorful shout out to the guys on the grill making magic everyday. The soft roll that soaks up all the flavors soaking up all of the juice. The perfectly grilled onion to top it off with your choice of cheese. HOLY ****

Just writing this makes me crave one. Take it from me I know what I&apos;m talking about just check some of my photos and other reviews. I know where and what to eat you&apos;ll love Dalessandros ;)"
3,"This is an unpopular opinion but I don&apos;t think it&apos;s worth the hype! I found the cheesesteaks pretty average and frankly not worth the hassle to get it. There&apos;s always a huge line that spills onto the street and no way to truly preorder for pick up. They&apos;re cash only but they do have an ATM on site. I don&apos;t know, after all the buzz of this place I was expecting to be wowed. It wasn&apos;t anything memorable and I think people keep coming back more so for the nostalgia of it all."
4,"Great cheesesteaks and you can add toppings (some free, some for $1) which is great because many places charge for every topping. Their peppers and banana peppers are amazing!! Made this our last stop before heading back to NYC and ordered 7 for friends and family haha. 

A bit out of the way from your normal Philly itinerary but definitely worth the travel. It is cash only so pack cash!!!! (We had to make a 16 mins detour to the closest chase bank)"
3,"Atmosphere: Dalessandro&apos;s can get pretty crowded due to local fame and being a tourist hotspot (we visited pre-COVID lockdowns). Inside was an amalgamation of cheese, bread, onion, and deli smells. 

Service: We had to wait about 45 minutes for our cheesesteak to be made. You&apos;re allowed to leave the restaurant and come back for your food, which was appreciated!

Food: We ordered the original hoagie. A dependable cheesesteak, but nothing spectacular as the line had it seem. The meat was delicious, but in our opinion, the large steak-to-cheese ratio resulted in a drier experience than desired. The bread was also average despite the aromas coming from behind the counter. You will get a big bang for your buck in terms of quantity but not necessarily quality.

Overall: Dalessandro&apos;s is worth a try for its fame and the classic &quot;Philly&quot; experience, but we thought that our cheesesteak craving could have been more properly satisfied elsewhere."
3,"Wayyy overrated. It&apos;s a fine cheesesteak, but is it worth the ridiculous lines, sometimes gruff staff, and not-cheap prices (not what I&apos;d call expensive either)? Probably not. Like the food is OK (not stellar)- just not worth the aggravation."
5,"This is by far my favorite Cheesesteak place of all time. 

Steak American Bread. 

Keep It Simple Sweetie."
2,"In the neverending search for &apos;the best&apos; cheesesteak, I decided to give Dalessandro&apos;s a try. Everyone is entitled to their own taste, but I really dont understand why there is such a following. I would group this cheesesteak as quantity over quality. There was a lot of meat and everything else, but I really couldnt taste anything. I am not a fan on the finely chopped meat to the point where it looks like its shredded as I am not sure what I am eating. Personally, I am not a fan, but there is always a line here, so a lot of people seem to enjoy it here."
4,"I decided to try this place because there&apos;s always a huge line and has a great reputation. The line was extremely long, maybe 20 minutes, but this was something I anticipated. 

I got the chicken steak with onions and provolone. I got the same in the regular beef steak as well to try a different meat. The chicken steak is very dry, but also feels healthier. The flavor is still wonderful, just very dry. The beef steak is less dry, but I must have chosen the wrong cheese. The sandwiches were so dry I needed lots if ketchup. I think if I had gotten wiz or American, the cheesesteak would have been much more juicier. 

I hope to go again and try different toppings because I did enjoy the flavors and how much meat they give! The quality is wonderful, and I think a better cheese will really top off the sandwich wonderfully."
4,"Bang for the buck! We called 30 min ahead on a Sunday mid-afternoon and, by the time we&apos;d gotten there, our names had been called. The line for both pickup and ordering were pretty short, maybe because it was that time of day between lunch and dinner; I only waited around 10 minutes in the pickup line. 

The cheesesteak itself is huge! We got a cheesesteak with onions and it was more than enough to feed both of us for a late lunch. It was warm and gooey in texture. I wish there was a bit more salt/flavoring to it, but for only $10 total this is a great value."
5,"&quot;Whiz with fried onions&quot;

Listen, I&apos;m from New York. I don&apos;t know who has the best Philly Cheesesteak, It&apos;s not my place to comment. I do know I&apos;m just passin&apos; thru and my buddy told me forget those tourist trap spots and go to Dalessandro&apos;s.

I mask up and walk up to the window to place my order:
One with Whiz and Fried Onions
The counterperson and sees my wife next to me and says only one?
(I&apos;m seeing these sandwiches and they&apos;re huge?!)
Yes, one please

Now we all stand around and wait to hear our name. Once your name is called, now you have to wait on the payment line. They roll up a window, you hand them cash (no plastic accepted) and they give you this huge sandwich.

I walk to my car and we split this work of art. Trust me, this is a hot, juicy sandwich. You&apos;re going to get it on your shirt. And if you&apos;re thinking about eating while driving? Surely you jest..

We open the package and take a bite. The roll is fresh and the quality of the meat shines in this hero. (Hogie? Grinder? Sub? Anything outside of NY sounds dopey) The whiz and fried onions give this handheld a nice rounded flavor. Total fan at this point.

So I ate at Dalessandro&apos;s and not my beloved Brooklyn. If you&apos;re passing thru, I highly recommend Dalessandro&apos;s over those punk ass tourist traps."
5,"This has to be my favorite cheesesteak place by far--however I&apos;ve only tried Jim&apos;s, Joe&apos;s and Tony Luke&apos;s. Dalessandro&apos;s does not skimp, will not disappoint, and leave you wishing you ordered more steaks to take home. To preface, my boyfriend Danny has also tried a number of places around Philly but we decided to drop in on the way to New York, from Harrisburg. To all of my friends and Uber drivers who suggested Dalessandro&apos;s to me early on, I apologize for not heeding your words sooner. 

My partner and I typically order the same thing at every cheesesteak joint, steak with grilled onions, mushrooms, and wiz, as our standard of judgement. Just what we prefer, don&apos;t knock us. At Dalessandro&apos;s the onions are not a tiny dice or in slices, but in huge squares, shoved on top of the steak. The steak here is seasoned well, and I know I&apos;ve said the same about other joints but this time I truly mean it! 

Anyway, I won&apos;t give away any more tidbits of taste information so go and see for yourself. One line is for ordering and paying, and the other line is for pick up during COVID times. Be sure to ask the employees which line is the right line for you, as some first time customers do not know which line is which. Smart shoppers will call ahead for pick up to avoid waiting in the long line! I know Danny and I took them to go and stopped in New Jersey and ate them in the front seat of my car. Make sure you steal some napkins if you go this route and bring a knife if you prefer your hoagies cut in half. And don&apos;t forget to order extra to take home."
