5,"Excellent cuisine and ambiance, particularly in the adverse elements presented by COVID.

We tried to dial in a reservation for two on a Thursday night, but not unexpected, we were informed that Zorbas was operating on a first come, first serve policy.

With pleasant evening weather, we lucked out grabbing the last available table, with expanded outdoor seating that extended into street parking on Fairmount Ave. Almost a European vibe.

Our server was quick to uncork the wine (mindful to take sanitary measures) and bring our paper menus. She was attentive throughout the meal and very helpful.

My GF and I split the combination of cold appetizers (essentially different spreads for the warm pita). We loved the roasted eggplant, hummus, and tzatiki sauces. The variety and color of the plate alone was super appealing.

As far as our main entree, we once again elected to share, this time the charcoal sampler for two. Simply outstanding. I am generally one to order anything cooked over a flame/charcoal pit, and this concoction of different meats delivered. The lamp chops, pork and chicken kebabs, shaved gyro, and chicken breasts all had the right ratio of char without losing any juice. The plate was accompanied by rice, potatoes, and other veggies. Plenty of food for leftovers too.

The tab was more than reasonable, and again, compliments to our server during a difficult time for the restaurant industry."
5,"Quick COVID update:  Zorba&apos;s delivery is super fast (about 10 minutes earlier than the predicted 40 mins on a Friday evening in the winter), and the portions are just as large and delicious as they are when dining in.  Pro tip: order early in the evening and make sure you grab a couple dips that can serve as happy hour appetizers, then reheat your main dinner entrees later whenever you&apos;re ready for dinner (no guarantees this works for fish, but we had success with lamb and vegetarian dishes)!"
5,"Oh my gosh! My family&apos;s fave local spot has become one of mine...and I live in Los Angeles! 
My parents live on Fairmount and we went for a casual dinner during epidemic. Zorba&apos;s has tables lining the street at safe distances and we brought our own bottles of vino. The appetizers of hummus and titziki (so) were fabulous and authentically Greek and the meals were fantastic! They were out of the lamb w red sauce but our table had the last 2 of the lamb with white sauce and shrimp dishes. 
Now I see what all the fuss is about! They know my family here so we felt even more special but to be honest, everyone was smiling and treated like family. Service and food worth the quarantine hustle!"
5,"Ask people what restaurant to visit in Fairmount, and chances are they will mention Zorbas. The best greek food I&apos;ve had so far, at reasonable prices and without too much of the fine-dining frills. This place seems like the real deal, with the simple items on the menu tasting incredible. 

My favorites are:

+ The combination of cold appetizers - seriously good, like maybe better than their equivalents at Zahav. I can&apos;t pick a favorite out of the bunch, because they&apos;re all stellar.
+ Imam Baldi - this looks like a straightforward dish, but it is absolutely addictive. Incredibly rich, flavorful and the ingenious use of eggplant"
2,"Not much to write up about this place. During the summer months, you see their entrance lined with tables and people eating outside. The aesthetic hits everything you would want from a restaurant, but the food is less than desirable. Just was not impressed.

They do have an authentic menu, everything is fairly priced, and the portions were good. Just didn&apos;t hit home for me."
4,"Had dinner at Zorba&apos;s last week and it was like eating a good old traditional, homecooked Greek meal. 

My husband and I shared the fried calamari appetizer, and had the grilled octopus and classic roasted leg of lamb as our entrees.

The fried calamari was fantastic. Lightly fried and served with slices of lemon and tomato. The grilled octopus was served at room temp, with a salad taking up half the plate, and salad dressing under it. It was tender but definitely not as amazing as other people say. The classic roasted leg of lamb was tasty and just melts in your mouth. Both entrees came with rice, roasted potatoes and mixed veggies.
 
Prices were fair for the food portions and we were very full from those three dishes. Still we wanted to split a baklava for dessert. Personally I didn&apos;t like the baklava very much. The walnuts weren&apos;t finely chopped but that&apos;s just my preference. My husband thought it was one of the best baklavas he ever had."
4,"Decent spot overall. Nothing negative to say per say, but I didn&apos;t leave there thinking &quot;I love this place and have to go back.&quot; We had the cold appetizer combination which was good for the most part. Wasn&apos;t a fan of two of the dips, but the spicy feta and tzatziki I really liked. We split the lamb dinner for two and enjoyed it."

Zorba&apos;s is a staple to Fairmount fine dining. Reasonably priced for great food, there&apos;s always something exquisite to try or sticking to your regular plate.

Family owned, Zorba&apos;s is as authentic as it gets when it comes to delicious Greek food. I always get the lamb because it&apos;s always perfectly cooked and the sides are just amazing. A baked potato of somekind (I can&apos;t describe it), delicious roasted vegetables, and a slice of tomato will detract your attention from the main entree because it&apos;s just that good.

The appetizers are also really great. You can&apos;t go wrong with the hummus.

To me Zorba&apos;s never gets old and I always get excited when my family goes out to eat here. If you&apos;re in the area for lunch or dinner, you must go to Zorba&apos;s. Plus, how often do you get Greek"
4,Generous portions and flavorful food that fed 5 generously and held up well to delivery
5,"Zorba&apos;s is hands down one of the best authentic Greek spots in Philly! I personally love to dine here al fresco when the weather is nice, but stepping inside being surrounded by photos of my favorite Greek islands isn&apos;t too shabby either. 

Their Fisherman&apos;s Feast is a favorite with my crew. It includes generous portions of filet of salmon, tilapia and rainbow trout. It comes complete with incredible roasted potatoes, rice and delicious stewed veggies! It&apos;s really an entire platter easily split by two hungry folk or a few for grazing. Technically this dish is only available for dinner, but they recently catered to my table during lunch, so just ask! 

Gyros are a specialty, and served traditionally like you find in Mykonos with fries inside! They are absolutely packed but only available for lunch. A fan favorite for sure! 

Don&apos;t forget the baklava! It&apos;s to die for here. Drenched in honey with perfectly crisp flaky layers. Oh em geeeeee!! Even if you&apos;re stuffed, take some to-go! 

Start with the roasted eggplant dip! It&apos;s heavenly. Heavy on the garlic, but oh so delish and served with perfect warm pita!!! (I&apos;m a pita snob). Calamari is said to be a terrific starter as well. 

When I crave and miss Greece, which is very often, this is where I head. Everyone who has been to this Fairmount staple loves it, and everyone I take here for the first time does as well. A crowd pleaser for sure!

It&apos;s on the smaller side so larger parties may potentially be a bit of an issue, but call in advance if it&apos;s a special occasion. The family own joint is super accommodating and friendly. 

Bring those bottles of unmistakable clean, refreshing Greek white or some Ouzo because it&apos;s BYO! 

Parking takes a bit patience, but once you find a spot out front I believe it&apos;s 8 hours unmetered! Score!!"
5,This restaurant has fine food and good atmosphere as well as an excellent location five minutes from the Philadelphia Museum of Art and across the street from a pay parking lot. Pricing per person is $15 per lunch and $40 for dinner.
5,"I recently got takeout from Zorba&apos;s with my partner since we were craving Greek food and it was absolutely delicious and went beyond expectations!! We got the dolmades and caviar dip.  I&apos;ve never had caviar dip before, and it was essentially a creamy dip (made with white bread apparently) that had a really salty taste to it, which went perfectly with the pita bread.  The dolmades were really good, the grape leaves were soft and tangy.  We got as our main dish the lamb sampler, and I&apos;m so happy we got to try a little bit of the different styles of lamb they had.  We opted for a lot of the tomato based sauces, and they were delicious - my personal favorite were the lamb meatballs.  The meat was juicy and cooked to perfection.  To finish everything off, we had baklava as dessert (they were out of the other thing we wanted, which just shows that this place is pretty popular I think!) and it was flaky, buttery, and nutty.  They gave us a huge slice also! I felt like the menu prices were extremely affordable especially with what you&apos;re ordering and how much you&apos;re getting, so I definitely would recommend and will for sure order again in the future!"
5,"We just had a large order delivered to the medical staff at the ICU in the Philadelphia VA Hospital. My dad is being treated for covid19, and we wanted to send them a huge Thank You for taking care of my dad in honor of his birthday today. 

It was really important to me that I chose a place that wasn&apos;t a let down, because I really wanted to show my gratitude to all these selfless and hardworking nurses, doctors, aides, and staff. 

The food was &quot;the absolute best food they&apos;ve ever had delivered to the MICU,&quot; according to one of the nurses, and they probably order-in all the time. 

Thank you, Cathy for taking our large order and even going the extra mile of double checking the delivery contact number the day before delivery to ensure smooth sailing. You don&apos;t know how much sharing a good meal can matter. Thank you for the delicious food and for helping take care of the heroes at the VA Hospital who are taking care of my dad!"
5,"Philly might be known for cheesesteaks but don&apos;t let that stop you from exploring some of the great greek food options here, especially Zorba&apos;s. If you&apos;re new to Philly then that&apos;s even better because Zorba&apos;s is literally right around the corner from the Eastern State Penitentiary, another great stop.

My boyfriend and I both got a gyro sandwich and grilled octopus as our starter. Once you have taste of their octopus, you&apos;ll find yourself craving grilled octopus for days (or maybe I was a bit too obsessed with it). Loved that the gyro sandwich was overloaded with lettuce like some places where you find yourself needing a bib to eat it. Everything was cooked to perfection and was exactly what we were looking for if not more. It&apos;s a bit small inside but that gives it a more authentic feel (: Definitely recommend!"
3,"I really wanted to love Zorba&apos;s! My partner has been talking about this place for a long time and it gets such high ratings on Yelp. We have 2 Greek places within a 5 minute walk of our apartment in Midtown and considering those two places, Zoe&apos;s Kitchen (essentially a Panera for Greek food), and Zorba&apos;s, I would put Zorba&apos;s at the bottom of the list of Greek places I have eaten at. I&apos;m sorry?

We called earlier in the day to make a reservation for 2 for 7:30pm on a Saturday because we wanted to head over to Jack&apos;s Pumpkin Glow after at 9pm. When we called, they asked if 7:45pm was okay. We went with it, however, upon entering the restaurant (albeit a little late), there were plenty of tables open. Maybe it was all just cleaned off, I don&apos;t know. The table was super wobbly, but the waitress helped us get a folded napkin to balance it out and then opened our wine for us when we were sure the surface wouldn&apos;t capsize our glasses.

Not wanting to overdo it and end up with leftovers we&apos;d have to bring through the pumpkin patch with us, we started with tzatziki and ordered an entree each - mixed charcoal grill for one for my partner and meatballs for me.

The bread that arrived first was delicious - warm and fluffy - but the olive oil/vinegar dip had too much vinegar. The tzatziki had a weird zing/kick to it that I wasn&apos;t a fan of. I couldn&apos;t place the spice. My partner liked the meats of the mixed grill but not the sides. I liked the meatballs and the sauce, but also, not the sides. We each got the roasted potatoes, vegetables, and rice - which it seems every dish comes with. The potatoes were complete mush and had a vinegar taste to them that I did not enjoy. The vegetables were also complete mush. The rice was good.

So the meats and bread were yummy, but everything else... Not so much. Overall, really disappointed and not worth making the trip to Fairmount for it. I&apos;ll stick to our local spots in Midtown/Washington Square West."
5,This place is so yummy and authentic! I had a small group of friends and we were able to get a table outside last minute with no reservation! Everything was absolutely delicious! You can never go wrong with BYO either! Definitely check this place out
3,"Sometimes Yelp lets you down.  This was one of those times.  I love Greek food.  I&apos;m a huge fan of dolmades, which is why I make it a point to treat myself out every once in a while at a solid Greek place
Any restaurant that uses canned dolmades is instantly put into my &quot;I&apos;m never coming back category.&quot;  Why?  It&apos;s a STAPLE in Greek fair, and they don&apos;t want to take the time to make it?  It&apos;s sacrilege to not have authentic dolmades.  It would be like going to a Russian restaurant and they served you canned potatoes.  You can&apos;t kick a Russian without a potato falling out.  It&apos;s in their blood! (Lived in Russia, married to a Russian, love Russian food).
Also, they charged $14 to serve me pig anus instead of calamari...  Mmm.  Hard nope.
Service was good.  Souvlaki was tasty.  The chicken was succulent.
But, Zorba!  Why&apos;d you have to do me like that??

$68 for Chicken souvlaki, &quot;calamari&quot;, tzaziki, one Sprite and a shrimp dish."
2,"We got takeout from here three weeks ago, and my skepticism about a Greek place called &quot;Zorba&apos;s&quot; was fulfilled...

The charcoal combo was very dry, except for the couple of sad gyro slices. Salad was generous but basically just tomatoes and cucumbers sliced up with onions. The taramasalata might have had &quot;caviar flavoring&quot; in it, but it lacked the flavor we&apos;re used to from authentic places. Really, everything needed seasoning, and not seasoning meat is as bad as over-cooking it into dryness, as this was...

The rice pudding was dense and chewy and dolmades soft and mushy (switch those up!). Yeah, nothing was all that good, but nothing was terrible and the portions are pretty generous, so let&apos;s say two stars and call it a day."
3,"Very convenient to Eastern State Penitentiary. Setting is quaint and the servers were very nice. All of the food was good. Good in the way going to a friend&apos;s house and his family made dinner and asked you stay kind of good. The meal stuck to your bones, filled you up, was fresh made and warm on a cold day. It made you feel nice to not be hungry, and you had a nice time eating it, sharing space, talking, being comfortable but the meal itself was not memorable. We eat a lot of Greek and Mediterranean food. There&apos;s a lot of fantastic choices where I live which may be why my meal here did not blow my mind. And that&apos;s ok. 3 stars is NOT a bad thing. It&apos;s solidly good, I&apos;d eat it again. I&apos;m just not gonna have dreams about it."
5,"One of my favorite restaurants in fairmount! The food is so healthy and fresh. The staff are friendly, and their service is impeccable. I love the charcoal platter and hummus. I&apos;m so glad they have stayed open during COVID. Truly an authentic Greek spot"
