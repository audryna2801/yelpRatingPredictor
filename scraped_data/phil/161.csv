5,Food was great and pretty original menu items. Beer selection is pretty on point too. Also has a surprising amount of outdoor space thats perfect for covid times.
5,"First timer and absolute lover of the Memphis Taproom! We spent the day walking around Fishtown a few weeks ago and stumbled upon this place. I don&apos;t believe they were offering indoor dining yet, but there are about ten tables outside. 

We only shared the hummus platter, but those roasted chickpeas were addicting! They should serve those like a bowl of nuts :) 

The beer selection was on point. We each had three beers, all different and all stellar. 

I will definitely be back!"
4,"Tons of craft beers, and an original varied menu. They ARE Pet Friendly. Loved the vintage tiled inside areas and really enjoyed the outdoor covered beer garden. If you like craft beer and funky food menu try this place!"
5,"Always a great experience! Beer list is amazing and they also have many spectacular can options, too. 

I am constantly recommending this restaurant to friends and it&apos;s our go to spot when anyone visits. 

The fried chicken sandwich, the chicken fried chicken, the Mac and cheese and the coconut club are fantastic! 

If you are someone that enjoys &quot;local&quot; restaurants/pubs/bars- Memphis tap is for you. Very casual environment for craft beer drinkers and anyone looking for meal that will wow you!"
4,"Nice variety of beer, yummy bites, and outdoor seating open to dogs. Unfortunately, our waiter was basically a &quot;too cool to care&quot; skaterboy donning an apron who couldn&apos;t bother to tell us the happy hour specials or even look us in the eye when we spoke. 

Maybe he was gazing off into the distance contemplating the meaning of life."
5,"There are very few bars out there that I find to deliver a consistent well rounded experience while offering something new in the process. But every time that I make my seldom traveled journey to Memphis Taproom, I find myself coming across exactly that.

I shouldn&apos;t be too surprised since I&apos;ve had similar experiences in other bars that Leigh Maida and Brendan Hartranft have opened like Local 44, Strangelove&apos;s, and the gone too soon Resurrection Ale House. But Memphis is the place that started it all for them, and the less traveled for me since it&apos;s always the furthest away from where I&apos;ve lived. But every time I&apos;m in the area I visit and discover something new that adds on to their greatness!

During my first visit I enjoyed their amazing happy hour which featured discounted drafts, and solid food bites like their trio of incredible deviled eggs. On top of that it gave me my first preview of their incredible beer list which regularly features the likes of Captain Lawrence, Tired Hands, Tonewood, and a ton of rare beer releases.

during my next visit I was able to grab a fuller sample of their menu options, which includes a ton of vegetarian and vegan options that rival most meat ones. the roasted mushroom grinder is a delicious mix of sharp provolone, garlic mayo, and cherry peppers. add in other options like a quinoa chickpea burger with smoked coconut and harissa mayo, and old bay jackfruit cakes with pineapple salsa, and veggies shine throughout. But carnivores will also enjoy the Mighty Memphis Burger with aged cheddar and fried kielbasa, or chicken fried chicken with mac and cheese and habanero mustad sauce.

Toss in a consistent mix of awesome beer events, and a kick ass outdoor beer garden when the weather is warm, and there&apos;s plenty to enjoy!"
2,"Came here on a Sunday at noon. There were a couple of tables with people seated and the one guy&apos;s eggs looked really good.

We were quickly seated and asked for our drink order. Both people I was with agreed that the coffee tasted burnt. 

Mighty Memphis Burger $12.75 - order it medium rare but felt like it was more well done. The couple pieces of fried kielbasy in the bbq sauce with the aged cheddar was good. Totally forgot about the crispy shallot until looking at the menu now because they didn&apos;t have a strong taste. The way the burger buns were cooked made it a bit .. chewy(?) for me.

Beer Battered Kosher Dill $7 - not a fan of the really oily batter. The horseradish buttermilk dip it came with was good though."
5,"Love this neighborhood bar. They have a wide selection of beer (and some other drinks but I come here for the beer) and a great food menu. Our fave apps are the fried pickles and the cheesesteak pierogies. For a meal, my go-to is usually the Mr. American cheeseburger (consistently juicy), and my 2nd fave is the McMemphis chicken sandwich; also their fries are bomb. They do have a few vegetarian options too which is nice considering the menu isn&apos;t very big. Staff is also super friendly, we love bringing friends here when they visit. So glad they&apos;re having outdoor dining again since some of the restrictions lifted!!"
5,Love this place!! Their food is awesome and their specials rock my socks!! Try their Cauliflower appetizer and their coconut club sandwich. Very Vegan Friendly.
3,"This place is very cool! Great outside area and cute inside, a little dark though. Good can/draft selection but I didn&apos;t receive a cocktail menu. Food was pretty good too."
4,"Nice cozy vibe, very friendly waitstaff. Packed on a Friday night. Constantly rotating tables. Long list of beer selections and wide range of types. Our IPA was outstanding, the amber ale so-so. A couple kegs of the better beer selections kicked. 

Our party had both the Memphis burger and what I think was the Classic burger. Both came as ordered, medium, slightly pink in the middle. Nice!  Both were overpowered though by the toppings. At times wondering if the burger was the side to the toppings. Burger meat itself was ok, not outstanding. Couldn&apos;t taste much flavor, but might have been because of the toppings. Fries were decent; Thin (which is ok) somewhat flavorful, but not that crispy and quickly became soggy and/or stiff.  Chicken vindaloo soup a bit salty. 

We&apos;ll come back again for the great atmosphere and the beers; but probably try other food selections."
5,"Casual evening with my family and some truly delicious food and beer!  I had to try the smoked coconut club because where else was I ever going to get smoked coconut!  It was ridiculously good!  Coconutty bacony with lemon garlic tofu and tomato herb mayo.  My Founders KBS 2016 cask was a perfect addition.  Other dishes declared delicious we&apos;re the cauliflower Mac and cheese, the slow roasted pork sandwich, and the mighty Memphis burger.  Service and attention to my food allergies was beyond reproach.  Please eat here and make sure this place stays open! No pics as the lighting was dim and they didn&apos;t come out!"
3,"Even though it&apos;s in my neighborhood it&apos;s my first time here. It&apos;s a craft beer bar and I&apos;m  not a beer drinker. The place still has the old corner bar look which is cool. There&apos;s an outside area but it was too hot so we chose to sit inside. I called to get some info before we went. The person who answered was a little rude and condescending.
There&apos;s not a cocktail list- a little disappointing but it&apos;s a beer bar. Although they did say they had a full bar. Our waitress was new so she didn&apos;t know a lot about the drinks. Another waitress was able to answer some questions about the drinks.  It took a little effort to find out if they could make a traditional old-fashioned and the prices. Drinks were reasonably priced between $7-9. The old fashioned was good. 
The food was good. We started with the fried pickles. They were dill pickles with a tempura batter.  I had a pork sandwich. The pork was flavorful with cheese and spinach on a round roll. Sandwiches came with fries. The fries weren&apos;t hot so we had to send them back. The Port Richmond platter with pierogi, kielbasa and sauerkraut was good. Portions were average. 
There was only 1 dessert so we opted out. 
Service was ok with typical hipster servers, not very friendly. The restaurant wasn&apos;t crowded at all."
4,"I really like that they have inside dining as well as outside options that seemingly can be used in all weathers (their patio is covered). For a Saturday night the place was pretty empty, aside from my party and one other sitting at the outside benches, (I guess t as pretty late, their kitchen closes at 11pm) but we still enjoyed our time there. 

My boyfriend and I started off with the Cayenne Onion Rings with Habanero Cream Sauce and out of the kitchen came a mound of crispy onion straws, which wasn&apos;t what we were expecting, but different in a good way. 

I got the Slow Roast Pork Sandwich (sharp prov, baby spinach, and garlic mayo) and my boyfriend got the McMemphis Chicken Sandwich (Korean Fried Chicken, Gochujang, lettuce, pickles, garlic mayo, on a long roll) and my boyfriends sandwich really stole the show. They both came with a heaping helping of fries, but the roast pork was just okay. It really needed a sauce to go with it, the garlic mayo wasn&apos;t enough for all of the meat involved. The McMemphis was amazing. I&apos;ve only ever heard of Gochujang sauce from Diners Drive-Ins and Dives, and it lived up to the hype. It was sweet and spicy and all that jazz.

I also really appreciate the fact that Memphis has a good number of Veg/Vegan options so that anyone can eat something good here and feel included."
4,"Great place with great food and vibe! 
Had after work dinner with a buddy and this place just got it! Nice outside seating (like tent) and slightly confusing and narrow alley-like interior area. We had fish and chips which was extremely moist and full of fresh fish flavor steaming hot and their chicken fried chicken was not dry, tasty without being too salty with nice sauce and well-paired mac n cheese. 

Server lady was pleasant and courteous with her recommendations as she took our beer orders and she did this awesome thing- she told us that we should save some room because the Jewish Apple pie just came out ... she said it before we asked for dessert menu so it was just a natural and unforced remark. I ended up having that Jewish Apple cake which was every bit delicious as she said, so I complimented her on &quot;salesmanship&quot; saying it was ingenious! Haha, we had good laugh over it! 

Only thing - I got murdered by desperado commando mosquitoes while eating... I think it was their last hurrah because ... yeah it was bad. I was scratching n slapping my arms and legs from halfway point ... not very gracefully. So those with delicious blood like me... stay in!"
4,"The wings were very scrumptious, the beers were crisp and the atmosphere was light-hearted.

I highly suggest you try this place out!"
4,"We stopped by Memphis Taproom for happy hour yesterday. Happy hour runs from 4-7pm , and includes a small selection of beers and wine at a discounted price. We also shared a huge plate of onion rings (the shoe string kind not the thick cut ones). The food is your typical bar fare but they do have a large selection of beers and the staff was really nice and helpful."
4,"I&apos;ve only been to Memphis Taproom for their stellar beer events, and yes, I know- I&apos;m missing out on the food.

They brought Wicked Weed in forces during Beer Week 2017 and were one of the coveted bars to receive a case of Heady Topper in Winter 2018. Their taps are always on point. If you like KBS, try it on cask. 

Any bar can have the goods, and be jerks about it. Memphis Taproom stands out for its service and beer love. Without detailing the full story, they took none for the team on Heady Topper day where other bars could&apos;ve caused a scene. 

I have had some appetizers, but I really want to get my feet wet with the menu. I see many more trips to Memphis in my future."
4,"Little hidden Philadelphia Craft beer gem located in the Kensington neighborhood.  Not only was I impressed with the selection on tap, the extended vegan portions of the menu were also well a pleasant surprise to my more health conscience compatriots.

The bartender had a busy Friday going on but still made time to explain some of the more unique options they had on their extensive menu.  No surprises here of you have read my reviews but I went with burger.  &quot;The Mighty Memphis Burger&quot; stood out on the menu as a need to try.  One Year Aged Cheddar, Fried Kielbasy, Crispy Shallots, and Bbq Sauce on a soft bun.  The Kielbasy was chopped up and mixed into the sauce, this made for an even distribution of the flavors and beat my expectation for inventiveness.  

They also have a lovely little outside area and with the weather about to turn will be filling up on the weekends."
5,"I&apos;ve been coming here for several years. The food is consistently good (with good veg options for those who need them). Service is usually good to very good. Beer on tap is always varied and interesting.

Probably my favorite thing to get here is their chickpea burger. I think this is my favorite house-made veggie burger I&apos;ve had anywhere in the world (I make it a point to try them whenever I travel). It&apos;s just done so well, with excellent texture and flavor.

Also, an honorable mention to the coconut club sandwich. It&apos;s very tasty. Getting coconut to taste similar to bacon is pretty dang neat."
