5,"We came here with friends on a Saturday morning. The friends were passing through town and we wanted some vegan food that consisted of hot drinks and tasty breakfast. 
This place was wonderful. We ordered online and our food and drinks are ready to go when we got there. And because of Covid we are able to get outside in the nearby neighborhood park. I got the BLAT sandwich. It was both tasty and refreshing and I also got the turmeric golden latte was so milk and it was warm and delicious as well. I had ginger in it but it&apos;s definitely stood out to me as someone else is trying to like ginger but thinks it is spicy. 

I can&apos;t wait to come back here next time. It&apos;s definitely a new vegan Philly favorite for me. I highly recommend. 

Pros: great breakfast food selection, great hot drinks selection, excellent online ordering system!"
5,"I stopped in this weekend to get a quick treat to enjoy in Dickinson Park since the weather is still so nice out. I had the Golden Latte with Oatmilk and a Philly Muffin with jam. I have heard great things about all their food but I just wanted something simple. The Golden Latte is superb, it has a nice spicyness that I couldn&apos;t get enough of. 

Currently everything is order on the web and pick up at the pickup window. I didn&apos;t know this so I ordered from my phone while I was outside and once I got my order in it was up within minutes."
5,My absolute favorite vegan cafe! I have yet to try something from Grindcore that isn&apos;t amazing! Some of my absolute favorites are: Sandwiches- Italiano and the BLAT! Baked goods- zucchini bread! Drink- chai latte with whip! In response to the pandemic you now order online and pickup outside of the cafe. You can even schedule an order ahead of time! They have made take out super easy!
1,"I walked here to grab my boyfriend &amp; I a cup of coffee - the front door is blocked off by chairs &amp; rope to stop people from coming in (understandable, I guess, since it is a smaller coffee shop &amp; they don&apos;t want people coming inside due to covid but kind of unwelcoming). Anyway, when I walked up the woman working opens the front door, I say &quot;Good morning, I&apos;ll have one large coffee -&quot; and I&apos;m interrupted by &quot;YOU HAVE TO ORDER ONLINE&quot;. I say, &quot;okay, do you take cash?&quot; she abruptly answers &quot;NO&quot;. The overall experience was just unpleasant &amp; I felt like I was almost bothering the employees by showing up &amp; trying to order a coffee.

I understand there are precautions due to everything going on, however, why do I need to login to a website, create an account, &amp; enter my credit card information to order two plain coffees? And why am I treated so rudely?"
5,"This place was one of my &quot;must go to&quot; stops when visiting philly overnight and I was not disappointed at all. Everything is order online and take out here but they made it super easy and were fast! Even with the traffic making us late to pick up everything was still hot! The grizzli breakfast sandwich was the best vegan breakfast sandwich I&apos;ve ever had, I miss it already. I have t had a brownie since going vegan two years ago and this one was just how I remember them! You&apos;ve never know it was vegan and it was super fresh and soft still. I also got a &quot;swamp thing&quot; coffee which wasn&apos;t as minty as I expected but from someone who doesn&apos;t like coffee, I enjoyed it. Def making sure I always come here every time I visit."
5,"I absolutely love this place in and out. Currently it offers take out/curbside pick up with a large variety of options to order online, from coffee drinks, with probably one of the largest milk choices I have seen, baked goods, amazing sandwiches, cakes to bulk purchases. This is a staple of good coffee, the tastiest vegan baked treats, and really healthy sandwiches; and you get the amount of ingredients you are supposed to get, never shortchanged. I sincerely recommend it as a customer who&apos;s been going to this place for few years now. Also, separate thank you for a dog treat to every doggie with any purchase. Woof!"
5,"The Grindcore House is a neighborhood vegan and vegetarian coffee shop that serves sandwiches, salads and baked goods at reasonable prices.  The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is relaxing.  The only downside is the loud heavy metal music. I will definitely go back and try them again."
4,"So this is a cute little coffee shop with quality coffee, and plenty of seating. There is window bar seating at the front and more tables and a couch in the back. The service was good enough. The four stars is because the punk rock music they were playing is just really not my vibe. So of course that influences whether or not I will be returning. 

I probably won&apos;t return, but depending on your music tastes this could be the perfect work spot for you. If I lived in this neighborhood I would definitely grab my coffee from here in the mornings!"
5,"Thanks to yelp for suggesting Grindcore House. A very unique environment. Really tasty and healthy. I became great friends with the staff, who are all wonderful and super courteous. Bon appetite."
4,"Nice little corner cafe/coffee shop. Vegan friendly galore. They have a goth/heavy metal vibe but it&apos;s not overbearing or creepy. 

Ordered the Greenwich added seitan on everything bagel. The taste was good and price was okay ~$8. 

Good menu for vegan sandwich options, I&apos;ll have to try them out. 

My one gripe is, I probably should&apos;ve gotten a different bread base. The bagel was too small to hold it all together and I had to eat it separate vs sandwich style. Next time I go I&apos;ll ask for a different kind and see if it&apos;s a better experience! Otherwise don&apos;t eat on the go and get napkins!"
5,"I love this place! It&apos;s busy but not too busy. We ordered the Kropotkin sandwich with Tofurky, a whole grain everything bagel with scallion cream cheese, an oat milk mocha, an oat milk chai latte and a cream cheese coffeecake slice. 

We loved the kropotkin sandwich! It was delicious with the roasted peppers and the creamy pesto veganaise. It had a strong pickle taste. We had it on sourdough but next time we wanna try it on pumpernickel bread! The bagel with the scallion cream cheese was insanely good too. The cream cheese was super thick and creamy. The cream cheese coffeecake was super delicious too. We loved the brown sugar flavor with the creamy filling. The drinks were excellent and beautiful! 

We had to get a hot chocolate and a blueberry coffeecake too. They were both excellent. I will definitely be back!"
4,I had some time to kill before my appointment in the area so I made my way to the nearest coffee shop. This place is unique and true to its name. My caramel latte basically was art. I love the local places with great staff and beautiful crafted beverages. I will always support a local business! Thank you for the wonderful latte.
5,"This place never disappoints!! Got the best sandwiches and latte from here today. Service was very quick and friendly. 
I got the golden latte and it was literally the best thing I&apos;ve ever had. Not too sweet but just right. 
Lots of vegan places are only doing takeout on weekends during the pandemic so when I saw that grindcore is open during the week I was so happy!
For anyone wondering about pandemic safety- they do follow guidelines well- wearing masks, etc when handling food and passing the food to you for takeout. THANK YOU GRINDCORE"
4,"This is a wonderful find in this part of the town. We were at target when we started feeling the hunger pangs and coffee craving. Quick yelp search showed us this place not too far away. 

For food, it&apos;s completely vegan. We ordered the klopotkin with tofurkey and it was quite nice. For coffee, they have plenty non dairy options for the milk. I ordered the chai tea latte and husband ordered the mocha latte, both with macadamia milk. His drink was a lot better than mine. They have plenty of dessert options as well, but I didn&apos;t try any. 

They have plenty of seating in the back. They have books, including books for children that you can borrow and read while you&apos;re there. Their choice of music is kind of funky. They were constantly playing hard rock? Gothic? Well something on those lines. Free WiFi is a plus if you&apos;re looking to come work from this place."
5,"Perfect coffee house because it&apos;s 100% VEGAN. Great setup for seating individuals taking breakfast or brunch alone, with friends, or even a family with a bunch of children like mine.  They have a shelve of animal rights &amp; anarchy related reading materials in the back. I think they hold events like independent film screenings here (?) but have not personally attended any.  That might also have been a one-off thing I heard about. ... Anyway! The coffee is delicious, the sandwiches are on point, but the vegan donuts are what draws us most. SO many choices that they change up regularly. The donuts are pricy but considering the alternative (no donuts) it&apos;s acceptable for special occasions. ... there&apos;s a nice playground around the corner making this an ideal stop for a vegan mom grabbing coffee and donuts, then wanting a place for her children to burn off some of their sugar rush. 

YES kid friendly"
5,"I hardly ever leave reviews, but I think Grindcore House deserves it. I took the trip from Conshohocken to get a Sunday quarantine lunch, and picked the Seitan Sammy. It was perfect! The flavors are wonderfully salty but so perfectly balanced with a vegan aioli type sauce and the best ratio of pickle to sandwich there ever was. 10/10 would recommend. The bread was really fresh, flavorful and toasted super well, and it was the perfect amount of bread to sandwich filling. I also ordered a chai latte with oat milk because I was feeling sassy -- it was not only delicious but I so very much appreciated that it didn&apos;t taste overly ladened with sugar like you might encounter at Starbucks. I&apos;m not vegan, but I can&apos;t wait to hopefully take my friends and family here one day. Keep it up, GCH!"
5,"Friendly staff good coffee and I like the selection of creamers and agave 

On my first visit the kropotkin is what I was told may have been the most popular.  While it was good as a carnivore it definitely had me wanting for meat lol 

I&apos;ve been here maybe a dozen times plus since I&apos;ve moved to south Philly.  The main reason is cos it&apos;s such a close walk but also cos the the friendly staff and the coffee is good.  

Only had the everything bagel once with the jalapeño cream cheese.  I wish I got the ghost pepper cream cheese when it was available since I love spicy foods but didn&apos;t know it was seasonal so I guess I&apos;ll wait for it next season lol. Guess early morning I just against my nerm didn&apos;t have the balls to just go with the ghost pepper. 

Emma&apos;s delight with the tofurkey slices is good and Better with added avocado but the best of the lot is easily the seitan sandwich with the pickles and mustard. 
Vegan or not it&apos;s a fucking good sandwich and so far the best this place has to offer for me. 

Still need to try the carver, Greenwich n the salad but hard to say no to the seitan sandwich which seems to be the employees consensus fave for good reason.  

I&apos;m glad to know this reliable spot is so close by and will be back and try to try the other stuff I may not like as much ha"
5,"I love vegan coffeeshops. I love vegan coffeeshops with incredible and diverse selections of tea even more.
Grindcore offers both.
Came here with a friend yesterday and we got a bagel with &quot;cream cheese&quot; and zucchini bread to share. For drinks, she got a cinnamon almond chai latte with hazelnut syrup while I got a coconut chai latte with marshmallow syrup. Both were DELICIOUS!
Grindcore has a very interesting ambience. Very pro-activist and heavy metal. Personally find it to be a better place for conversation than studying (unless you can concentrate with heavy metal playing in the background) but this place has a good amount of seating. Friendly staff!
Will definitely come back!"
5,"Holy shit this place was amazing. My first try of macadamia nut mylk and I&apos;m obsessed. Their cream cheese coffee cake was also amazing, I inhaled it in seconds. Definitely stop by, try a Danish! I wish I had."
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting a hoagie since becoming vegan about 4 years ago. I finally made it to grind house today. I ordered the Italiano and it was delicious!! I also had a blueberry muffin which was good a little dry but good. Also, the service was excellent and the staff were very friendly and welcoming! I will definitely be returning for another Italiano soon."
