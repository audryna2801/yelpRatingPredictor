5,"So easy to order online for pickup Actually easier getting a pizza than before Covid 
I ordered online for a 530 pickup, put in my credit card info and done! There&apos;s an option to tip which I didn&apos;t notice before paying. I sent an email asking if I could tip at pick up. They answered within the hour. ( yes you can!) worked out because I prefer to tip in cash. Pizza was ready when I got there. 
The pizza is excellent. We had 2 margarita pies. It fed 5 with a few left over slices. The crust is crisp with a tangy sweet sauce. While some margharita pies are chintzy with the cheese, these had a good The crust was a little soggy when reheated but still tasted good! 
I have to say $22 is a lot for a pizza but it was definitely a good pie. 
Note: GPS took me to Front St I&apos;m glad I knew where Lee St is. Coming North on Front, make a right on Thompson. It&apos;s the first small street. You can park on Thompson and walk the 1/4 block up."
5,"Came here for Valentines Day dinner and was very impressed! The place is kind of hard to find as it&apos;s in an alley but the pizza is amazing!! The service is all contactless which made it quick and easy and they still had servers coming around answering any questions.  The place has a local authentic feel to it.  We got the tomato pie to start and raved about it so much the waiter gave us a huge complimentary slice to go.  The onion pizza was our favorite because the onions were sweet and the the crust was cooked perfectly.  The sauce is very flavorful and more on the sweeter side.  The meat pizza we ordered had a ton of meat on it that was fully loaded.  The pizza is reasonably priced for being homemade.  If you&apos;re around the fish town area and craving pizza, this is the place to go!"
5,"On our first attempt to order from Pizza Beddia, we were informed sadly on the day of the order was cancelled due to an employee tested positive for COVID.  We greatly appreciate the restaurant being upfront about the situation. 

We decided to make another attempt and placed an order yesterday. I had heard about the seasonal mushroom pizza and had been craving it. The seasonal mushroom pizza included oyster, shiitake, and Cremini mushrooms, garlic oregano cream, porcini powder, mozzarella and royer mountain cheese. While my love for mushroom is great, I felt like the pizza was lacking in flavor. I found myself choosing a second slice of the angry pizza over the mushroom pizza. The angry pizza consists of Thai chilies, tomato sauce, mozzarella, fresh Basil and pickled serranos. The sauce was delicious. The spiciness gave it a nice kick. Be warned have a drink nearby. The crust on both pizza was crusty and the style of pizza is thin crust."
5,"Loved pizza beddia. I&apos;m a huge thin crust person, and this definitely met my expectations. We got the number 1 pizza, it was two types of cheese and sauce. The globs of cheese were so good!! I loved how thin and crispy the crust was as well. The best part of the pizza for me though was the sauce, which really makes or breaks the flavor of pizza. Definitely recommend if you&apos;re in Philly.

The entrance is down the small alley, which was kind of hard to find with gps."
4,"I can&apos;t believe my last review was 2015, back when they only made 40 pies a day.. now there&apos;s a newly transformed space that is covid-friendly for the times (pexi glass between tables, spaced and follow social distancing, masks on all staff, and contactless ordering system via QR code)

For a party of 4 that ordered 2 pies, tomato pie, roasted veggies, 2 desserts and 2 rounds of alcohol our bill including tip came to about $190. 

Our friends ordered the pie and added anchovies, they loved their pie. We ordered the roasted potato pie and it was delicious. The olives were nice and salty and added a lot of flavor and texture to the pie, great crust too. We enjoyed everything we ordered, including the soft serve ice cream and service was great. 

Overall, I would recommend Beddia, it&apos;s worth a visit but personally for me it&apos;s a once in a while rotation as the prices are a bit steeper than the many great pizza establishments that Philly has to offer. But it&apos;s a great treat and place to bring guests!"
5,"Stop the fight. Stop the rankings. Stop what you&apos;re doing RIGHT NOW. BEDDIA is it. It&apos;s the best pizza in Philly. Hands down. Order a day in advance on their site and you&apos;ll have it no problem next day. Don&apos;t wait as their pies run out early. 

What we snagged:
-Plain with pepperoni. SO solid. The pepperoni is large and in charge with sweet/spicy flavor. The crust on this one was crunchy AF. 
-Angry Pie. Get it and you&apos;ll be the happiest camper this side of the Mississippi. The flavor profile on here is to die for. The peppers (with seeds) give it a LOT of heat. I&apos;m pretty sure I was sweating through my hair, but it was well worth it&apos;s so damn good. 

Overall, 8.3/10. Solid pies and will 100% be headed back. Make your stop there early and often. Roughly 65$ for two pies. Heavy on the price, but heavy on the flavor in return."
5,"I ordered an angry pizza and a seasonal summer corn pizza to go a few weeks ago, planning to eat it on my roof with a nice glass of wine. But my car smelled like tomatoes and cheese and I was literally salivating, so I ended up eating most of my meal out of open pizza boxes in the passenger seat of my car!
Although the atmosphere of my meal was a bit cramped (my fault, I admit), the pizza was delish! The angry pizza was MAYBE too spicy for me, so I ended up picking off a few of the peppers, but the arrabbiata sauce was to die for. The corn pizza was the perfect creamy and slightly sweet juxtaposition to the other spicy one. The crusts of both pizzas were perfectly thin and crisp, and the cheese was melty and beautiful. 
Will I be ordering from here again? Definitely. Will I be able to resist temptation, and wait to eat it at home? Can&apos;t guarantee that."

Overpriced
Oversalted

Been wanting to try Beddia for some time now after hearing that it was the &quot;best&quot; pizza America.  Ordered a number 1 with pepperoni and sausage.  First impression, way too salty. Don&apos;t know it was the toppings or the sauce. They put way too much sauce on the thin pie.  The crust was nice and crispy. $30.00 for the pie and they want $1.50 for basil? Really?!?
Pie was good, not great. 
Angelos over Beddia any day."
4,"The Holy Grail of Pizza&apos;s? Not quite.

What is unique about there pies is they use olive old and oil gold, also milk cheese mozzerella. This gives off well a distinct oily taste. The charred crust is done very nicely and the back side of one of there slices I took a picture of below as it was very delectable.

Being this was my first experience here I did not want to get fancy and order there pie of the day which was a creamed corn pizza pie. After speaking with some in the Yelp community I have learned the way to go is to actually order there pie of the day so thats my fault but I am not running back as this is not in my area and I refuse to pay $7 again to deliever a pie to my door.

The pepperoni pizza was good but for $26 I would not return to order what is named Number 1 pie on their menu.

Funny enough I went to order from Pizza Plus before choosing Pizza Beddia and there website was not working and the personal pan pies there looked dynamite....another time perhaps but after eating quite a few pies in the last couple weeks I think it is finally time to take a break from the pie eating.

As always people SYOY!!!"
4,"This pizza lives up to the hype.  The dough is crusty and chewy with a great flavor (expect it to be a bit charred).  The tomato sauce tastes fresh and the cheese to sauce ratio is perfect.  The online ordering is really easy, but fair warning that there could be a long wait time.  We ordered on a Sunday evening and had to wait over 2 hours for our pizza to be ready.  Make sure you follow the directions to pick up on Lee Street (small alley)."
5,"I&apos;ve been to Pizzeria Beddia twice in the past year, and immediately became a fan on the first visit. Now, with COVID-19 restrictions, I put in an order for pickup. 

Beddia has a good pick-up arrangement. Orders, clearly labeled, are placed on a table in an area opening out to the entrance way, so you don&apos;t go inside. We arrived about 4 minutes late, and there was the order (they forgot the side of anchovies, but no problem - we didn&apos;t intend to order them, were only $3). Apparently you add &quot;side orders&quot; to the pizza or portions thereof. As I was leaving, someone came out (masked) to make sure I was able to locate my order okay. 

At first, it seemed that the online ordering (the toasttab.com link from the Beddia website) was not working, so I made repeated attempts. (I don&apos;t know if this was a routine, recurring problem, or just something temporary and transient - in any event, persistence paid off!) 

The Number One Pizza (the usual mozzarella and &quot;old gold&quot; pie), with mushrooms, was the usual excellence - thin crusted, with the crust just a bit charred. Not as good after being in the box for a time as it would have been right out of the oven - but it&apos;s still a Beddia pizza. Judion beans, too. Great flavor, and so creamy. And since this was a special occasion, we ordered the 2017 Montesecondo Chianti Classico DOCG. I was concerned that the wine would be really warm by the time we got home, but in fact to my surprise, it had been refrigerated, and really needed to warm up before drinking. A little touch of Olde South Philly! Very satisfying chianti with the pizza."
4,"I am so excited Pizzeria Beddia has finally opened up for takeout orders. And I wish they would continue to do this even after the pandemic is over.
 
I love all their pizzas but reservations for this place are impossible for normal dinner hours, and I am not a fan of walking in and waiting 45-90 minutes for a table to free up. 

Currently, they are taking pre-orders for pickup 7 days a week. You can call anytime from 10am to 5pm to place your order, and pick up the orders between the hours of 3-8pm. I would advise to plan ahead because if you&apos;re ordering pizza for the day of, especially on a weekend, they could be sold out for the day."
4,"Have heard so much praise regarding Pizzeria Beddia obviously like many others have. Definitely one of the best pizzas I&apos;ve ever tasted. I would say it&apos;s the 2nd best in philly, but overall really solid pizza to try. Sauce was nice and rich and the cheese didnt overshadow the pizza like you get at many other pizza spots. Crust was good, wasnt like crunchy but it was still solid pizza. When you come to a place like this be prepared to pay because its popular and theres high praise. Was this pizza better at one point in time?
Possibly, many would say the owner had sold out. But regardless it&apos;s still excellent pizza to try out."
5,"Came here to pick up 2 large pizza&apos;s.
One was plane and one was pepperoni. Both were delicious and fresh. Order process was fast , convenient and easy."
5,"Alright, leaving an update here for the hoagie room experience. 

Wow was this worth it. Yes, it is expensive - BUT such a fun and unique experience. I went with a group of coworkers (pre-COVID) and when you enter the small back room you&apos;re offered a choice of a Negroni or Old Fashioned. We all went with the Negroni and then the appetizers began coming out - tomato pie, focaccia, white beans, sardines, I think they brought out at least one of everything on the menu. 

You also order a selection of pies. From what I remember it was around 4 for the group of us and we were able to pick from the menu and their specials. After that, you get the hoagie courses. You get a vegetarian, tuna, and italian hoagie. I wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the tuna hoagie, but at this point you&apos;re stuffed and there&apos;s more than enough food to go around. 

I think the best part is that each one of us went home with leftovers. They gave us the leftover fresh rolls that weren&apos;t used for the hoagies as well as the remaining pizza slices. All in all, such a great night and a fun way to celebrate a special occasion or nothing at all!"
5,"Delicious! I had their summer corn pizza and it was divine. We picked it up to bring back home to eat, and I tried a bite in the car. Took all the willpower to not devour the whole pizza in the car! This is a thin crust pizza, and it really lets you appreciate all the flavor of the sauce, corn, cheese, pesto. YUM!"
5,"Everything could not have been more perfect. The food, the extra steps they take in safety and sanitization and the company. :) Their spicy pizza, the anchovies(we couldn&apos;t help but dig in as soon as they came out as a side so there are only 3 pictured haha), and the focaccia all were so goood. Their wine selection is also intriguing and I cannot wait to go back and try the other wines/dishes. Would definitely recommend."
1,Dreadful service and terrible first impression. Ordered dinner and did not received order or response to inquiries about it. We waited nearly three hours while the business was still open and got nada. Can&apos;t support and won&apos;t encourage friends or family too either.
3,"This place is pretty trendy, but not totally worth all the hype.

The worst pasty of this experience is that they make you wait in a cold patio area with barely any heaters to be effective. They&apos;ll periodically come out to ask for your name. It seems like every other restaurant but Beddia has figured out an efficient texting system to inform when you&apos;re table is ready...

The first time I ate here, they sat us in the back room which definitely is awarded the worst seat in the house. This time, we were seated in the middle room with shared tables. The downside of this area is being a part of every one else&apos;s conversation.

None of the appetizers are anything to write home about. The pizza is definitely good, but I&apos;m certain I&apos;ve had better elsewhere."
5,"Updated review - they kindly reached out and offered a replacement pizza. I got this pizza (a number one) for carryout and was able to get it home within 10 minutes, so I&apos;m convinced that delivery was the issue last time. This pizza tasted incredible, the crust was crispy yet chewy, and the cheese was perfect in flavor/texture. I am now a beddia convert, and really appreciated the great customer service!"
