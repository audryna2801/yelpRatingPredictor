5,"National Mechanics is really terrific. The cost is perfectly affordable as well. National Burger is very delightful. Good food. I became good friends with the staff, who are all amazing and super courteous. We can not wait to go back."
4,"We were in town for a business meeting and were looking for a quick dinner for 6.

They had a good selection and a nice neighborhood bar/restaurant feel.

It was a good dinner with a helpful staff.

Enjoy"
4,"I stopped in here for a late lunch during the week and basically had the place to myself.  The inside was dark, with stained glass windows, exposed brick walls and old hardwood floors and had nice decor.  I sat in one of the several old church pews they have along the wall.  The bar area looks nice, clean and inviting.  The staff was friendly and prompt.  

The lunch menu had a nice variety of options and it was hard to choose just one item.  My server suggested a Roast Pork Sandwich for a first timer.  The sandwich comes with Provolone, spinach and longhots on a baguette with au jus for $14.  The sandwich was a decent portion size and came cut in half with a nice helping of great looking hand cut fries.  The flavor profile of the sandwich was nice and it was well put together.  The baguette was fresh and the pork was nicely spiced and moist.   

Their craft beer menu, although small had a nice variety of styles and was a bit IPA heavy which is expected.  The cocktail menu looked interesting and well thought out.

The bathroom was clean and featured a crazy piped/Dr. Seuss style faucet.  

I would return here and enjoyed my lunch/visit.
Thanks guys!"
4,"Newest Fan of National Mechanics..this place has a cool vibe; great service and even better food!  I started out with the frisky sour drink special as we waited for our food!  This was a good call on my part..drink was well balanced with flavor and nice amount of alcohol!

The wings are so delicious and my friend love her burger! We were so full because we wanted to order the &apos;Pretzel&apos;, but that is for the next visit!

The server was attentive and made good recommendations!"
5,"You can&apos;t go wrong here. The drinks, food and service are all wonderful. Stop in for lunch with Patrick and Dillon for the friendliest and fastest service. Or, stop in at night for a wonderfully priced happy hour and some music. No matter your vibe, national mechanics is the spot. 

Some of my favorites: 
- lunch: beyond burger with onion rings, french onion soup and chessboard, crispy chicken salad, Big Pretzel 
- happy hour: Mac and cheese"
5,"Decided to try this place out for brunch last weekend and it was a lucky strike! The food and Bloody Mary bar were amazing and overall we had an excellent dining experience! Definitely coming back for the Bloody Mary bar since I got a mimosa this time. 

The Bloody Mary came with a shrimp skewer grilled to perfection and was so aesthetically pleasing! I&apos;ve never seen any other restaurant do this, so it definitely made the experience unique!"
4,"Da Bank! Yea pretty cool. Watch your step up and down. 
Quiet Sunday night after Eagles choked in Miami. 
But I digress...
Good beer selection and great bar food. I settled on the roast pork sandwich which did not disappoint. Fries were fresh and crisp. 
Could have not served the dipping juice cold but still a solid bite. 
I&apos;ll be back!"
5,"Of all the restarants we visited while in Philadelphia, National Mechanics was our favorite.

We walked from our hotel near Independence Hall.  This is easy to find, just down the street from the Museum of the American Revolution. This bar has a fun, funky historical vibe.  We easily found two seats at the bar.  We ordered local brews and pretzels.  The pretzels wete incredible.  In fact, my husband is trying to replicate the mustard served with the pretzels.  We also had a couple of other appetizers - angus sliders and olive dip.  They were both great as well.  Happy hour also has incredible prices.  We had a great time, good service.

We have a rule to not repeat a restarant while on vacation, but we agreed when we got back we should have gone back one more time."
5,"Just a really cool place with reasonably priced good food and drink. 
We stopped here to experience Philly food and had a blast!
The appetizers were over the top good! We had the nacho plate and it was more than two people could eat. Our friends even went back the next day to have lunch!!!

Love this place!"
4,They only have 4 tables for outside eating but our server was amazing and very nice the food was good and I recommend this place and give them your time they are trying to make it during these trying times. Oh and they are dog friendly which is always a plus with me! Nice local hangout spot.
5,"I went here because of the exterior of the restaurant that looks like a bank with a Greek architecture look. Inside is spacious with bar on the right and booth seatings on the left. In the middle and back the seatings are high chairs.

I asked for booth seats which are actually church pews, for me and a friend. First the hostess said that they are for large parties. However there were two booths with only two people in each. After our argument based on that fact, she gave us a booth.

We were greeted by a friendly waitress. I ordered house  salad with additional salmon my friend ordered avocado grapefruit salad with crab cake. Mine came with a medium piece of grilled salmon, on the borderline of over cooked, not too dry though. Her crab cake is pretty big. However it looked that it&apos;s fried. My friend tried to avoid fried food. So when she asked the server whether it&apos;s fried, she said yes. The waitress said that it&apos;s pan seared. She offered to change it but we decided to keep it. My friend said it&apos;s very good. The grapefruit with the lemon citrus vinaigrette is a perfect combination. She really enjoyed it.

I also ordered Bavarian style pretzel. It&apos;s big, made to order and very soft with nice touch of butter on top. Only available for brunch. Definitely get this.

I also ordered the veggie burger to go. Very packed with shredded carrots , zucchini, and chopped broccoli. It&apos;s served in a soft bun with fried and a pickle. Delicious.

Definitely go back."
4,"I came with one other person here on a Saturday night. We made a reservation a half hour in advance just in case, but there would not have been a wait had we not. Although I have been here several times in the past where there has been up to an hour wait. 

I ordered one of the draft beers and their National Burger. The burger was good and cooked as I asked, but it wouldn&apos;t make it on the list of best burgers I&apos;ve had in the city. I also ordered sweet potatoes as a side, since they don&apos;t come with the burger.

The service was good in the beginning, but after we received our burgers, the waiters stopped coming by our table and it took much longer to get things.

Overall, I would still come back here for a casual meal since it is in my neighborhood and they have a good beer list."
4,"Fantastic food served fast. The greet time didn&apos;t happen for 5 minutes. Had to call over the waitress. Staff = 1 waitress. 1 server. 1 hostess for the whole restaurant. I assume they were short staffed. Service was good once somebody finally came. 

I had a blueberry draft beer from Rhode Island. Nicely fruity, but not overwhelmingly so. You could still taste the beer. Wifey had a white sangria. Fruity, but not too sweet. 

I had a veggie burger. Homemade in the restaurant with zucchini, carrots and broccoli - no filler!  Served with a soft fried egg on top and choice of cheese and a fresh, soft brioche style bun. I added avocado. Topped w/L/T/O. Served with steak fries (cooked crispy the way I like them!)

Wife had a turkey burger. Topped w/avocado, red pepper aioli, L/T/O served on soft brioche style bun. Served w/steak fries. 

you have access to the Bloody Mary hot sauce bar for your choice of hot sauce!!!!"
4,"Pro-tip. If you find yourself at National Mechanics, do yourself a favor and order the pretzel. It&apos;s huge, comes with cheese and mustard and is bready, buttery, salty goodness. Have it before a meal or have it AS a meal...but by all means, have it. (Welcome to Philadelphia...home of the liberty bell and soft pretzels)"
5,"Very nice service, vibe, music (which isn&apos;t too loud), and food was good! 

The people in my party liked their food, which ranged from the veggie burger, the brisket, the fish &amp; chips, and more. I had asked to substitute my cole slaw for veggies, but the waiter had said the cole slaw was a small thing, so I just said nevermind not a problem! And then when my plate came out, I had a side of veggies! I thought maybe I might be charged for an extra side by when I checked the bill at the end of the meal, the veggies were nowhere to be found :)

So thank you to the kind waiter for being awesome about telling us the history of the restaurant, being patient about our menu question and food choices, and for giving me my veggies! 

I&apos;m no Philly local, but I thought this place was fairly priced with good food and nice atmosphere. Definitely recommend for both locals and visitors!"
4,"Mmmmmm. The food here was pretty good, although I&apos;ll admit that I should have ordered something else besides the salmon.

I chose this restaurant for dinner with my family, aunt and uncle. I was skeptical at first, because even though the menu sounded amazing, I know my dad and brother are especially picky when it comes to American cuisine. Thankfully, the food here was spectacular. My dad ordered the lamb lollipops, while my brother ordered the skirt steak special. Both had rave reviews about the food. They even licked off every crumb! (Literally.)

As for everyone else&apos;s orders... my uncle thought the veggie burger was very unique, in that you could see all the veggies in the veggie patty. My aunt and mom got the salmon orichiette pasta, which to them tasted very flavorful... just a bit oily. My salmon dish was fine, but it could have used less butter sauce. Nevertheless, I&apos;m really glad I took the risk to bring my fam here. It&apos;s too bad I&apos;m only spending another few days in Philly before I fly home to SF, but I&apos;m definitely going to keep this place in my bookmarks."
4,"Came here for happy hour: cheap beers and cheap food! 

However, I just ordered off the regular drink menu because they have some great drink names! For example: Obama Bomb, Bad Hombre Margarita, Snacks on the Beach, and Nasty Woman Shandy.

Cocktails are about $9-12 which is pretty standard! I got the Bad Hombre Margarita which had a little kick (aka spice). The bartender said a lot of people actually send this drink back because they don&apos;t like the spice. I thought it was a nice contrast to the margarita! Cheers!"
4,"A fun spot for young and not so young. Serving excellent burgers, sandwiches, salads etc.... all at reasonable prices. 
Excellent Bloody Marys... good selection of draft and bottled beer. 
Plenty of seating. Very efficient staff. 
Gets crowded on weekends. But that can be fun with the right mix of people."
3,We stopped here for brunch and bloodies before heading to the Wells Fargo center for a Villanova game. The have a Bloody Mary bar where you can add your own mix and topping which I wish I had done but instead I ordered one off the menu that was half bloody half Guinness. I love the concept but unfortunately I didn&apos;t love their bloody mix (not their fault it just has a lot of horseradish in it which a lot of people like but I&apos;m not a huge fan). My friends did get the bloody bar though and theirs were delicious! I had the Benedict with avocado on it for a meal which was really good. Plenty of hollandaise which is important! I would go back here before another game!
4,"That make-your-own bloody mary bar tho

Prior to my brunching at this place, I had been once before for the sole purpose of enhancing my buzz. Rumor has it that this place has a good bar and is fun in the evening hours. I also was not opposed to a routine oil change.

After packing some food in across the calle at Farmicia, Tinasaurus rex and I scaled the steps and took a seat at the bar. I believe our consumption consisted of the classics that are vodka soda intermixed with some fire ball shots. This was maybe like 8pm on a Saturday and at this point in time the restaurant service was still in full swing. I am therefore unable to comment on the late night bar scene.

While I&apos;m not usually keen on building shit, especially my own shit, bloody marys are a glaring exception. Idk if you&apos;re noticed but most people fucking suck at making them. A great BM (lol at that abbreviation if you&apos;re in the medical field) is a SCARCE COMMODITY and an exception rather than the rule. I&apos;m down for a delicious, thick, juicy bloody that doesn&apos;t result in me choking on horseradish. Additionally, if you like hot sauce half as much as I do, they have a very impressive hot sauce collection for utilization either in your BM (sry i can&apos;t stop) or on your brunch fare. Naturally and as per usual I went too hard and got too aggressive and excited pouring shit in my glass and it overflowed all over the place. You can&apos;t bring me anywhere. 

To start we ordered the cheese plate. There was the classic bleu, brie, &quot;aged&quot; cheddar, and &quot;aged&quot; gouda. Out of curiosity, have you noticed that legit every cheese plate on earth it seems has bleu? Does anyone actually like that shit? The flavor is so fucking strong and that MOLD. Gross. Anyways, cheese plate was good however the extra accompaniments are not as impressive as I&apos;ve had at other places. 

For my main (besides the bloody mary), I went with the tofu scramble with eggs, oaxaca cheese, and surprise surprise: tofu. For my side bc I&apos;m a basic keto bitch these days, I got a salad with some ranch. I actually got drunk enough where I started dipping the little baguette slices into the ranch. Judge-away mother fuckers but you know deep down that shit sounds amazing.

The food here is decent and adequate but the real fire in my pants for this place is that &apos;mary bar."
