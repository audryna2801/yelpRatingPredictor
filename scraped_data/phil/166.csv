5,"I had gotten take out from here due to COVID restrictions with indoor dining. The chicken teriyaki set was amazing and I&apos;m very happy about the portion, along with the various sides that came with it! The chicken was well marinated and flavorful and the vegetable sides were clean and tasty as well. I would love to try some of their options too if I&apos;m ever in the general area!"
5,Wow supper fresh fish!! Excellent sushi! My new favorite sushi place even though it&apos;s not close to my house in south philly! I will still be getting take out from them when I want sushi.
5,Very good. Great quarantine pickup situation. Ordered a hand roll like an idiot and they gave me a standard full roll after calling me -- and didn&apos;t charge me. It was extremely generous. Will call again.
2,"The sushi was ok, no the freshest. It had a bit of fishy flavor; which in my opinion sushi should not have 

Takeout was socially distanced, you call when you arrive and make payment over the phone. The host brings your food out to you

I probably would not return here for sushi being that it is rather pricey for not so good sushi."
2,"I was very disappointed by the avocado salad ! I They delivered $100 worth of sushi and the salad was really sad. It was iceberg lettuce and avocado, nothing else. I get these salads all the time at other sushi restaurants and they are always great! I won&apos;t be ordering from here anymore...."
4,"I got sushi delivered from here the other day and the sushi was spot on! I ordered the spicy tuna, sweet potato, shrimp tempura and miso soup. All were very tasty! I am giving this review 4stars because on their website they have a lunch special where you can get 3 rolls w/a complimentary miso soup for $10.95. I ordered my food using ubereats and the lunch special wasn&apos;t available. I paid $29 for something that would normally cost $10.95. The person who delivered my sushi never notified me and my food was left unattended for ~20minutes. Food was very tasty but ubereats has some work to do"
4,"Happened to venture out to Philly and was just going through a lot of restaurants nearby and this one had really good ratings and I saw the reviews mentioned a groupon that you can also use with it, as a huge sushi lover, I couldn&apos;t say no!

Parking is always a pain in the city, but found parking a blocks away, though there is street parking available right outside the restaurant, if you&apos;re lucky. 

I was seated right away on Sunday since they had just opened and we initially ordered 3 rolls and service was super fast and pleasant and was able to talk to have some nice quick conversation with the staff.

We ordere the Las Vegas Roll, Sex on the Beach Roll, and the Pink Lady Roll. They were all so delicious and tasted so fresh and the presentation was beautiful. Me and my boyfriend agreed that the Pink Lady was the best! So we ended up ordering another one!

If you write a review on Yelp with a picture of their food, you&apos;re able to get a free Japanese soda which was a nice surprise.

I would definitely get the Groupon deal if you&apos;re coming here. Without it, the sushi would&apos;ve been a little bit more on the pricier side, but still worth it!
 
I noticed an error with our check and the Groupon deal, but they apologized and resolved that quickly, so it&apos;d be good to double check.

can&apos;t wait to come here again!"
5,"This is my favorite sushi place in the city! Whether I&apos;m getting delivery or take-out during lunch (this place is dangerously close to my office and I have to stop myself from going more than once a week), or eating in, Koto is by far the freshest, tastiest option for sushi in Philly. The sushi always tastes delicious, fresh and the portions are generous. I usually ask them to cut the regular rolls into 8 pieces. 

Pro tip: get the Angel Roll and you won&apos;t leave disappointed!"
4,"So we have ordered from here a few times. We were packing up our entire apartment to move out of Philly in 1.5 days because of the Hahnemann closing debacle. 

My little sushi roll was craving sushi the evening prior. She was also craving thai. I asked my asian friend who has a BIG DICK when it comes to asian food. We inquired as to any place in the city that has both thai AND sushi and she was HORRIFIED. I was treated like Hitler essentially for even entertaining the thought in my mind. SORRY, I&apos;M WHITE. We went with Thai so the next day for lunch I felt compelled to seal the asian food deal and ordered sushi. This was our go-to place in the past and as they say, if it ain&apos;t broke.

I ordered my usuals of vegetable gyoza, sweet potato tempura roll, cucumber avocado, and because we were leaving Philly I figured there was no better time to try PHILADELPHIA ROLLS! Bae ordered eel and yellowtail and scallion. We also ordered edamame and because I was desperately trying to feel &quot;healthy&quot; I ordered a side salad with their ginger dressing.

The vegetable gyoza and my vegetarian rolls were to die as usual. The philadelphia roll (and I usually don&apos;t like seafood) WAS ORGASMIC! HOLY SHIT! Who ever thought of putting cream cheese in fucking SUSHI? Tina says her rolls were &quot;great&quot;. The edamame was standard. I would have preferred some more salt. 

The salad with ginger dressing, as will probably NOT come as a surprise to many of you, was not good. I&apos;d avoid it next time. 

Good sushi option for delivery in Philadelphia!"
4,"Looking for a place to eat at 2:30 PM on MLK Weekend is a hard task, but Koto made it easy! My sister was visiting from out of town and got in around 1 so we were around Independence Hall but got really hungry! We were so excited that Koto still had a lunch special on a Holiday weekend and they had exactly what we wanted. The shrimp tempura rolls were crispy and fresh, fried rice chicken hibachi was just the fried rice craving we needed. It&apos;s a bit hidden in the middle of Jeweler&apos;s Row but definitely a great place to stop by! Lunch for two came out to $32 and they&apos;re also on the Seated app so you can still get extra cash back :)"
1,"Ew. Extremely tasteless and tiny rolls. I get the COVID-19 situation, but don&apos;t pass it on to the costumer."
5,"Wait: None. We walked right in and sat window-side. It was about 6pm on a Thursday. 

Server: Sooooo sweet. There was a bit of a language barrier which actually kept us all laughing. He was so funny. It was 80 degrees outside and I asked for a hot Green Tea. His face was priceless as he asked, &quot;Are you sure?! It&apos;s very Hot&quot;. I immediately started cracking up and agreed with him. No hot tea. Haha 

Food Quality&amp; Order: He ordered Hibachi Steak&amp; Chicken. I ordered a Spicy Tuna Roll and... a Philly roll (I had to, judge me). It was all so delicious. Came out in enough time to be prompt but slow enough to know that they care for how they make their food. P.s. They are BYOB!

The Chef came out and brought us something &quot;special&quot; to try. Jalape√±o Yellowtail w/Ponzu. He saw us taking lots of photos and a few videos and wanted to introduce himself. 

Atmosphere&amp; Decor: It is your typical Sushi restaurant decor. I love the lack of lighting, it&apos;s romantic and calming."
5,"A sushi restaurant in the middle of Jewelers Row... go figure??
But here&apos;s the thing... Koto is a great place to get excellent quality Sushi. 
Koto offers a wide selection of sushi &amp; sashimi at moderate price.
They do not skimp on portion size. 
One nuance I look for in a good sushi joint is... do they use real Ohba (a form of Japanese mint) or fake green plastic separators in their presentation. Here it&apos;s the real thing. 
The wait staff is friendly and courteous. 
And the lunch specials are priced right."
5,"Yep!! Tried this place based on yelp recommendation and there was not regrets!!!  KitKat sealed the deal!  JJ came by the table and met my party. He chatted for awhile. 
So I had the fried calamari and gyoza then lunch bento with curry chicken and the sushi sashimi condo plate. All of which was excellent!!! 
Ambiance for lunch is ok- 4/5
Scenery- downtown street -4/5
Food 5/5
Customer service 6/5
Overall 4.75/5"
4,"I came here with friends on a weeknight and loved everything we ordered! We had no problems grabbing a table and had great service throughout. It did take awhile to pay, though. Still, the rolls were delicious, filling, and decently priced! I will definitely make this one of my go to sushi spots in the city now."
4,"*UPDATE*: Yesterday Koto reached out to my friend and has apologized. They offered her a complimentary meal and were very nice!  

My friend and I ordered 5 rolls and some dumplings for delivery on her 30th birthday. An hour and a half later, called to find the food was still &quot;sitting at the restaurant&quot;. They apparently use a 3rd party delivery service and do not actually employ the delivery drivers. Ended up canceling the order because the dumplings would have been cold and the sushi dried out and warm... and they still couldn&apos;t provide an ETA. They were rude and getting refunded was difficult. Unacceptable."
5,"Literally the best sushi I&apos;ve had in the city and state. Always fresh, and consistent and creative rolls. Not to mention quick service and such kind staff. I am very picky with sushi and this place is best in class."
4,"Solid sushi restaurant with comparable prices to other sushi places.  

Ordered 3 roll combo (yellowtail, eel &amp; avacodo, spicy crabmeat) for ~$10.  Nothing too flashy.  Was able to order online and pay when I got there.  This is a good alternative to Fat Salmon, less than a block away, if you don&apos;t want to wait too long for your order.  FS tends to be a little busier during the lunch rush."
4,"Pleasantly surprised with the sushi here! Very fresh and fairly priced. Three of us shared the sashimi deluxe and three specialty rolls in addition to edamame. This was the perfect amount of food.

BYOB. Located in the middle of jewelry row."
4,"Found them on Groupon when I couldn&apos;t find my favorite spot. Good reviews. 

Parking: Street

Atmosphere: laid back &amp; comfortable. It&apos;s B.Y.OB!! 

Service: we were seated quickly. Our servers were very pleasant.  J.J brought us a dish out that wasn&apos;t on the menu.  It was delicious!   Apperizers: calamari was fried just right with a spicy sauce. Edamame was ok. Shumai and had no taste. 

Meal: My son had the shrimp tempura, king crunch crab and western roll. He said it was tasty.  My Daughter. Las Vegas and shrimp tempura roll.  I had the black dragon roll. Mine&apos;s was breaking apart. Not good. 

Overall I would go back. The service was really good and the food wasn&apos;t bad."
