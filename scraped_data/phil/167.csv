5,"Recently, we ordered from Fond. Fond is located in South Philly, near Passyunk Ave and we were supposed to go for New Year&apos;s Eve two years ago. We ended up canceling last minute due to undesirable conditions but it&apos;s been on my Philly food bucket list for years. Fond is of the restaurants continuing services with delivery and curbside options. Not only are they offering plenty of sandwiches, soups, and prepared foods, but they also have a mini-market. This market contains household items like salt, flour, and eggs, but also includes necessities like toilet paper, wine, and beer.

We ordered a ton of items, enough for lunch and dinner, and even grabbed some beer. Although the beer was more than what we would typically pay for a 6-pack, we ended up getting a delicious blood orange IPA. We were given the Tommy Knocker Mountain Town Craft Beer, brewed in Colorado. Definitely the best blood orange IPA we ever had. It was lite on the hops and the orange just tasted like fresh juice. It was so nice to be able to order food, salt (since we ran out a few days ago), and beer - one-stop shop. I will always continue to support local restaurants. 
Corned Beef Sammy: The sandwich was served on marbled rye (the best!) and had a large serving of corned beef. It was topped with Thousand Island dressing, Swiss cheese, and sauerkraut. The meat was moist and pretty tasty. It wasn&apos;t the best corned beef sandwich we&apos;ve had, but definitely tasty.

Bahn Mi: I&apos;ve been craving a Bahn mi for weeks now and was so excited that it was on the menu. Although not traditional, it was served with chicken. The vegetables were pickled perfectly. I would have liked more pickled juice or heat (like extra jalapenos). The bread was so soft. I love when Bahn mis have soft bread; I think it kind of defeats the purpose of having succulent meat if the bread is so hard to chew through. Definitely hit my craving and I can&apos;t wait to recreate this.

Thai Chicken Curry: We recently had curry from a local Thai restaurant and I&apos;ve been craving it ever since. The curry is part of their prepared foods and so glad we ordered this. It was a large portion that had plenty of veggies. I was surprised that it came with chopped potatoes. Is this normal? Can someone confirm this? The flavor was great with just the right amount of heat. We ended up making a side of rice and having it for dinner the following day. It kept great and highly recommend.

Italian Hoagie: We inhaled this for lunch the following day. The bread was super soft, just like the Bahn mi. The sandwich was full of meat - a mix of ham and salami. It was topped with provolone, lettuce, tomato, and onion. I would have liked it to have some oil and vinegar, but glad it didn&apos;t make the bread soggy for the following day.

I know this isn&apos;t typical of what they would normally serve but it was really tasty. The food traveled well and kept for leftovers. I would highly recommend ordering takeout from Fond Bistro. I can&apos;t wait to come back when things return to &quot;normal&quot;."
5,"I went to Fond recently after they opened their outdoor dining. Great dining experience - we got the $50 prefixed menu. It&apos;s not the first time I went to Fond and the food and drink were great as always. So I felt compelled to write a review. 
There was no cocktail menu yet but I was able to order Aviation which is my fav there. We have not seen skate on the menu at any restaurants in a while so super excited about that. For appetizer we got chicken liver mousse, octopus, entree skate and soft shell crab. Both entrees was extremely good- reminds me of why I love the Philly food scene so much. Outdoor dining experience was overall good, social distancing was maintained well (6 ft apart from tables and person to person). It was quite sunny and hot out so that was the only downside. If there had been more shade it would&apos;ve been perfect."
5,"What a wonderful gourmet meal during this pandemic. We tried the shrimp, tuna tartare, skate and soft shell crab entrees and chocolate cake and tarte desserts. Everything was absolutely delicious, and the sauces weren&apos;t throw in the containers randomly like some places do.The packaging was also well thought out. We have dined here several times over the yrs so we went into this order knowing it would be good... it was great ! We paired the meal with a Sancerre and we were in heaven in our backyard Thanks!"
5,"RW Review: This is a cute romantic spot in south philly. Excellent assortment of cocktails, as well as a special rye one for RW. We opted for one of those and an aviation. We started with the beef rillettes, which came with a horseradish sauce and the a warm parsnip soup with little shrimp and parsnip chips in them. The whole bowl was served with just the fillers, and the broth was poured into it. 

Then, we got the coq au vin, which was cooked perfectly and the skate wing with Meyer lemon risotto. I was a little confused why there was edamame in it, but I like edamame so I wasn&apos;t about to ask questions. The servings were a good size. Sometimes I feel like I&apos;m getting ripped off for restaurant week. 

For dessert, we got the mocha cake that had several yummy layers and this orange creme brûlée. The best part of dessert was the passion fruit cannoli on the creme brûlée. I could have eaten 12 of those. American food with French flair done quite well!"
5,"My sister took us here for the 7-course prix fixed menu tasting for Christmas and it was epicly delicious and a ton of fun!

First off, I gotta say their cocktails are off the chain. Some of the best I&apos;ve had in the city. Especially their jalapeño tequila with passion fruit and something called Milk of Amnesia. 

The wait staff was very warm and friendly. And the food hit the spot. The chicken liver mouse? My favorite.  Fresh Scallop ceviche. Crispy pork belly. Pan seared Skate. Buttery bread and Escargot. Double cream Dutch Cheese and coal roasted bread. Dessert too? Check and check- both Cheesecake and ice cream.

There is something magical about ordering prix fixed little plates and everyone having the same plate. There&apos;s a sense of community and conversation around what&apos;s being eaten. No one feels like they&apos;re missing out or jealous of someone else&apos;s dish. There are strategic trades between people with different palettes. Oh how I&apos;ve missed the prix fixed- and by the end, we were all full and bloated. 

My sister nailed the family Christmas gift this year. This place was great - would definitely come back!"
4,"Yum!!! It&apos;s taken me a while to get here but never -the -less, I&apos;m glad I made it. The intimate space, the sweet bar while waiting for a table and the great service... all so good! The food? Delicious! I had the pork belly and the flavor, the texture, the egg, the broken rice...WOW! I&apos;m still thinking about it the day after. Everyone at the table enjoyed their orders. The space is a bit small and the conversations whirling about can get a bit loud. But it&apos;s still sweet and the good service and food make up for that. We ordered a bottle of wine and enjoyed our night and our food. The desserts looked delicious but we had something unexpected come up and couldn&apos;t partake. Next time. This is a top notch space. If you haven&apos;t gone... you should go. I&apos;ll be back."
5,"Great dinner fixed price $50.00 a little on the high side  but a small restaurant has to make a profit. 
Soft shell crab outstanding.  The tuna app was amazing. Deserts were good not great.  The service was excellent"
4,"Chicken Liver Mousse was super delicious!  I ran out of bread to pair and really wished I had more!  It was a big portion, the texture was light and airy with bold flavors.  Paired well with the grilled sourdough bread and pickled onions.  This was the favorite of the meal for sure and surely what I&apos;d definitely order again.

The Pork Belly main was a big portion for an entree.  The pork was tender and moist but not overly so.  The pork belly skin was slightly disappointing in that it could have been more crispy, as it was, it had greater potential.  I found the pork flavor to be muted even though we&apos;re taking about pork belly.  Underneath were some sweet potatoes that certainly didn&apos;t look like sweet potatoes with escarole as well.  I definitely found myself more than satisfied after finishing this plate.

For dessert, a Chocolate Almond Cake with a Amaretto Semifreddo and chocolate ganache was pretty on the plate.  The ganache was the perfect bittersweet to the sweeter semifreddo.  The cake had a more refined subtle chocolate almond flavor.

Fond is a really small eatery with tables that are really close to each other so don&apos;t expect much intimacy.  The music is loud enough to make the nearby conversations muddled but best to tone down the volume less you want you neighbor to participate in your discussion."
3,"We came here for a birthday brunch on a Sunday morning. The food was very good; I may be judging harshly because of the price, and because I&apos;ve heard such good things.

We were the only people in the restaurant when it opened at 10, and they sat us at a corner table in the back. There were something like 5 flies that were buzzing around the table during our entire meal that was sort of annoying us.. but that isn&apos;t really the restaurant&apos;s fault. I imagine it&apos;s hard to control that. But maybe they could have put us at a different table?

We ordered oysters to start which were FABULOUS but we had to ask for lemon and hot sauce. I had an iced green tea that was barely tea, it was basically ice water. And I got the mushroom omelet.. the mushrooms and cheese were absolutely phenomenal, but the omelet was overcooked.

It was definitely good! But not great."
5,"This was my second time at Fond. My first time was in 2013. Six years later, this little restaurant still puts out excellent food. The paté du jour, duck paté, was awesome. So flavorful and hearty, it was accompanied with a sweetened mustard, green scallions, and grilled white pancake bread similar to the kind they would give you at a Chinese restaurant with your Peking duck. My salmon with lemon asparagus risotto was a heavenly dish. The thick slab of salmon was light and flaky, cooked just enough to preserve a medium rare like texture inside. The outer skin was a wonderful contrast of crispy to the tender, succulent inside. The risotto was a perfect complement. A fine French-style dish. If I could find a way to come and eat here by myself without looking like a crazy, single old bat, I would. I would come here quite often.

Sadly, my date this time didn&apos;t have the same hearty appetite as my date the first time. I got the feeling he wasn&apos;t very adventurous with his food as he ordered the &quot;green circle&quot; chicken, which was actually quite remarkable as far as chicken dishes go. The chicken was cooked perfectly. I will definitely be eyeing this place again as a dining destination now that one of my other favorite French restaurants has bumped up their prices to astronomical proportions."
5,"Here are the facts:
-I came here for my birthday dinner with my boyfriend
-waiter was sooo friendly
-the space and seating is nice and cozy
-tried the 5 course tasting menu and it was on point (especially with wine pairing) 
-I loved the chicken liver mousse
-you will leave satisfied
-I will come back"
4,"Dined here with my husband during restaurant week. We came for brunch. The service was fast and friendly and you could just tell the food was fresh. 

I liked the decor, but it was pretty small inside and it had a single-stall restroom which I&apos;m not a fan of. The pricing was also just okay and it a bit more on the expensive side. 

Overall however this place is worth trying."
3,Service was excellent. It appeared that most of the customers were regulars because the wait staff seemed to know many of them personally. Loved the chicken liver moose and seared foie gras. The complimentary olive bread was delicious. The only disappointing part of our meal was the pork belly dish; the crispy skin was burnt so a lot of it was bitter.
5,"I have read the other yelp reviews and have to terminate that Fond produces consistently excellent dishes. My husband and I really enjoyed our experience at Fond. From start to finish The cocktails were excellent or appetizers were top notch as well. My husband and I enjoyed ample portions of chicken liver mousse with delicious grilled bread. I love the pickled onions that added a nice balance to the salty creamy Delight. I truly enjoyed foie gras with mascarpone and berries. 
Atmospheres cozy I recommend reservations for sure"
5,"Dad joke alert: I am very fond of Fond.

I went for a little date night dinner during Passyunk Restaurant Week.  Together, we ordered the chicken liver mousse and wild boar pate for our appetizers, the pork belly and skate for our entrees, and finished up with the chocolate almond layer cake and coconut creme brûlée.  

Apologies in advance for the photos - they do not do the dishes justice.  The chicken liver mousse was so creamy and savory, and I&apos;ve never had skate before so that was a real treat.  The skate was prepped so that it was very juicy and tender, but the outside of it was crisped up nicely.  The pork belly was probably my favorite - it was just incredible.  The meat melted in your mouth while the skin&apos;s crunch and flavor was absolutely salty perfection.  The pairing with sweet potatoes was a match made in heaven.  The one thing I guess I&apos;d say is that I do wish we were given more bread with the mousse and pate though, we had to really ration that out.

Both desserts were so good, and definitely the right amount of sweetness - my partner was a little disappointed the pineapple topping the creme brûlée was canned rather than a more tart, fresh taste but it was still my fave of the two desserts to be honest.

The interior of Fond is really cute: a very romantic atmosphere for sure, albeit a bit small. 

Our server was very attentive and wonderful.  I would recommend Fond as one of the Passyunk restaurants to stop by for sure, especially for the restaurant week deal (FYI Passyunk restaurant week only runs Mon-Thurs and Fond is closed on Mondays).  We left feeling very satisfied, with our meals being well worth the price."
3,Went for dinner during restaurant week and it was not the same experience as a normal night.  They were very busy and the service was off from their usual standards.  We were waiting in the bar and the hostess told us they had our table but it was not great and if we would rather sit at the bar she would offer us a few additional dishes.  The dishes never materialized but we did get a comped glass if very nice wine.  As for the tables there are no bad ones so I think it was a bit of a hustle and frankly the bar does not have a sufficient overhang for comfortable dining. The food was good not great again not the usual standard.  If you go steer clear of restaurant week and sit at a table.  Even on an under performing night a 1000 times better than Hungry Pigeon
5,"Here are the facts:
-waitstaff is so friendly
-the space is beautiful and light and clean
-brunch menu was in a moderate price range
-they had great specials (lamb combo was dope)
-crab feta avocado and tomato omelette was so fresh and yummy 
-pate Banh mi was just ok could prob skip (I love Banh mi and I almost always know going into it that getting one at a non-viet place is a mistake but I do it anyways)
-def want to come back for dinner 
-great that they have some outdoor seating"
5,"Really great experience here this past week for the tasting collective. I tried many different dishes but the top ones for me was the chicken liver mousse which is a signature and now I know why. Fatty , buttery , I mean just give me a loaf of bread and a bucket of that next time and I will be satisfied. The other dish I would shoutout would be the pork cheeks with polenta as it just brought be back to having some good homemade bbq just melting in your mouth. Also wanted to note on the atmosphere because this is a cool spot to check out."
1,"To preface, it&apos;s been about a year since I&apos;ve written my last Yelp review. I had just about fully retired, but this dining experience has brought me back from the dead. Furthermore, I rarely write 1-star reviews so I really had a memorable experience here.

While planning for my weekend trip to Philadelphia, I came across Fond as one of my finalists for a nice dinner. The menu looked decent, and the price point was extremely reasonable. Judging from the reviews, I naturally assumed that this would be another great dining experience. 

Fond is a quaint restaurant located in South Philadelphia. As with all restaurants in the area, street parking is your best bet. When we walked into the restaurant, it looked like a cute place with an attentive staff. Upon sitting down, I realized that the tasting menu was priced reasonably well: $62 for 5-courses. Based upon that fact and that an entree was ~$30, it was a no-brainer to go with the tasting menu.

As a party of two, we decided to order the: Salmon Crudo, Venison Pate, Corn Risotto, Foie Gras, Bavette Steak, and Pork Belly. A pretty solid lineup if I do say so myself.

Long story short, when our dessert came, there was a life ant on my wife&apos;s plate. We mentioned this to the waiter, and he brushed it off. No apologies, or any mention of a new dessert. We were appalled to say the least. Furthermore, when we spoke to the manager, the response was the same. I wasn&apos;t looking for a comped meal, but at least some acknowledgement of the issue.

A good meal ended up going South, and what could have been a 4-star experience, ended up not being so. Sadly, and rightfully so, I will not be coming back."
4,"Came here for date night and while I didn&apos;t enjoy my main course - the pork belly, my husband enjoyed his duck dish, which does not look like it&apos;s on the menu anymore... I will recommend the chicken liver mousse appetizer though. It was a generous portion and tasted heavenly. The service was also superb."
