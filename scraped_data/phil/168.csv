4,"Ordered here a few weeks back. If you go through Grubhub, give them your first name when you go to pick up. It took about 35 minutes or so during early evening.

On to the food:

Dan Dan Noodles
Top notch as always. Peanutty with slight burn, we got them mild.

Wontons in Chili Oil
A slight disappointment. Kind of a sour taste to the sauce, which was kind of mushy. 

Walnut Shrimp
Packaged separately to avoid transit issues - separate containers for shrimp, sauce and walnuts. A nice touch. As for the shrimp, they were huge but tough and overcooked. Sauce was tasty. 

Smoked tofu with shredded pork
Excellent as usual with hints of garlic in the sauce. 

HomeStyle Tofu
Really good with a terrific sauce and delicious mushrooms. 

Covid-19 precautions:
No dine-in when I was there, only one person at a time for pick-up. Masks required."
5,"Super convenient for Chinese food not in Chinatown! 

Beef Lo Mein was delicious. Not super salty like most take out restaurants. I also enjoyed the Sichuan spicy beef noodle soup. They separate the soup and noodles for take out. The noodles are thick which I prefer. The soup was on the oily side. I also tried the dry pot style chicken. Chicken was tender and the flavor was yummy.  That dish was my favorite!"
4,"I must say that my experience with this location involved a DoorDash order to the eastern part of Delaware County. And this food is just a different experience for takeout or delivery as opposed to dining in. 

But that&apos;s life during Covid. Cant hold that against them. 

What I can say is that despite the travel to get to my house, the Dan Dan Noodles are still a flavor explosion. The dumplings in chili oil are addicting. And the garlic beef still packed quite the punch."
3,"This place is legend in more than one friends circle I roll with. 
It was pretty good. I don&apos;t know how anyone orders over level 5 here. Everything&apos;s hot and Spicy and full of peppers. Everything. 
It was very good but kinda hurt my tummy later. Maybe I need to order a level 3. 
We all shared stuff. The thing I got for myself was dry pepper chicken. 
We got 6 meals for $74 at lunch. They get expensive for dinner."
5,"We love Han Dynasty and have ordered take out fairly regularly during the pandemic. We love it so much that it was our Christmas Eve takeout meal. There are no pictures because we inhaled it all as soon as we opened the containers.

Started with scallion pancakes. Honestly, I was never about ordering them as a takeout appetizer and I was right. They don&apos;t travel well. Not a fault of Han, but just a fact.

We split an order of Dan Dan Noodles. They are an always order often added without asking the other person. 

I ordered the Chicken Dry Pepper Style entree . It&apos;s a heat level 8 so it&apos;s hot, but I like that. My boyfriend ordered the Beef Garlic Sauce Style which is a heat level 3 (perfect for him!)

We are thankful that Han Dynasty was open on Christmas Eve and appreciate all of their hard working employees!"
4,"Moving in the middle of a pandemic isn&apos;t easy. After a long flight from across the country, being frustrated with TSA and people not knowing how to wear masks properly, I wanted something that was comforting and familiar. Luckily, Han Dynasty was close by and made me feel better after a long and arduous day. 

I had been here once before for a conference, but getting the experience living in the city is quite different. For now, it&apos;s either pick up or delivery, and it was nice to see that they were very cautious, and only allow people wearing masks to pick up food. I ordered some of the usual sichuan dishes, such as mapo tofu, water boiled beef, twice cooked pork, and string beans. After sampling almost every sichuan restaurant in my previous city of Houston, I can say that Han Dynasty can stand with the best. The mapo tofu has a wonderful texture, it wasn&apos;t broken up, and actually uses the right style of tofu. Water boiled beef had a great flavor, just enough sichuan peppercorn, and wasn&apos;t too greasy. The twice cooked pork was also really good, but it was half leeks and less meat than I would expect. String beans were cooked perfectly, just how I like it.

The price isn&apos;t terrible for the location, but it is more expensive than I am used to. Then again, I am new to the city so my needle has to probably change a bit. If you&apos;re already familiar with the dishes and are ordering online, it can be a bit confusing, since they go by &quot;style&quot;. I would have also liked to have some more rice with my food. I ordered 4 dishes and only got 2 little to go containers of rice, which felt a bit skimpy.

Overall, this is going to probably be my new local. The flavor is great, resonably priced, and does an excellent job of protecting their customers and staff.

PS, if you haven&apos;t yet, the owner is featured on Munchies video by Vice."
5,"Can never go wrong here- a few favorites are the kung pao chicken extra spicy, spicy wontons, and dan dan noodles. The lunch specials on uber eats are a great deal if you work in the area! Preparation is fast/on time as predicted."
5,"This place has gotten better over the years. I came here on a very busy weekend but was seated quickly in their new extension dining area. The staff was very attentive and food was great as usual. 

This time, my favorite dish was the Dan San Noodles. They tasted great, had a bit of spice, and the peanut sauce flavoring was one of the best I&apos;ve ever had. Highly, highly recommend it. I had a great time overall and enjoyed every dish."
5,"You can really never go wrong with this location of Han Dynasty in University City. The sesame noodles (cold), dry pepper chicken, and bok choy with mushrooms were all great solid dishes and a pretty good combo if you ask me. Dry pepper chicken is a must-try for me whenever I see it on a menu and this time it delivered!! It wasn&apos;t too spicy and especially when you combine them with the cold sesame noodles it&apos;s just a whole other experience forreal.

Han Dynasty is definitely one of the most consistent restaurants in University City/Penn&apos;s Campus and is great if your family is in the city for the evening or you want to have a dinner with a bunch of friends. With that said all dishes are served family style!

Can&apos;t wait to come back and taste around the menu again : )"
4,I love ordering from this place. I have ordered a few times from here on Doordash and food comes so fast!! We always get the dan dan noodles and cold sesame noodles. My fiance does not eat pork so I ask for the pork on the side for the noodles and they always accommodate! We always get the garlic sauce with chicken and thats always delicious and has a sweetness to it. We always get so much food that we have enough for dinner the next day. The food is spicy and I can handle spice so i learned I have to ask them to come down a notch on the spice levels. Will definitely be ordering from here again!
4,"Huge venue! Great service, plenty of seating for large and small groups. Ideal location for business, right by campus.

Parking is minimal, street parking mostly. I would walk if you can. 

Lots of choices, variety of proteins. Definitely need to come back multiple times to try different things. We got the garlic sauce with chicken which I was not a fan of but portion sizes were good. Meant to be shared/family style. Also got the salt and pepper shrimp which was to die for but like most places it was a tiny portion. We killed this dish and wanted more! Not overly salted which is always good. Finally the wonton soup was a light refreshing soup. May have  added a bit too much black pepper as out daughter was not able to eat the actual soup but she enjoyed the wontons.

Overall, definitely wil  be back to try more of their dishes. We did get dessert too, their Mochi which comes from a prepackaged  place so it was standard nothing to rave about.

Only complaint were the prices of some of the dishes. Yes the portions were large, but not large enough to be charging what they charged!

Will be back, happy eating!"
4,"This place had some pretty solid Chinese food. I came here with four others, and we ordered a bunch of dishes which were all pretty big, but we managed to finish everything! 

Chili wontons - 3/5 - the sauce was a little more sour than I expect.
Chili cucumbers - 4/5 - not traditional but I liked the sweet and sour sauce.
West lake beef soup - 1/5 - not good at all, the soup was so bland and the beef in the soup was very dry. 
Dry pepper chicken - 5/5 - so yummy! The seasoning was good and the chicken did not have too much breading and no bones!
Hot sauce fish - 5/5 - flavor was really good, spicy!
Scallion style lamb - 3.5/5 - I&apos;m not a huge fan of this dish in general and it was alright. 
Dry pot intestines - 4.5/5 - a little oily but very delicious! The flavor was great and there was a lot of intestines :) 

Aside from the soup, I thought everything was pretty good, but coming from California, we also have a lot of great Chinese food so it didn&apos;t wow me. Solid and good spicy food though. Rice is also included for free which is nice!

My friends told me that the Dan Dan noodles are amazing, but I didn&apos;t get a chance to try those. Maybe next time!"
5,"House special lo mein, double cooked fish,  garlic style wings,  string beans with pork topped with rice and tea made for a lovely lunch today with my family. 

This place was packed at lunch today,  we had a little bit of a wait but it was worth it.  Fast service, quality food and lively atmosphere.   There was even Christmas music playing in the background. 

Nice outing,  Han never disappoints."
4,"Han Dynasty is a university city favorite. I come here almost every month since 2015- whether it be for big lab lunch meetings or dinner with family and friends. Han is a great go-to spot for a solid meal. 

You really can&apos;t go without getting the dan dan noodles. I usually do get it with the meat topping but my friend doesn&apos;t eat meat so there&apos;s none in my photos -still delicious. They give the spicy levels on the side in red but you can adjust them to any scale 0-10 since food is made to order. Stuff comes out very quick and rice sides are unlimited. 

My personal favorite is the black bean fish but I generally like everything they sell here. It&apos;s just that the service has been a bit lacking lately that the one star is taken off from this review."
4,"i love Han Dynasty! It&apos;s really great for large groups because you can order many dishes family size and all the dishes are delicious!!! 
pros: 
-i love the dry pepper style fish. It is so crispy and crunchy, but the fish inside is so soft and tender. it&apos;s not too overpowering but the chilis add a nice kick. make sure not to eat the chili peppers though, v spicy LOL 
-the green beans are so good!!! theyre not soggy or not too crunchy. 

Cons: 
-the honey walnut shrimp was pretty expensive with not too many pieces , and a bit too creamy for me. I think some of the dishes are pretty expensive but the portions are very small compared to the price 
-service was a bit slow. It makes sense because there are a lot of people at the restaurant, but we would ask for more water or rice and it would take some time"
5,Ordered from here a second time during our visit to Philly - no complaints this time! We asked for medium spice level so the food was perfectly spicy. Flavors were impeccable. I loved the Garlic Sauc Style Chicken and Dan Dan Noodles a lot! Would recommend both of these.
5,Hands down my favorite sichuan place in the east coast. Their dry pot and pepper style chicken are the best and will never get bored of it. I wish they had more locations especially a few in the west coast.
4,"This is an overdue review of the 2nd Philly location of my beloved spice palace (https://www.yelp.com/biz/han-dynasty-philadelphia)!

But its also taken awhile because, despite popping in for a couple years now I&apos;ve only really done take out when situations like Clark Park Fest meetings have brought me out to West Philly and I found myself craving some food on the go. This is also why I&apos;m giving 4 stars for now, but the fact that they do things like free parking redemption for a lot of 37th &amp; Filbert may have me changing this!

But while it&apos;s definitely not as big as my beloved Old City spot, and you might not see Han as much, this location is a good sized one that plays true to his style. It was also the first Han Dynasty to have a bar, and features some pretty impressive cocktails like the Shifu&apos;s tea which marries Old Overholt rye whiskey with Wang Lao Ji sweet tea, Chinese bitters, lemonade, and hibiscus bitters; and Han&apos;s Cup which combines Bulleit Rye with Pimm&apos;s No. 1 Sichuan Bitters. Toss in a rotating beer list and you have a solid bar.

In my three Old City reviews I touched on plenty of the things that make Han Dynasty awesome overall. So for this one I may as well touch on some of my favorite entrees:

Dan Dan Noodles - No explanation needed really because you already know. whether you go pork or veggie, or alter the spice to your preference they&apos;re the king!

Rabbit w/ peanuts in chili oil - the tender meat and super spice makes going through all those tiny bones worth it!

Fried Taiwanese sausage - sweet succulent meat pockets!

Cumin style lamb - My usual go to entree with its perfect levels of spice, bell peppers blended with long hots, and amazing cumin crust. 

Double cooked pork belly - My kind of pork belly!

Dry pepper style beef - Triple flash fried in all of those pepper juices!"
4,"Delicious food, great atmosphere. We went for a 3pm lunch on a Friday and were seated immediately. They had lots of pandemic adjustments in place, tables are very clean and spaced out, and we felt safe eating indoors.
We shared Singapore noodles, which had plenty of chicken and shrimp. We ordered chicken and shiitake mushroom steamed dumplings, but I couldn&apos;t taste the mushrooms. It is possible we got chicken only, but I was too hungry to care and wolfed them down anyway.
Note that the restaurant&apos;s entrance is right on Chestnut St and not off the patio that runs down the side of the bldg."
3,"I realize during COVID they&apos;re doing the best they can but I was really upset with the food I got at han dynasty. My sister was visiting and I had really high hopes of her trying Szechuan food and especially their Dan dan noodles because they&apos;re known for it, but was very disappointed. They said to come in 15-20 minutes and i came about 17 minutes later and they had it ready so no complaints there, but the noodles themselves tasted as if they had been sitting in the sauce for over a day because they were very soggy and didn&apos;t taste good. And because they were soggy they clumped together making the meal pretty gross. We also got cold sesame noodle which also wasn&apos;t good, it became a warm sesame noodle by the time we got it. They must&apos;ve just let the food sit there or something. Maybe this isn&apos;t one of those places that&apos;s good for take out and better enjoyed in person"
