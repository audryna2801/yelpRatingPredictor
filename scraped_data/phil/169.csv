5,"I&apos;m so glad we tried this place.  Our family decided to go out to eat at 8p on a sunday in the middle of this panamic.  Most of our spots were closed or no longer taking reservations.  
We drove to the city and decided to try this place based on yelp reviews (thank you!!) and oh boy did we like it! 

First of all, love the prix fixe concept, fair and not small size portions.   Second, although it was very late (we got seated at 8:50p) we received great service.  The food was delish, we tried the sweet potatoes pasta meal for the kids and we each had the ribeye steak.  The kids actually ate all of our dinners which was surprising.  
I really enjoyed the arugula beet salad and our fav was def the fried oreo  ice cream dessert.

Def will keep this place bookmarked for post covid date nights!"
5,"You realize what your favorite restaurants are when you don&apos;t get to eat at them for months. During lockdown, we heard large companies declaring bankruptcy and closing their doors -- the only thing I could think of was: is Entree going to be okay? When they posted they were doing their classic 3 course meal for $30 for takeout, my husband and I immediately ordered. And I can assure you, the frutti di mare tastes just as good at home as it does in the restaurant. Supporting our favorite businesses has never been more important than now, and I have never been more thankful for Entree BYOB."
5,"Where to start? Every course is excellent, and the portions are large. I always get the prosciutto-wrapped dates for an app and the sweet potato alfredo for the main course. For dessert, I&apos;ve had the fried oreos and the Nutella cannoli. I really enjoy both. The 3-course for $30 menu (which they launched during the quarantine) is a great deal. I also went a number of times pre-pandemic, when the menu was $40 for three courses. Still well worth it. Hope to see this restaurant survive as we emerge from the lockdown."
5,"A little gem on South St in Graduate Hospital. Our waitress Christine was fantastic, very attentive, helpful, cheerful, knowledgeable about the menu and the preparation methods. I had the scallops and my husband had the duck, both really delicious. Also the prosciutto wrapped dates were WORTH IT. So good. He&apos;s a fan of &quot;The Wedge&quot; and this one had a gorgonzola dressing which he liked a lot. Overall, a great experience, and we&apos;ll be back."
4,"What to know:
- Very affordable menu: Most appetizers are $10-15 and entrees are $25-30. However, they are currently offering $30 and $50 prix fixe options that include 1 app, 1 entree, and 1 dessert (price difference depends on whether your entree was more than $30).
- BIG portions: Gf and I each did the prix fixe menu and had leftovers to bring home!
- Maybe it was just our amazing waitress Christine but we were able to substitute one of the desserts with an extra appetizer
- BYOB

What to get:
- Caesar Salad: A classic done right with homemade Caesar dressing!
- Lobster Bisque: Currently a special but perfect for a chilly night! Does not have actual lobster chunks though FYI
- Ribeye Steak: Juicy steak with a surprising Gorgonzola balsamic glaze and mash potatoes. Delish!
- Nutella cannoli: Doesn&apos;t get any better than this

What to avoid:
- Frutti di Mare: Came with a ton of seafood which was amazing but the pasta itself was unseasoned and pretty dry.
- Prosciutto Wrapped Dates: Not what I expected. The dates are huge and the prosciutto is crisped. If you&apos;re expecting Spanish tapas-style (as I did), you will be disappointed.

All in all, great local dinner spot with a well-priced prix fixe menu (and you can save money on drinks with the BYOB)"
4,"We came here for a birthday dinner and I have to say, the food was absolutely 5/5, the service was 3/5, hence the 4/5 stars. We got the calamari and shrimp app, both were fantastic. For entrees we&apos;re got the frutti de mare and bucatini - and both were DELICIOUS, although the portion sizes were so polar opposite - the frutti was huge with loads of seafood, and the bucatini was really only a few bites so that was disappointing. Love that it&apos;s BYOB. The interior is very small, which makes for a cozy, intimate dining experience. Our waiter wasn&apos;t overly friendly and i had to keep calling him over because he rarely checked on us. Overall, the food is the star of the show and I&apos;m excited to come back and try more, i just hope the service is better next time."
5,I have eaten here twice and would come back a million more times! The food is amazing and they offer price fixes (either $40 or $50 for a three course meal and only $30 during restaurant week!) They pair all of their main dishes with delectable sides and every dish is beautifully crafted. The flavors always mesh perfectly from the steak to any seafood dish I have tried! I highly recommend the ribeye steak and the scallops. Very reasonably priced and I love not having to worry about expensive drinks and just bringing a bottle from home. Will definitely return
2,"The ordering system on the website didn&apos;t work so I placed a phone order instead. Had no problem picking up the food, but later found out one of the items was wrong. The item we wanted was on the menu on the website, but they said they weren&apos;t serving that item and misheard us on the phone and thought we said something else. However, they made an exception and made the item anyway. Had to go back to the restaurant and waited about 15 mins. First time ordering and probably will be the last."
4,"I got take out here during corona. They have an awesome deal! 3 courses for $30 and they do not skimp on the serving sizes. We had plenty of delicious leftovers. The best part is the fried Oreos so I&apos;m so glad we were able to get takeout during this time!!


I came here for my birthday with my family. It&apos;s a small restaurant so make a reservation. You don&apos;t feel like your sitting on top of the people next to you which is nice. They have an a la carte menu and a $40 and $50 prefix menu. A few people ordered off the prefix menu so we got some apps and desserts. 

I have the frutti di mare which was delicious. There was a ton of seafood on it and was super filling. I got the grilled hearts of romane for an app, it was good but nothing special. For dessert I have the flourless chocolate cake, it was so filling you could only have a few bites. You MUST get the fried Oreos. They were delicious, I would probably come back just for dessert. 

Kim was an amazing waitress! She was very attentive and friendly. My dad is obsessed with iced tea so she made him his own person pitcher of it for the table. She was very good"
4,"I was invited to a Galentine&apos;s dinner with some coworkers and the reservation was made for Entree. I had not heard of Entree prior so I was really excited to try something completely new since I haven&apos;t done so in sometime.

First thing I noticed was that it was a pretty tight and small place, however it was decorated nicely and cute. Unfortunately I had to sit towards the end of the table so I was constantly getting bump into. To be fair, I was in a large group so the restaurant tried its best to accommodate the seating.

I ordered a 3 course meal: shrimp, scallops, and the fried Oreos. This was the first time I have ever tried scallops or fried Oreos and I am so happy I finally did. The meal was very delicious and I was left feeling very satisfied."
3,"I was very excited to come here for restaurant week though left a little disappointed.  

Starters: beet and watermelon salad, lobster Rangoon, cheese plate. The beet and watermelon salad was refreshing and best of the bunch, though the other 2 left much to be desired.

Entrees: scallops, steak, artichoke pasta, and branzino. The scallops and steak were very well cooked and recommended but felt like a typical restaurant. The branzino was average, and I cannot speak to the pasta but my friend did enjoy it.

Dessert: fried Oreos, Affogato, tiramisu. The fried Oreos were very hyped up but honestly felt like any fried Oreo that you can find at a fair, complimented by fairly average vanilla ice cream. The real star in the dessert category is the Affogato, which came with a much better vanilla gelato. The tiramisu was nice and light, still better than the Oreos.

Overall, it was a okay dinner but not as great as I had hoped. Though if you do come here, I&apos;d recommend the scallops, steak, and Affogato."
4,"I wasn&apos;t on my game. If anyone else would have chosen what I ordered, I&apos;d have asked, &quot;why&apos;d you get that?!&quot;  (It was the half roast chicken. Yawn.)

If you go for one of the two prix fixe options, know that price -- either $40 or $50 -- is based on the entrée.  Appetizers and desserts are inter-changeable --a plus for those who appreciate flexibility.  One can also order a la carte.

So I started with the arugula salad.  If I hadn&apos;t had squid the night before, that would&apos;ve been my choice. It looked good.  But the arugula hit the spot!  As did my husband&apos;s wedge.  I thoroughly enjoyed my daughter&apos;s prosciutto wrapped dates.  She found them secondary to a Hugh Atcheson restaurant we go to in Georgia ... but I thought they were actually better.  Not heavy, as some yelpers claimed.

The best entrée of the evening was my girl&apos;s steak.  I think it was tenderloin.  The picture I took and didn&apos;t post, was unappealing -- hey, I&apos;m no photographer -- but the beef was tender, flavorful and cooked perfectly.  Haddock was okay, sort of ho hum.  (I noticed my husband  eyeing the daughter&apos;s steak.)  Someone at the neighboring table ordered sea scallops.  Dammit!  Why didn&apos;t I get those?

For dessert, we shared a trio of sweets.  The winner, hands down, were the oreos.  Even the accompanying ice cream -- is it homemade? -- was excellent.

Note that on Saturday night, the restaurant was packed. And noisy.  Reservations strongly suggested.  And don&apos;t forget to bring your wine.  BYOB, with no corkage fee.  Woowee!!!"
4,"I have tried Entrée BYOB twice during restaurant week and both times didn&apos;t disappoint. The first time we started with the dragon shrimp, which is tempura style and just melt in your mouth delicious. Surprisingly on my second visit the Caesar salad was my favorite appetizer. The dressing was so good. I was actually super underwhelmed by the cheese plate, minus the brie it was a total waste. For my first visit I ordered the scallops as my entrée and they were so succulent and amazing. I love it. The second time I had the salmon or trout or some times of fish I cant even recall because I ended up half of my friends chicken dish. I just remember saying the fish was good, but it was a small portion and I didn&apos;t like the side. Surprisingly the chicken was AMAZING, we shared it and still couldn&apos;t&apos; finish it was such a large piece.. Oreo beignets are the only way to go for dessert. I have tried the cannoli but it just doesn&apos;t hold a candle to those fried Oreos. I always enjoy the service, but the small intimate setting does get noisy fast. I would definitely recommend and will be coming back."
5,"Restaurant Week Review: GO!

Restaurant Week(s) are undeniably my favorite time to explore Philly&apos;s food scene. I do extensive research via Yelp to figure out the best options for the $35 dinner offerings. I scour menus, search reviews, and decide where I can get the most bang for my buck. Entrée did not disappoint.

First of all, since its BYO, you&apos;re not shelling out extra dough on drinks. No uncorking fees. I happily sipped my water and wine, and there was no surprise when the bill came. (It&apos;s never fun to see how much your drinks can add to your total!)

I loved the variety in the RW Menu, and based on other reviews, I knew my order before I even stepped food inside: Cheese Plate for appetizer, Hanger Steak for my entrée, and Fried Oreos for dessert. The dessert was a no brainer - two huge, hot Fried Oreos with a healthy serving of cold vanilla ice cream - I&apos;d go back to Entrée just for their dessert. The Hanger Steak was cooked perfectly as requested, and incredibly tender. The sauces were mouthwatering. The Cheese Plate left a little more to be desired, but it was the perfect amount of food for a one-person starter. The prosciutto-wrapped, cheese-stuffed date was the highlight of the plate. Additionally, each table is treated to a bottomless bread basket- be careful, because it&apos;s delicious and hard to stop eating. I left Entrée so uncomfortably full, I could barely walk - but it was all worth it. 

The space is smaller than I expected, and when we sat down at 5:45pm, it was perfectly quiet and empty. However, it filled rapidly as the time passed and it got increasingly louder. There are options for outdoor seating, but it&apos;s literally just tables on the front sidewalk. Unless the weather was PERFECT, I would opt to sit inside. The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable, and the evening was delightfully unrushed. 

TLDR: would come back - get the fried Oreos!"
1,"It was a horrible experience of me and my friends. I had a reservation at 7:30, I arrived there on time,and there were two female servers one was manager curly hair. The other server made me wait for the wine glass for 15 mins, for the ice bucket 20 mins. Then my friends came I requested to change the server. Second server(manager) was worst than her. She dropped the wine bottle while opening,asking private questions about personal life! And i ordered appetizers they came to the table quickly but had to wait for a plate and fork and knife! After 10 mins i stood up and made a big trouble and left the restaurant with my friends. NEVER GO HERE, I STRICTLY NOT RECOMMEND"
5,"My initial experience at Entree&apos; wasn&apos;t the best, sad to say, but the owner Kevin went above and beyond  to turn it around.  Not only was I impressed with the staff and how apologetic and friendly they were , but the owner was humble and made sure that by the time I left I was smiling from ear to ear.  Hands down this was the best customer service I&apos;ve ever received.  Entree is definitely one of my favorite places to dine alone or with friends.  Also, my food was absolutely exceptional each and every time I&apos;ve had the opportunity to dine here."
5,"I had picked 3 spots to hit up for Restaurant week and per a recommendation, Entree BYOB made that list. This restaurant was my absolute favorite of the three.

Tiny dining room, but with fun and eccentric decor. Some of the tables are really close, but you know what, you&apos;re so enthralled by the food, who cares.

The cheese plate was beyond my wildest imagination. Every single piece of food on that plate was fantastic. I loved the vino rosso so much I&apos;ve gone out and bought some for home, being my new favorite cheese. Dip a little of it in the honey, it&apos;s a home run. The fried chevre with a bite of fresh strawberries..get out of here! I don&apos;t like dates, but I apparently LOVE dates stuffed with Gorgonzola wrapped in prosciutto though! 

That seared Duck is still on my mind. It was cooked perfectly, juicy inside, crispy skin. The hash that the duck sat on top of didn&apos;t look so pretty..purple sweet potato, acorn &amp; butternut squash.. but it definitely tasted great.The cherry port demi was a classic and wonderful sauce pairing for that duck.

How I was physically was able to eat anymore after all that, I just had to push through. Seriously, don&apos;t say no to the Fried Oreos. TWO huge dough balls, fried up perfectly with some delicious french vanilla ice cream.. my friends almost had to roll me out the door.

Hands down, loved this restaurant and excited to come back and eat everything else."
3,"I&apos;m somewhere between 3 and 4 starts on Entree, but the differing pre fixe menus and some (IMHO) overpriced offers prevent it from being a real star.

My wife and I were taking my sister out for a celebration and decided Entree would be the perfect spot to enjoy a pleasant meal with a younger person who otherwise doesn&apos;t get to indulge in the Philly restaurant scene like us.  And so, upon recommendation, we picked Entree BYOB.  We enjoyed it and a few menu items stood out, but the Entrees were perhaps acceptable and limit it from becoming a star.

After some discussion, it was agreed that we would share appetizers so we each could try a little.  That was a great decision.  Entree features an a la carte menu which is almost designed to push you into a pre fixe alternative, which was fine, but really rachets up the price of dinner quickly.  Still, the results were enjoyable, even with lackluster entrees.  

Pros:

The appetizers were exceptional.  Especially the rich proscuitto-wrapped dates which were very heavy, but truly something to enjoy.  The fried calamari was average but enjoyable (hand-breaded, with some delicious sauces) and the wild shrimp dragon style were a sweet fried shrimp which was all enjoyed.  

The Fried Oreos are just exceptional - how could they not be?  People have raved about them for a while, but it turns out frying an oreo is pretty hard to fuck up and is delicious.  Entree makes no exception here and I would recommend over almost any dessert.  

Cons:

The restaurant was weirdly empty.  I definitely didn&apos;t find it cramped because of the lack of people. I admit, we went slightly early, with a 6pm dinner time (I guess?) on Saturday, but they seemed somewhat lacking for patrons on a summer weekend (perhaps not that unusual in Philadelphia).  

My wife had the veal which she found to be mediocre.  It was enjoyable and she finished it up, but found it lacking a distinct flavor different from a traditional Italian offering anywhere in the City.  

I had the seared duck breast which was pleasant and acceptable, but again not distinct.  The dried cherry port demi was a nice addition to the potatoes and added a sweet flavor to an otherwise bland, but well-cooked dish.  

My wife and sister both had the creme brulee which was a mess.  The alleged crisp sugar top was not fresh (or nonexistent?) and the entire dish was cold (something I could make at home at this point).  It felt like these were an afterthought brought out of the fridge a little too late.  Go for something else (fried oreos, duh).

Service was fine if slightly odd with the lack of business.  Servers were attentive and food and water came quickly, but I found them a bit hovering with little to do.  I can&apos;t blame anyone for this, but it felt odd.  Dare I say, overstaffed on this day?

Conclusion:  Entree isn&apos;t a unique addition, but a solid stand-by in the BYO scene.  Prices are a bit higher than I would have liked, but it doesn&apos;t seem like many disappointing things exist.  It&apos;s better than some other BYO places that try too hard and do too little, but Entree also doesn&apos;t stand out from it&apos;s peers."
5,"Fantastic food- went for restaurant week and enjoyed every single thing we ordered. I got the beet salad for my appetizer, the branzino for the entree, and the pistachio tiramisu for dessert, but you can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu!"
3,"This review is from March 14, 2020. I was very excited to celebrate my friend&apos;s birthday here but was a bit disappointed. We had a large party (10 people) and the place was very crammed. We barely had any room to eat and, since we were sitting against the wall, every time someone wanted to go to the bathroom we had to get up. The tables were also very small so plates and glasses were crammed on the tables. That aside, the food was ok, I was expecting a bit more for such high prices (but yes, I realize they are higher since you can BYOB). The app and entree selection is very good with some really nice meals. My pet peeve though is overcooked shrimp in seafood pasta...The prosciutto wrapped dates were ok as the dates were huge and sweetness was overpowering. The service was fairly slow but they were nice and very accommodating. I think this is a great deal if you want to drink a bit more with your meal."
