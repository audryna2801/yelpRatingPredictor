5,"CASH ONLY
Read the fine print. Orders over $50 have to pay 18% tip.

They have outdoor seating available during covid. My partner and I shared The Kitchen Sink for brunch. This thing is massive! It will curb your biscuits and gravy craving in one bite. They hook you up with tons of perfectly scrambled eggs and rosemary potatoes underneath."
5,"Call me crazy for this as a a New Yorker (with our infinite number of restaurants) but it all comes from a good place, to say one thing: Green Eggs Cafe&apos; is probably the best brunch place in Philly. 

Why? Many reasons...

Their food is dependably solid no matter how busy the restaurant becomes. Their drink specials (e.g. iced latte + oat milk) are unique including flavored coffees.
Their presentation is beautiful (see photos).
Their line is long but they seat you fast (unlike Sabrina&apos;s)..
And their service is extremely customer-friendly.

They&apos;ve expanded an outdoor seating area in the back parking lot with a decent view of the surrounding buildings. My only gripe is they&apos;re CASH ONLY but it helps make their prices very affordable. 

After living in Philly for 4+ years, I will always return to Green Eggs. It&apos;s that solid and nostalgic."
5,"YUM. YUM. YUM.

This is one of my favorite brunch spots to bring friends whenever they visit me in Philly. The food is tasty &amp; the portions are a great size. They have lots of options for breakfast &amp; coffee. I haven&apos;t been here during Covid but I believe there is outdoor seating available. 

You will not be disappointed, I promise. Just be sure to go early because there&apos;s typically a pretty long wait but to me, it&apos;s worth it."
5,"This place was recommended by some locals and I&apos;m so happy I met them because this food was sooooooooo good ; I can&apos;t wait to return. 

The presentation was everything as you can see but it was like this for everyone&apos;s meal that came by us. And the taste was unforgettable. JUST GO! 

Stephanie was great and checked in and also the girl with the Hogwarts tattoo was really nice and helpful as well. Overall the staff are wicked nice and I couldn&apos;t get a enough. 

Thank you all so much for a great experience and warm atmosphere!

Oh this place is also CASH ONLY! And they have an atm if you don&apos;t make it this far!"
5,"The three times I&apos;ve visited this highly popular, bustling breakfast/brunch locale, it&apos;s always been worth the trip. Although it does get extremely crowded on the weekends, a little patience goes a long way, and it is absolutely worth it.

My love for skillets is wholeheartedly satisfied by the Kitchen Sink, which I got on two separate occasions, and the Chicken and Waffles Benedict was a healthy (not really) mix of the best parts of sweet and savory. The portion sizes are commendable, and for the price, are absolutely valid.

For a brunch spot, it is definitely one of the best in Philly."
1,"Went there once, pre-Covid, and NOPE not going back even if you paid me.

We go outside, get in line outside when it&apos;s chilly and wait..and wait..

People behind us get to go in, with the person in charge of the list giving us a weak explanation while he probably just wanted the large groups in and out first to maximize profit. 

Cash only in 2020, mandatory tip which is a bit weird but whatever, and the prices? Still pretty high compared to others I had in the area! 

The food...was &quot;okay&quot;. Not super flavorful but not horrible either, just a bit more bland than I expected from a place with so many good reviews. The coffee was whatever, I can think of 3-5 better coffee places in a 2 block radius! 

Summary: Waste of time and waste of money!"
3,"Decided to stop by here in our visit to Philly because of the fun menu! They have such unique options I figured it would be a fun place to try for breakfast.

Upon arriving, there was a lot of construction going on outside and you pretty much have to pass another restaurant to get to this one. The ambiance doesn&apos;t really match the menu. The menu is very exciting and the inside is kind of bland, even the service was good, but it wasn&apos;t like great, it was just straight to the point 

Everyone wears their mask and you may remove them at the table to eat, staff were all wearing mask, as well. 

It is CASH ONLY, 18% fee on tables that spend $50 or more &amp; they do not split the Bill. Fine print that is on the menu 

Food: 
5/5 - $15 - Creme Brûlée French Toast: it was SO good! I am not fond of too much sweet so I couldn&apos;t finish it all, but it was full of delicious flavors, we are so happy we ordered this and I would recommend 

3/5 - $16 - Short Rib Benedict: honestly, it was very underwhelming. I think I was really excited to taste this so I was disappointed when it didn&apos;t meet my expectations, it sounds so good but it was okay! The short rib lacked flavor and the dish just didn&apos;t come together as good as it could 

Oreo &amp; Nutella Latte - $4 each- rated 3/5 - it was good , nothing crazy 

Thank you for reading!"
5,I love your food so much. I want to order every entree every time I dine with you. Eggs Benedict is perfect and every French toast etc is to die for
5,"Keeping it real out here for Philly
We usually have a fun time going here with my family. Quite a long wait, i remembered waited for a good 45 mins on a cold Saturday morning, goes to show how popular the place is. 
We got the few popular signature dishes, sorry don&apos;t quite remember the names now, but one thing I won&apos;t forget is the huge portion they come in. I&apos;m a semi big eater and I barely finished 3/4th of my dish. Price is reasonable in that sense. 
It&apos;s one of my go to brunch place in Philly for sure"
4,"I must say when it comes to French toast this place is a must. French toast here are out of this world. I did order the omelette and I was extremely disappointed. It was very dry. The Potatoes the a company were delicious. Go with the expectation that they are pricey, and is considered cash only. And remember that they tackle on a service fee."
4,"Conveniently located across the street from the Airbnb from where my fiancée and I were staying, we were told by our hosts that it was an absolute MUST that visit here while we&apos;re staying at their place. I can say that after eating their food, I had to agree.

Pricing: The pricing of the food was on par around other restaurants I saw in the area, in the $11-20 range depending on the item. The amount of food that you get for the price was definitely fair. This is a decent sized meal for someone with a hefty appetite, and maybe 2 meals for someone that doesn&apos;t eat as much. 

Food: The food was good. I got the Santa Fe Benedict while my fiancée got the Creme Brûlée French Toast. The benny came with plenty of meat, to the point where I was slightly struggling with finishing it, which was a good sign! The English muffin was replaced by a corn cake which was a great texture change for me. The French toast was cooked really well with a soft inside and a slight crispness to the outside. Along with the maple syrup and berries that came with it, there was plenty of sweetness to go around, but not overwhelming. 

Service: The service was okay. We only had our waiters refill our waters once during our meal, which was a bit of a bummer since the place we were staying at had no drinking water for us so I was trying to stay hydrated when we ate.
 
Overall: This was a great place to eat. I would come back here if I were ever in Philadelphia again. Just make sure to bring cash, or a card to use at their ATM."
5,The service was amazing. We got there 15 min before closing and were afraid they wouldn&apos;t sit us. That wasn&apos;t the case at all. They were happy to put us on the waitlist. We waited about 30 min and not once did we feel rushed. Everything was so delicious!! Definitely will be coming back!
5,"It was an amazing start to a long, hot Philly day. My friend and I were visiting for the weekend and the only breakfast place he wanted to try was here. They currently have outdoor seating, both in the front and the back (which is part of a parking lot). We couldn&apos;t make a reservation, but luckily, we were able to be seated immediately. The place was packed, even though it was 11AM on a Saturday, do Philadelphians not sleep in? 

I looked at the menu and was impressed by the french toast options. Creme brûlée french toast? Say no more. My picture doesn&apos;t do the dish justice, but it was amazing. The french toast was the perfect combination of moist and toast. Although I do wish I asked for the syrup on the side. It was topped with berries and a dollop of whipped cream. The portion is huge for the price, which is always a plus. My friend ordered the ultimate tofu scramble, a great veg/vegan option! I always appreciate a place that includes all people. It came with toast and potatoes. 

They also serve drinks! Definitely come here for a boozy brunch if you&apos;re nearby!"
5,"Highly highly recommend! The food is so delicious and flavorful. Just a little disappointed the restaurant didn&apos;t take us in even though there was 10 mins left before they closed but it was understandable there was a lot of people still waiting to be seated... so I took the Togo order and went to a near by park. 

I would recommend the chicken and waffles and the yummy yummy Oreo drink 

Stuff is very patient and nice even though they get super busy. 

Must try"
2,"Despite the high recommendation from a friend who lives nearby, I was quite disappointed.
I had a very long Sunday planned and wanted to start with a tasty, leisurely breakfast.
On arrival at 9:00 am, the manager asked me to wait a moment while his hostess seated another table.
I was then led to a back room where a monstrous TV was obnoxiously blaring CNN.
I asked for the channel to be changed or at least the volume lowered.
The manager appeared with an attitude and responded that if I didn&apos;t like it, I was welcome to leave.
Because of the high recommendation, I compromised for an outdoor table. 
As I followed the hostess outside with my two travel bags, I did not appreciate her letting the door close on me.

My server was reasonably pleasant, but seemingly overwhelmed by the number of tables. 
Nothing seemed urgent.
My steak and eggs were nothing exciting.
A barely warm and underdone hanger steak that was unseasoned and tough.
I asked for medium plus, I got rare.
My eggs were ordered over medium, but the whites were still runny.
And, my rye bread never saw the inside of a toaster. 
Refills on hot tea were long delayed.
Pepper for seasoning was equally slow to appear and came in stale little white packages.
The sweet n low never showed up.
Finally, it took way too long to get change for my cash-only check.

Notably, the manager was unconcerned with me or other tables complaining about slow service.
Likely because he was at the back of the restaurant practicing his vertical leap trying to touch a ceiling beam.
The only employee who seemed determined and diligent was the busboy who hovered over my table repeatedly trying to clear my table while I was still eating.

I only gave a second star because,  (1) the restaurant has a good location; and, (2) due to the lagging time, I had the opportunity to meet and talk to a really nice couple from NYC.

I don&apos;t know about Philly, but in NYC or Miami, this restaurant would be a total failure with a pending &quot;for lease&quot; sign."
4,"Even though breakfast/brunch is my least favorite meal, I feel like I have a knack for always finding the best spots for it. Our recent trip to Philly was no exception. Loved that they served lunch items during breakfast hours on a weekday. I feel like we could come back 5 more times and still have plenty of dishes we&apos;d want to try. Would love to come back here someday in the future."
4,"Green eggs is a consistent, yummy brunch spot.  Most of the locations get jam packed, even during week days so be prepared to wait. Their creme brûlée French toast has always been a favorite of mine and is large enough to take some home.  It&apos;s cash only so be prepared for cash or to use the atm  on site."
5,Iced latte + oatmeal with oat milk = perfect breakfast. Ordering online is easy- their interface easy to navigate. Pick-up is relatively safe- only one person allowed in at a time to grab your order off the table near the door and scoot right back out. Tables in the park across the street are convenient for breakfast al fresco. Making it work during COVID.
3,"I was hoping to come in for a really spectacular meal aka i was planning on getting some french toast or the red velvet pancakes. However, I chickened out and just got my usual eggs. I think the omelette was ok. I&apos;m not sure why the cheese was not melted and stuffed inside as opposed to just slapped (?) on top. I&apos;m not even sure what the two patties were on the side in retrospect. I can&apos;t say it was a particularly memorable meal. The only thing I do recall is that it is a cash only place so make sure to come prepared! Overall I enjoyed my meal just am not sure I&apos;ll be back."
5,"Always a wait, but always worth it. Staff is friendly, service is quick and efficient, and social distancing is observed to a T. The kicker is definitely the pan sized red velvet pancakes that is good for a table of 4-6, if you even have the stomach space after finishing your entree... Among my favorites include the short rib benedicts (honestly all of the benedicts).. and any of the hashes. Love love love the service and how fair the prices are given how much food there is, and will definitely be back."
