5,"This Thursday I am thankful for Nam Phuong. You are always there for our Vietnamese food needs and cravings. I&apos;m sorry I did not appreciate you more before the pandemic. 

While some restaurants are temporarily closed, and others closing at 8pm, your hours of operation remain the same, 10am to 10pm. We could always rely on you for a late night dinner run, knowing that the most delicious foods would be sitting there waiting for us at pick up. 

Just wanted to give you a big shout out and say thank you from the bottom of my heart. #ThankyouThursday"
5,"Nam Phuong is currently opening for dine-in so I went there to have dinner today. I have heard of Nam Phuong for so long from my Vietnamese fellows but didn&apos;t have a chance to stop by until today. It was pretty empty probably because we are all still strict and cautious about the whole covid situation. But the restaurant does a good job on following Covid guidelines and protocols with social distancing, disinfecting and wearing masks so Io did feel safe. I ordered bo la lot with banh hoi and banh canh cua. Serving was fast, the staff were friendly and the food is delicious. I love it there and will definitely come back."
5,"Love this place.  Along with Viet Huong, Nam Phuong is my go to place for great Vietnamese food.   Like everyone else, they are now Carry-out only for the coronavirus crisis, and they have the protocol down pat.   You must order and provide them with a credit card by phone.   When you walk in, your order sits on a table in a bag with your name on it.    You never get near anyone, just sign and go.  Do them (and yourself) a favor by bringing your own pen!   Thanks to them for staying open during this crisis.  It was a great break from eating at home.  Btw, our favorites are grilled pork vermicelli, salt &amp; pepper squid/seafood/soft shelled crab (your choice), shaking beef."
5,"My parents and I usually get dinner here every time we go to Philly. The taste is very authentic. The quality has slightly gone down over the years but it&apos;s still by far the best place to try viet food in the NE. We usually get the family style for 2 people, which is definitely enough for 3, and substitute the sautéed beef &amp; string beans with the bo luc lac for like $3 more, and it&apos;s totally worth it. 

Recommendations:
Appetizers - Cha Gio, Goi Cuon
Salad (it&apos;s more like a slaw, could be a bit strange to people new to viet cuisine) - Goi Du Du Tom Thit/Ga, Goi Ngo Sen
Vermicelli Wrap - Ba Vi (2+ servings), Tom Thit Nuong, Bo Nuong La, Chao Tom
Rice Vermicelli - Bun Dac Biet (solid option), any vermicelli with either grilled shrimp/pork/meatballs/grape leaves wrapped beef
Thin Soup - Canh Chua Ca (2+ servings)
Broken Rice - Com Tam Suon Bi Cha, Com Tam Thit Nuong Bi Cha
Chicken - Ga Xao Xa Ot
Fish - Ca Kho To (could be hit/miss for non-Viets)
Seafood - Tom Rang Muoi
Beef - Bo Luc Lac (I live for this)
Specials - Bun Cha Hanoi"
5,The bo luc lac was very good and tasty. The meat was also very tender. Excellent Vietnamese coffee!
4,"Another good meal as usual. Had the following dishes: bo luc lac (marinated flank steak cubes), lemongrass chicken, and papaya salad with shrimp and chicken. 

All were quite good with the lemongrass chicken being particularly good (generally prefer this from Vietnam Palace, but just had a pining for it).

Papaya salad (actually most of them in general) is particularly good here in any form and I have also had it with beef jerky in the past, which is quite good, but fairly spicy. Beef cubes were better than usual, being more cooked in the middle and the watercress is good as always, in addition to the lime pepper sauce.

Consistency here can be a bit hit or miss. Bun was really good last time I was here, but sometimes is just OK. Certain dishes are always good (papaya salad, summer rolls), but with many items, I just feel unsure as to how good it will be on a given day."
1,"Unfortunately my time back here was not pleasant to say the least. I had ordered the Hainanese Chicken and had bit into it and thought to myself why is this chicken so chewy. I had bitten the piece off and was mid chew when I looked down to see an almost completely raw piece of chicken on my plate. It could not have been cooked for more than 10 minutes...I was disgusted and spit the chicken out and had ordered a broken rice dish instead. The broken rice was lukewarm and it oddly came out in about 5 minutes. However I just sort of sat there and thought to myself how terrible the food has become. Barely any flavor and the food wasn&apos;t even piping hot. 

What used to be my favorite Vietnamese restaurant had quickly became one of the worst. I&apos;m sad to be giving what used to be a 5 stars in my eyes to a quick 1 star rating...maybe it&apos;s a change of management or a different chef..."
3,"Yesterday was my second time here. The first was not memorable but Sky Cafe (in the same plaza) was not open, so we gave this place another shot. 

The service is very fast, but you do have to ask for water and additional napkins.

We ordered the spring rolls and summer rolls (shrimp only) to share. When we asked for the pork on the side, we found out that the summer rolls are pre-rolled. It does not really have a huge affect on the taste, but just know that it is not freshly made. The sauce for the summer rolls is absolutely amazing, we ended up dipping the fried spring rolls in it as well instead of the fish sauce.

I ordered the rice vermicelli house special that came with a spring roll, grilled shrimp and chicken, and slice sausage/spam. It was okay. there was only two pieces of shrimp and the chicken was a bit on the dry side.

My friends ordered the broken rice, both of them said it was just average and that they had better. The beef was very flavorful, as was the pork, but the chicken can use a bit more flavor."
2,"I was here last month to try the food. The restaurant is always busy and crowded. Food was okay, not great. We tried &quot;bún mam&quot;(Vietnamese fermented fish noodle), &quot;mì xào giòn do bien&quot;, (crispy egg noodle with seafood) and &quot;cua lot xào kieu thái&quot; (soft shell crab Thai style). The only tasty food were the crispy noodle with seafood and the soft shell crab thai style. Bún mam was not great, it did not have the right taste at all. My cousin left the whole bowl of bún mm.

We came back to give this place another chance today. We ordered different food this time. We ordered &quot;mi do bien&quot;, &quot;chao tôm&quot; (Vietnamese grilled shrimp on sugarcane), and &quot;bánh cuon&quot; (steam rice flake roll with miced meat &amp; pork roll)  this time. None of them was tasty. We need fish sauce for bánh cuon and the fish sauce does not taste right at all even though we asked for more. 
Customer service was not so great. They were busy, they have lots of people working,  but they did not care about us at all. We tried to ask for more fish sauce because the fish sauce did not taste right, none of the waiters were willing to help. One of the waiter looked at us and ignored us although we tried to call him couple times (he was standing at the table next to us). Mì do bien has no taste at all compared to mì xào giòn do bien I had last time.

This place may be good for family style food such as canh chua, ca Kho to (which I have not tried yet). So far, the non-family style food does not have the right taste as far as I have been trying. The inside of the restaurant is huge and they do not seem care about us when we try to call them over. The boss seems nice and funny, but the waiters are not that nice.

This restaurant is located in a super busy Asian shopping center, so it&apos;s hard to find a parking lot especially on the weekends."
5,"Favorite Vietnamese restaurant in Philly. Traditional rice and meat dishes are my favorite here. Love their beef cubes and are super authentic. Have not tried their pho. Clean tables, friendly and attentive service!"
1,"Was slowly enjoying my meal.....thank god I&apos;m a slow eater and literally look at every spoon/forkful. Then I saw this. A dead roach. Thank god I noticed it. My first and last time eating at this place. Never in my 35 years have I had this experience.....wouldn&apos;t recommend this place to anyone.


Đang từ từ thởng thức bữa ăn của mình ..... cảm n chúa tôi là ngời ăn chậm và thực sự nhìn vào từng muỗng / nĩa. Sau đó tôi thấy điều này. Một con gián chết. Cảm n chúa tôi đã nhận thấy nó. Lần đầu tiên và lần cuối cùng tôi ăn ở ni này. Cha bao giờ trong 35 năm tôi có trải nghiệm này .... wouldn giới thiệu ni này cho bất cứ ai.



Estaba disfrutando lentamente de mi comida ... gracias a Dios, soy un comedor lento y literalmente miro cada cuchara / tenedor. Entonces vi esto. Una cucaracha muerta. Gracias a Dios lo noté. Mi primera y última vez comiendo en este lugar. Nunca en mis 35 años he tenido esta experiencia ... no recomendaría este lugar a nadie"
4,They have so many of vietnamese restaurants in Philly. We decided to try on Nam Phuong. We got the pho deluxe that have combo on all meats. The meat is a little hard to chew for kids. We ordered the bo lu lac. This dish is really good. My recommendation will be not to order pho dish at this place. There are other places that serve better pho dish.
4,"I had a very solid lunch experience at Nam Phuong with lots of hospitality. As soon as I walked in, I was immediately greeted, sat down, and given a menu with an extensive list of food options. After looking it over I ordered the fried pork lumpia and an order of their seafood rice. Whew, it was just what I needed after not eating all day. 

The lumpia was smack, I don&apos;t know what they seasoned the meat with, but I almost ordered another order to go they were that good.  And as for the rice, I love that they were not stingy with the meat; lots of shrimp, scallops, and crabmeat. After I hooked it up with some vinegar, chili oil, and sweet chili sauce, I was sitting quite right.

Overall, Nam Phuong serves up really good Vietnamese food with hospitable service. Definitely stop by if you&apos;re in the South Philly area."
4,"I was really excited to try this place because it was recommended by a friend and it is located in the Passyunk Square area, which is known for the best place for Vietnamese food in Philly and one of the best in the country. I got there about an hour before closing and they still had about a third of the restaurant filled, so we got seated pretty quickly. The restaurant is huge for a Vietnamese restaurant! I&apos;m originally from New York and there are some great Vietnamese restaurants there, so I ordered the typical pho(noodle soup), summer rolls, and spring rolls to see how they all compare. 

Pho dac biet (deluxe pho) - This bowl included all the items like the eye round steak, well done flank, tendon, beef balls, and tripe. The bowl wasn&apos;t large for a deluxe. Usually this is the biggest size and would come with everything in it. The broth was pretty good, but wasn&apos;t as flavorful as some others ones I&apos;ve had in other states and countries. All the other stuff ingredients inside were good. I don&apos;t think there was anything too special about this - especially for the size of the bowl at that price. 

Summer roll - these come two to an order. They are much smaller than I am used to. They come with shrimp and pork(or chicken if you prefer). The best way is to go with the shrimp and pork. Although the size was smaller, it was delicious! The skin had the perfect chew and it tasted great, especially with the peanut sauce. 

Spring roll - they come two to an order. The spring rolls were much different than what I&apos;m used to. When I saw that they were two to an order, I was surprised. They taste like any other Asian spring roll and not the typical Vietnamese spring roll. It was not a crispy kind of spring roll. It reminded me of a dim sum spring roll or one you would get at a Thai restaurant for a lunch special. I wouldn&apos;t get these again. 

Overall my experience was average, but I can see why it is popular. The service was okay, they were attentive when they wanted to be and they didn&apos;t really say bye to us as we were leaving since they were busy cleaning and closing out. There was nothing that stood out to me too much to want to make the extra drive to go here.... yet. From the looks of what everyone else was eating and the menu, the restaurant was real authentic and it seemed like others were ordering a lot of other Vietnamese dishes besides the pho. How do you not get the pho!? I am willing to take another trip to the restaurant and try some of their other dishes."
4,"This restaurant is huge for its size but its location is located in a busy area and the parking here is just hard! The on-site parking lot is so crowded and narrow. The service here was just average, I felt like they had too many staff compared to the amount of customers during lunch time. Don&apos;t get me wrong, it&apos;s great that there&apos;s so many staff waiting around and are able to help when you call for them right away, but when it&apos;s not so busy, they all just stand there and stare in a way. 

I was there with 3 other people and we all ordered similar but different dishes. I think we all enjoyed our food. I got the vermicelli with grilled pork, the portion was actually pretty big in my opinion. I only finished half of it and was full so I packed the rest. The entree itself was decent, the grilled pork was good. This was the first time ever that I had ordered this at any Vietnamese restaurant so it gave me a good review of the dish itself that I would try this dish at any restaurants."
3,"3.5  Perfectly fine for fast and cheap.

You have to ask for water.

You have to ask for sugar if you&apos;d like some for your hot tea.

There are no utensils at the table, so if you are terrible with chopsticks, raise your hand.

The hoisin sauce had no chopped peanuts in it - a staple at almost every other Vietnamese place I&apos;ve been to.

The other condiment sauce that is slightly sweet yet tart also was missing little piece of pepper or slivers of carrots, something else I normally see in that bowl.

The summer rolls were inexpensive - two for about $3.

I order my standby dish, the grilled pork with noodles, which come with a nice serving of chopped lettuce and carrots.  Generous serving for about $8."
5,One of the best viet restaurants around- huge menu with so many great options. Love the banh Hoi with pork- almost enough for a meal for 2 people. On top of great food the prices per portion are amazing!
4,"I&apos;ve been going to this restaurant for over 10 years and I love their food every time. Used to eat Bun Mam all the time! And recently had canh chua shrimps and ca kho to twice. It&apos;s very good each time. 
It&apos;s in a busy strip so parking can be a pain most of the time. 
Service is too notch. Had been that awesome this 10+ years experience. 
It&apos;s a very busy place so the noise level is high."
4,"This place seems really popular. It&apos;s quite spacious but was pretty packed when we came. There&apos;s a small parking lot, and we were pretty lucky to have found a spot just as someone was leaving; otherwise, I could imagine spending a good 10-15 minutes looking around for street parking. 

Service is really good. Food came out fast. They have a bunch of waiters who always seemed to be hard at work bringing out the dishes or refilling the waters. We got the Ca Kho To - stewed in pottery pot ($11.5), which was pretty good but I think it wasn&apos;t cooked all the way for the sauce to gel to a nice consistency. Otherwise it&apos;s pretty flavorful. The sweet and sour shrimp soup ($13.5) was also pretty good and always complements the former dish well. Wish they&apos;d pack it with more shrimp/vegetables than what we got."
5,"Nam Phuong offers amazing Vietnamese cuisine for the adventurous eater.

They have com tam (broken rice), noodle dishes, pho, steamed and stir-fried meats, and more. Some of our group got the pho (delicious), and the rest of us split one of the multi-course family dinners, which was amazing - particularly if you like to try many different things. The fish in a clay pot and the fried beef cubes were especially good. Prices are reasonable ($10 for a bowl of pho, up to $15 for other entrees).

The restaurant itself is huge, with seating for easily over 100. There are large round tables for big groups, as well as smaller seating arrangements for just one or two. The interior is spacious and nicely decorated, with fun paintings and other trinkets around the restaurant. The staff was a bit inattentive, so you may need to waive them over, if you need something. But they were friendly enough.

Next time you want a Vietnamese feast with a big group, Nam Phuong is your place! Pay a visit, and you won&apos;t be disappointed."
