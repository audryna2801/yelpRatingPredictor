4,"Solid brunch spot with great outdoor dining! 

This place is a gem. I&apos;ve been here a few times always for brunch and have never had a bad meal. Last time I went my boyfriend and I shared the BLT and the Potato Mess and both were great. 

Drink menu is awesome, they have a really good wine list and a great bloody mary (coming from a very picky bloody mary drinker). 

I&apos;ve always found the staff to be friendly and they appear to have been doing a great job observing social distancing &amp; COVID restrictions. Definitely a part of my weekend brunch rotation!"
4,"Came here with some friends during covid for the outdoor dining option. Service was great and everyone was friendly. However, the food was below par of what I expected. 
I ordered the fried chicken waffle and it was average. The chicken was really soggy as too much sauce was dropped onto it. The waffle was also pretty soggy. Overall the meal felt soggy lol"
5,"Just moved to the neighborhood and I knew this would be my first stop based off my roommates&apos; raving reviews. 

It was great to see that there is outdoor seating available post COVID (June 17, 2020). All the servers seemed to be using super safe practices. There are also amazing to-go cocktails available! 

The BLT was delicious! It&apos;s kept me full for three meals now lol :) the full menu wasn&apos;t available unfortunately but I&apos;m excited to try more when it is."
3,"Went here for brunch on Saturday.   Was a 1030 reservation .    We had the choice between an igloo or the larger heated tent.   We opted for the igloo.   It was a nice option it was quite warm in there just from the sun.  We started with drinks had Bloody Mary and a Paloma.   Both were very good.    
     We started with apple cider donut. Pierogi, and fried pickles .   The donuts were fried hard and more like a munchkin than a donut .   Just a fried dough ball.   It was super greasy .    The fried pickles were good despite the breading was coming off of each pickle .    The flavor was good though.  Pierogi was good.  
      We wanted to order lox and bagel but they ran out of bagels.... hmm it was only 1030 and brunch just begins near that time.   We opted for the chicken and waffles, and the chicken and biscuit.   The waffle was good but cold and soggy .   The chicken was a boneless thigh.   Wish that would have been specified on the menu as I would have avoided that.    We also ordered the crab cream soup which was over microwaved and they added milk to bring it back to life but it was terribly runny.   So they comped the soup as it was inedible. 
      The food was just OK .   Most disappointed by the way it was served .   Plastic ware and paper cardboard boats.    The fork was so cheap it was all bent halfway through breakfast.   I understand pandemic and the need to adopt and adapt your business but when quality control is compromised the experience changes.   
        The service was extra good.   Server knowledgeable and very mindful of space and time.   She offer suggestions that were spot on.   You have good service but food could use some more love and attention.     For three brunch was 124.00 with tip .    Fairly average price for brunch."
5,Great drinks and food make this place one of our favorite hangout spots! We have yet to have anything that wasn&apos;t amazing. I personally love their fried pickles covered in this crispy cornmeal coating and paired perfectly with their tangy sauce. Their chicken sando is also out of this world - thick-cut bacon on top of a perfectly fried juicy piece of chicken. The service here is also great! We had the bartender serve us a couple of times and they always surprise us with their amazing drinks.
5,"Fantastic. Outside seating while it was a bit cold, but they were on top of it with individual table heaters. We got the &quot;crabby dick&quot; and &quot;potato mess&quot;...both delicious! Add to that the old bay tots and this place was a winner! Can&apos;t wait to come back!"
5,Hawthornes has always been great for brunch! Their Covid preparations were on point. I appreciated them using cardboard plates instead of plastic and still having bottle purchases available. South of the border is one of my favorite meals. Very flavorful and not too spicy! I will always recommend this spot!
5,Cute spot with awesome igloo seating. Great service great food. We were seated right away on Saturday night and got amazing food. I loved my chicken and waffles and the wings were sooooo tender and delicious.
4,"Brunchin Munchin! These brunch devours come from @hawthornesbeercafe ! Hawthornes is known for its why variety of craft beers and their infamous brunch menu. Every fall they hold an annual beer fest that takes up the entire 11th St. However due to COVID-19 this year they were unable to do so. They offer only outdoor dining. My server was new however she was very experienced and we went to the menu together which was pretty dope. However, I ordered the Caesar salad with fresh anchovies that was freaking amazing! Then I ordered the grilled lemon salmon with vegetables. The salmon was grilled to perfection with Lemon zest and seasoning. The salmon literally melted in your mouth. If you ever find yourself in South Philly and wanting a really dope affordable brunch spot please check out @hawthornesbeercafe ! Oh duh! Tell them Shimmy sent you! #brunch #mimosa #fish #salmon #salad #water #philadelphia #philly #food #foodie #foodphotography #foodstagram #foodblogger"
4,"So it&apos;s Date Night 
Me and my boyfriend decided to try out this place cause we enjoying going to places that don&apos;t have a ridiculous waiting time in Philly. Due to COVID, you have the outdoor seating choices of either tents or around heating towers. We made reservations just to be on the safe side, but there was definitely no waiting time for walk-ins. Our server Matt was super friendly and had even gave great menu choices. We started off with the Garlic Hot wings, which I must say was pretty good! I would&apos;ve preferred them to be a bit crispier and more saucy, but overall the taste was great. I had the Philly Chicken Sandwich, which was definitely tasty, fresh, and will fill your appetite. It comes with a choice of house made chips or tater tots; I prefer a side of fries which was something I didn&apos;t like. My boyfriend had the same, but instead made his sandwich spicy with their Garlic Hot sauce. We didn&apos;t try any of their drinks or beers, but they did have a wide selection. The food came out super fast and was displayed great on the cardboard plates lol( thank you COVID). Will try the breakfast menu next time I go! Overall you  won&apos;t be disappointed trying out this spot in Philly."
4,"They are doing great with social distancing and following protocol .... the staff is friendly and genuine.  I felt very safe dining her and so much so that I&apos;ve been two weekends in a row. 
Oh, and the food is great.  I live a few blocks away and I chose to make the leap and have a sit down meal last weekend. Their Southwest Salad is delicious, I order mine topped with salmon.  The flavors all work well together or a satisfying lunch that&apos;s not so heavy. 
They have a huge selection of wines and beers and a ... FULL BAR!!"
5,"Came here yesterday with a few friends. They have a huge amount of outdoor setting and hand sanitizer by the reservation place. 

I got the blackened mahi mahi tacos. The tacos contain a decent size slice of fish. Nicely cooked, a little overdone, but still good. The fish was mild in flavor. The sauce was good and paired well with the pickled onions. The only thing that I would like is having a bit of kick to the taco. Sometimes the fish can easily get lost in the pickled red cabbage. A small kick in the sauce or seasoning would help a lot, which loses out on that Cajun spices.

Overall friendly service that adheres to COVID-19 regulations really well and good food. The pricing for the food was fair. Definitely want to come back and try their breakfast!"
4,"The breakfast burrito is delicious but small, a perplexing fact when they decided to name it &quot;Juan&apos;s big burrito.&quot; I do appreciate that they serve brunch until 4pm (Tuesday-Sunday).

THE PROS: The flavor of this is absolutely delicious, and includes egg, sautéed red onions and peppers, corn (roasted?), black beans, cheese, and bits of some mildly spicy pepper (jalapeño?). I added bacon and asked for it extra crispy -- the crispness was delivered. It comes with a red salsa that&apos;s smokey and slightly sweet and a &quot;cilantro sour cream&quot; that tastes more of onions than cilantro, but is ok either way. 

THE CONS: If I had to guess, I&apos;d say it came with 2 small, crumbled strips of bacon at the absolute most, and I&apos;m not sure the corn or black beans added much flavor. The side of fried potatoes had a nice flavor, but were super oily. At $17, it was tiny. 

I might have given it 5 stars if had more bacon, and its size matched its price."
5,"I absolutely love this place! Used to live right down the street and would frequent for breakfast foods and their burgers. Their fries and home fries are soooo freakin good! 

Very cozy environment with an updated interior including 2 bars with an amazing selection of local beers. 

One of my absolute favorite spots to grab a casual bite in the city. If you are in the Hawthorne area is this place is a must."
5,"Beautiful ambiance, great service, delicious chicken salad sandwich, and very comfortable! Had such a great time. Can&apos;t wait to be back!"
5,"Yasss! Simple no fuss, homey place for breakfast, lunch or dinner. They have both outdoor and indoor seating, the indoors is super cozy with a fireplace a high top table and counter seating. The menu has a great breakfast selection as well as brunch items. We have been here twice and it&apos;s been a big hit both times! 
I love the hot potato mess! The fried chicken and waffle is delicious, breakfast nachos are soooo good! 
Coffee is fresh and service is on point!"
1,"I will never eat anything out of this restaurant. I ended up wanting to treat myself to a new place for breakfast. I ordered the hot mess which was an accurate term for the dish. The positive was my order was sent hot.  The downside was half cooked bacon and discovering a birthday candle in my food. It wasn&apos;t my birthday at all and even If it was I wouldn&apos;t want a candle in anything beyond cake. This candle was dirty and clearly used.  It seemed to have bite marks on it. I called the restaurant to let them know what happened.

I was met by a very ignorant and condescending manager who was talking to me like I was slow. I was told they don&apos;t even have candles in the restaurant. Giant Red flag. As I&apos;m continuing to tell her how disturbing the situation is and she&apos;s telling me they don&apos;t have candles, she gets upset. She tells me even if it was done it wouldn&apos;t be done maliciously. I&apos;m not sure what&apos;s going on in the kitchen but they need to up their sanitation practices along with customer services. I ended up throwing food in the trash."
4,"I came here with a large party (about 10 people) one evening and we were the only people in the whole place. The wait staff were very friendly and attentive and gave great service. The self-serve beer fridges were really cool and everyone enjoyed the vibe. The food was fresh and came out in a timely manner.

The reason I&apos;m only giving 4 stars though is because someone in my party was up the whole night with food poisoning. She was the only one who got sick thankfully, but it was not a good experience for her. And personally, it makes me less inclined to go back."
5,"I&apos;ve been living in Philadelphia for a year.  Coming from a town in northern NJ, I&apos;ve struggled to find a place as good as my [Morristown] local favorites.  

Until today.  This place has amazing food and a great menu! 

And,  even though we&apos;re still dealing with Covid restrictions,  the service was great all around.  Shout out to our amazing server,  Shannon,  for the best service I&apos;ve had to date in Philly! 

I&apos;m definitely going to be a regular at this place!

Oh,  and I highly recommend their sparkling rose.  (Just a side note)"
4,"Hawthornes was a great option for brunch, because they have some really tasty southern choices like chicken and waffles! They also are pretty busy for brunch so I would definitely make a reservation ahead of time!

I ordered the rosemary&apos;s bagel, which  was good, but hard to eat. I also thought the potatoes were going to be on the side. My friend ordered the open faced crab omelette, and it was good! I would order that next time."
