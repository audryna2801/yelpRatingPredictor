5,"Im an italian whose fathers side is from philly. I was hungry for real italian sfogliatelle so I looked online and found Termini Bros and they could ship these delicious pastries right to my front door.
OF COURSE i ordered them and they arrived today in perfect condition due to the tray they use to pack them in. EACH large sfogliatelle was in absolute perfect condition and all I need to do is bake them for a few minutes to make them oven crispy and dust them with some powered sugar and eat!
I am so grateful that Termini Bros delivers all the way to florida during this pandemic. I cant wait to try one as they are made in philly and the altitude and water is different than floridas water and sea level altitude.
Thanks Termini Bros for letting me have a true italian delicasy delivered to my doorstep! Stay well!"
5,"As someone who, quoting Tony Soprano is from Elvis Country where there are no Jews or Italians, Termini Bro&apos;s bakery is like a celebration of Italian pastries and desserts. Everything I&apos;ve read and heard about can be found here, and the smell is absolutely intoxicating. Going through Reading, you&apos;ll be spoiled for choice, but once you smell the butter and sugar that&apos;s around the stall, you&apos;ll have to make a stop here.

The cannoli&apos;s here are a bit smaller than I&apos;m used to (don&apos;t blame me, I&apos;m used to Texas sized portions) but it really is quality over quantity. There&apos;s that golden ratio of the cannoli shell to the filling that they do right, and you don&apos;t feel like you&apos;re eating cheese with a bit of pastry. Even though the Italian&apos;s stole pasta from us, admittedly they do desserts brilliantly. The sweetness is that level where you are enjoying it, and it&apos;s not too much and not overpowering that you just want to eat more and more.

I won&apos;t say that Termini was the deciding factor for me to move up to Philly, but I&apos;m glad that little shops like this exist in this amazing city. If you&apos;re visiting, be sure to stop by and try their pastries. Next on my list is, sfogliatella, or schfoyadelle for fellow Soprano&apos;s fans."
3,"My family has been a customer of Termini since before
My time in the 1970&apos;s.  (Family is from JA).  We always loved their items and still do.  We often patronised their site when it was across from quarter master.   I love their cannolis and what we get mostly is the cheesecakes, cupcakes and cakes.  NOW, this review is on their layered buttercream cakes.   I am not sure if they changed the recipe or made changes on proceeds but this cake is not as good as it is used to be and their
Icing/frosting is started to taste waxy.  This year my bday cake doesn&apos;t taste the same. The cake taste rough, dry and dense...if they read this I hope they go back to how they originally made these cakes.  Otherwise great selection, staff and a lot of variety."
4,"So many options it&apos;s almost overwhelming! I tried the tiramisu, which was perfect. I enjoyed the classic flavors, but with the extra bedazzle. It was dense but very good. It even had a little coffee bean in the middle.

I was not a fan of the cannoli at all. When I got there, they would fill the shells after I ordered. However, the shells were not crispy when I tried them, and the filling upset my stomach. Maybe I&apos;ll give them a second chance in the future."
5,Honestly didn&apos;t love the selection or taste of the Italian cookies but 5 stars due to the best cannoli I&apos;ve ever had in my life. Fresh and perfect taste. Amazing amount of cream.
5,"I don&apos;t care what anyone says! I will fight, argue and cuss! Terminis is the best Bakery in Philadelphia hand&apos;s down! When I was a kid attending school nearby, as we walked past the bakery Mr. Termini would always give us one of the pastries to try (which probably led to my obesity lmao I&apos;m not anymore), nevertheless my childhood was very happy . Thank you Mr. Termini for contributing to my life. You don&apos;t think about these things until you get older and go back and take your grown kids. You know what I absolutely adore about Termini, &quot;Tradition&quot;! The Italian Way, OMG, how I miss that. They kept the recipes in tact and the store. I can return with my grandchildren and tell them my Mr. Termini story, those were great childhood memories. The customer service is always amazing!! I let them know I was an old South Philly girl, and badda bing badda boom, lol. Unfortunately, I can no longer enjoy the deliciousness delicacies of Termini, but alas my dears I will always grace them with my presence and so should you!"
3,"I have been a local customer for many years and for the last 4 years I have bought cupcakes for my son&apos;s team here for his birthday. This year, getting them was a week long process. The cupcakes are great, pricy but great.. However, the customer service has become dry and not eager to accommodate."
4,"Love the desserts here! I loved the $6 cakes, so beautiful and tastes delicious. My favorites are the carrot cake and the red velvet. So moist and perfectly sweetened. This is also my go to stop for cannolis! For only $4, you can have a freshly piped cannoli that would leave you wanting more!

Must visit when in Philadelphia"

11/2019

I visited the Reading Terminal Market location a ton of times and really liked their baked goods

I had company from out of town so decided to check out this location.  I&apos;m so glad I did as everything about my visit was amazing.  

Tons of parking in their huge lot next door. This is huge as this location is located in a &quot;I wish I had a driveway&quot; location.  Otherwise I&apos;m not sure if we could visit. 

Arrived 30 min before closing and you couldn&apos;t tell as it we never felt rushed.  

The staff even took us to the back baking area so my son could fill a cannoli.   As an avid baker I was in heaven.    It was cool to see the backroom and all the tools and supplies. 

We picked up a ton of items such as mini cakes, cannolis, cupcakes, chocolate bananas .. just to name a few.    Everything was amazing that my cousin stopped in again the next day to bring home goodies to her family in NH. 

My first experience was top notch and I am sad I lived in the area for a decade and never visited.  

I&apos;ll be back"
5,"Italian pastry heaven. Every visit to my hometown, this is a must stop. 

This location has an old school bakery atmosphere. Upon walking in, I was greeted by Nancy who was dressed in white bakers garb. Even though I knew what I wanted, I circled around the open display of various pastries. There were also an array of cakes and cookies in closed displays as well. 

I happily decided on some traditional cannolis and sfogliatelles! They were all neatly placed in boxes and tied with string. Nancy was also kind enough to let me try a pignoli and holy cow, they were the most delicious cookies I&apos;ve had in a long time, maybe ever. She also asked if I was there alone, I told her my brother was with me and she handed him one to try as well. 

Though I wasn&apos;t there for long, Nancy was a great conversationalist. I thought this place was great, but she made the experience pleasantly greater. Price is reasonable. I walked out with 5 cannolis and 3 sfogliatelle for $40.

Worth adding that everything is delicious. I brought the cannolis back home to VA and everyone was very impressed. The filling was so smooth, creamy. I&apos;ve had awful cannolis before where it was gritty or not sweet enough. Go to Termini Bros. Bakery and it will not disappoint."
5,"One of my favorite local pastry shops. I always get requests to bring our family favorites for the holidays and I&apos;m here at least once a week. The cakes and pies are delicious, but my usual weekly order is the biscotti. They each have their own unique flavors and textures. My favorites are the quarsemalli and the pignoli.

Some other family favorites are the fig bars, sfogliatelle, and the pecan bars. 

The bones cookies are a nice treat this time of year!"
5,"While this business has gotten corporate and expanded throughout Philadelphia, Termini offers a one-of-a-kind authentic Italian bakery experience at it&apos;s Queen village Italian market location. I was offered a pretty awesome tour of how the business bakes goods for it&apos;s locations in popular spots such as Reading Terminal and Suburban Station.

There&apos;s a very unique cookie bar where you can pick and choose assortment of delicious cookies and baked goods. However I found that the real gem was a tiramisu cake that was made with a delicious flair of coffee flavoring and cream.

the prices are relatively reasonable with cakes running between four and $5 for a personal size and approximately $20 for sizes to share. Mamma Mia you better come on down!"
5,Jim was very helpful and made us feel as a priority. He was kind enough to add freshly cut strawberries on top of our cheesecakes. Jim even proceeded to make small talk with as us we waited for our cakes. Jim is a example of what true customer service should look like. -NorthFace Gang
5,I&apos;m not usually the biggest cannoli fan but I must say this is worth the hype. The cream was not too sweet and possessed a strong vanilla bean flavor. The pastry was just crunchy enough and it came together perfectly in my mouth. The service staff were polite and helpful.
4,"Friendly bakery! Even my 8 year old nephew said wow they are really nice. 

I came to Termini&apos;s Bros Bakery because I love cannoli&apos;s and churros! but were talking about cannoli&apos;s today and I heard this bakery had the best ones in South Philly.

As I entered the store it was very large and the layout consisted of different baked goods, some were on an open display and the others were behind the counter. There was also staff that walked around in old fashioned 50&apos;s hat and attire as a matter of fact the whole shop gave me a 50&apos;s vibe.

Overall after 10 minutes of indecisiveness and every 5 seconds of grabbing my 3 year old neice hands each time she felt the urge to reach for the goodies on the open display. I decided to get the vanilla Italian cream cannoli, a mini red velvet cake and two free cupcakes for the kids! 

Everything was delicious and there&apos;s a parking lot on the right of the shop."
5,"I was in town visiting and asked a friend on a must have local bakery/dessert place that was a Philly staple item. He recommended this place and I&apos;m so happy that I was able to get here before leaving town. This is definitely an authentic bakery with history. They have a couple of locations and attempted to go to the closest one to me but I couldn&apos;t get to it because of parking and time. I ended up driving a little further to the original location. I was immediately greeted and someone came out to box the items that I was selecting, they were extremely helpful. The treats were absolutely amazing! I loved everything I chose and even brought back some to the office for my co-workers. The cupcakes were perfection - the buttercream icing was amazing and the cake itself was nice and moist."
4,"I didn&apos;t get chance to visit the store, but I stopped by their stall during the Italian Market Festival. There were plenty of enticing desserts and pastries to choose from, but I just had to go for the classic cannoli!

I heard good things about it from my friends, and I was not disappointed. It was a top-notch cannoli, with a crunchy shell and smooth creamy filling. Add a couple more handfuls of mini chocolate chips and it would&apos;ve been perfect!"
5,"Best cannoli of all time. Been going here my whole life. As a Philadelphian and Italian I take two foods more seriously than any others: the cannoli (Italian invention) and the cheesesteak (Italian American invention). You could basically bury me at one of the two places I love. For cheesesteaks it&apos;s the White House Sub Shop in AC. For the cannoli, it&apos;s here. What else can I say? The shell is crispy not soggy. Get the ricotta filling (don&apos;t screw this part up). They have a huge assortment of other baked goods that are all really incredible. I love the Italian cheesecake and there&apos;s this chocolate dipped banana thing that you would never think is nearly as good as it really is. Just show up alone with 30 bucks and go crazy one day you won&apos;t regret it or forget it."
5,"The best Italian bakery in Philadelphia, hands-down, more words words words words words because it won&apos;t let me post without lots of words words words words, and more words words words"
4,"The cannoli was great. The cream was light and not too sweet. The cookie was crumbly and yummy. Then I had this orange cranberry maybe? biscotti. That was eh... It was too sweet and the sweetness overpowered the cookie. However, the texture was spot on."
