5,"TLDR; Amazing coffee, baked goods, people!

I&apos;ve been stopping by Nook 1-5 times a week for the last 5 years. If you&apos;ve never been, do yourself the favor and stop by. No matter what you&apos;re interested in, there&apos;s something for you at Nook.

Love coffee? Mike roasts the coffee in shop and is extremely knowledgeable about it.  It&apos;s delicious and cool if you&apos;re a coffee nerd. It&apos;s easy to order their beans online, too. 

The baked goods! Edna makes the best baked goods! The muffins at Nook are easily the best muffins in the city. The scones are crumbly and never dry; and the croissants are perfectly flaky. Don&apos;t forgot to take home a quiche, too. The hidden gem of Nook, however, is the specialty order. The pies and cakes are amazing. My last 3 birthday cakes have come from Nook and they are always on point. 

Great coffee, great food, and the owners are wonderful people, too. If you read the reviews for Nook, you&apos;ll see that mentioned again and again. Edna and Mike are hard working and always smiling. And Edna will never forget your name. 

Note for COVID times, Nook is doing a great job with touches service. You call and place your order at the window, they bring it to you at the door and take your payment. It&apos;s easy and feels safe."
5,"You know how you know this place is bomb? There&apos;s a Starbucks and a Dunkin on either side, and they&apos;re still in business during a freaking Pandemic. Enough said. 
We buy 2 bags of coffee every week! Edna is the best! Such a great neighborhood spot. The mocha is literally the best you&apos;ve ever had in your life. I&apos;m not kidding! All the little baked goods, and quiche, CANT GO WRONG! Seriously terrific! Thank you for keeping us caffeinated, and sugared up! Do yourself a favor and get something here."
5,Stopped by today to pick up expression chocolate chip and banana chocolate chip muffins. Got there around 7:30am an the muffins were still warm. Some of the best muffins I&apos;ve ever had! Moist on the inside with a crust on the outside. Rich flavor and not crumbly like some other muffins I&apos;ve had. Will definitely be back!
5,"After constantly passing Nook on our walk home, my boyfriend and I finally stopped by after our workout. We usually go to the Starbucks just a few steps away.... We have already gone to Nook twice in three days. 

My boyfriend said it was the best Pumpkin Spice Latte that he&apos;s ever had - (and we LOVE that we can still get our favorite flavor in February). 

They are sustainably sourced and make their own coffee. LOVE THAT - but to make things better, the workers couldn&apos;t be sweeter either.

Definitely give Nook a try - you will not be disappointed."
4,"Nook is a small and cute bakery. There is some seating here, with a couch at the back area which is great for groups.
I came here to get coffee and a turkey sausage cheese sandwich. They have many types of coffee here- pour over coffees, iced coffees, nitros, or normal drip coffee. I had an ordinary drip coffee and it was great!
The sandwich was delicious too. If you eat this, you won&apos;t be able to eat at McDonald&apos;s. This is far fresher and better. 
They also sell a variety of baked goods like cakes and cookies. The cashier was very nice and seemed to know a lot of her regulars by name.
I will definitely be back."
4,"Wanted a nice place to sit, drink coffee, and work while visiting Philly so I stopped by this place! There are not a ton of tables to work at but it is a cute little coffee shop with free wifi. The iron chairs are a bit uncomfortable to sit on for long periods and there aren&apos;t a lot of outlets.

I ordered a blueberry crumble bar and a latte. The crumble bar had a great blueberry flavor, but was a little mushier than I typically like my pastry bars. I was a little disappointed they only serve their drinks in paper cups instead of ceramic. The latte was average with a semi-smooth foam and moderate coffee flavor. 

Overall a great little coffee shop in Philly to get your caffeine and sugar fix!"
5,"Been walking past this little cute bakery every day for a year. Finally decided to stop pass one day as I was looking for Tiramisu and Matcha Latte. As I enter, i was greeted immediately by the cashier. She was eager to help me order as it was my very first time. 

When I ask for the Japanese Matcha Latte, she told me it was made with soy based, I guess just in case I have a soy allergy. Then she explained their variety of milk they carried, I chose oats milk, bc they make drinks on the sweeter side. While she was making my latte, I was looking at their cakes. Couldn&apos;t resist Tiramisu and the chocolate banana cookie for my hubby. 

I have to say, everything were made to perfection!! Or for me, just right. The Matcha Latte weren&apos;t overly sweet or unsweetened. Tiramisu were bitter(bc of the cocoa top coat) and creamy at the same time, so it kinda balanced perfectly. 

I would love to sit in one day as their sitting section got a very cozy feel."
5,"I absolutely love this neighborhood find. It&apos;s close to the business district so it doesn&apos;t have the residential street scene that some do, but it more then makes up for that in everything else. From day one I was greeted like an old friend. Everyone is, the staff is so welcoming. Coffee lovers, hold on tight. This joint roast their own on premises. That&apos;s right! As such, the selection is unique, varied, and wide. Now for the baked goods. You&apos;d be surprised at this selection as well. And yes, also prepared on premises. Everything from muffins and cakes to imaginative cookies and chocolate truffles. I can&apos;t leave out pecan bars, lemon bars, and tiramisu. Aside from baked goods and coffee, they also serve a few breakfast items and a few lunch items. I highly recommend you check them out. House brew coffee with a cowboy cookie is my favorite."
4,"Lovely spot to stop for an oatmilk latte if you&apos;re in need! I was a little disappointed that they didn&apos;t offer cold brew, but the iced coffee tasted great! I also enjoyed a cowgirl cookie -- seemed like I was catching the tail end of the sweets and pastries for the day, but it seems as though they have lots of options! 

A nice break from the usual Starbucks you normally found too many of. Glad we stopped!"
5,"Wow, Nook Bakery &amp; Coffee Bar was simply extremely good. Delightful menu items at great prices, amazing mood to unwind at. Everything is yummy! Service was good and every one working here was incredibly nice and helpful. All in all Nook Bakery &amp; Coffee Bar has great experience, great staff, great spot, affordable price."
4,"Really cute, quaint coffee shop offering both chocolates and coffee.

Atmosphere: The couches made the area felt very cozy and friendly, and they offer desks and electrical outlets too for anyone who needs to do work. When I came in the afternoon, the shop was relatively quiet, which is great for getting work done. With the additional comfy seating they offer, it&apos;s a really nice place to catch up with friends as well!

Food: Personally, I thought the latte I got was average and tasted a bit diluted, so I probably wouldn&apos;t go back for their drinks. The coffee did come out very quickly, though. Also, they did have a really cute assortment of all their chocolates, including hand-made truffles, which I would love to try next time! The assortment of pastries included several gluten-free options (predominantly fudge) that looked delicious, and very affordable ($1-2). 

Overall: , mostly for the atmosphere and variety of pastry options they offered! I think there are better places in the city for coffee, but I&apos;d come back to try their desserts."
4,"This place fits it&apos;s name perfectly! It&apos;s such a quaint, cozy coffee shop off of Market Street.

I stopped in here to pass some time and decided to get an iced matcha latte with almond milk. It was delicious! Not at all like the processed, sugary matcha powder at Starbucks.

I only regret having eaten breakfast beforehand, because the collection of pastries looked delicious - especially the coffee mocha bread! 

Between the friendly staff and the great matcha, I will definitely be back (next time with an empty stomach!)"
4,"I was taking a mental health day off from work because i hadn&apos;t used a vacation day in a while. Decided to commit to trying out a new gem and whipped out my handy dandy Yelp app. 

I wanted somewhere with a cool vibe, cozy and inviting yet would put me in the mood to read/get some work done...with a good cup of coffee in hand. I definitely got that here. This place epitomizes service with a smile. They&apos;re efficient and my chai latte was YUM (best I&apos;ve had in quite some time) and I liked how they asked me up front what kind of milk I wanted. (Also I think good coffee temperature is underrated; I&apos;ve been to a lot of places where the non plain black coffees are lukewarm by the time they&apos;re done with their &apos;art&apos;.) I got some reading done, and some people watching by the big window facing the street. 

The furniture is a little worn..almost shabby to he honest, in a &quot;well loved&quot; sort of way. There is a ton of artwork on the bathroom walls; looked like they were for sale but I personally wouldn&apos;t purchase anything that&apos;s been in a public restroom. Instead of all the art, I&apos;d rather have a mirror in the bathroom (there isn&apos;t one so couldn&apos;t retouch my lipstick as I wanted). I also wish the hand dryer didn&apos;t blow ice cold air on to my already freezing hands... especially if there is no paper towel option."
5,My favorite coffee place even during Covid they service is awesome and the coffee and treats always fresh and yummy
4,"If you are looking for cute little cafes in the city, you just found one! Nook is the perfect name for the place because it is literally a little nook in the big city. I work around the corner from Nook Cafe and am always pleasantly surprised by what a nice escape it is from the hustle and bustle of the city.

Whenever I go to Nook the staff are always genuinely friendly, a rare treat in Philadelphia. Most cafes in the area don&apos;t really care how I am doing but the baristas at Nook always ask and make small talk. They are really sweet.

I have to admit, I didn&apos;t like the decaf espresso that I had. I am not sure why it just tasted a little &quot;bleh&quot;. The other foods look pretty good, I just never had them. They offer all kinds of sweets that look like they go really well with your morning cup of coffee. If I needed a place to sit down for a snack with some coffee and do work on my computer or have an informal meeting I would definitely consider Nook."
5,"Super cute little coffee shop near rittenhouse that&apos;s not too busy. The ambience was nice here to sit with a coffee and chat with a friend since it&apos;s not overly crowded and the coffee is great!

They roast their own beans and have a different special coffee every week. Their baked good selection is also pretty large, and they even have breakfast Sammies. Quite a lot for such a small place. 

The staff were also very friendly and made accommodations to my drink requests. We also got the Greek yogurt parfait which was delicious - I would highly recommend. 

Overall, I think the highlight of this cafe is the fact that it&apos;s not always packed like a lot of mainstream cafes so it really does feel like a more relaxed, chill vibe. 5/5 for sure as far as cafes go!"
5,"I must say this was the first egg, cheese and veggie sausage that i truly enjoyed!!  I also love how efficiently they make everything.  The eggs are actually cooked, not just microwaved (or at least it tastes that well!) Also the iced matcha latte unsweetened with oat milk is delicious as well.  I walk by this place everyday and now it will be SO hard not to stop in every day (and maybe even multiple times a day!)"
5,"Love this little cafe! Discovered it when in Philly for the marathon and came back a second time. Friendly, environmentally conscious and great coffee. Highly recommend!"
3,Very friendly service . Canele: it has hard shell and not too moist. Tiramisu: pretty good but the mascarpone is light. The lady finger is the best part with perfect sweetness.
5,"Edna is the best! I am never disappointed at Nook - whether it&apos;s a coffee, latte, or pastry, everything is always wonderful!"
