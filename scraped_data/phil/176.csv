5,"The burger was fantastic! I was feeling weak all over from a cold/flu, the chicken soup&apos;s not doing it so I ordered the burger/fry to get some strength/energy back. The fries were still a little crispy outside when it arrived and the seasoning was perfect. The burger was fantastic, can confirm I still have my sense of taste thus it&apos;s not covid. The meat is pink in the middle but cooked outside, the sauce, pickle, onion and other condiments blend perfectly. Not too greasy, not too salty, not dry and very flavorful. Nothing more you can ask of a burger.

If you hesitate on getting delivery for burgers &amp; fries, try get them here, it&apos;ll be worth it."
5,"Stopped by here for a beer after work with a co worker.  Sadly the inside is not open due to COVID19, but they had a nice seating are outside.  The server made sure we had a heater for seating space and was very attentive.
We got the tater tots with garlic aoili to snack on and several beers.  The beers were quite good and the tots were great.  
All in all a very nice place.  When I head back this way, I will definitely visit again."
5,"I love this bar. They have a great beer AND cider list. The atmosphere is cool and casual. The brunch menu is pretty fab. And as a Celiac, I so appreciate their fried chicken Tuesday&apos;s. And it&apos;s amazing. The sides are also always amazing. I would be there every night if the regular menu had a few more gluten friendly items. I don&apos;t always want a steak or burger without the bun. It&apos;s not that hard to do. Hell, put the chiquiles on the regular menu and I&apos;m your new best customer!

Updated Note- awesome outdoor set up during Covid!"
5,Incredible food. Particularly the mac n cheese and burger. Fair price on the beer too. Can&apos;t recommend this place enough.
4,"What a nice spot to sit outside! Not too crowded, tucked on a quieter street. The wait staff were wearing masks and were very polite. We ordered all the bites on the happy hour menu because why not !!! All delicious! Also got two drinks, the philadelphia punch and the blackberry tart beer, both very tasty! My sister got the watermelon spritz which was also great! I&apos;d come back for another happy hour with friends!"
1,"We were seated right away; loved the ambiance--low lighting, fun place to chat.

Ordered drinks, mine was an Old Fashioned which was fine; ordered the Mac n cheese w mushrooms, my friend got the mushroom &quot;cheesesteak,&quot; and we got the pretzel bites w beer cheese to share. First off, the pretzel bites were weird  because the pretzels were soft/saut√©ed in butter, and had way too much salt on them. The cheese sauce was fine. 

The mushroom Mac n cheese was disgusting; the cheese sauce was super soupy, the mushroom flavor overpowering (and I LOVE mushrooms!!) I can eat like a truck driver, so you know it&apos;s bad when I leave half my meal untouched. 

My friend&apos;s meal: the fries were squishy, undercooked, and covered in this weird green powder neither of us could place. The mushroom cheesesteak lacked flavor and was, as she put it, &quot;not bad, but not great either.&quot;

Before we left I used the restroom nearest the kitchen. First off, you can see a sliver of the bar through the &quot;closed&quot; and bolted door, so I imagine that goes both ways. The soap was out--hope the kitchen staff weren&apos;t using that bathroom!--and it&apos;s pretty gross when you have to shove your hand between the towel dispenser and the wall to get the towel crank to work. Gross. 

Would not go back, would not recommend."
4,"Great ambience! Food was good too! We got the shrimp po boy, pretzel bites with cheese, and a chicken app.. would definitely come back ... chill bar to have great conversations with friends
Drink was yummy too!"
4,"Three words - bacon, fat, popcorn. 

Each word can stand alone in the gastronomy world but they create a tripod of deliciousness that is complimentary of the house when you take your seat for dinner. So if that&apos;s not enough to get you in the door, maybe you should make like a tree...and get out. Kidding, not kidding. OK let&apos;s review....

My brother and I came here prior to seeing a show at the newly renovated Met on Broad St. 

#1. Because the Met (as cool of a venue as it is) is in a dead zone when it comes to night life (this is a half mile away). 

#2. Because I have a soft spot for good food and beer and that is what Pro Taproom seems to be known for. 

So did they check off both boxes - oh you know they did. 

The beer selection is modest with some local guys on tap as well as some tasty suds from afar. They also have happy hour 5-7 which includes $4 select drafts. 

As for the food, the fried chicken seems to be the top choice here. We both ordered the Southern fried chicken sandwich - a boneless thigh with cheddar, pickles and Szechuan aioli. We both agreed that is was good...not great. The chicken was a bit dry and after eating this sandwich, I can confirm that cheese doesn&apos;t belong on a crispy chicken sandwich (at least not on mine). We decided that if we were to come back, we would order the actual fried chicken to split which is available on Tuesday night. 

Service was great. Music was great. And in case you&apos;re wondering, our show was great. This is one of the finer tap rooms in the city and one that I wouldn&apos;t mind returning to."
3,"Came in for some drinks and food with friends around 10ish on a Friday evening. The place was rather slow, so we were seated immediately. They had some nice beer options on the menu, but about 5 options were not available. Our waiter Trish was accommodating and allowed us to sample some of the beers and walked us through the food menu. 

My 2 friends ordered the chicken sandwich which sounded good, but on the contrary was actually bland and lacked any type of excitement. 
I had the mac and cheese. Had a decent flavor, but  also wasn&apos;t all that great. Overall, the food was okay, nothing special.

The ambiance was quiet and low lighting with games playing in the tv. The spot appears to get more filled after 11pm as they close at 2am."
5,"10000% recommend this place their food is gluten free including the fries. Pretzel bites were mouth watering, the burger was phenomenal, salad was fresh and delicious and the chicken sandwich is a must have. Great food &amp; service"
4,"Ive been to this place for dinner once but what I really love coming to this place for is happy hour, definitely a great happy hour selection and price. It is very reasonably priced, staff are lovely (they try to be attentive but it can get out of hand. Last time I was here I had one server ask if I needed anything, I asked for more water. While waiting for my water another staff member came and asked me the same thing...this happened 3 or 4 times, I felt a little bombarded) and I love the unpretentious vibe (I read another review that said &quot;small town bar feel&quot; and I absolutely agree)...just solid snacks and drinks. 

Inside is quite dark, but sometimes I&apos;m not into that so I prefer to sit outside. I MUCH prefer their outdoor seating for enjoying some wine and people watching. 

The location is great; still walking distance from center city proper but with a little less of the bustle going on."
4,"I have passed by this &quot;diamond in the rough&quot; on many occasion in the past few months. I decided to give them a go on Valentine&apos;s Friday for happy hour. Upon walk-in, the place is dimly lit for ambiance. I was excited considering their namesake suggest that I might find some really great cocktails here. Sweet Tea was our server. She is quite bubbly and was spot on with drink recommendations. We ordered a Bloody Valentine drink special that included bourbon and we ordered a &quot;Moscow&quot; (I think they used Titos) mule. The bourbon in the Bloody Valentine was very subtle and went down smooth. Now for the Moscows. I am pretty particular with my ginger beer and thus always look at a server/bartender with one eye open when they tell me that they make their ginger beer in-house. I was pleasantly pleased with my &quot;Moscow&quot; mules at Prohibition Taproom. OMG! The tingly burn at the back of the throat, the peppery tickle in my nose. So darn good, we ordered 5 in total! YEP! I said 5 of the same drink between 2 people! 

Now about the food. This is where it gets a little tricky for me. The menu has a limited selection of small plates and large plates. We ordered the Popcorn chicken bites, Beet Tar Tar, Pretzel bites with beer cheese sauce and the Shrimp n grits with mushrooms.  Overall, I enjoyed the salty, garlicky buttery goodness of the pretzel bites (complements all of the alcohol). The beet tar tar was not bad, it simply did not go with anything else on the menu. The popcorn chicken bites were also decently seasoned and not overly fried. The shrimp and grits weren&apos;t really grits, more like a soupy risotto. The flavor was earthy (mushroom based) and the shrimp were a great size and grilled nice for good texture balance to the overly sauced risotto grits. 

Overall, the drinks were nice and potent. We could not here the music over all of the talking. This place is best suited for enjoying excellently crafted cocktails and lite bites. Go somewhere else for dinner. I will return for another happy hour adventure. I am still having dreams about the perfect mule.... but with better, and Russian, vodka."
4,"Came here on a Wednesday night. Chill spot, low key. Nice ambience, good for dates. After dinner drink, etc. They have really good sours that I&apos;ve never tried before. Overall, really enjoyed it! Nicole &amp; Shaun were attentive. Thanks Nicole for serving us!"
5,"Before a concert at the Met, we decided to go to the Prohibition Tap Room. It is located in the Callowhill/Spring Garden area of Philadelphia and uses a building that has been a bar since the 1800s.

The restaurant/bar itself is relatively small. We had a bit of a wait to be seated and ended up sitting at the full-service bar. I recommend trying to get reservations before coming but we arrived well-before the show and had some time to kill. It&apos;s a great atmosphere and a perfect spot if you&apos;re looking to grab a drink before a show or catch their happy hour.

What we ordered:
White Bean Dip: The appetizer came out quickly. The hummus was warm, creamy and full of flavor. The broccoli rabe was a nice addition to the dish and I was surprised how much I liked the balsamic drizzle. It was just enough acid and didn&apos;t overpower at all. I wish they gave us more pita though but it was delicious. I think I&apos;m going to have to try and use navy beans the next time I make hummus.

Fried Chicken Sandwich: This was the best part of the dinner. The chicken was fried yet still very juicy on the inside. The mayo added a good kick of flavor. The bun was so soft and the fries that were served with them were just crispy enough. They paired well with the leftover hummus.


Viet-Cajun Shrimp Po Boy: The sandwich itself was slightly sweet, a bit spicy and full of flavor. The amount of shrimp in the Po Boy was plenty and well-cooked. It brought me right back to NOLA but with an Asian flair. 

Both entrees were delicious and paired well with the drinks that we got. Honestly, the only thing I really didn&apos;t care for was how hard the roll was in the Po Boy dish. It was a bit loud, but it was jam-packed on a Saturday night. They were really large and we left very full. My boyfriend had an assortment of beers and I had a few ciders. I was excited to see that they had a bunch of ciders on tap that wasn&apos;t Angry Orchard. These were dry, full of flavor with a good apple impact. The bartenders were attentive and were helpful in choosing drinks. Being a prohibition bar, they had plenty of mixed drinks that looked delicious as they came out from the bar.

I would recommend coming to the Prohibition Taproom and grabbing a drink. Plenty of beers and ciders available and a full-service bar for those who like to drink a bit harder. Walking distance to several of the concert halls in the area, it&apos;s great for a quick (or long) drink. All the food was delicious and the atmosphere was really neat."
5,"I have never gave a more well deserved 5 star review. I went here with 2 friends and all of our meals and a dessert way beyond exceed expectations! UNREAL! 

We went around 8:30 on a Friday night and there were 3 tables open. It seems like a place that would get crowded at particular dinner times.

Atmosphere: 5/5: the lighting is average to dark, the music is a little loud, but that&apos;s the crowd that is there- there were a groups of friends at the bar, couples eating at the tables, age range of 23 to 40 for the most part. It feels like a hip spot that&apos;s totally casual. Personally this is the types of restaurant atmospheres I enjoy best. 

Service: 5/5 for sure! We were there until about 10:30 and our server made sure we had everything we needed and didn&apos;t rush us at all. Very friendly staff all around.

Drinks: the draft beer list is excellent and their can beers are also good too! I love craft beer and if I have the option I am going to get something on draft. I had an IPA from Bucks County Brewing. Delicious.

Food: OH MY GOODNESS! I cannot even tell you how great my fried chicken sandwich was! And the fries  other meals enjoyed at dinner were the Mac &amp; Cheese with braised pork shoulder and the pulled pork sandwich. I tried the Mac and cheese without the pork...HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS DELICIOUS CHEESY-NESS! 

Dessert: Because the meal was so good we went with a dessert of s&apos;mores pie! So happy we did! It doesn&apos;t come out hot or cold it is the perfect temperature of cool-warm so you can dig in right away. Which is exactly what we did which you can see in the picture it&apos;s already half eaten. 

Can&apos;t say it enough- this is a must try! If you are even considering it for brunch, lunch or dinner one night JUST DO IT. Make sure you are hungry though!"
5,Always has been one of my go-tos but excited to see they are open again for take out and out door dining. Placed an order on their website and walked over a few minutes later to pick it up. The food (I ordered the burger) was ready right when it said it would be and was very hot and fresh when I got it back to my apartment. The mixed drink I ordered (Bees-knees) was so tasty! The waitress was so friendly and the whole set up was easy to use. Will definitely be back!
5,"Prohibition Taproom is actually quite exceptional. The entire place has a great vibe. My friend had many different items from their menu, but he feels that their Pro Tap Burger is just simply amazing. The service was courteous and experienced. Two thumbs up."
4,"Came in for happy hour with some coworkers. Immediately liked the low lighting, low key atmosphere, and bar setup. Sat down at the bar and was greeted by one of the bartenders who was extremely knowledgeable about the beer and menu.

We ordered a smorgasbord of food off the menu, including house pickled seasonal veggies, mac &amp; cheese, and [eventually] s&apos;mores pie. My friends ordered their own entrees, but I settled with a mix of the small happy hour plates: hushpuppies, fish tacos, and popcorn chicken.

The pickled veggies were tasty and by far my favorite item. The mac &amp; cheese was pretty good and easy to share. The hushpuppies were a bit oily for my liking, and the fish tacos were somewhat bland. The popcorn chicken was crisp, spicy, and yummy, but definitely a smaller portion than expected (maybe like ~5 small pieces). I&apos;d say overall, I was disappointed in the happy hour food... now I know for next time to only indulge in the $5 Dale&apos;s Pale Ale and other drink specials!

To finish, we ordered the s&apos;mores pie, which had a buttery, crumbly graham cracker crust, COLD chocolate, and toasted marshmallows. I usually would assume this kind of pie would be served warm, but the cold surprise was welcome.

I could definitely see myself coming back here for drinks. I&apos;ll eventually give it another go off the regular menu, but I&apos;m not 100% sold on the happy hour food options."
4,"This is one of our neighborhood go-to spots. Outside area built for COVID dining and plenty of space. Servers always so nice and friendly, food is great - elevated pub food, good selection of beer and cider. Always very chill - they never rush us and when we bring our dog they bring out a bowl of water. Favorites have been burger, chicken sandwich and fried chicken platter. Tried the BLT the other day and they suggested to add avocado. Beyond delicious and I will get again!"
4,Small town feel bar and taproom off the beaten path in Philly. Prohibition Taproom plays to its name with ambiance and decor and offers interesting takes on bar food. The beer list includes craft beer heavily from local breweries. The food is well prepared and service was pleasant. Only downside is it is a very dark (lighting wise) establishment. Burgers are delicious and if you can make it between 5-7pm their happy hour specials are great deals.
