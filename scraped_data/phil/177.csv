5,"3rd time here for takeout! I have gotta say definitely is an amazing place, it&apos;s like transporting to another country. It&apos;s beautiful decor inside and layout would probably be amazing pre-covid days but due to situational hazards, we live in new times, so just gotta go with the flow. I love the brick oven roaring in the back, and fresh dough being made with the open grill firing up some proteins adjacent to the oven. And even farther left is a separate but entirely one entity which is the bakery with AMAZING pastries. 
Aesthetics: beautiful and lovely decor, sad that it&apos;s not up and running for dine in business yet. 
Service: takes a while for the food to be made, bcuz everything is so fresh! But atleast they keep to the time slot as they state. 
Food: only reason I keep coming back, very generous and even more delicious, I am slowly attempting to try everything on the menu but I can not stop ordering their beef shawarma wrap. It&apos;s sooo goood! And chasing it down with some amazing baklava, I may not be well experienced in middle eastern cuisine but from what I have tried, I&apos;ve gottta say the food here is def authentic and delicious as anything I&apos;ve ever tried before. 
I will def be back and back and back again."
5,"Phenomenal manakeesh! One of the primary reasons we actually were excited about our Philly trip. It&apos;s a nice middle eastern cafe. They had some really cool lattes. Will be back to explore the rest of the items!
Good job following covid guidelines too. Everyone was wearing masks appropriately and they had nice markings on the floor to drive SD."
5,"Mmm loved being take out from here! I ordered via their website, I was a little surprised to see all the sides cost extra, but it ended up being a lot of food with good proportions so I&apos;m fine with it. My favorites were the curry chicken shawarma and baba ganoush with the pita bread. The beef was a tad tough, but my husband enjoyed it. The shawarma seemed to have more meat versus the kabob. 

It was busy on a Saturday night, it would have been helpful if they had a separate pick up line rather than us having to wait in the line where people were placing orders."
3,"Ordered kanafa, basboosa and several of the different types of baklava (pistachio, walnut and almond). 

The baklava&apos;s were pretty good, I would recommend pairing it with coffee or tea. The basboosa was not bad but not that fresh either but the kanafa was really bad. It seemed old, stretchy with 0 taste."
5,"The grilled meats as well as the manakeesh ( small meals on a single fresh baked pita) are quite tasty. 

Be patient when ordering and picking up food. There is a lot going on in this place. It is certainly a place where learning and cultural exchange can happen. 

The decor is pleasant with a soaring veiling and lots of windows as is the middle eastern music.  

First and only place I have ever eaten mamorah. (Sp?)

This place is worth checking out. I also enjoy the fattoush salad, the grilled beef and the fool bean dish are tasty ask for a side of pickles and olives. Crepe, coffee, baklava and smoothies also great treats."
3,"I came here on a Sunday afternoon with 2 friends to order takeout. The service and the food were both meh in my honest opinion. Although they had outdoor seating, the tables didn&apos;t seem far enough apart for it to be safe.

Their menu is quite extensive so we were all able to select choices that seemed like they would be good. After ordering, we sat at a table near the counter waiting for our name to be called. The place was not busy as only a few people came in after us. After a while of waiting, we noticed that several people that had come after us had already gotten their order and left. My friend eventually got up to ask about our food. That was when we realized they&apos;d prepared our orders a while ago but never even bothered to call us up! By the time they gave us our food, it was already lukewarm so they tried to half heartedly reheat it on their stone oven. Given that we remained in the line of sight of the cashier the whole time and the place barely had other customers at the time, there was no reason for them to not call us the moment our order was ready. 

I ordered the chicken shawarma wrap so I can only speak to that. I asked for it to be extra spicy not realizing that they used siracha instead of actually peppers for their spice. I&apos;m not a fan of siracha so that ruined the meal for me to be honest. The chef said he added extra siracha to make it extra spicy, but in reality it just made the wrap soggy and not that spicy. I came home and ate the chicken with some leftover coconut rice I had. That wasn&apos;t a bad combo, but I shouldn&apos;t have to supplement a meal I paid for with food I cooked myself. 

The hibiscus drink they sold was pretty good so no complaints there from me.

Overall, I wasn&apos;t a fan of the food or the service I received. They might have other things on their menu that are better, but I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll be returning any time soon."
2,"I had heard good things about Manakeesh but it didn&apos;t live up to my expectations. During COVID, you can order online for takeout and they have tables for dining in. While their workers wear masks, some didn&apos;t have their noses covered and they aren&apos;t consistent with keeping it on. Furthermore, they don&apos;t control the amount of people that are inside the store and it got packed very quickly because of how slow and confusing their service was. The lines weren&apos;t clearly delineated and people were confused with where to order and pick up their food. It took forever for a worker to notice I was waiting to place my order and it took even longer to receive my order. 

I tried the Chicken Schwarma (~$11) and it was okay. I liked the pita bread but there were barely any vegetables in it and it tasted pretty bland. I do recommend Manakeesh&apos;s bakery however. Their Baklava (~$2) isn&apos;t too sweet and the filling was delicious. 

TLDR: Didn&apos;t live up to my expectations and poor service. But the cafe has delicious desserts."
5,"delicious coffee and smoothies. underwhelmed by their style of falafel, i prefer the way Halal trucks or Golden Crust makes them but that&apos;s just my taste. They have a lot of ingredients like raw honey in comb, pickles, etc. And it always smells delicious from outside. everyone who was working was also very kind."
4,"Chicken schawarma: it&apos;s ok, not too much flavor, not memorable. You get a lot of chicken, though. I added fatoush salad. It&apos;s a small portion 
 I enjoyed the dessert more than the main dish.

Baba ganoush and muhamara are tasty with good flavor, perfect for dipping. Unfortunately the pita was a little bit dry , kinda stale although it is big.

Baklava is small but fresh with crispy phyllo. Not too sweet and not dry at all.

The date cookies and pistachio cookies are fresh and delicious, good amount of fillings . I definitely taste the rose water. Very authentic.

Kunafe was a disappointment. I was expecting shredded wheats, instead I got semolina kind."
3,"Love Manakeesh. Consistently some of the freshest baba ganoush, hummus, and labneh in the city. Amazing (and inexpensive), especially on a hot summer day: lots of light little snacks to cool you down. 

The three stars is for the experience, NOT the food!

My friend and I stopped in last week, on one of those stinky summer days. While the food was light, refreshing, and flavorful as usual, ordering was chaotic, and we were both a bit unnerved to see some of the counter AND kitchen crew wearing their masks incorrectly. 

Ordering: it&apos;s counter service, with outdoor seating. So.... do we sit at the seats first and someone comes out? Do we order at the counter, grab our food, and bring it back to our seats? The entire thing was confusing, and a lack of signage or instruction from the cashier made it even moreso. Even just a verbal heads up from the cashier would have done the trick: &quot;You can go wait by that counter for your food.&quot; Something! Definitely a little awkward.

But whatever, I can put up with awkwardness... the masks though? Please just wear them correctly. It&apos;s a shame, but I probably won&apos;t come back for this reason alone. 

Like I said, great food, but the entire experience was a little awkward/unnerving."
4,"For some reason Yelp isn&apos;t allowing me to post an addendum to my review that I wrote seven years ago (!). Seven years ago I wrote Manakeesh had the most authentic Lebanese food in Philly. This a complaint review, ironically I think manakeesh might still have the best Lebanese food in Philly! BUT my order was one hour late (not &quot;took one hour&quot;) AND their phone didn&apos;t operate so I couldn&apos;t get an update and didn&apos;t know if i would receive my dinner. Of course, I had company.

So the food is still the best but clearly they have business issues."
4,"Great food, but call in your order.

It takes awhile because it&apos;s made to order. This is great if you want fresh food and can sit and eat in, but in the pandemic world it&apos;s not so much. This place is pretty busy, so it&apos;s usually got a good amount of people waiting and while there is social distanced chairs, it&apos;s up to the patrons to really follow as the staff doesn&apos;t really care. 

If you sit, it&apos;s okay, but it&apos;s a good 15-20 minute wait if there are orders ahead of you. When you do get the food, it&apos;s best to eat it fresh. I eat in my car.

My favorite is the Lamb lahm Manakeesh. It looks like crap, but the lamb is flavorful and yummy. Definitely recommend this.

We also ordered the Kafta Manakeesh, which is ground spiced beef. While flavorful, i definitely prefer the seasoning in the Lamb Lahm."
5,"Ordered delivery because Manakeesh is one of the ONLY places in Philly that does shish tawook and my partner was craving it! He was NOT disappointed - both his chicken shish tawook (kind of like a chicken kebab, but heavy on the paprika?) and my chicken shawarma were excellent. Sides were also good - we got the labneh, the muhummarah, and the tabbouleh (which was my favorite!). Prices were great, too! Definitely will revisit soon."
5,"Seating and space is a plus. Service is also decent. With tons of food items, their manakeesh dishes are always a good default if you can&apos;t decide. Their shawarma is lacking but everything else is bomb. Also their tea and coffee (and bakery items) are spot on."
5,"What a great place to come and get some authentic halal and Labanese food! If I lived closer to here I would definitely become a regular. 

I usually get halal food from local food carts so it was nice to come to a sit down restaurant. This was also the first restaurant where I tried specifically Lebanese food, and I honestly wish I had tried it sooner. 

The staff working here is really friendly and made great recommendations for what we should order. We shared a plate of hummus, which is absolutely a must get! It comes with their house made bread, served warm right out of the oven. It was so good I had more than my fair share of it. I ordered the chicken shawarma wrap. The portions here are huge! I saved half my wrap to eat later. And even hours later when it was cold, it was still delicious."
4,You go here for the experience and healthy tasty Mediterranean food. It is a cute place in west philly for a nice intimate date. They have some social distance separations between tables. The food is generous servings but can be kinda pricey if you order many sides with your kebab plate. The chicken kebab was grilled at perfection and it is not overwhelmed with white sauce as a halal food truck might have it.
4,"Biased because I love myself a good mezze plate - but wow does Manakeesh do a falafel and grape leaves platter right. 
Some of the better falafel I&apos;ve had in the area - crisp, well-seasoned, and soft on the interior without being mushy - and most importantly, very addictive. The hummus and baba ghannouj are another few staples in my order - always delicious and clearly made fresh in-house. 

If you&apos;re looking for something on the lighter side of a sharable platter, I&apos;d also recommend trying a flatbread - specifically the spinach and cheese, or the zaatar labneh if you like a little seasoning kick in your food.
And to round out the meal, don&apos;t forget to add on a Lebanese pastry or two to your order. My favorite is the basboosa - an almond cake that&apos;s sweetened, but not quite as sugary as the baklava or cookies."
2,"Food is delicious, but lady working at the crepe/smoothie section only wears a visor. She also needs a mask and gloves. It&apos;s socially irresponsible, it&apos;s not protecting customers or herself. I ended not drinking the lemonade because she made it. Also other workers need to cover their noses w the masks. Nobody likes wearing masks, but we need to do it to protect others.
Adam--thank you for you receptiveness. Please see attachment, visors are not substitutes for masks."
5,"I went here on a tuesday with my friend who recommended it and if you like Lebanese food this place is great. It is not fancy like a restaurant in northern libs, Suraya. But it&apos;s really delicious.  The platters are generous in their helpings and it really does fill you up. 

I got the chicken schwarma platter with the white toum sauce. ( I had to google this because the man behind the counter did not give me the name.) It tastes like garlic in dip form. I dipped the chicken in it and the pita and it was the perfect compliment to one another. It was my first time having that sauce so of course I asked for seconds! (They kindly gave me more.) 

My friend got the beef kebab platter and we pretty much got the same sides of tabouleh and baba ghanoush. The sides were fresh and delicious. The beef kebab though tasty it was a little dry to my liking so I preferred the chicken over the beef. 

I didnt get to try the dessert because we were so full but I hear that they are delicious as well. 

I&apos;d definitely recommend if you want tasty food at a low key, and affordable place to eat lebanese food. I kind of enjoy these small tasty places because it&apos;s  not loud and the affordability makes it easy to come back often!"
5,"This is THE place for Lebanese food. Reasonable prices, hearty portions, and delicious food!! Admittedly I&apos;m not too well versed in Lebanese food, but I think this place (with a cafe and bakery attached) is such a unique restaurant. I certainly haven&apos;t seen anything like this in Center City. 

My go-to is the platter: I&apos;ve tried the ginger beef and Lebanese beef (they honestly taste the same) with fries, hummus, pita, and the tabbouleh (finely chopped parsley salad.)

As for the manakeesh, it&apos;s a meat-or veg flatbread reminiscent of a pizza. Out of the ones I&apos;ve tried, I prefer the spicy chicken one (tawook), but the kafta and yogurt/zatar ones are great as well.

I think a manakeesh and a platter would be more than enough for two people."
