4,"These margs are infamous. They have wrecked many a friend. At $36 per 32oz glass bottle, it&apos;s a steep price to pay for a good time. But a good time was had by all who imbibed, which is all a girl can ask from a takeout marg. Thank you Distrito for a great birthday weekend."
5,"It&apos;s been months since my friends and I have been able to enjoy Taco Tuesday at Distrito due to Covid. I heard they opened up a few weeks ago, and since my Rona results came back negative (#ronafree), I thought I&apos;d celebrate (even though it was Monday). I ordered the traditional margarita and the nachos over the phone. They said it&apos;s be 15 minutes. So I pulled up on them. When I got there my food was ready, but they had given me the huge Margarita instead of the 16oz. I didn&apos;t realize this until after I paid... BUT then round the corner comes Joshua! (my fav server) he totally saved the day, refunded my card, adjusted my bill and got me the 16oz drink. I missed him! Lol... my friend and I say he&apos;s always making things better. He&apos;s like our friend in our heads (lol ‍). Anyways... we took our food to the park (but I heard they&apos;ll have outside seating soon) and we TORE UP our food okay?! Upon taking our first sip of margarita, I said, &quot;mmm, this tastes just like Tuesday&quot;. Lol! Cause it did! I&apos;m glad I got the 16oz cause it was strong  - my friend on the other hand got the huge margarita, and she didn&apos;t regret it. The drinks are ALWAYS strong, but so are we! 

We&apos;ll be back soon."
4,"Huge fan of Distrito always, they finally have re-opened for outdoor dining and everything was nearly perfect. The margaritas (we ordered a pitcher) were STRONG...like, really strong. The chicken tacos were prepared differently if my memory serves me correct, they are no longer shredded but still absolutely to die for. Nothing Distrito can really do here, but the lantern fly&apos;s were seriously everywhere around/on the table and it was pretty gross. I wish they still accepted the rewards card for Garces as I had $25 to spend on mine, but I understand so much has changed this year with dining! I will always come back!"
4,"Came here for dinner on a Friday night. Very large venue with cool decor. Plenty of menu options and excellent service 

We started off with chicken nachos which were HUGE and excellent ( best item of the night ).  We ordered steak and mahi tacos as our mains . They were very good but a tad salty . Margaritas were very tasty and strong 

Overall a robust choice and I will be back for mas!"
3,"If you want to hit a restaurant dishing out some classic Mexican food - this is a great spot to consider. You walk in and can just feel the energy here. Bright colors, really cool art, fun music. 

They have a nice variety of tacos - plenty of options to choose from. I personally felt like the prices were a little high for the portion sizes.

Really solid guac &amp; happy hour menu/discounts. Their bar is huge - plenty of good drinks."
3,"We ordered the: 
- Chicken Burrito - it was pretty good - I&apos;ll give it a 4/5.
- Cornbread and I&apos;d give that a 4/5. 
- Tofu Tacos - lacked flavor so I&apos;d give it a 3/5. 
- Super Nachos - there was not an option to add/subtract meat. So, it came with either pork/carne asada. We don&apos;t eat meat so we were pretty upset at that, especially since we were really hungry. Disappointed in the nachos, I&apos;d give it a 1/5. 

Overall, not really satisfied with the outcome of the this place. Hoping it&apos;s better in the restaurant but not really sure if we&apos;d go any time soon."
3,"I really wanted to love this Mexican Restaurant, as it is very close to my house and i love tacos. Chef Garces really needs to check on this place as it is just meh. 

The happy hour is great price wise! Especially on Taco Tuesdays when the tacos are $2.50. And a beer is only $2. Tacos are delicious! Gotta admit that. The margarita that is during happy hour has a weird taste. It is definitely not my favorite. I got 4 tacos al pastor, which were delicious, but very small in size. 

Also, guacamole that is $13, definitely is not worth that price. The size is small, and the taste is just meh. 

We had one waitress for our whole section which was about 5 tables. The service was slow, had to wait forever for our drinks. Food surprisingly comes out fast. 

I just think this restaurant needs to work on whether they want to be super fancy as prices suggest, or just a good taco place with fair prices. 

I will only come for happy hour, because all other prices are just outrageous. 

Cute decor tho!"
1,"My experiences here keep going downhill and in addition to downgrading my rating I&apos;m definitely contacting the company. 

I&apos;m in the area and I know they have a Taco Tuesday offer so I stop in for take out since the last time I dined in the service was not up to task. I confirm with the bartender that it is indeed Taco Tuesday. I confirm with him that my tacos will be 2.50 a piece. I also confirm that I do not want the green salsa but extra salsa roja instead.

My bill is presented and I am expecting to pay 15.00 for this meal but instead it&apos;s 20.00. After he takes my card and starts to process it I tell him to stop and explain this bill to me. He says oh the special is DINE IN ONLY. No where does it say that. Not the website, not the card he sat down in front of me when he went over the special and most importantly it did not come out of his mouth when I placed my order. That is an unacceptable practice I don&apos;t appreciate it. Oh and that green sauce I didn&apos;t want, I got three of them and some limes that were so old the skin had turned yellow."
5,My picture was a bit messy because I ate half of that huge delicious sandwich and trust me I finished the rest of it ! The food was outstanding service was great especially from the General Manager David. Thank you sir. Oh almost forgot margaritas were excellent.
3,"Great service, atmosphere, and scenery. 

We were given the car table (very cool) the inside is very colorful but with a dim warm setting. 

It&apos;s probably the best place to go for Mexican food in university city; however, the price is just not worth it. Portions are very small for your standard Mexican cuisine. The food wasn&apos;t bad, it&apos;s just the price was way more expensive than what was being offered. For the same price, I&apos;ll rather go to Fishtown or center city for a better meal. 

Happy hour drinks and apps are worth it though. And the kind service makes up for the heavy price."
1,"I have been going to Distrito for years and have always loved it but my experience this time around sucked and I hate making this review!

(1) food: nacho recipe changed, and now there is queso instead of the usual cheese, which made them way less cheesy and flavorful, and more soggy

(2) service: a waiter processing our check told us he didn&apos;t know how to enter our $50(!!!) gift card and said he&apos;d take off our beers instead, which was only $12, and when it unfortunately started raining (not Distrito&apos;s fault at all obviously) a waitress approached our table and talked to us without a mask on 

All in all I know Distrito can do better, so I will come back and make a new review."
2,"A big group of us came to Distrito for celebrating our graduation from a track program. We arrived and were seated in a nice room close to the entrance, walled off from the rest of the restaurant with a TV/AV setup presumably linked to karoake. 

Our food came out in waves: greek (mixed with a mexican theme) salad, chicken tortillas, seafood dish and fried plantains to name but a few. While most of the dishes had a nice presentation, the ingredients did not taste particularly fresh. The margheritas were filled with ice cubs, and after dinner, we even struggled to get the karaoke setup up-and-running. Once we even got the karoake working, it continued to freeze and didn&apos;t have many of the hit songs you would expect. Acoustics were also pour given that our private room was separated from the rest of the restaurant with only a thin, plastic sliding door that allowed for plenty of noise to seep through.

Overall, I was not impressed by my dining experience at Distrito even though I have been told the interior is quite fun, the nachos are delicious and happy hour specials are solid."
1,"Ordered off of an app for delivery. It was close to their closing time (about 20 minutes) but the order was confirmed. When it was delivered all that was in the bag was guacamole and the delivery person was very confused and told us they had a &apos;limited menu.&apos;

We were charged the full amount of three meals (which we had to call the app separately to get a refund)

I understand if you are closing and you don&apos;t want to pick up an order. How about instead of sending out a random app and wasting everyone&apos;s time you just cancel it? 

Oh and we called the restaurant and the person who answered had no idea what happened. How do you let one order of guac go out for delivery and not know anything about it? He said the last online order he received was hours earlier. So basically was telling us we never ordered anything. HOW DID WE RECEIVE GUAC THEN. 

Now it was too late to order from anywhere else and we were left feeling like a restaurant that was recommended to us is seriously incompetent and honestly rude. Who sends out an order of guac when we ordered three meals and thinks that is ok? No call or anything?!?! I never write reviews like this especially during this time but I am just honestly blown away."
3,"Quite the average &apos;Mexican&apos; food place. No free chips/salsa for the table, pre-made margaritas, small portions, but a decent happy hour and kind of a cool space. Wouldn&apos;t pick this place for authenticity, but i&apos;d you want some average appetizer food and drink in the area, Distrito is good enough for a happy hour joint and a place to convene for medium sized groups."
5,"Came here in a Friday night to catch up with a friend. The restaurant is really cool and modern. With it being in the heart of University city expect there to be a college kids during the school year. 

As soon as we walked in, we went directly to the bar. The service was solid. Our bartender was helpful and informed. Order some margs, and they came out perfect and the food came out so fast, I thought they were reading my mind prior to ordering. The tacos were really flavorful which was surprising. Sometimes you go to places and the meat is bland and gross. Here there was an abundance of flavor which was delightful! Would definitely recommend!"
2,"I came here on a weekend when restaurant week had every other restaurant in the city packed. Fortunately Distrito had plenty of tables available to take my party of six. 
The nachos are still there one and only best dish
The tacos were these thick corn tortillas with barely anything inside. 
The smothered burritos tasted like they had canned enchilada sauce on them
And everything else we ordered from the side of corn to the fajitas were just not impressive. 
And to top it off, the waitress that was barely present and rolled her eyes at us just wasn&apos;t a fun way to have a birthday dinner. 

There&apos;s definitely better Mexican food in the city that&apos;s worth trying instead."
5,"Wondering where to go for a 10/10 Cinco de Mayo experience? THIS IS THE PLACE! My friends and I came here to start off our day-long celebration of this fun-filled holiday. Distrito offers AMAZING margaritas, and, as a special for this holiday, has margarita towers for you to share with the table at a reasonable price. SO worth it!"
2,"This is a review for Tuesday lunch.

Food: 3/5 Stars 
My colleagues and I (5) came in for Taco Tuesday during our lunch break. We ordered average 3 fish tacos each ($3/taco) and a super nacho to share. The tacos came out before the nachos but they were sub par. The fish was a dry, perhaps old? The batter was not crispy nor hot. Perhaps they received the fish or just had these sitting on the counter for a while. The tacos came out before our appetizer, the nachos. The nachos were good, a lot of toppings loaded on top, but not a lot of meat. Good flavor though it gets cold fast. 

Service: 0/5 Stars 
TERRIBLE. we waited in the lobby for 5 minutes to be seated. Why so long @12PM on a Tuesday? Because there was nobody at the desk, behind the counter, nowhere to be found. When I only have a 1 hr lunch break, every minute counts. Why isn&apos;t there anybody on standby or at least on the floor? We were ready to order once we were seated but our waiter was too busy talking to his friend behind the bar to notice us flagging him down. Plus, they forgot my colleagues Al Pastor taco. 

Overall:
I&apos;m quite disappointed with Distrito. I don&apos;t know if the quality of the tacos and quality of service decrease on Taco Tuesday. If that&apos;s how they save a couple bucks to afford Taco Tuesday, I wouldn&apos;t come back. The terrible service and sub par food to save $1.50 on a taco isn&apos;t worth it. There&apos;s better taco options in the city."
3,"This is somewhere you would only go if you are in college and looking for a late night filling snack. Skip the tacos (heavy, leaden tortillas), and go straight for the quesadillas, which although not very authentic, are toasty, cheesy and delicious. Ambiance is very eclectic and service is friendly and fast."
1,"Wow -- first of all, Distrito is really out here playing games and thinks no one would notice? First the prices of happy hour margaritas were increased by 50¢ with no explanation. Moreover, taco prices were raised from $3.50 to $3.75, however, the size decreased dramatically. The new regular-taco sizes are literally almost half of a real a taco. You can compare this below between the Chicken taco (right, small) and Fish taco (left, real taco size). Moreover the Happy Hour salsa size has decreased and the amount of salsa in the ramekin has decreased as well.

Additionally the waiter at the bar upstairs treated the group of girls next to us very rudely. He wasn&apos;t even understanding of the fact that because the downstairs floor was booked for an event, the group of girls were standing and ordering by a table very close to the bar. When he had their order he was dramatically put-out that they didn&apos;t see him despite the fact he could have very easily called for their attention, especially considering that it&apos;s a very loud setting. They can&apos;t just be attending to his every action and word, especially when he took a handful of minutes to complete their order.

Also, the restaurant just needs some management tweaks - my friends and I are happy to help, really let us know. The hours Distrito is open should be changed, and the policy about seating as well. Increasing prices and decreasing value is not the way to go? Rude bar tenders? In this economy?"
