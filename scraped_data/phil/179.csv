5,"I was looking for a nice date spot out. I did a little research and saw that Friday Saturday Sunday was offering a prix fixe menu during the current Covid times we&apos;re still unfortunately in. I made reservations online for two and came here on a Tuesday.

Dining is upstairs only currently. A small, quite space decorated fancy with fiberglass barriers between tables to keep everyone spaced out and safe. All of the servers wear masks and/or shields as well. The service from the moment we walked into the restaurant was top notch. The only thing more impressive was the food.

A nice variety of small portions, we enjoyed cured kanpachi with chili oil, beet pyramids (a pasta dish similar to ravioli), sweetbreads (my girlfriend was nervous about this one but it was a fried, melt-in-your-mouth delicacy), halibut (perfectly cooked in a delicate buttermilk dashi broth), roasted duck with duck leg pie (by far my favorite - creative and perfectly completed. The duck breast was rare, tender, and wonderfully seasoned. The duck pie was so unique but delicious at the same time - hands down would order just this again if I can), dry aged New York Strip (what more can be said about amazingly cooked steak?) and finished with a nice yuzu tart for dessert (the perfect ending).

Looking for a nice date night out that is taking Covid as seriously as perfecting each dish they push out? Friday Saturday Sunday is your spot. Check it out."
5,"Just had take out after covid shut down. Excellent meal, from salads to entree to desert all to the exceptional standard we expect from Hannah and Chad. Best meal since March shutdown."
4,"When you walk in, you immediately are taken back by their flashy bar scene. My eyes were immediately drawn to the cool black and white checker pattern on the floor that is carried through to the walls. The furniture is simple, which is perfect, because it allows the structure and fixtures of the building to shine. 

The first floor is buzzing with people there just to grab some drinks or patiently waiting for their reservations. The bar is a swanky/modern mix and they have some really elevated drink options. Stretch yourself a bit, and try a cocktail, but they have plenty of beer and wine to choose from you as well. 

Have you ever seen that commercial...&quot;the plates, were tiny?&quot; That was my first thought when we understand the plating options. You are paying a lot for small orders. We were a party of 2, and easily needed our 5 plates at a minimum. You could easily order more than that if you have the pockets for it. That being said, the food was damn good. Just go ahead and splurge - get the caviar, get the chicken liver mousse. 

This restaurant has a lot of hype, and it deserves it, but I couldn&apos;t give it a five because it is an experience that I feel like I can pass on to try new things. I would DEFINITELY look to go back for the bar scene once we are back to normal from COVID."
5,"An oldie but a goodie! I always remember this as a great first date place, that was always reliable for a good impression and meal to match.
Fancy cocktails made with top shelf liquors make this a great place for a drink before or after whatever your plans may be. On a recent trip a few years after I ate there regularly I wasn&apos;t surprised that although things were different or look different it&apos;s still had the cool factor. The  food was outstandingbut although the menu changed FSS is still providing a good dinner great wines by the glass as well as the fancy cocktails all made for a great night out."
5,"We came here with high hopes after hearing great reviews and our dinner did not disappoint! 

As many mention the restaurant is tiny, so you&apos;ll want to make a reservation just in case. They take reservations via OpenTable but you can call directly as well. 

We started off with drinks and ordered the Control State and Judgement of Paris - both were well balanced and easy to drink with dinner. My bf thought JoP tasted &apos;basic&apos; but he later ordered the Man for All Seasons later on and really enjoyed it. 

Dinner wise shared the chicken liver mousse, mussel toast, beet pyramids and roasted chicken. Between two people I think this was the perfect amount once you count the complimentary bread course and extra toast that came with chicken liver mousse. 

Would definitely order the chicken liver mousse again - a bunch of different flavors but when you layered them together it worked! I also really enjoyed the beet pyramids with the goat cheese/honey filling. It was a smaller portion, so we made sure to savor each one lol. Star of the meal was for sure the chicken. So juicy!!! Even the white meat. Probably one of the best roast chickens I&apos;ve ever had. The broccolini was on the saltier side, but eaten with the other sides it mellowed out. 

For dessert we had the ice box parfait. Best part was the homemade toasted marshmallow :)

Service was great and prices aren&apos;t tooo insane. Hope to be back again!"
5,"Let me first say that I never eat shellfish but I made an exception when I knew I wanted to break my personal rule.

I wanted to make sure my last night in Philadelphia was memorable so I went on Yelp to picked a restaurant which had high ratings and served oysters, got dressed up, and made my way here. If you want to come here and you don&apos;t have a reservation then good look being upstairs or at the bar. I was fortunate enough to be dining alone and there was a spot open at the bar. I started me dining experience by enjoying oysters with rosé while talking to the friendly bartenders to determine what I should order next. I steered by the knowledgeable bartender to try the beef tartare and geeze he was right about ordering this delicious, mouthwatering, eye pleasing meal. I finished my food experience with their brownie which was recommended by another helpful bartender and another pleasing recommendation to end my food experience. 

Food: I give an A+
Hospitality: A+
Ambience: A+
Price: Somewhat expensive (someone who is on a budget); however worth every penny based on experience"
5,"One of, if not the best, meals I&apos;ve had in PHL to date. FSS had delicious, creative, food in a cozy atmosphere. I loved every dish we had, they were all executed well and flavors were on point. I definitely want to go back to try more and eat some of the standouts again.

We tried a good bit. My favorites were: beef tartare (classic), chicken liver mousse (well balanced), sweetbread katsu (yum), beet pyramids (OMG), and roasted potato gnocchi (pillowy). We also had the octopus, confit artichokes, and morcilla creste de gallo, which were all still very good. We finished things off with the brownie dessert, which was super rich and delicious.

Not a huge restaurant, so reservations are needed. But I&apos;ll be back"
5,"Finally cashed in my open table points to have an amazing Sunday night meal!

We got:
1. Beef tartare -served with delicious grilled bread and very flavorful
2. Grilled Butternut squash - this was seasoned so perfectly that it tasted like steak
3. New York Strip Steak with potato purée and a beet vinaigrette 
4. Pear upside-down cake"
5,"A spectacular, sure to impress, culinary experience. The restaurant is located in what appears to be an old townhouse, with the bar downstairs and about 14 tables upstairs. It&apos;s intimate and cozy but it proves difficult to accommodate medium sized parties. 
After reading some reviews, we got the &quot;mussels&quot; toast as one of our plates and it was light on the &quot;mussels&quot; flavor and extremely delicious. Additionally we had the Arctic char, asparagus, gnocchi, roasted chicken, and one of the most marvelous desserts to hit my mouth: the sweet potato and marshmallow parfait. This entire meal left our table of 2&apos;s taste buds satisfied and our stomachs not too full. 
This is a place I would absolutely recommend for a date or special occasion night."
5,"Had been wanting to go here for a while and finally made it for dinner around 8pm (important info). I&apos;ve been in the downstairs bar area before for some after work drinks but never had any of the food. So this was a special occasion.

We really wanted to try the dry aged duck but they had already run out of orders. So just keep in mind if you&apos;re trying for the duck, make an earlier reservation! Instead we opted for the beef tartare, roasted potato gnocchi, grilled corn, new york strip, and the roasted chicken.

Firstly... the &quot;bread service&quot; was phenomenal. The thin little crisps sprinkled with hibiscus powder sitting in a dollop of honey butter.... YUM. I asked for a second serving of it and didn&apos;t even feel guilty because they were so light and airy.

We really enjoyed the beef tartare. Was creamy but fresh. The gnocchi didn&apos;t really blow me away but I was kind of expecting that. The grilled corn side was good. My boyfriend very much enjoyed his new york strip. It was cooked very well but tbh it was just a tad too salty for me. And for me, I never order chicken at a restaurant but went with it after being recommended by the waiter. I thought the chicken was SUPER moist, one of the best chicken dishes I&apos;ve ever had at a restaurant. Was not disappointed at all. And it was a very large portion. I forget what I had as my first drink but I fell in love with the Girls girls girls cocktail. Kind of reminded me of the bull dog reviver at philadelphia distilling.

Overall, was very impressed with our meal, service, ambiance/space. For sure have to go back (at an earlier time) to try the duck. Great spot for a date/celebratory dinner for a smaller group!"
4,"First time here was on Halloween so you know I was in for a treat when I saw the whole crew were all dressed up in costumes. We were seated upstairs the first floor is just for the bar area and stool seating. Our waiter Tim was very nice, attentive and had a nice attitude plus he was wearing a Kangaroo Costume. 

For starters we ordered the Mussel Toast, I&apos;ve never had mussels before but this being my first time I was impressed by how good the toast was overall. There was no fishy taste. We also ordered the Beats Ravioli which was something completely different than I&apos;m use to also but it was so delicious. We honestly came in for the duck it was gonna be my first time trying duck out but sadly they only make Two a day and we&apos;re sold out within the first hour of the restaurant being opened. So we went ahead with the chicken for two. This comes with quarter chicken, chard brócoli and pumpkin squash purée. Though I wish they would have served a lot more of the purée than just two dashed under the chicken. I also had an order of the gnocchi but I wasn&apos;t a huge fan of it.
My husband also ordered himself a drink called &quot;The Great Satan&quot; he mentioned it was pretty strong but good. 

Ended the night with a peach cobbler upside down cake to celebrate our anniversary that they brought out with a candle."
4,"High quality food, decent service, very romantic atmosphere with dim mood lighting and European style wall paintings. 

Everything was delicious. Would definitely recommend the goat cheese beet pasta and pear upside down cake - two of my favorites of the night."
5,"My favorite restaurant in Philly - I often only go for special occasions but I&apos;m never disappointed. I have yet to try a drink from here but based on what I&apos;ve seen they look great.

My favorites are the foie gras/liver appetizer - it&apos;s extremely creamy and comes with bread that has a perfect crunchy texture. For the dessert go with the recommended chocolate choice. 

The wait staff is very professional! Make sure to make reservations as the upstairs isn&apos;t super big."
4,"Truly one of the best meals we&apos;ve had in Philly in the last 2-3 years. A fun combination of sophisticated cuisine and down to earth ingredients such as sweetbreads, carrots, labneh. Not too pretentious, not too simplistic. Just right. We will be back soon 

Not five stars for the following two reasons::

Cocktails were hit or miss. We tried four. Two were delicious and complex and two were just &quot;meh&quot;.  Not quite as good as The Franklin. 

Service was well paced and professional but also very stiff and aloof. You felt a little bit like just another cover. Waiter never introduced himself though did have good suggestions. Hostess never said hello on way in and just stared at her phone on the way out without as much as a &quot;bye&quot;."
5,"My fiancée took me to this hyped-up restaurant (#3/50 Philly Mag) for my birthday (after we already splurged on happy hour at the Oyster House). And despite both being full, FSS delivered! 

The complimentary, paper thin crispy chips and savory whipped butter may have been my favorite thing I ate that day... had it not been for the next several dishes they put in front of us.

Sweet bread Katsu toast was perfectly crunchy and soft in the middle. The flavors (bone marrow included) were strong but not overpowering. I like to eat things as they are plated, but also deconstructed- and this tasted great both ways. You can really taste the high quality of the ingredients when you eat them separately.

The cauliflower had a nice bite to it- tangy? Semi-sweet savory? Almost peppery? This was over a month ago, but thinking about it&apos;s complexity really brings back the amazing  and unforgettable flavor. 

The roasted potato gnocchi was the best I&apos;ve ever had. Just cooked to perfection. The sear on each gnocchi was crisp- the middle soft and hearty.  Gnocchi is my favorite pasta and this is my new gold standard.

Well done, FSS, well done."
5,"I had the best oysters of my life here so that warrants a 5 star review alone...

my husband and i came here as soon as we could get a reservation for a romantic dinner and it was just that. we were seated upstairs so I did not get a good look at the downstairs but from what i saw it is cute and cozy. upstairs was also cozy, almost too cozy, as we were very close to our neighbors. 

our meal and service was fantastic. admittedly, i am writing quite a few months after our visit so i do not remember all the specifics but the oysters I do remember, distinctly (irish points). We sampled tuna tartare and sweetbreads for appetizers and I had a lobster dish for my entree which was divine. All of the food, however, was spectacular and my husband and I both want to return soon!"
5,"We came here after dinner after it was recommended to us by strangers on the street! We were looking for a bar with delicious drinks and were steered in this direction. I ordered the Espresso martini and my husband didn&apos;t order anything from the menu, the bartender asked him what liquor he liked and concocted something on his own! It was a great craft cocktail! Very talented bartender and friendly atmosphere!"
3,"I read great reviews, but unfortunately I was pretty disappointed. 

To me, it seemed like it was mostly for the gram. The actual taste in food was not quite there."
5,"My trips to Philadelphia historically have been more focused on South Philly (where it&apos;s, apparently, &quot;Fillelfya&quot;, and people drink &quot;wooder&quot; and watch the &quot;iggles&quot;. However, my friend moved to the Rittenhouse Square neighbourhood which is a fair bit more posh than Passyunk Square. We would up visiting Friday Saturday Sunday for last drink (or two) after a wedding we went to.

It&apos;s tiny and it&apos;s packed, but man... it&apos;s a cool spot.

I need to figure out the sorcery that is the Assassin&apos;s Handbook, because I&apos;ve never had a cocktail quite like it - and I&apos;m not even usually a cocktail person, but it was just such a great mix of flavours (and a lot of booze) that I was really impressed.

The night didn&apos;t end that great as we made that stupid decision to have one last drink at home before calling it a night, and that&apos;s always the one that gets you, but at least I discovered the wonder of the Handbook..."
4,"I visited last Sunday with for my dad&apos;s birthday. The atmosphere of the restaurant is nice and cosy, the space itself was a bit tight but definitely understandable. Our server was very friendly and extremely helpful with recommending us dishes. One thing that was very interesting was the bread service. There wasn&apos;t exactly bread, rather a plate of thin chips with a light flavored butter whip. It was enjoyable and unique! 
We got to sample most of the popular dishes at FSS, including the chicken liver pate, mussel toast and red better pyramids. Unfortunately we did not get a chance to try the duck for two since they had already been reserved when we got there. 
Overall, I would comment that all the dishes are executed in such a unique manner. It&apos;s a lot of modern twists on classics. However the portions were pretty small for their prices. 
It&apos;s definitely worth checking out! I had a good time at FSS."
