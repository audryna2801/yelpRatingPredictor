5,"Great COVID precautions. They send ea guest a questionnaire about recent activity before dining + in some cases take temperatures. Despite the winter temps, they kept a window open for circulation of air which was much appreciated. Proper social distancing is maintained btw tables + servers wore gloves. I noticed extra precautions + cleaning btw tables. There&apos;s a 2-hr limit + w/dessert you&apos;ll be right at the time limit.

All that being said, the food is also exceptional. Pasta was fresh, perfectly sauced + well portioned (though more would have been welcomed for a carryout). Soups + dessert were superb. Lamb burger was delightful. Cocktails were good + bar was well stocked. Service was excellent. Looking fwd to returning."
5,"This is a really great restaurant. First, booking a reservation online was easy. The staff were very friendly and also, every aspect complied with the new COVID regulations. Even sitting inside, our tables were far enough away from one another. 

For my main course, I got the fish, which was so good. It was flaky and perfect. Portions are a bit on the smaller side (or maybe because I had been drinking, I was more peckish than usual) so I highly recommend getting some sides or small dishes to begin. 

The old fashioned there was really perfect and on the mark. Highly recommend.

Definitely would return and perfect for a date night."
5,"Really really good food. I would rate it top 5 in Philly. Their menu changes frequently, so if the current menu looks good, act fast! My favorite dish I had was the foie gras toast (ethically raised). The portion size was large enough to really get the taste and revel in every bite. Had a fish dish that was also really good. In general, everything I had off the menu was unique and flavorful.

I went there before the second set of covid restrictions, and their upstairs, indoor seating area was well laid out with ample distance between tables. Before being seating, they took our temperature and required us to provide them with information for contact tracing purposes.

Will definitely return, and will be monitoring their menu to see when the foie gras toast comes back!"
4,"If I could give one piece of advice heading into a dinner reservation at Vernick...GET THE TOASTS! They have these really elevated and elegant toast options. Open faced, and topped with a variety of different ingredients. We tried the: pumpkin, crab and kumquat! 

I also stepped out of my comfort zone and tried their sea urchin! Such a unique dish, and absolute must try. 

They have a relatively big menu, lots of options to choose from. I definitely want to go back to try more. We hd the apple brown sugar tart dessert, which was top-notch. Very yummy. 

This place is a great date night option. Attire is definitely a little dressier, and the scene inside is modern and swanky. We sat upstairs, which was really an open-aired floor concept. Lots of interesting art, although we felt the the furniture was pretty plain (comfy though!)"
2,"Had amazing expectations for this place based on reviews and recommendations. Went there for a birthday celebration and completely underwhelmed all around. 

Drink service slow, who uses wild Turkey in an old fashioned. Bourbon options not reflective on menu or known to waitress. 

Specials gone by an 815 reservation. 

28oz, 94$ steak ordered medium rare cooked well. 

Pork belly is the only reason for a second star. 

Wanna spend $300+ for a ruined night, this is your spot."
4,"I know that Vernick is a hotspot in the Philly food scene so I was really excited to visit! Needless to say, I had high expectations and was expecting the food and service to be top tier.

We ordered four dishes in total for two people:
2 small plates including the tuna poke salad and the maccheroni with mushroom bolognese. The tuna poke salad was light and the macadamia nut added a wonderful crunch and creamy aftertaste that was surprisingly delightful. The maccheroni bolognese was a bit too heavy for my liking and tasted like imitation meat. Given that it is a small plate, it was dense in my opinion. 

2 large plates including the cauliflower steak and the spicy shrimp burger. The cauliflower steak was well seasoned and had rich flavors. The shrimp burger was sure the show-topper. It was absolutely delicious with a crispy exterior and bouncy, soft interior that was unlike any shrimp burger that I have tried before.

I will say the server could have been kinder because the service was underwhelming. While I appreciated the additional symptom checker protocol that you had to do on your phone prior to coming to the restaurant, the server was short and dismissive to us. We knew about the cap of 90 minutes and as he handed the bill he had a rude tone telling us that the restaurant was about closing in the next 15 minutes, rather than speaking kindly/or notifying us nicely about the hours."
5,"With the Safer at Home restrictions rolling out on Friday, I was thankful for a reservation I had randomly booked several weeks ago for the Wednesday before  all indoor dining would be shut down for the rest of the year. I had heard great things about Vernick and my biggest worry was the hype was too much and that I was coming in with too big of expectations.

Vernick met and exceeded all expectations I had. From the outside, it&apos;s 1 little brownstone on the 20th block of Walnut, but upon stepping in you&apos;re in what feels like an elevated, posh, friend&apos;s condo. There&apos;s a bar when you first enter with stairs leading up, but we were taken to the back where there was a left room and a right room. The right room we sat in was large and had a wine bar, there was only 1 other table of 2. My husband and I expected to be sat at the table for 2, but instead we were pleasantly surprised they sat us at the table for 4. Great because we planned on ordering a lot. Elegant crown molding curdled the high ceiling and the room echoed as I walked to the bathroom in my boots. 

As for food we ordered 1 drink, 2 appetizers, 2 entrees and dessert. We were here celebrating my husband&apos;s 30th birthday (albeit 2 weeks early but we won&apos;t be able to go to a restaurant then so yay for planning ahead). The Fifth Season the fifth season is described as (milk punch) congac, singani, becherovka ($15) - light and sweet, we were worried because everything was sherry, brandy and dark liquor but it was very light and almost looked as if he had poured us apple cider (though it tasted nothing like it, I assure you). Would recommend for those who aren&apos;t into dark liquor, though it can be especially satisfying on a dark winter night. We were given a barlette pear soup and cheese ball as a complimentary appetizer, delicious, drink it like a shot and eat the cheeseball to ease out the saltiness. Snapper Crudo ($18) and Polenta Agnolotti ($18) for our 2 appetizers. If we weren&apos;t in public, I would have licked the remaining porcini cream sauce off the plate until it was clean. The only thing missing was an extra side of pasta for the remaining sauce after we finished the Agnolotti. Snapper Crudo had grapefruit zest and mustard, two things I&apos;m not a fan of but I had 2 and my husband gobbled the rest down. Entrees: Pork Chop ($38) and Halibut ($36) The halibut was buttery and just flaked off at your fork&apos;s touch, it was placed in this flat bowl so the broth just sat there at your own liking, with the braised cabbage and dill it was simply scrumptious. Pork chop was great, 3 pieces: the bone and 2 that were already cut for you. Bone meat was my favorite since it was more tender, the other two cuts were slightly dry, but the sweet potato and other sauces made it palatable. For dessert, we got the French bordeaux cake ($13) which was a thick spongy yet crispy wet cake and chocolate pudding. Delicious and on the house for my husband&apos;s birthday. Overall great experience, great food, great service, great ambience, no complaints at all and we had a really great time! My husband and I are typically fast eaters and we stayed for 2 hours. Would love to come back for another special occasion. 

Their COVID precautions are pretty stellar as well: they sent us screening questions prior to arrival, checked them when we arrived, took temperature and used masks, had hand sanitizer available and waiters used gloves to take our plates away. Safer at Home orders don&apos;t start until Friday, but I miss indoor dining already :( I guess we&apos;ll have to try Vernick at Home ... if I can snag a meal before they sell out so quickly, sheesh!!"
5,"Amazing! The service was possibly the best we&apos;ve ever had... and everything we tried was incredible. We had a halibut ceviche and pork belly and lentils for apps, LOVED the flavors in both. Lamb burger and cauliflower steak for dinner. Cocktails were also incredible. Nothing bad at all to say, except wish we lived closer cause we&apos;d be here all the time!"
5,"We celebrated my husband&apos;s birthday at Vernick Food &amp; Drink last night and it was the best time. As voiced by many fellow yelpers, the service here is pretty great, but it is slow. The food here is freaking amazing and they&apos;ve got a very interesting and well curated wine list. 

One particular wine caught our eye and it was the 2015 Otskhanuri Sapere from the country of Georgia. Georgian wine is not easily found and the grape used to make Otskhanuri Sapere is a very rare grape. Having tasted the wine, it was rich, earthy - honestly quite lovely even if it didn&apos;t go with our food pairings! We just had to have it!

We started dinner off with the foie gras toast and sea urchin with warm scrambled eggs. The foie gras toast was heavenly. The portions were so generous. I could eat that all day. The sea urchin with scrambled eggs had three layers of: scrambled eggs, shrimp butter, a yogurt, and then topped with sea urchin. We were instructed to scoop from the bottom so you get all the layers when eating it. It was warm, creamy, briny and oh so delicious. 

Then we had the squid ink sorpresine with tuna bolognese. It was a well put together dish, though I have to say it was on the salty side. 

Our final dish was the roasted branzino stuffed with fennel and orange. An absolute stunning dish. The fish was nicely charred and already deboned. We ate half of it and decided to pack the rest to go as we wanted to save some room for dessert.

For dessert, my husband and I shared the meyer lemon tart and the dark chocolate cookies. Our server brought out the lemon tart with a birthday candle on it since we were celebrating his birthday. Aside from making it known that we were celebrating a birthday on the questionnaire on Vernick&apos;s online reservation platform, I wasn&apos;t able to leave any instructions to bring dessert out with a candle. So I am really glad they did that.

Overall, the food was phenomenal and the staff was very nice and professional. We can&apos;t wait to come back."
5,"Came here for dinner, outdoor dining due to COVID. Their menu is a lot different than previous yelp posts, the waiter said they are using a truncated menu due to COVID. We ended up ordering apps: Shrimp and salmon. Shrimp was extremely tasty, one of my favs in meal, the avocado sauce went very well with it. It only came with 4 small shrimps though. The salmon had a nice crisp to the skin. For entrees I had the sea bass, steak and half chicken. Chicken was very tender and moist, came with lemon sauce. Steak was great but nothing special. Sea bass was very tasty as well. For dessert we tried blueberry pie and brown sugar pot de creme. The creme was really really good. Would definitely get again."
5,"Vernick makes me sad that I don&apos;t live in Philadelphia. Going here was one of my favorite dining experiences ever. The ambiance was chic yet not pretentious, warm and inviting and sophisticated. I came here for a romantic dinner and was not disappointed. 

More importantly--the food. Holy cow. I was here during a prix fix menu event and every dish was awesome. The menu changes with some regularity, according to their website, but I imagine everything is good. The Maryland crab toast still sticks out in my mind as something seemingly simple that was decadent and amazing. 

Also compared to my current town, DC, the prices are great. This meal would have been easily 25 percent more expensive in DC, and I&apos;d have had to make a reservation much further in advance, probably for a meal that wasn&apos;t as good. Vernick really showcases how Philly has come far as a great dining city."
5,"I love Vernick! As soon as indoor dining opened back up, my partner and I rushed here. The menu is completely different, understandably, but it&apos;s still phenomenal. Vernick is for sure in my top 5 spots in the city. You can always expect great food, service, and vibe. We sat upstairs for the first time (we usually just sit at the bar) and it was so cute."
5,"Came back to Vernick for another outstanding meal.  We had tuna and shrimp appetizers and both were fantastic.  My girlfriend had the sea bass for dinner and I had steak, once again Vernick did a great job. I can&apos;t wait to go back to Philly to go to Vernick Fish when they re-open.

BTW - The blueberry pie was no joke."
4,"An amazing dinner can be found and consumed at this great eatery. Vernick delivers the business.

The items I tried, in order of favoritism:
1) Sea urchin, warm scrambled eggs
2) Arctic char, crispy skin &amp; dill
3) Maryland crab
4) Beef tartare, fresh horseradish
5) Bronzino, fennel &amp; orange

The only dish you really 100% need to try is that sea urchin in a bed of warm scrambled eggs. It&apos;s heaven in a little bowl with its unique texture and flavor. Everything else was pretty delicious and it seems like everything on their menu is worth your while. I don&apos;t mean to put that deep sea bass bronzino at the end of this list. I mean, it was a pretty delicious &quot;classy&quot; non-bottom feeding fish, but the flavor could&apos;ve been better and I was just sort of full from the earlier part of the meal.

Reservations are highly recommended, but unnecessary! They also do military discount--always ask!"
5,"Our 2 year anniversary fell in the middle of COVID19 and I was worried that I wouldn&apos;t be able to celebrate you like I should. 
I had made a list of restaurants I wanted to take my wife for Valentines back in February. However we ended up just going to one of our tried and true favorites. Vernick was on top of that list. 
So when we were trying to figure out how to make this day special she suggested we see who was doing delivery. I pulled out my list and we were off to the races. We didn&apos;t get any further than Vernick.  Upon visiting the website it looked like 4/21 they started doing take out. That lead us to the menu and I was sold. I&apos;m a huge fish fan. My wife is very picky about her fish. So for her to like it as much as she did is a real testament. 
So we got:
Black Truffle &amp; Orzo Soup(THIS WAS AMAZING)
Spicy Salmon meal for two which came with a desert and awesome corn chips. 
We opted to go with DiBrunos new wine they make themselves. 
With tip and everything it ended up being $95 and was totally satisfying. 
The way it works is you order ahead of time and they give you a pick up window. You call when you are there and they bring it out. You go home with instructions on how to properly prepare it. The soup was frozen so that was just a defrost. The salmon had to go in the oven for 15 minutes. They give you times, temperatures, and how best to serve suggestions. It&apos;s really cool and I kind of hope even after the pandemic this service continues. 
So now to one of the coolest parts IMHO... they give you a Spotify playlist of what they play in the restaurant. It was perfect to set the mood! How did they know?!
So we lit the candles, turned on the playlist, put on the outfits we got married in(they still fit) and sat down for the first meal we haven&apos;t had to cook in a month!
A special thanks to Vernick and everyone who helped make our meal. I really appreciate you helping us find a way to make it truly memorable. 
When quarantine is over we will be your first customers!"
3,"Really underwhelmed with Vernick, considering all of the reviews and what I had heard about it. I&apos;d rate it probably 3.5 stars, but I&apos;m not itching to return. Arrived early, and even though there were tables open, we waited 15 minutes to be seated. 

Overall, the food was not bad at all. But there were very few standouts and prices were a bit high - probably only 2 dishes that I would order again.

Started with a couple toasts - they range from $10-24, but $24 for one slice of toast seems excessive, no matter what is on it. We went with the foie gras and the beef tartare. The foie gras was ok, but just over the top loaded with foie, and the concord jelly tasted like something from the grocery store - I get the foie pb&amp;j thing, but it wasn&apos;t executed particularly well here. Just overly rich and a touch sweet, and the bbq sunflower seeds were a weird addition. The tartare toast was probably my favorite plate of the night - well executed/seasoned/etc, larger chunks of beef which I liked. 

We had to try the scrambled eggs and uni - super rich, creamy, decadent dish. It was good, but a lot - definitely share this one. Next came the halloumi - I enjoyed this, but I also love halloumi. Can&apos;t remember anything particularly special, other than there were huge chunks of halloumi. 

Next was probably the most interesting dish (which I would definitely recommend) - savory pear custard with parmesan and lemon. Great textures and flavors here, would get that every time. Could even work as dessert. 

Continued with the tagliolini with chanterelles and kale pesto, which was unmemorable, and the grilled black sea bass which was not good. The skin of the fish did not have texture, the sea bass wasn&apos;t particularly flavorful, and the tagine flavors didn&apos;t make a lot of sense. Definitely wished we hadn&apos;t ordered this, especially since we were super full by the time it came. 

On top of the food, the service was a little off. Very generic, let me run you through the menu type service, overbearing (they were trying to take away plates when they were obviously not finished, multiple people constantly visiting the table and disrupting the meal), and just not what I would expect from a restaurant of this caliber. Asked us numerous times for drinks after we already said we weren&apos;t interested in ordering more. I tried to ask for recommendations/highlights before ordering, but our server cut me off to tell me about the specials (??). Just all over the place."
5,"Plain and simple top 3 restaurant in Philadelphia hands down! 
 The food here is simply amazing. Such fresh ingredients with amazing flavor. I ordered the brisket special and never in my life have I had such a tender flavorful piece of red meat. Sooo good. Also tried a couple of the toasts my favorite was the avocado and radish
 Ambiance is nice. Nothing really fancy just a clean restaurant with great service. If in the city of Philadelphia add this restaurant to your must try"
5,"Came here on a Wednesday for dinner date. We were seated at the Chef&apos;s table which I highly recommend! We loved watching the action behind our dishes. We were so impressed by how much detail is put into each dish. 
We ordered the veal sweetbread, turbot and blueberry pie (seasonal). Blueberry pie was a bit too sweet but the camomile ice cream helps negate it a little. The tart portion of the pie was great. First time having torbot and it&apos;s a pretty large fish. It&apos;s meant for sharing so come hungry if you&apos;re planning to order it. Nice light buttery almond sauce on top. 
I got a watermelon cocktail which was refreshing. I appreciate that they used a metal straw! 
The service was phenomenal!
Nice ambiance.
We saw a few other things being made in the kitchen frequently so we will definitely be back to try them. 
Compliments to the chef and his team!"
5,"This place had super amazing service and also the restaurant has such a pleasant atmosphere. I really enjoyed dining here. Make sure to book a reservation early so you can get seated at a nice table. 

I had five amazing dishes here.

The sea urchin scrambled egg was very interesting and at first bite  I wasn&apos;t sure how I felt about it. However, after eating it more, the texture was delightful and it was packed with uni flavor. 

The Maryland crab on toast was absolutely phenomenal. It was so creamy and the crab meat was so juicy and plentiful. This is a must try dish. 

This dish was my absolute favorite. The LOBSTER TARTARE. It was mindblowingly good. I don&apos;t even know how to describe it besides being one of the best flavor texture combinations I&apos;ve ever had. 

The squid pasta and tuna Bolognese was very delicious and I loved how the pasta fit into each bite perfectly. Not to mention, the bolognese was super flavorful (my boyfriend who isn&apos;t a huge fan of bolognese loved it) 

Lastly, the organic Amish chicken was so juicy and tender. And it was marinated in an amazing sauce combined with peppers and vegetables. 

I&apos;d highly recommend getting a reservation here and PLEASE try the lobster tartare, you will not regret it."
5,"Easily one of my top 5 favorite restaurants in the city! Everything is top notch, Interior, Service, Food, Drinks, they can do no wrong. I&apos;ve had dinners and celebrations here pre-COVID and their extended menu is phenomenal. Since COVID they have truncated the menu and found creative ways to keep customers interested like a wine shop and Pizza Saturdays (the King Crab Pizza was mind blowing by the way). I recently paid a visit on a weekday evening without a reservation to grab dessert and some drinks and luckily they had a table for two. The Apple cake and Chocolate torte were delicious and i&apos;m still dreaming about my Espresso Martini. Make your way here ASAP, you won&apos;t regret it."
