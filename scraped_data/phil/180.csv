5,"We&apos;ve had good Mediterranean food, and then we had GREAT Mediterranean food from Apricot Stone. Easy to order over the phone and the service was super quick. Phone to pick up, to mouth in under 25 minutes. Tucked into an ally in Northern Liberties, Apricot Stone is your go to place for fresh ANYTHING on their menu. 

What we snagged: 
-Falafel Plate
-Filet Plate 

Both plates come with rice pilaf and your choice of salad, pita (white/wheat), and sauce. SO much food we had enough for lunch the next day. Looking forward to post Covid to join them outside or inside. They&apos;re BYOB too. Even better. 100% will be ordering again during Covid and you should too."
5,"Came here for dinner last night with a friend. We had the Dinner for Two - it was a great way to do a tapas-style dinner, with plenty of delicious food at a decent price! Service was great, and they had an enclosed patio with heaters that was cozy and warm enough even in February. BYOB too!"
5,"Tasty, Good atmosphere, excellent place, excellent service, good prices, great music, heaven for vegetarians. 
I live in NY and it was my first visit to Apricot Stone and I love it.
 1.Food-  I am a vegetarian and they have plenty selection for vegetarians and vegans. I got trio( babaganush, motabal and beet salad walnuts. All three were incredibly tasty. I also got vegan Dolma with rice which was melty and very tasty. I got falafel with tahini as an entry, which was very well cooked, not oily and one of the best falafels I ever had. We got Pakhlava as a desert, which was good.  

2. Service- Excellent service, Anie was our waitress and she was very attentive and friendly. They don&apos;t have alcohol but you can bring yours.
 
3. Atmosphere-  Felt like being in Armenia.  Armenian and Greek music were playing through the speakers. Photos of Armenia all over the place. Even the salt and pepper shakers were from Armenia. I  am from Armenia and finding place like this was touching and emotional for me. The dining was outdoors but so warm that felt indoor. 

I would  also suggest to make a reservation in advance as the place has a lot of customers. 
I love this place and promise to go there every time I will be in Philly.  Thank you"
5,"Walked past this place and saw everyone enjoying their time and luscious plates of food. So glad we stopped. The food and service were awesome. 

Definitely recommend Apricot Stone to everyone. I know I will come back"
4,"Since I haven&apos;t been dining out because of last COVID, I got delivery and I ordered the Mixed Platter for dinner. I got chicken kebab, chicken shawarma and filet. I am a huge chicken shawarma fan but this was my least favorite.  It was quite dry and not enough flavor. The kebab and filet were both excellent, with the filet being my absolute favorite. 

The hummus was outstanding and the pita was good too. I&apos;m glad I ordered an extra pita. Both were even good the day after. The Israeli salad was enjoyable. 

The next time I&apos;ll skip the mixed platter so I can get more filet since I loved it so much."
5,The service is great. The location and outdoor options are helpful. The food is fresh and the staff is engaged. We bring out of town guests here and it is a hit. A few appetizers and salads are a solid choice for a nice dinner and conversation. The food is mild spicy so its good for those who haven&apos;t had a lot of middle-eastern food.
5,"100/10 - phenomenal - great atmosphere, great servers, great food. Came here in July with my family and had such a nice experience. We were running late for our reservation and couldn&apos;t find parking to save our lives - we had called the restaurant to let them know we were going to be late and a few minutes later they called and said they had a parking spot saved for us. I think it was the owner or maybe the manager but he kindly moved his own car from a spot right out front and let us take it for the time being - it was so sweet and telling of how they treat their customers. 

We ordered a bunch of food that I forgot to take pictures of because I was so excited when it arrived. We got the trio of dips to split between 5 of us and it was the perfect little amount for sampling. We also got some spanakopita which was delicious and perfectly cooked - nice and flaky on the outside. We also obviously couldn&apos;t come and not get some cheese boreg which tasted just as good as my grandmas used to. We also got some kibbeh kufteh which wasn&apos;t my personal favorite but was very flavorful nonetheless. The manti was incredible I&apos;m drooling just thinking about it. We also shared some chicken and lamb kabobs which were so good - nothing tasted too salty which I sometimes have an issue with at Mediterranean restaurants.

All in all a fantastic experience. I left feeling uncomfortably full and will definitely be coming back whenever I&apos;m in Philly."
3,I thought the food here was OK but the restaurant wasn&apos;t that great it&apos;s definitely overpriced for a Middle Eastern style dining which I am very custom to egg dying at these types of restaurants all the time I am not from Philadelphia so I&apos;m not familiar with other restaurants there but I would say that there have to be some that are better than this.
5,"Came here for Valentine&apos;s day, and it was absolutely so charming and romantic. The food was sooo good. We had the fattoush salad with falafels and the mixed platter with chicken, chicken shawarma, and falafel, and sides of lebni and imam bayaldi. The prices are very affordable for a fancy night out. Very satisfied :)"
5,"Came here for dinner. Had to RSVP cause busy. They have outdoor seating with tons of heaters so was comfy outside. Good vibe, lots of good lighting. For apps we had cheese boreg, hummus, and grape leaves. For dinner we had the chicken kebab, lamb kebab and another. Everything was really tasty and well made. Staff were very friendly and helped us with byob bottles. Would definitely recommend this place and come back!"
5,Always outstanding. They give the BIGGEST portions at such a fair price plus BYOB. I had the falafel plate with hummus and it was amazing.
4,"Good spot! Looks really nice on the inside. 

Ordered the falafel wrap plus the dip Trio. The wrap was a little dry (I&apos;d ask for more sauce next time) but the flavors were really good. The pickles and pickled vegetables was a nice touch. 

The baba ghanoush was the bright spot for the dips"
5,"Last night was the first time I visited this restaurant since COVID &amp; it was actually the last indoor dining experience I had pre covid. My friends have been going there for years but this was only my second time going. I was not happy with the service the first time I went (and the restaurant was empty) but yesterday we had a whole new experience. The whole staff was friendly but our waitress in particular was extremely attentive and took her her time explaining the menu. Even though we are all Middle Eastern and know what we wanted she walked us through the menú to get the best bundle deal for us to basically taste everything on the menu took her time explaining it, even with a full restaurant she still had a smile under that mask. As a pescatarian the spanakopita, baba ganouj &amp; grilled veggies skewers were a few of my favs but we cleared all of our plates and will definitely be returning. 
We definitely enjoyed the evening very much with the courteous service, the food was superb. And the ambience of Armenia meeting Northern liberties was the perfect touch."
2,"I really wanted to like this place as it&apos;s new and we need more good middle eastern options around Northern Liberties, but we were disappointed. We ordered a selection of options for take out.

The falafel was extremely dry, hard, and mealy, and we didn&apos;t even finish them. Halal cart falafel is far better.

The dips (hummus, jajukh, muhamara) and tabouleh were decent but sorely in need of better spicing. My partner remarked that someone needs to show them how to use salt. In contrast, we also had a side of lebni with the main dish and that was done quite well. 

The meats were good. We tried a mixed plate with lamb, filet kebab, and chicken shawarma, and that was by far the best part of the meal.

They&apos;re new and we really want more middle eastern options in the area, and so we&apos;ll give them a try again in a little time - and we&apos;re hoping they&apos;ll improve!"
4,"A few weeks ago, my friend and I went out to dinner at Apricot Stone. It&apos;s located in the Northern Liberties neighborhood. This area of Philadelphia is flourishing; there&apos;s plenty of new restaurants and bars in the area. Like many dining establishments in the area, Apricot Stone is BYOB. The restaurant itself is pretty small, I highly recommend making reservations. I had a hard time parking, but my friend was quickly seated while she was waiting for me. I personally think parking is kind of difficult around this area, since I&apos;m not the best parallel parker, but you can find some parking nearby. Although it was already cold out, it looks like they would have plenty of seating during the warmer months. I&apos;ll have to head back and check it out.

The service was alright, nothing memorable. I believe our waitress gave us some recommendations on her personal favorites of the menu, which I always appreciate and refilled our waters a few times. We definitely ordered way too much for just two people, but who doesn&apos;t love leftovers? We ordered a few variety of plates to truly try more items on the menu. I wish we had room for dessert because all of them sounded divine. Maybe next time!

What we ordered: 

Trio: pick any of the 3 dips/salads on their menu

Jajukh- &quot;tzatziki cucumbers, mint, and yogurt
Hummus- Chickpeas, tahini, olive oil
Imam Bayaldi- baked eggplant, tomato, peppers, and onion

All three were delicious. They were served with a crispy pita that was almost chip-like. I could have easily gotten a few of the trios to try all of them. I expected a softer pita for the sauces to be sopped up, but the crispy pita was a nice change

Stuffed grape leaves: Rice and vegetables, served cold

These were good, a little different than grape leaves that I&apos;m used to eating.

Manti

Homemade open-face dumplings with ground beef, topped with garlic yogurt and sumac.

I heard that I needed to order these prior to arriving at Apricot Stone. I never heard of manti before, but I loved it. I wasn&apos;t sure what to expect when ordering these. The crispy shell of the dumplings mixed with the stuffing was delicious. As they sat on the table, they began to absorb some of the sauce and was slightly soft. SO Good!

Mix Platter

We chose the falafel, chicken shawarma, and lamb. It comes with rice pilaf and the option of two sides. Since we already got a few of the dips from the trio, we got the beet salad and muhammara (roasted red peppers and walnuts).

The mixed platter was everything I wanted. I got to try a variety of proteins and some additional sides. I loved the falafel. The shawarma had great seasoning and went well with the remaining dips that we had from the appetizer.

Everything was pretty tasty. I wouldn&apos;t say it&apos;s the best food I&apos;ve ever eaten but definitely satisfying and would be happy to go back and try more items on the menu. Will have to save it for a warm day, because who doesn&apos;t lock cocktails on the patio?"
3,"I came here for a birthday dinner, thinking we could order a bunch of plates and share them. 
The outside seating was beautiful, aside from the hookah smoke traveling our way. The service was incredibly slow, that we portioned out water until we could get more. 
The food overall was okay. The falafel was dry without much flavor. The chicken was nicely blackened but needed a lot of dip/sauce. But for how much it all cost, i expected much bigger portions and better flavor."
5,"My friends and I were almost out of luck with trying to find a BYO reservation on a Saturday night. I came across Apricot Stone last minute, and I am unbelievably glad we decided to eat here. As the indecisive people we are, we decided to go for the Dinner for Two, which came with the best variety of dishes we could have asked for. The stuffed grape leaves, mujaddara, and spanakopita were remarkable, and the service staff could not have been more nice. And the fact that you can bring 2 bottles of your own wine to sip on is the cherry on top."
4,"Ordered the dinner for 2 with a 2-3 additional apps for our party of 5, and it was a good amount of food. We tried many dips with their pita chips (which are nice and flaky, different from your typical pita chip). 

My favorites from the night were the cheese boreg, spanakopita, and steak kebab. I would definitely recommend the boreg, which i preferred slightly over the spanakopita. I was pleasantly surprised by the steak kebab, it was nice and tender without being overlooked. The dumplings were recommended to us though they were too hard and not particularly to my liking.

The desserts were also good, with the rice pudding being my favorite of the night, having a mild rose flavor.

Overall, this is a nice place to dine and BYOB for a medium sized party. There are tables outside perfect for the summer months :)"
5,"You CAN NOT go wrong with Apricot Stone EVER. Dining in, pick up and even take out are all top notch. They never skimp on portions or perfection. Who doesn&apos;t like a solid BYOB? It&apos;s the perfect spot for a meal with family, or cozy date night. 
Try Apricot Stone as you will not regret it. 
Chicken shawarma over anything else"
5,"This place is absolutely amazing we were there yesterday and everything we ate was just amazing and the waiter was very nice, the dessert was delicious it is clear that we&apos;ll go back to this place give this place a try you won&apos;t regret"
