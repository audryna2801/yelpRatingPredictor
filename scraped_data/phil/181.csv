4,"[This review was made in 10/2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic]

My friend and I had intentions on going to an Italian restaurant, but after a change of plans, we ended up here with an even larger group of friends! I had never heard of this place before nor had I tried German food before, but as my fine arts professor once said in college, &quot;It&apos;s never bad to try everything at least once!&quot;

Because I wanted to try so much of the menu, my friend and I split two dishes. We split the Wiener Schnitzel (chicken) and the Schweinshaxe! Coming here made me realize how similar cuisines can be between cultures. The Wiener Schnitzel is a breaded chicken cutlet that came with fries on the side and it really reminded my of the Japanese katsus that I&apos;ve had in many ramen eateries. The Schweinshaxe, which is Brauhaus Schmitz&apos; specialty, is a crispy pork shank with a dunkel lager jus and wow was this delicious. For those of you who have had Filipino food, this is very similar to crispy pata, but of course with German flavors. Of the two, the Schweinshaxe was my favorite.

I did see that they had rooftop seating, which I will try the next time I get the chance. We were seated on the extended sidewalk, which was very loud at times, but bearable. Regardless, it was good food with good company, and that&apos;s all that you can really ask for."
5,"I wanted to bring my family out to a nice dinner but also remaining safe during COVID times. With a group of 6 I was a little concerned about finding a place that could accommodate, but Brauhaus Schmitz was perfect. 

I made a reservation through Resy about a week in advance and was able to get one of the few tables up on the beautiful roof top. One of my favorite views in Philly so far. 

There were a ton of stairs getting up there so for your servers sake I definitely recommend getting a big stein downstairs and bringing it up to avoid making trips. The view made it worth it and the beer and food were awesome. The brat with cheese in it with sour kraut and potato salad were a hit!"
5,"I am so glad I finally tried this place!! It was recommended to me because of their long list of German beers. They have the largest German beer in the country according to them. Right now they have an outdoor walk up window they are calling a &quot;zeitgeist&quot; with a little seating area. 

The food is wonderful. It&apos;s potato heaven. We had the potato soup and the schupfnudeln (like giant gnocchi) in creamy brown butter spinach sauce with toasty root vegetable bits and it was so good!!!!! We also got the mandeltorte (almond tart). 
The beer was excellent- we had the Ayinger celebrator. It is based on a monk&apos;s recipe so of course it&apos;s good- dark and malty, with a bit of a coffee taste. I like the swing top cute growler and my husband can reuse to to brew beer. 

Definitely will be back. Hope they keep up the great vegetarian options!"
4,"This is a really fun place to eat. When things are open for indoors, they have a cool open room with lots of benches you can sit at, so its super engaging with everyone there. They have other seating outside of this as well, but very much a feel of a place you can go to get good food, be a little rowdy, watch some football, and drink great beer.

They have a ridiculous sausage plate for tasting. I got this with 6 different sausages, and it was such a cool experience to try so many different types (mainly beef and pork mixtures.) Their side offerings are pretty solid as well (potato pancakes bavarian pretzel are solid gets.)

For beer, they literally have a glossary - so much try, you&apos;ll definitely find something you like. 

Like I said, really fun atmosphere - super casual, great place to try and avoid the sunday scaries."
1,"I would honestly give it 0 if possible. Right off the bat I dislike any place that charges automatic gratuity and this is a perfect example of why I hate it. We were a group of 5, 4 of our orders were wrong. 1 didn&apos;t even come out, and the other 3 had to be sent back. 2 of the orders came out about 5 minutes after their first attempt, and the last 2 came out about another 10 minutes after that. The hot apple cider was &quot;warming&quot; up the entire time we were there, over an hour by the way, and we finally just cancelled the order for that. Our server only showed up only a couple of times. I got 1 refill the entire time and had to wait forever for him to come out, and then had to flag him down when he was out, but he got tipped almost $30. That is totally unacceptable. If I can&apos;t choose my servers tip then their service had better be worth 18% ever time. Also, I did notice it, but the notice that they automatically add 18% gratuity is in very fine print at the bottom of the menu. Not only is it very easy to miss they have a spot on the receipt to add more tip. I&apos;ve fallen for this trick once before and I don&apos;t like it. If you auto-add tip, don&apos;t put a spot on the menu for one.

Now, why didn&apos;t the food make up any of the stars? Well 2 of us got the Jagerschnitzel and the nice thick mushroom gravy on top was so watery that it had all the breading soggy in the first 2 minutes it was on the plate. And to be clear when I say watery I mean I couldn&apos;t even tell there was gravy, it looked like water on my plate. The meat inside was tough and dry. The Rouladen was even tougher and drier and barely edible, and the Sauerbraten was almost as bad. In the case of the last 2 they should be tender, juicy, and loaded with flavor. They weren&apos;t even close to the mark, and they were $23 each.

I wanted to like this place, and the friend who brought us here has been multiple times so I believe that they used to be good, but I can&apos;t share that experience. 4 out of 5 plates were bad, service was lacking, and we over paid for bad food and bad service. If you drop the 18% gratuity requirement I would consider eating here again, but with what you charged me for the dishes you put in front of me yesterday I&apos;m not taking a risk getting overcharged for bad food and bad service.

Also, 1 final note to the management in case you see this. If your server comes out and sees that 5 guests are leaving with their plates half full of food and they don&apos;t want boxes to take back the remaining half of an order that cost $200 you should probably have them ask what&apos;s wrong."
4,"Brauhaus Schmitz offers authentic German cuisine in a fun and traditional ambiance. Portions are huge, so come with a big appetite. I got the Schweinshaxe, which was delicious and ginormous. The Schweinebraten was also pretty good, though I wish it came with red cabbage like normal Sauerbraten. The beer selection is excellent. Unfortunately, the pretzels were pretty disappointing, so I don&apos;t recommend getting those.

If you sit on the rooftop, you get a fantastic view of the Philadelphia skyline. It&apos;s a lot of flights of stairs to get there, but I highly recommend.

Lastly, they have a fun Oktoberfest party which I can recommend for anyone who&apos;d enjoy an afternoon of hanging out, drinking and eating, and enjoying live German music.

Overall a nice brauhaus perfect for when you&apos;re craving German food."
4,"My husband and I tried Brauhaus for the first time a few weeks ago. We made a reservation through open table. They have a bunch of large picnic tables out front for out door dining, and then for small parties, the have tables on the roof.  The view from the roof is absolutely amazing! You can see the entire city! It&apos;s beautiful! Please be ware, if you are in a small party, you will have to walk up several flights of stairs to get to the roof, they do not have an elevator. For us, this was no problem. They ask that you order your beer when you enter to help cut down on trips the waitstaff will have to make up and down the stairs. 

Their menu is very authentic German food. I ordered the burger, and my husband ordered the wiener plate. The waitress was super nice, and never even broke a sweat walking up and down those stairs! We were impressed! Our food was a little disappointing. My burger was good, but the fries were gross. They were pretty soggy and had a weird seasoning. My husband said his sausages were just ok. He said they taste like brats from the grocery store. Nothing was terrible, just not as great as we were expecting it to be based off other reviews. It was also a little pricey. We spent almost $70 before the tip. 

So overall we had an ok experience. The view from the rooftop was SOOOO great! Our waitress was awesome. But the food was a little disappointing. I don&apos;t think we would go back for food, but we would go back for a beer on the rooftop!"
4,"We wouldn&apos;t have discovered Brauhaus Schmitz if it wasn&apos;t for my friends and their confusion of the Philadelphia food hall scene.

It was a Saturday night and I was in town with a large group of friends. After a few drinks in Center City we were all growing hungry and the plan was to venture out to a food hall for dinner.

&quot;Oh which food hall are we going to? Redding Terminal?&quot; I asked the group

&quot;No we&apos;re going to South Street Market,&quot; answered one of my friends. With that we followed him over a mile to South St. As we walked up to a closed corner bodega full of hookahs that read, &quot;South Street Market,&quot; we all realized that we had made a mistake.

Tired, hungry, and ready for another drink we headed to the place next door: Brauhaus Schmitz. As a fan of German cuisine I wasn&apos;t disappointed with the menu: the pretzels were hot and fresh, the schnitzel was large and in charge, and the spätzle was cooked just right. All in all it wasn&apos;t a very fortunate turn of events.

At the table as we all sat and reflected on what a good find Brauhaus was I asked whose idea was it to find &quot;South Street Market.&quot; My friend who led us pointed to another and said it was his idea.

So I asked, &quot;Which market did you think was on South Street? I thought we wanted to go to Redding Terminal Market, the indoor one we went to two years ago.&quot;

&quot;Oh ya, that&apos;s the market! Is that the name? I thought it South Street Market.&quot;"
5,"Love this place.  We come up from Baltimore each year for Oktoberfest.  It is always a great time.  With this year being different, they did a great job, basically offering table service on the street.  The menu and beer list were excellent, and it was a great experience."
1,"What a terribly disappointing experience. My fiancé and I are in the entertainment/hospitality industry and have more than average respect and understanding for what a huge operational impact it must be operating under COVID restrictions, however our experience was beyond a margin of typical covid impact. 

Visited 9/12, dined outside and tables was filthy and sticky, thank god for my travel sized Lysol spray. After the hostess sat us we waited 30 min before a server even acknowledged us. 50 min went by before we could even put in a drink order.

We ordered apps and entrees. The entrees came to the table first, the food runner literally dropped them and ran. Still no apps. My fiancé got the sausage sampler platter, and contrary to any experience we&apos;ve ever had at a German restaurant, the server did not explain what each sausage was, nor were there indicating flags. 

5 minutes later, an entirely different server came to the table with the apps and asked &quot;if we still wanted them&quot;.... I wanted them before my entree, not all at once for the food to get cold. I asked to have the apps cancelled. General observation of the servers working was there was a noticeable lack of any urgency, general human decency/customer service. Slamming things in tables and running off... a manager budding a table and throwing full mugs of beer right in the street to splash on nearby diners.

I&apos;ve had better German food at McDonalds when they did their international limited menu... and certainly better service. This place is just garbage."
5,"Brauhaus was my first German restaurant visit in Philadelphia, and I was very impressed with their service and food.

Went with a large group of students (about 15 of us) and the legendary Professor Eric Clemons, and they made sure we were taken care of! We had a private room setup in the back of the restaurant, including plenty of room to chat, mingle, and watch TV at the bar.

Nearly all of us started out with a beer sampler (must try if you enjoy libation pairings) and set of interesting appetizers (meats, cheeses, fish, veggies). Then, the main course was the pig roast and even more veggies!

Very grateful to the staff and welcoming hospitality. Would definitely come back again soon to try out another set of beers and menu options!"
5,"I was seriously craving shnitzel so my coworkers and I decided to walk down to South Street to Brauhaus.  I was not dissapointed.  This has to be my favorite German themed craft hall in Philly compared to Bru up on Chestnut Street.  They really did a nice job with the decor and the display of the different steins is really cool.  Since we went on a regular weekday for lunch the place was pretty much empty with maybe two other patrons.  My coworker and I both ordered the schnitzel which was way more than one should eat for a workday lunch, sure it was a bit pricey for a regular workday lunch but no complaints on my end.  Looking forward to having another excuse to visit."
5,"Most authentic German food, drink, AND atmosphere!  Growing up with a German grandma that cooked a lot of Bavarian food, the food here was very good, the beer is great, and atmosphere was very typical of a German Stube.   Just fantastic all around.  Can&apos;t recommend enough!  

So many &quot;German&quot; restaurants offer a few bottled German beers, bratwurst, a mall-pretzel with American mustard, and claim to be a &quot;German&quot; restaurant.   

But then the menu goes downhill, not to mention the cheesy guy in the corner paying a polka on an accordion.  You imposter restaurants know what I&apos;m talking about!   Those &quot;authentic&quot; German foods you serve like:

-Bavarian Nachos
-Beer battered onion rings 
-October Fest chicken wings
-Rhineland Rubens
-German Fried Baby Pickles
And of course the 100%, always totally authentic, 
-German chocolate cake!

Sheesh!

Life is too short to eat fake German food.   Go to the Brauhaus for the real deal, and GO NOW!"
4,"Was there for their Octoberfest event. You had to make reservations ahead,which was fairly easy. We had 2 tables of 6. We waited 5 minutes for both tables. Service was so so-- one table got their beers and appetizers about 10 minutes before the other table. We both had the same waitress. Since event was outside and staff had to run long distances maybe they should of hired more staff for the event. The food was outstanding. My party ordered 4 serevings of the sausage sampler( 6 different sausages with sauerkraut and potatoes).The rest  
Had either pork or veal schnitzel. It was a great outdoor event with music,beer and great food. Been here a couple of times and the place never disappoints"
2,"Was craving schnitzel. regretting that REAL quick. Do not bother ordering anything but sausages here. And the sausages were only pretty OK. This chicken was the worst. Somehow the chicken was soggy on the outside, drenched in oil....Which tasted old....and dry as hell on the inside and a strange pink color. The potatoes were like mush with no flavor. I just threw it away. Burger wasnt too bad, fries were very good. Salad was fresh."
1,Negative 1 Star. Piss warm beer and ice cold food. Take your Oktoberfest cash grab and shove it up your ass. Waitress was just as terrible as the food too. Apparently it was our fault you were short staffed. Really appreciated the attitude. I see why you put the %18 gratuity on automatically. If you cons didn&apos;t take my card to start the transaction I would&apos;ve left after 45 beer and food less minutes. Won&apos;t get another dime off me
5,"This was our fourth visit!  

We have always enjoyed the ambiance, delicious food, and extensive drink list! This is the closest place to grab German comfort food and the closest in taste/ authenticity. My boyfriend hates coming with me to German places due to Germany being my home country. This place never disappoints!

This time we came to enjoy the restaurant menu. We were greeted right away by a friendly sever whom tooK us upstairs (which we love). Shortly after we were greeted by the server. She was friendly, attentive to our needs, and everything was well timed out.

The food was amazing, as usual. We started off with the Kartoffel puffer which were served with applesauce (Apfelmus) and brought back many childhood memories &amp; Gulaschsuppe which was spiced nicely. right before we got our means weordered a second round of drinks. The server recommended the peach beer with a 2.5 ABV, it was nice and refreshing, just what I needed. My boyfriend got the Pork Shank that came with sauerkraut and mashed potatoes &amp;  I got the  the Wienerschnitzel which came with french fries and a house salad, both were excellent. We ended the meal with an apple strudel and a pretzel bread pudding, both were perfectly light and delicious.

Overall a great experience!!"
3,"3.5 Stars. I come here mainly when I&apos;m craving German beer. Excellent German beer selection on tap. Food is good if your in the mood for Schnitzel plates, sausages and I particularly like the Goulash soup / stew. Meals are served with home made bread which is very good when fresh. Warning - it&apos;s hard to eat healthy at Brauhaus, everything is heavy, fried, large portions and higher fat dishes. I&apos;ve been a customer for the last four years and the service can be hit or miss at the tables or bar areas. Lots of special events through the year. I really like sitting at either of the two large bars enjoying the German beer and background music (especially when it&apos;s not crazy busy). At times there is live music which is too loud in my opinion as it&apos;s very difficult to talk to anyone without screaming. 

Highly recommended if your in the mood for German / Bavarian beer / food. Other German focused bars / restaurants in the city just don&apos;t have the same extensive beer / food options.

3,"I visited this bar with a friend and I enjoyed the large variety of beers offered.  The overall environment of the German restaurant was fun and just like &quot;Texas&quot; everything is done BIG - The beers - The Food = BIG!

I had a few German brews along with a bratwurst and pretzel.  I enjoyed the our bartender who provided us with plenty of samples and educated us on German beers.  

I will be back to enjoy more of the offerings."
5,"Have stopped by here once or twice a year for quite a few years and the consistency and experience is still the same.  Perfect. The ambiance is just right, German beer hall feel, Bundesliga playing on TV&apos;s above the bar, long tables and proper glassware for each Brewery/Beer Style. The back room is spacious, a little loud, but very homey.  

Their German beer menu is unmatched.  They have breweries on tap that I am told are exclusive to them in this area and their bottle list is extensive.  The variety of German beer styles compliments the menu so well.  For example Aecht Schlenkerla makes the best smoke beers in the world, (you can find them on tap and in bottles here) pair so well with the 9 different wurst offerings.  

The house made Laugenbrezel (Pretzel) is a must starter, my wife orders Kartoffelpuffer aka potato pancakes every time we come and she loves them.  On this trip I went with the Wurstplatte which comes with two sausages from their list of 9!  I chose the Weibwurst (mild pork&amp;veal) and the Feuerwurst (very spicy pork) with a double serving of potato salad.  The sausages are big portion wise and very fresh.  Feuerwurst was very spicy, but not enough to take away the pork flavor and had a nice snap when you broke through the casing.  Weibwurst may not look appealing because of its white appearance, but it was mild, juicy and tender.  Potato salad, served cold was delicious.  

I finished my evening with a bottle of Weihenstephaner Korbinian, a full bodied doppelbock with nice fruity flavors of figs and plums and left a happy man.  
Love this place!"
