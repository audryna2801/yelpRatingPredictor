5,"Forget Geno&apos;s and Pat&apos;s when it comes to cheesesteaks -- THIS is the place you want to go. (Get the sharp -- just trust me on this one.)

The prices? A little higher than most, yes, but worth every penny. (Thanks, Mr. Portnoy!)

Staff was masked, and social distancing was in place.

A new Philly favorite for me and mine!"
5,"If you live within the Philadelphia area, this place is the place to go if you want pizza! This pizzeria caught my attention after a pizza review video done by Dave Portnoy from Barstool. One bite everybody knows the rules...

Pros: 
- the best pizza you&apos;ll get for your money 
- you can now call ahead and place an order a pie for pick-up (guess this is one positive of a pandemic) 
- HUGE portions

Cons: 
no real cons, just remember to bring cash with you as they are cash only."
5,"Bring some cash and expect a wait, but they are a solid place for pizza. Luckily when I went (before the pandemic), there was not a huge line. We waited for about 15 minutes to order and then another 15-20 to get our grandma pie. 

We ate half the pizza together in one sitting, and honestly, we probably could&apos;ve downed the whole thing right there. The dough was thin but held up nicely, the cheese was fresh and plentiful, but what impressed me the most was their tomato sauce. I&apos;ve never been someone who eats pizza for the tomato pie experience, but this tomato sauce was flavorful and fresh - a component that I will definitely consider more in other pizzas from now on.

If you&apos;re looking for a quality thin crust, authentic pizza experience, I&apos;d recommend coming here."
5,"We got this pizza before our flight out. It was so good I almost canceled the flight and bought a house in Philly.

Wow. Just wow. This can compete with any place in NY or Chicago.

This should be seen as a Philly staple. Or let&apos;s keep it a secret and not tell anyone. I am cool with either.

Yes, the wait is long, but it is worth every second. Little Italy is nearby I recommend strolling through there while you wait!

I can&apos;t wait to try their cheesesteak next time!"
5,"Angelo&apos;s has some really good pizza (my wife&apos;s favorite in the city), but their sandwiches are even better. I truly believe that they make the best cheesesteak in Philly. It all starts with their homemade seeded Italian bread, which they bake fresh every single morning. You can follow them on Instagram to see Danny doing the baking every day (usually dancing and having fun too!). Get the cheesesteak with Cooper sharp cheese and onions. They also have a great meatball sandwich, but I still need to try their chicken cutlets.

They are closed right now, but the ordering system recently has been to call ahead. Keep in mind, you will have to try again and again, and again to get through on the phone. Don&apos;t give up though because it will totally be worth it!"
2,"Where do I start!

We drove by and saw all the people outside and we&apos;re intrigued. 

Before I dive into my review I do wanna clarify that I understand that we have a pandemic and things are different, therefore I am doing this review based on their way to adapt to the world situation and also this review is about the items we tried overall. 
I will be noting all about the EXPERIENCE as a whole. 

Some things may be different from prior to covid I will put an * next to the experience I feel that is probably post covid policy. 

This location is very popular it seems. they have tons of people here and I heard that they open in the morning and remain open until they daily ingredients run out. To me that mean that they are so popular that they run out of food every single day!

As we decided to get pizza from here we came to find out that they only take orders through the phone *   the lines were so busy that it took almost an hour to get in touch with he person answering the phones, and we were calling non stop for the entire time. 

Once we got the order in we were told to come in about 20 min to get the pizza. 

THIS PLACE IS CASH ONLY so we had to make sure we had enough money and that is the easy part. 


Parking here was easy as they do not have dine in *.... so people park get their pizza and go, none the less it is street parking

We came to get the pizza and it took longer than 20 minutes for sure. Their style is pretty similar to MICHAELA&apos;S in Napoli, someone comes outside and screams a name and you come get your pizza and pay inside *

After well over 20 min we got our pizza, however when we looked in the pizza was missing toppings we had ordered and we had to come back and turn the pizza in so they could fix it, AND HERE IS WHY I AM GIVING THEM THE 2 STARS.

They took the pizza back in, we waited ANOTHER HOUR for the correct pizza, it was pretty cold and we had to stay outside. 

By the time we got our correct pizza they had already ran our of ingredients, and that was around 3pm. 

before I give my final thoughts let me talk about the pizza 

GRANDMA STYLE WITH PEPPERONI- the pizza is square, marketed as a thin crust, I must say that I love deep dish but this thin crust was kind of a mid range and I was pleased with the cheese to dough ration..... so as far as the pizza dough I was happy with it. the toppings and the sauce taste was good, we think that they have the best pepperoni we have had in a long while. however the pizza is far from outstanding.


NOW HERE IS THE FINAL TOUGHT ABOUT THE ENTIRE EXPERIENCE SO PLEASE READ THIS.

the fact that we spend an entire hour to order, over 30 min waiting for the pizza, to get it and see it was the wrong pizza (lucky for us who checked before driving away as we are not locals) and the wait another HOUR for them to give us the correct pizza was honestly NOT WORTH AT ALL the final product. 

they have plenty of inconveniences from phone orders *, cash only, long waits.... the expectation is that this pizza is worth all the hustle and it WAS NOT.

the pizza was OK at best, far from the best I ever had. 

the fact that they pushed us to the back of the line AGAIN to make the correct pizza was honestly an slap to our face, we had to wait AGAIN as if we had just ordered and that is not how things go in the restaurant industry. 

WHEN they make a MISTAKE they should push the meal to the front of the line and make sure the customer gets whet they asked for..... 

honestly I do NOT recommend this place and will NEVER come back here, they displayed the behaviour of a already successful business that does no longer car to customer satisfaction...."
5,"Second visit -- they were out of pizzas (about 6pm on a Friday), so we got a bunch of sandwiches instead. The cheesesteak was amazing once again, and the chicken parm was excellent. I think our favorite, though, was the Boom, which is a non-daily menu item, and had chicken cutlets, fresh mozz, long hots stuffed with prosciutto, and shaved parmesan. This one really blew us away.

We&apos;ll be back to try more -- I really wanted to try the upside down especially, so hopefully next time."
5,Hello! I&apos;ve been attempting to get in touch on behalf of my client who wants to potentially collaborate. Can one of your team members please email jmassanari@webershandwick.com or call 310-854-8215 to connect? Thank you!!
5,"Wow!Wow! Angelos makes the best Italian sandwiches and pizza in Philadelphia!
The chicken cutlet sandwich assortments are mine blowing. The nice thing about the chicken cutlet sandwiches are that you can create your own or order of one of the specialty items like chicken cutlet on a seeded homemade roll with a balsamic glaze, prosciutto, arugula and sharp provolone. The pizza is five star gourmet one bite and you know you&apos;re eating something special. I&apos;ve had the cheesesteaks they were outstanding I&apos;ve had the chicken cutlet sandwiches a few times amazing and the pizza as well as roast pork.
Welll all I could say is get ready for the wow factor"
4,"We can&apos;t let the appearance deceive us - the shop is smacked dab in the middle of other row homes &amp; shops, and it is easy to walk passed it...unless they have the usual crowd of hungry patrons waiting to sink their teeth into a slice of pizza or Italian sandwich. Their goal isn&apos;t to have the curb appeal draw you in. They know once you try to the food, you won&apos;t forget where they are at. If you can snag a table to eat outside, you are lucky - plan to pick up and eat in the car or find a step to sit on (not really a place you can plan ahead to go and eat at.) Pre-covid, you have to just show up - no phone number, no ordering online. Now you can at least call ahead, but be prepared to call back multiple times because their phone is ringing off the hook. 

The shop itself is cool, tight quarters but tons of energy. They are a well oiled machine inside, and you can see, everyone who works there is passionate about what they do. 

The food is solid. We got the regular pie and the &quot;Sunday Morning&quot; Meatball sandwich. The pizza does have a distinct and delicious taste, well constructed, not too greasy... but I wouldn&apos;t travel far and wide to get it. Maybe the benefit of living in Philly, but there are plenty of pizza shops pushing out pies just as good. The meatball sandwich on the other hand was very memorable. Their broccoli rabe was fantastic, the saltiness and bitterness paired so well with the provolone and sweet flavor in the meatballs. All placed on a soft and warm roll - you can&apos;t beat it. 

We definitely want to go back &amp; try the different pies and sandwiches. Their menu is pretty expansive and creative, a lot of their offerings look tasty on paper, so I have no doubt we will be visiting again."
5,"Let&apos;s be honest... the hype is real. I called ~50 times before getting through but ordered a pie and it was ready in 20 mins. They pump these pies out like wizards, I swear, and somehow they&apos;re still insanely delicious. Crust is crisp and chewy, and there&apos;s the perfect ratio of cheese to sauce. The basil leaves are just the extra special touch. I am from New York and therefore was born a pizza snob, but Angelo&apos;s is one of the best pies in Philadelphia and could easily match up with the better pies I&apos;ve had in NY.

Someone made a suggestion to me about calling on off days/hours, and it worked. Good luck getting a pie Friday-Sunday - if you do, please reach out to me with your magic."
5,"Angelo&apos;s has been on our list for a little while now because so many people rave about it. We finally tried it last night and were not disappointed!

We called around 6:30pm on a Thursday to order a margherita pizza -- by then, they were out of sandwich rolls and only had dough for round pies and were closing up at 7pm. This was totally fine for us, but something worth sharing as it sounds like they are a popular spot with limits on what they can/will serve in a day so don&apos;t delay getting your order in. $22 for a pizza seemed like a lot, but I guess that&apos;s the price you pay for delicious pies.

We picked up our pizza and walked over to Hawthorne park on 12th and Catherine to eat it. It was so delicious. I am always a fan of a greasy slice and I tend to not be impressed by these types of wood fired pizzas but this was amazing. I felt like it captured a good mix of grease and artisanal pizza styles. I think I tasted some provolone, not just mozzarella? The sauce was delightful.

This is definitely my favorite pizza spot in the city as of right now, with Zio&apos;s coming in a hot second because I do favor the greasy pies and it&apos;s in my neighborhood. I&apos;m sure we&apos;ll be back here!"
3,"Angelo&apos;s is a very popular Philly pizza joint. Unfortunately, I found it just so-so. The pizzas were fresh and warm, but they weren&apos;t remarkable per se. The Diablo was tasty but VERY SPICY. The mushroom pizza was enjoyable but certainly not mind-blowing.

The pizzeria loses some points for just being so darn inconvenient. You need to call ahead to place an order, and you need to call dozens of times because the line is usually busy. Just keep trying. Then they said the pizzas would be ready in half an hour, but in reality it took over an hour, so we had to stand outside in the rain waiting for pizza for over 30 minutes. The whole ordering and pickup process is not well designed.

Perhaps Angelo&apos;s is worth a visit just to see a classic Philly pizzeria. But I don&apos;t feel the need to return again soon."
5,"We are fans of David Portnoy, so when he reviewed Angelo&apos;s -twice within the last year or so- and gave both the pizza and the cheesesteak AMAZING reviews, we were game to try it.  

Our first attempt was a no-go, when we called in, they were sold out.  Total bummer - but we tried and tried again (amidst may busy signals).  When we got through we ordered two cheesesteaks (Copper Sharp with Fried Onions - one with mushrooms, one without) and one Sixth Man pizza.  It&apos;s a bit pricey, $50.50 for these three items - and cash only, but it was well worth it. 

First of all, the cheesesteaks. Wow.  This is where we are taking our friends from here on out to get cheesesteaks.  We have lived here for just over a decade now and have tried so many different cheesesteaks. None of them compare to this one.  The bread is fantastic - the right amount of chewiness and the seeds are a great added flavor.  The steak is seasoning is perfection and the cooper sharp plays right into it.  It was so good that I joked with my husband the next day that we needed to order it again (and we rarely eat cheesesteaks).  Another key point is, these steaks survived a thirty minute ride home and were still perfection.  

The pizza was also way above average - it had a fantastic crust, the right amount of crunch and softness combined.  The pepperoni crisped up, you know, where the edges roll up slightly and they get perfectly crispy?  Amazing.  The sausage was also delicious.  I cannot say enough good things about the food we ordered.  Best pizza in Philly.  Best cheesesteaks in Philly.  Period. End of Story.

I&apos;m so glad we made a point of making the trek into Philly and calling Angelo&apos;s until we got through.  It was cold out but the wait for our order to pop up was worth standing in the cold.  I&apos;d do it again.  and again.  Cost be damned, this is good stuff."
5,"Unequivocally, and without hesitation, I now believe this is the best pizza in the Philadelphia area. 

It may be up there in the best I&apos;ve ever had conversation with places like Frank Pepe in New Haven. 

It&apos;s the cheese. I&apos;ve never tasted a pizza cheese that seemed more authentic to me. The sauce is present without doing too much to overpower it. The basil adds more complexity. And they&apos;ve achieved perfect crust freshness. 

I gave it a 9.3 on the Barstool Portnoy Scala."
4,"finally got to try Angelo&apos;s! i recently heard that this is the new philly favorite cheesesteak and pizza so i had to test it out for myself

1) UPSIDE DOWN PIZZA (w/ extra cheese) 5/5 - this was delicious. fresh or heated up i really enjoyed this. the dough was somehow still light and fluffy even though it&apos;s a thick pizza. great sauce 

2) CHEESESTEAK 3.75/5 - i messed up, i got extra american instead of getting their cooper sharp which is their staple. mine didn&apos;t have enough cheese to meat ratio but the bread was BOMB. i need to try next time w/ the cooper

3) ITALIAN HOAGIE 5/5 - delicious. AMAZING flavor and great cuts of meat. i really enjoyed this sandwich

all in all, this is a good pizza/sandwich spot. it&apos;s not the most convenient since i had to call at 11am and the line was busy for about 20 minutes. it was ready within 40 minutes, cash only and had to go pick it up with my car since i live in north philly (no delivery) but for those that live near by i&apos;m jealous of you!"
5,"In the pantheon on pizza this place wasn&apos;t really on my radar until Davey, El Presidente, from Barstool sports reviewed it.  Word must have gotten out at this time as this place has exploded with business and reviews.  I&apos;m sure it was excellent before hand but receiving such a high review score made it that much sought after.

Now in regards to orders this place is old school.  Phones only (at least during the pandemic).  Took me 37 phone calls to get through over the course of two days.  By the time I got through I wasn&apos;t even hungry; it was more a matter of principle just to try the place.  Open roads during the quarantine made it to shuffle from the opposite end of the city to pick up the food.  Took about twenty five minutes for my pepperoni pizza and cheesesteak to be ready.

Not sure what rolls they use but they are similar to Johns Roast Pork and Primos in that they are seeded and fairly hearty.  Probably one of the best cheesesteaks I&apos;ve ever eaten for $11.  I got the recommended sharp provolone on it which was melted and liquid like.  Of course can&apos;t forget the fried onions.

Up there with the original Joe Beddia pie, this pizza was quality.  Excellent high quality mozzarella that melted accordingly and create a top layer of savory, salty exterior of the pizza.  The pepperoni added to this umamae flavor.   A couple of basil leaves on top and bingo bango we&apos;re finished."
5,"Pizza is so good, I cracked an egg on the leftovers and ate it for breakfast 3-days later and it was still amazing. 

Tomato Pie w/ Garlic &amp; Basil
6th Man: Half Pepperoni / Half Sweet Peppers

So happy they moved into the city, and they are close to South Philly. They are super friendly. Sauce was fragrant, the whole drive home was a delight. Ratio&apos;s were all on point."
5,"1st - I consider myself a professional pizza taste tester!!

2nd- if you don&apos;t go here then you are selling yourself short. I can&apos;t explain how good the pizza was today. This is hands down the best pizza in Philadelphia. We ordered a pepperoni pizza and a plain pizza and both came out a little well done with extra basil on it.......wow!!!! If heaven is making pizzas then 9th and fitzwater is the spot. Parking is the only bad thing about this place so I  recommend you bring someone with you to get out and get the food while you drive around the block. Enjoy my friends!!!!"
5,"Fire. That&apos;s it. Snag the grandma or OG slice pie. You can&apos;t go wrong with selecting either. Frankly, the sauce, basil, cheese IS FIRE FLAMES. 

Need to be quick with your call. Call before 5:30 to snag a pie or two for 6:30."
