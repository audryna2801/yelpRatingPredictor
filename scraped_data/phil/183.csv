4,"This is one of my favorite brunch spots in the entire city. The big feature is there DIY bloody mary menu. You can select everything, from the liquor to the additives like bacon, vegetables, etc. They also offer bottomless mimosas.

The interior is like a traditional diner but with a new age feel/decor. It feels high-end, but is still very affordable.  

They have a pretty big menu - nice variety. Different variations of eggs &amp; french toast/pancakes.

Would definitely recommend, but you should make sure to make reservations."
4,"If you go here, be sure to make a reservation on Open Table as this spot definitely gets busy; especially for brunch. That aside, my husband and I decided to come here for brunch after seeing so many good reviews and we were NOT disappointed. 

They have indoor and outdoor dining, but we specifically requested outdoor dining because we just feel safer that way. The staff is very professional and provide good service, especially the wait staff. Regardless of whether or not you do indoor dining or outdoor, all guests have to undergo a super quick temperature scan before being seated, which I thought was great. 

And the food itself is really good and reasonably priced. my husband had the chicken and waffles and I had the eggs benedict and a side of pork sausage. There was not a single flaw in any of the dishes. The sausage was juicy, chicken was fabulous, the eggs benedict was solid and even came with tater tots, which was a rare surprise (and they were wonderfully crispy!). 

Would absolutely dine here again."
3,"Jones is a mid century styled upscale diner with all the classic dishes you would expect on the menu - eggs Benedict, steak and eggs, waffles etc for breakfast and fried chicken and waffles, meatloaf, Turkey etc for dinner. Think Bud and Marilyn&apos;s... just a bit less wel executed, and the menu a bit more uninspired. Just about everything we have tried had been tasty and consistent, though I have only been here for brunch. The service can be a touch spotty... I have had the host/ess have a bit of an unpleasant attitude but most of the others usually make up for it. I mentioned the style... with the fireplace and &apos;60s clock, the color scheme and materials, you feel a bit like you are dining in the Brady Bunch living room. 
I like it, overall a solid place to have breakfast. There are better places but not a bad choice by any means."
4,"We always have a good meal here at Jones

I only gave it 4 stars because their booths are very uncomfortable. And it took away from my dining experience. 

The happy hour menu was a pleasant surprise 
For $5 we got a nice bowl of loaded tots 
And I had several of the Blue Hawaiian drinks

The chili was a good surprise. It was thick and full of flavor. Really delicious. 

I thought the Mac n cheese was a cheesy goodness. 

The meatloaf looked good sitting on top of a bed of mashed potatoes. 

The brisket was good. It was better on the sandwich than on the entree. Not really sure why."
5,"I&apos;ve been to Jones a dozen times over the years and this was my first time hanging at their bar for happy hour. It wasn&apos;t bad at all! The bar has limited seating, but the overall decor is beautiful. 
The bartender was pretty chill and made some good drink pairings with food. I decided to have dessert for dinner and ordered a butter pecan spiked milkshake.
Usually I either taste the sweetness of a spiked milkshake or it&apos;s overly spiked and there&apos;s no flavor. 
]Lemme tell you how THIS ONE was perfectly balanced. And it actually tasted as advertised! The best part was the flavor. The butterscotch liqueur, the whip cream, and candied pecans were just fantastic. The only thing I wish was that it was bigger for the price point ($12), but it was served it in mason jar so they get a pass. Drinks taste better in mason jars. Clearly that&apos;s sarcasm or is it?"
5,"Although I have heard good things about this restaurant I hadn&apos;t had the chance to give it a try until 2 months ago.  And since then I&apos;ve been addicted to this restaurant.  I&apos;ve gone each time for brunch and on each occasion I&apos;ve ordered the chicken and waffles.  The chicken is seasoned to perfection and very flavorful and has just the right crisp.  I would often have to ask other restaurants to fry the chicken a bit longer for the right crisp but not Jones!  It&apos;s done right.  The waffles are also flavorful with a bit of a cake like flavor and to u that with the warm syrup and you have perfection.  Although I usually stick to this dish I&apos;ve had tastes of other dishes they offered and my taste bus were delighted again.  The shrimp and grits is also a good option.

Last but not least, the mimosa option makes complete sense if your table orders more than one mimosa.  The special comes with a bottle and juice options to make your own (OJ, passion fruit, and pear I believe).  Definitely worth the money."
5,"We had an amazing first time experience here at 9:00 on a Saturday night! We&apos;ve seen this place a million times but have never given it a try. We were parked near here and had a 30 minute walk to our car from where we were so we checked out the menu and decided to give it a shot. We were not disappointed! 

The atmosphere is warm and inviting. Great ambiance. It was dead outside and when we walked it there was a steady, happy, holiday buzz. We were greeted promptly by the hostess and seated by a fireplace. 

Our waitress was friendly and attentive. The manager did a table check at the end and we gave her great feedback and she told us we made her day. She seemed genuinely interested in our visit and happy to hear the feedback. 

My husband got the fried chicken and waffles. He is very hesitant to order fried chicken at restaurants because so many people mess it up. He usually asks them to cook it extra. He read some yelp reviews and it didn&apos;t seem like he had to say that so he didn&apos;t. He was so impressed that the chicken was cooked perfectly. Crispy and flavorful. He said the waffle was also crispy and delicious and the maple syrup was good. He is a tough critic when it comes to collard greens and he was impressed with those as well! They had turkey versus pork which he appreciated. 

I had the ALT on country bread with chips. It was very delicious! I was so happy that there wasn&apos;t bacon! 

For dessert my husband had the chocolate cake because they were out of the dessert he wanted. I ordered the adult butter pecan milkshake and it was SO GOOD! I don&apos;t even like milkshakes! I&apos;ve actually never had a non-alcoholic milkshake. This was YUMMY. 

The bad news is the bathrooms are tiny one person rooms and the one I went to smelled terrible. Like urine that&apos;s been adding up over years. The manager did say they&apos;ve been there for 17 years. I think maybe it&apos;s because it&apos;s so tiny and at a certain point, urine gets absorbed into tile and you can&apos;t really get rid of the odor. I don&apos;t know. It wasn&apos;t great. Maybe the others didn&apos;t smell like that? 

There were a couple of hiccups but overall our visit was so fabulous that I am still giving five stars. We were so pleased with our dining experience. It was a great dinner  date and we will definitely return. 

I highly recommend trying Jones!!!"
4,"Saturday brunch was so much fun. Imagine three girlfriends catching up and taking FOREVER to look at the menu, yet our waitress was patient beyond belief. Love the vibe of this place. Super chill, good food, and great drinks. The chicken and waffles were a delight. Sometimes waffles can be heavy and weigh on your stomach. Not here!!! Super light, fluffy and paired perfectly with the buttermilk tasting fried chicken. The breast was flaky on the outside, juicy on the inside!!! Shrimp and grits were bomb-dot-com. My girlfriend also thought her steak and eggs were quite tasty. I love that you can order a bottle of champagne and get little juices to make whatever mimosa flavor you&apos;re in the mood for. Can&apos;t wait to go back for more!!"
5,"This is a really nice place for a romantic evening or even a get together with friends. Reservations are recommended, considering the restaurants popularity and prime city location. 

The food was delicious and the portions were huge! My salmon was cooked to perfection and while it was a little on the pricier end, it&apos;s what I expected for the quality. 

The cocktails were fancy and unique and the variety of beverages, milkshakes, and non-alcoholic beverages was quite surprising. 

Overall, excellent service and dining experience! I&apos;ll definitely be coming back to try out some of the other delicious menu items."
4,"Cool brunch spot with retro decor. Was not a long wait to be seated and the server was nice.

Nice to have &quot;seasoned&quot; chicken (wings and a breast) &amp; yummy waffles! Drizzled the syrup on both the chicken and waffle....mmmmm! Nice! Also, had some crispy bacon. 

Really enjoyed my meal and would definitely come back!"
5,"I went to Jones for brunch on Saturday. I didn&apos;t have a reservation, and hostess said it&apos;d be an hour wait but my guest and I could sit at the bar if something opened up. And, in about 20 minutes it did open. We happily sat down and my guest and I were greeted by the bartender, James. He was super friendly, knowledgeable and accommodating. Jones has really cute drinks, my favorite was the Mrs. Jones, I think. We had the shrimp and grits, chicken and waffles and the cheesesteak omelet (we were hungry, judge your mother). Our fav was the shrimp and grits, although the chicken was a very close second. The omelet had great flavor and came with tator tots. If I wasn&apos;t so full, I would&apos;ve had the Butter Pecan adult milkshake for dessert. Lol... my eyes are definitely bigger than my stomach. I&apos;ll definitely be back, definitely sitting at the bar and ready to try happy hour or dinner next."
1,"horrible service.. 

The host is not too found on how to work the front.. More than 10 tables were empty but they somehow were unable to seat us inside.. 

they promised us outdoor seating with Heaters.. No heater available.. Terrible.. Change out the entire staff on the restaurant floor"
4,"I went to Jones for brunch with some friends on a Saturday. We made a reservation and were seated right away. We started with a bottle of champagne for mimosas, I believe it was $22 for the bottle and 3 juice choices (OJ, white peach &amp; passionfruit), not a bad deal! I wasn&apos;t crazy about the peach or passionfruit juice but they came in the cutest little mason jars, 5 stars for presentation! It would have been nice to have an ice bucket for the champagne though. My friend ordered a Bloody Mary which was delicious. They have a checklist you use to order the drink so it&apos;s made exactly to your liking. Next, we ordered the monkey bread to share. Not the best monkey bread I&apos;ve ever had but it was still good. I ordered the grilled cheese and tomato soup for brunch, would definitely order that again. Service was just ok, but we were upstairs in the balcony area so that may have been why."
4,Went to Jones for brunch on a Sunday and we had quite good experience and fun with the menu.  Started off with picking your own style Bloody Mary with any of about 100 different things ranging  from type of liquor to any type of condiments added to your drink.  Was not drinking so they made mind with no alcohol and was perfect.  Brunch menu is fine with settled for the Chicken n Waffles and the Hueves Rancheros which look to good to eat but tasted as good as it looked.  Gotta try this place for dinner next time in the city.
5,"I&apos;ve been here twice now.  The first review is below. After my review below the manager reached out to me and explained that they were off.  The pot pies were off for a bit without anyone noticing. 

So I went back and gave it another chance. This is absolutely crazy how night and day it was.  We started off with the ahi tuna tacos.  They were very good. Really enjoyed. It&apos;s raw tuna, a little spicy but good flavor.

We also had the mac and cheese as an appetizer. I would never oder Mac and Cheese as an appetizer but my wife was interested. Wow. It is great.  Really really great mac and cheese which is unusual.

For dinner, I had the crab cake. No filler, all crab. Great cake. Great fries.  Fries are real thin and crisp up great.

Wife had the Turkey Dinner.  She loved it but I only tried the cranberry sauce and it was great.

Son had the briskey sandwich which he loved.

And they brought a pot pie so we could see what it was supposed to be like.  It was excellent. I love pot pies so it&apos;s my go-to when I see it. THis was one of the best pot pies I&apos;ve had. Went from the worst to the best.

Glad to see they figured it out and fixed everything.  Really pleased they reached out to fix what was a bad experience.

---------------------
We had a gift card for Steven Starr restaurant and this was close to where we were seeing our show.

So the good : son had fried chicken and said it was very good.

The bad : wife had the brisket that was served like a pot roast. It was fancy and you could tell it had been cooked in wine. I liked it from the bite I had but she hated it.

The ugly : I had the turkey pot pie.  It was OK. Not enough sauce. Pastry was overwhelming and not great. More pastry than pie.

Service was good. People were nice. But I won&apos;t be going back"
4,"Jones is a long-running comfort food restaurant in Center City Philadelphia.  It&apos;s décor is &apos;50s American retro stylish (or I think that&apos;s what it is.)  Anyway it looks cool and the fireplaces add to its warmth. The food here is traditional American dishes such as meat loaf and pot pie or a Thanksgiving dinner served every day.  As this is a Stephen Starr restaurant, prices are a bit above what one thinks of paying for these comfort foods but they are prepared well in an engaging atmosphere....and the serving sizes are ample.  Recently I met a friend here for dinner and we had a really good experience.  We started out with an order of zucchini frites which I liked more than my friend did and I wound up taking some home with me to enjoy later.  Our main courses were excellent.  My friend got a roasted salmon platter and I got the huge but tasty turkey pot pie.  The pot pie&apos;s puff pastry crust was flaky and perfectly prepared and the turkey and vegetables in a cream sauce was very warming on a winter&apos;s night.  We had a very personable waitress and left Jones felling well-satisfied."
3,"I was excited to try this place because it&apos;s a Stephen Starr restaurant but I was disappointed. I got the Jones Nachos and the Chicken Ciabatta sandwich and both were average. Service was okay. The interior was really nice, it had a retro diner feel to it. Won&apos;t be going back but am looking forward to trying other Starr restaurants."
5,"What a delight it was eating with the Jones&apos;! 

I met the Executive Chef, Larry, and managers Olivia and Steve! Everyone was so friendly and kind! 

Those SHRIMP AND GRITS ARE AMAZING. Like nothing they&apos;ve had before. Worth re-trying this place if you haven&apos;t in a while!!!"
3,"Came here for brunch on a Sunday morning. Sat at the bar and was impressed watching the bartender do their magic with how busy it was. Decided to get a bottle of champagne as they don&apos;t have a mimosa special. Portion sizes were pretty small for brunch, especially for the price. I&apos;ve been here for happy hour in the past. This place gets busy but I am sad to say that nothing really pops up as standing out or being special other than it being centrally located in the city."
4,"Came to Jones Restaurant for an anniversary celebration for sister in law and brother in law.   Doesn&apos;t hurt that our last name is the same - hence  Jones.    The restaurant has a nice décor with great atmosphere  and ambiance.

We started at the bar and ordered the Hurricane for the guys and some type of Margarita drink for the girls. 

We didn&apos;t have to wait long before our table was ready.  Once we were seated we started off with the &quot;deviled eggs&quot;.    I&apos;m not a fan of the later but had to try them based on the reviews.  They were everything and more.

For entrees we ordered chicken and waffles (2), mac and cheese and crab cakes.  Everything was like comfy food, especially the chicken and the mac n cheese. 

Would I come again, yes, if I&apos;m in the area."
