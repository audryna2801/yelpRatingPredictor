5,"Surprisingly, there aren&apos;t a lot of great delis in Philadelphia... But Famous is probably the most iconic and one of the best. Like any classic deli, their portions can feed a family of four for about three days. I know they have towering sandwiches (get some extra rye bread to make five sandwiches out of one!) and giant bowls of matzah ball soup.

I haven&apos;t been in a while, but a few weekends ago, we ordered some brunch takeout. I got the corned beef hash with a side of home fries. Actually, I got side orders of both (and made my own eggs)... The full order of corned beef hash is probably three times as big, and comes with your choice of eggs and a side. Even though this was the smaller portion, it was outrageous huge and, although I can eat a lot, lasted several meals for me. You can see in the photos how much was left after my breakfast that day.

The food is very high quality and delicious and quite inexpensive for how much you get. We also ordered some mini chocolate chip cookies (which you typically get for free when dining in), which are the best way to end a meal there. Will have to go back in person some time soon when it&apos;s safe to do so!"
5,Haven&apos;t been here since pre-pandemic but this is one of my favorite places when I want a good pastrami sandwich!  Always fresh and always awesome!  Their potato pancakes and fries are so good!  Cookies-yum!  Now I want to go there today!
5,DUDE!!! This has been THE best pastrami on rye since I was able to enter NYC and eat at the 2d Ave Deli. 4th Street Deli is the real deal.  Also had the corned beef sammich.  It too was AWESOME. I can&apos;t wait until the world reopens so I can sit in and dine on the other tasty morsels they offer.
4,"There were not lying when they said large portions! Oh-my-wow! I ordered a sandwich, soup and a slice of cake. The sandwich is the size of my head! It is going to take me days to eat all of this. The cannoli cake - I honestly had to cut it up into chunks and freeze it. It will probably take me a month to eat this entire slice! I honestly think it is overkill. The slices are so big, a single person like me can only take one. What if I wanted to try different slices or other desserts? I am not overly thrilled by the portion sizes here. I could do without the gluton. I&apos;m sure the sizes are their justification for higher prices. They give you so much food that it only makes sense to charge what they charge. 

The quality of the food is great. I have no complaints in that department. I broke my sandwich up in several proportions and ate them open faced to reduce the amount of carbs from the bread. I enjoyed each bite of my broken down meal . I also ordered some smoked whitefish by the lb. and I look forward to enjoying it on pita crackers as a snack."
3,"I knew the sandwiches here were huge but I didn&apos;t realize just how huge until I ordered a chicken salad sandwich with cheese for delivery. It was packed with delicious chicken salad on a thick wheat toast. It was very difficult to eat. I ended up only eating half, with a side of macaroni salad. I only saved the chicken salad on the 2nd half. I ate it the next day, and it was a full sandwich on regular bread. It was better that way. I just could not really enjoy the sandwich when it was so thick with so much bread. In a city like Philly, with so many good sandwiches and hoagies, this will certainly NOT be my go-to sandwich spot.

For dessert I ordered the Devil Dog. Devil Dogs are my favorite childhood dessert so I was curious to try their take on it. Although it&apos;s one devil dog it is huge. I split it into 3 pieces, eating one piece per meal. It was awesome! The cream filling was delectable. It was sandwiched between two tasty chocolate cake toppings. I was in heaven eating it and would order it every single time I ordered from here."
5,"When I entered this restaurant I felt like I was entering the land of the giants. All of the desserts are humongous. 

On the top shelf of the cake display you will see giant six layer cake. You can buy them per slice mostly $9.75.
The cake options among others 
Chocolate peanut butter
Chocolate raspberry 
Funfetti
Chocolate 
Cannoli
German chocolate

On the middle shelf you will see cheesecake: strawberry and chocolate swirl (if I remember correctly)

On the bottom shelf you will see giant eclairs, black and white cookies, streudel. Also containers of Boston cream pies, Lemon meringue (maybe? I saw the meringue topping), and others.

On the left of the cake displays you can find cookies, a lot of varieties of rugelach and hammentaschen. The rugelach and hammentaschen are fresh and the pastries are soft. Good amount of fillings.

One  cake slice is so big that you can feed 4-6 people. The cake is moist and sweet. I got chocolate peanut butter, chocolate raspberry, and German chocolate. All of them have the same chocolate cake but the icing and the fillings between layers makes the difference. 

The coconut macaroon is as big as a soft ball. Further down to the right I saw giant knishes. 

Next time I want to try the sandwich which will be ginormous too."
5,They serve the beer corned beef and pastrami sandwich&apos;s I&apos;ve ever had. The sides are a delight.
5,Always consistent and good.  Great spot when craving big food and desserts.  It was our cheat day and well worth it.
4,"Nine months ago, I gave a negative review of this restaurant because I did not care for their bakery items. The backlash was amazing. I thought my head was going to be ripped off with all the messages I was receiving. So I thought when the time is right, I would go back and actually try the &quot;real&quot; food.

To preface this review, I take this kind of food very, very seriously. This is the food I was raised on, the food I eat on holidays and when I am sick. The food I eat when I crave a sandwich, or something hot. This kind of food is not just nourishment for me, but a reminder of who I am, and where I come from.

After looking over the menu, I decided it was best to get a Matzo ball soup and a regular pastrami sandwich on seedless rye. I was undecided between that or corned beef, but my server was more decisive. She told me to get the pastrami and that was that. Since it comes with a side, I asked for latkes, or potato pancakes (it is Chanukah after all).

With each order comes pickles and some health salad. The pickles work well, briny and not super sour. The health salad is overbrined and has a lot of onion in it. I had to pass.

Then the soup arrived. A big Matzo ball with carrots, bow tie pasta, in chicken broth. I have high expectations for this soup because it sets the table for the rest of the meal. Thankfully, the Matzo ball was perfectly cooked! The soup not too hot or too cold. The vegetables also cooked perfectly. So far, so good.

Not long after I finished the soup, my sandwich arrived. The pastrami is definitely fresh and plentiful. It is lean and tastes great. A little bit salty, but not drowning in it. The bread is perfect. Pillowy and saturates the pastrami into making it special. They also have a mustard which works well too! However, the latkes are overcooked in onion powder, and the side applesauce they give you is too chunky for my liking. Plus you only get to pick that or sour cream, not both. Picking both gets you an up-charge. I think I could have finished the whole sandwich if I really wanted to, but I swallowed my pride and decided to get a bag to take away with me.

After the meal, with your bill you are given a small complimentary chocolate chip cookie. It is good, but you have 24 hours to eat it before it turns into a rock.

For $35, it is expensive, but I got a good meal, and a slight change of heart, for this restaurant."
5,3 words: matzo ball soup. I always love trying matzoh ball soups at different diners across the city and this is my favorite. The ball is humongous and I love the flavors of the soup. So simple yet so good.
5,"O M G the sandwich here was so good!!  Came across this place when i was on the hop on and off bus touring philadelphia.  At one of the stops, this place was nearby list when i was yelping.  Saw the high number of reviews and that this place averaged about 4 stars...so i figured i&apos;d give it a try.  I was a little confused when i first walked in to the restaurant/deli store.  I saw all the meet but no restaurant or places to sit.  One of the staff asked me if I was dining in or taking out.  I told her i was dining in, and she told me to walk down to the end of the deli, and someone would seat me at the restaurant.

Another staff member greeted me at the end of the deli and took me to my seat.  When i sat down, i noticed how much of an old school vibe this place had.  Really cool!  A number of awards hanging on the wall,  and i noticed how bright the place was because of all the open windows there were.  When i looked at the menu, i was a little surprised by how much it cost for a sandwich...but when i received my sandwich...i noticed how much meat they give you!!  it was a shit ton!!!  

I ordered the pastrami sandwich with coleslaw in the sandwich...BOMB!!  the meat was so juicy and moist...melts in your mouth...like butter!! =P 
The combo of the pastrami and coleslaw in a sandwich was perfect!!  The food was so much, i only could eat half the sandwich.  I had to take the rest to go!!  When they bring you your bill, they give you a free cookie!!  that was delicious too!!

Overall the place was awesome!!  the staff was friendly and helpful.  I had questions and they answered them.  If it wasn&apos;t for the prices, i&apos;d be in this store every day of the week while in philly!!!  whenever the next time i&apos;m in philly, i&apos;m definitely coming back to this place."
4,"Really Really good!

Your going to get high quality ingredients here. I can only speak from the breakfast sandwiches and corn beef hash. The bacon quality is amazing and the corn beef hash they use real corn beef.

Basically can&apos;t get any better than that. It&apos;s up there on my list now for breakfast spots in Philly.

Service here was incredibly poor however my waitress was no where to be found after she dropped off our food.  They need to step up there service. But the food is good!"
4,Really good food. Will definitely be back. It&apos;s not Katz deli but it&apos;s the best I&apos;ve had local! Plus they gave us cookies to go
5,"Wow!  Excellent!  Brought us both back to our childhood holiday dinners, aka our grand mother&apos;s cooking, as well as to our earliest memories of great Jewish delis.

Believe it or not, great traditional food can can trigger all those fond memories. This deli is a treasure trove of those food memories and experience.  Haven&apos;t had matzoh ball or kreplach soup like theirs since my single digit age and I&apos;m in my 50s now.

The tongue in sweet sauce was outrageous.  First bite and I had to stop to savior the memories.
The noodle kuggel was excellent, and perfect in the sense of not burning the top.  

Their fresh rte bread is to die for.

We even brought home slices sable and bialys for breakfast.  Fabulous at to start a lazy day Sunday.
So grateful to find real Jewish food nearby our new away from NYC home."
3,"Would give 3.5 stars if I could. Odd experience at 4th st. Deli today. 

Pros:  the best pastrami and corned beef I&apos;ve ever had. Seriously - so tender and flavorful. 
You get what you pay for - lots of food
Generous servings of pickles and slaw to start
Old school dining room gives you an authentic jewish deli experience 

Cons:  although the portions are huge, it&apos;s expensive ($25 for a sandwich)
The sandwiches are so large, they are impossible to eat gracefully - it&apos;s unruly
The wait staff is extremely rough, some downright rude

The long and the short of it is while this is the best meat I&apos;ve ever had, I prefer SCHLESINGER&apos;S as an overall experience."
5,"It doesn&apos;t get any better than this, packed like very happy sardines in a bustling urban deli about to confront a two foot stack of warm, lean pastrami, creamy slaw and a chaser of Dr. Browns black cherry. 

Nothing here is going to calm your cardiologist but once in while some actual deli is the only meal that works. These random moments of sublime happiness make life worth savoring. When things calm down, just go."
4,Ordered delivery through Caviar. Was very pleased with my order and will order again. I had the smoked turkey on white and it&apos;s was delicious! The portion size was huge! Easily a pound of meat. I saved some for later lol. The turkey was so fresh and well seasoned. Also ordered a cheesesteak and it was surprisingly good. The chicken soup and potato pancakes were wonderful too.
5,"It&apos;s CHCKN SP SZN until the weather breaks so naturally I had to stop here the other night for a fixin&apos;.

Walked in to order takeout and waited about 15 minutes for the food, which wasn&apos;t bad, but I&apos;d definitely call ahead.  Not a great place to wait as I stood awkwardly by the fountain soda machines, however, it&apos;s worth noting this place is impeccably clean for being all white everything.  Very old timey and charming.  Really takes you back to another place and time.  Front desk cashier who took my order was very friendly and it took everything in my power to not buy the array of fresh desserts, meats, etc. in the glass cases.  Their black and white cookies are MASSIVE - I kid you not, they&apos;re the size of a small dinner plate.

Ordered: one large &quot;famous&quot; chicken noodle soup that feeds 2 (complete with matzah and whole bunch of other good good), 5 potato pancakes with apple sauce and sour cream, 4 of their &quot;famous&quot; cookies to go (1 oatmeal raisin, 1 sugar/sprinkles, 1 plain ch. chip, 1 ch. chip with walnut), and 2 cans soda.  I think the total came to about $38, which is kinda steep but well worth the price tag.

First and foremost, I gotta make a shout-out to those fantastic meat dumplings that were in the soup.  They stole the show!  I want just those, steaming on a platter.  Congrats and thanks to the whole team.

The soup as a whole was also great: flavorful, not dry chicken, hearty broth, onions, some rice/wheat jawn.  I could&apos;ve used a little more carrots. But this, along with that plump side of matzah ball, was everything I needed and more this cold and flu season.

The potato pancakes were SO good: crispy and oily and salty and wonderful dipped in that sour cream and that tasty homemade apple sauce.  I wish I got the order of 10.

Tried to save half the cookies for the next day but we ended up eating all 4.  I was surprised they gave them to me warm out of the oven, so bonus points there.  They were nice and plump and SO good but my favorite was that oatmeal raisin.  The sugar was cloyingly sweet but I&apos;m a sucker for rainbow sprinkles.

Despite living here for 13 years, I had only ever eaten breakfast here in 2007 and I was too hungover to enjoy it.  Overall,  well worth the visit and one of the few &quot;tourist traps&quot; that&apos;s not actually a trap."
5,"An excellent, authentic kosher deli, in the heart of Philadelphia! 

Founded in 1923, this place exemplifies what&apos;s great about a Jewish deli.   It&apos;s a corner store, many tables, spaced close together, all in bright white.  Nostalgic pictures and old mechanical cash registers attest to the longevity of the establishment.  And busy - the hustle and bustle of the staff and patrons in line for tables and take out add to the vibe. 

Upon seating and drink orders taken, bowls of pickles and slaw are served.   One bowl of kosher dill, the other half sour (my favorite).  The slaw iuis sweet pickled.  Authentic and delicious - both. 

Food is excellent!  The corned beef is served on rye (of course) - piled too high to each as a sandwich.  Paired with deli mustard, this is the must-have.  The meat is lean, a little more thinly sliced than you would find in Katz&apos;s in NY, but still perfectly tender, moist, salty and delicious.  A minor ding is that this isn&apos;t NY rye - it&apos;s a little thicker and mushier, but still great. 

The corned beef reuben is of similar size, but topped with melted cheese, saurkraut, cole slaw and russian dressing on toasted rye.  Same piled-high sandwich, gotta tackle it with a fork.   

Others at the table tried a bagel with lox, a tuna salad sandwich and a potato knish.   All of the sandwiches are silly thick, all of the ingredients fresh.   The knish is plate-sized with a flaky shell stuffed with creamy, garlicky mashed potatoes. 

Wash the whole thing down with Dr. Brown&apos;s Cream Soda and you have yourself a legitimate Jewish deli meal.   It ain&apos;t cheap ($19 for the sandwich, even though it&apos;s big enough to split).  Still - for the experience and the quality of the food - worth it.   Recommended!"
4,My first time here and the two cookies I had (chocolate &amp; peanut butter) were amazing. They have a good selection of dessert &amp; deli options. They don&apos;t skimp on the size of the cookies and cakes.  You have to wear a mask to enter &amp; while ordering. Place was clean and not crowded. There are stickers on the floor telling you to keep your distance.
