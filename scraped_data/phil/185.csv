5,"First time at bubble fish 
My wife and I like it a lot 
The server is very nice definitely recommended"
4,"Whenever I am craving for sushi and near Chinatown, this restaurant is my go to spot. 

I definitely recommend the Salmon burger and the Marilyn Monroll if you want to try something different and be WOW. I love the Marilyn Monroll as it always come out so tasty and delicious. The salmon burger is also really good, but I would recommend to share it if you have a small stomach like mine. The sashimi here are okay, not the best but they are decent. 

The drink menu looks so tempting with so many options, and I loved my guava green tea here. 

I have visited this place for a couple times, and the food is always consistently good. The server is also nice. Definitely worth to try if you want sushi and happen to be in Chinatown."
4,"Got: Cold grass jelly with 3 toppings 
Price: $6 or $7 for the jelly, $6 for the eel roll, standard
Value: Average value for trendy sushi place

I missed my Megabus on my way to NY.  It was pouring and my friend and I needed shelter from the rain.  Soo we stumbled into this place expecting to sit down, order something real quick just so we could make use of the roof over our heads, and use the restroom.  

The service was quick and attentive.  Not overly crowded (2:30pm Saturday).  Nice ambiance and decoration.  Can definitely see this place as a date spot.

The eel roll came out quickly and was pretty standard rolls. 8 pieces for about $7.  Not complaining, pretty good.  The grass jelly took a little longer but came out in a heaping bowl and my choice of 3 toppings (included): boba, taro, and aloe jelly. They didn&apos;t give condensed milk which was totally fine bc I would&apos;ve skipped on it anyways. Overall, nicely decorated &quot;date quality&quot; sushi place that has boba, ramen, desserts, and other Asian goodies."
4,"Came here because I was craving Sushi for a while. What is the next best thing instead of sushi? Poke bowls! 
Because of Covid, I ordered it to go with a few of my friends. I ordered in person and it took about 15-20 mins to prepare.
I tipped generously considering the times and went to eat my food. 

I got a salmon poke bowl, very delicious and filling. They gave 2 types of sauce. One was soy sauce and the other was a sauce I never seen. It was like pale vanilla colored sauce, which was decent. 

Everything is in the picture that I couldn&apos;t really describe but there was a lot of rice underneath everything. The avocado was enough to last me till the end and there was a generous amount of salmon. 

Overall, satisfying and refreshing. Definitely hit the spot for my cravings!"
4,"Solid sushi for a decent price. I tried the dynamite, bubblefish, and mango shrimp rolls and they are were all pretty good. Their mangos are a bit on the tart side, which I did not expect. My personal favorite was the dynamite. It had a good crunch and creaminess to it. I also liked how they packaged and labeled their sauces on the side when I ordered my food for takeout."
3,"Tried BubbleFish for the first time the other night and was disappointed. I had the Seafood Poke while my husband had the Unagi Don. 

From the appearance of it, the Seafood Poke looked amazing. It had a whole lot of tuna, salmon, shrimp, crab, egg, avocado and fried onions. The portions of the Unagi Don looked kind of small.

As we dug into our food, I realized that the rice in the Seafood Poke had a little too much vinegar in it. Overtime, the sourness of the rice and the marinade from the salmon and tuna melded together into a flavor of its own. I was expecting a refreshing bowl of poke, but I got this and it was just not good. Also the wasabi that they provided looked off and watery, so I ended up using the wasabi we have in our own fridge. 

My husband thought his Unagi Don was ok, but he was still hungry after eating dinner."
4,"02/22/2020

I came back here for dinner before a concert. I ordered the Sushi and Sashimi Platter for One. The platter was good, but just as I stated before, they put too much rice in their sushi rolls. As well, the service was a bit slow this time around. Other than, it&apos;s still a good place for your sushi fix and I would recommend here."
5,"We came here to eat after checking out the 2020 flower show and don&apos;t regret it at all. We normally pass by the restaurant but after tonight&apos;s visit we will be coming back.

The decor was chic and clean. I enjoyed the style of the restaurant. All the servers were well versed in the menu, polite, and efficient. Everyone is well trained in their job. The sea foam froth green tea drink was made super fast and was super! You can taste the tea so strongly, I love it so much. 

We had two beef skewers for an appetizer, but it was too chewy so next time we&apos;ll try the chicken skewers.

The Sashimi Heaven was SO worth the money. For $24 I received a literal boat of sashimi that came in 3 pieces per fish. The taste was phenomenal as well! Totally insta worthy and definitely highly recommended for any sashimi lover.

The beef curry came with stir fry veggies that ended up being my favorite part of the meal. What a surprise! I really don&apos;t enjoy how chewy the beef, so if you&apos;re ordering this get the shrimp!"
5,"I&apos;ve been getting delivery from Bubblefish for a while now but finally made it in to the restaurant! It&apos;s a beautifully decorated restaurant and very clean. The service initially was slow and it took a while to get water.  However, I think there was a miscommunication with the waiters and once figured out, it was great service.

We started with the takoyaki which is much better in the restaurant vs. delivery. We also had edamame which was slightly undercooked and had a little too much salt.

The star of our meal was the sushi rolls. We tried their signature rolls which were HUGE. Definitely pricy, but it was difficult to finish because of how much they give you. We ordered the Bubblefish Roll, Angry Dragon Roll, Marilyn Monroll and Mars Roll. The Marilyn Monroll and Mars Roll were my favorites! The Mars Roll is so pretty and has gold flakes on it! All of the sushi was incredibly fresh. 

If I&apos;m in the area and craving sushi I would definitely go here but their delivery is so convenient!"
5,"I may have just found my new favorite sushi spot (and favorite spot in general)!! They have an extensive drinks menu and sushi menu but also so so much more. Here&apos;s the breakdown of the belly-busting dinner my partner and I devoured: 

ALMOND SESAME MILK TEA: The sweet scent of almond and nutty taste of sesame swept me up to the milk tea heavens. 

TAIWANESE FRIED CHICKEN: Fried perfectly to create Taiwan&apos;s iconic crispy yet light batter. The drunk food you didn&apos;t know you needed. 

BEEF/LAMB SKEWERS: Pure meaty goodness with a spicy kick at the end. 

TAKOYAKI: The thin crispy outside perfectly contained the creamy, fishy batter. Bonus points for the bonito flakes dancing on top. 

EEL &amp; AVO ONIGIRI: Seaweed was a bit stale and tough to eat, but overall pretty good.

NINJA OYSTER ROLL: Whatever mad scientist came up with this monster combination was onto something. 

MARILYN MONROLL: The torched tuna had a unique smokey flavor, definitely a new experience for sushi. Bonus points for puns."
4,"My friend and I were craving sushi and this was my first time at Bubblefish. We ordered the Marilyn Monroll, Eel Avocado &amp; Chicken Tempura Onigiri, and Takoyaki. I absolutely loved all the food but the Takoyaki was hands down the most delicious! 

They&apos;re also open for indoor dining now which is an added plus!"
4,"The place&apos;s food is delicious and consistent. The place is beautiful, and the staff are friendly. However, the food is kind of expensive, but I would still recommend for a quick lunch."
5,"I LOVE SUSHI. MY DREAM = EAT SUSHI EVERYDAY. This place made me love sushi even more! I am very suspicious of sushi places in Philly, since I&apos;m from LA and my mom made me very good homemade sushi. But I am impressed. This is my go-to sushi place in the city, it is best tasting and price worthy! 

I can&apos;t really review any other dishes since I&apos;ve only tried their sushi and sashimi.. but sushi and sashimi are hands down the best in the city!"
1,"Pretty disappointing considering all the positive reviews.  We ordered unagi don, Marilyn mom roll, salmon avacado roll and Chicken skewers.

The only edible dish was the Marilyn mom roll which I would give 3.5 stars.

The salmon roll was more fat than fish.
The unagi was also a bad cut and my wife had to throw away most of the eel.
The chicken skewers were really spicy and my kids couldn&apos;t eat them."
4,"Bubblefish is a great restaurant that offers quite a bit of everything: if you want sushi rolls, sashimi, donburi bowls, misc. hot appetizers and dishes, or even ramen, this is the place to go. Their special drinks menu is super extensive - they have all kinds of speciality drinks that range from boba tea, regular tea, yogurt drinks, milkshakes, jelly drinks, and more. They were unfortunately out of the lavender milk oolong which I initially tried to order, and I feel like this is probably a popular drink choice. When I was here, I got The Force Awakens coffee milkshake with chocolate which was very good (actually not very sweet which was perfect), two onigiri (sweet potato and eel) two rolls (the TGIFresh Roll and Out of Control Roll), fried oysters, Taiwanese Beef Stew Noodles, and the lunchbox deal with teriyaki lamb. It was way too much food but my partner and I definitely could at least have leftovers to last us for a whole other dinner! My partner ordered the fermented rice oolong boba, and it&apos;s got that shot of liquor kind of taste to it from the fermented rice, so really make sure to mix it in well and sip it along with the rest of the tea (we accidentally  sipped initially from the rice settled at the bottom, oops!)

Everything was really good: starting with the rolls, they were average priced but definitely huge and really delicious. We honestly filled up just on that. The onigiri were great, and Bubblefish actually had a nice variety and some of the biggest and tastiest ones I&apos;ve had in Chinatown.  The Taiwanese beef noodles were something new that I really enjoyed, and the beef was cooked and marinated really well. The lunchbox was slightly disappointing - we only got 4 tiny pieces of lamb with our box, and I didn&apos;t see how this was worth the money at all. It was well cooked but definitely tiny portion-wise. We did enjoy the tempura it came with though, and the California rolls in it were fine but nothing special. The fried oysters were fried to perfection and were really interesting (think takoyaki, but oysters instead of octopus pieces). Overall it was a good experience, and a solid place to bring others when you don&apos;t know what you want to eat and want a ton of options at good quality. It did end up being pricey, and that definitely could be because we just ordered so much food, but I think comparatively speaking you could take half of what we spent and spend it elsewhere for the same amount of food in other Chinatown restaurants. It felt a little pricier than average. The ambiance is cute in the front part of the restaurant, but we were seated in the back in a more secluded, dark part with not a whole lot going for it. Service was great, and we&apos;re thankful for the waiters who were extremely patient with us just truly not knowing what we wanted."
5,"Delicious sushi at a very affordable price point. Both the Monster Roll and the Mars Roll were very good! 

My only critique was service was a little bit slow on the busy Friday night I was there. Other than that, it was a tasty experience."
4,"We tried the sushi burger, maki combo and the chicken skewers at this place. The sushi burger was very unique and we really enjoyed it. The skewers were tasteless, didn&apos;t like it. The spicy maki combo was good. The service was great! Will be back to try more dishes."
4,"Came here on a Wednesday evening because my boyfriend heard about their sushi burger. I previously read that it gets messy and ends up like a poké bowl... IT&apos;S TRUE. I ordered the salmon sushi burger and there&apos;s no way you could eat it like a real burger. I was quite disappointed in it simply because I barely tasted salmon. I tasted more onions. Definitely not worth the $15.

We also tried one roll - their signature Bubblefish roll. It was tasty, however, once again, the sauce they used overpowered the taste of the sushi. My boyfriend also ordered the shoyu ramen for $10. He said it is worth the money if you were to compare the price of ramen elsewhere. But let&apos;s be real, I wouldn&apos;t go here if I was craving ramen.

Ended up going to Bubblefish again a week later because my friend wanted to try it after seeing pics of my salmon burger. We all just ended up ordering sushi rolls. I felt this time around, the sushi tasted SO much better. My boyfriend ordered sushi heaven and said everything tasted fresh. My friend enjoyed her rolls as well. I haven&apos;t tried their bubble tea though.. just not open to trying it when I know there are other bubble tea places nearby.

The service was quick, but can be a little intrusive. Perhaps they were over staffed that time, but they kept asking if we were done when there was still food clearly visible. The ambiance is great. The chairs are comfortable. (Avoid the booths up front if you&apos;re wearing shorts. The seats are peeling and definitely need to be replaced.) They give lemon water, however if you want plain water, that is available too.

Based on both experiences, I would give this place a 3.5 (being generous with giving 4 stars rather than 3). Not my first choice for sushi, but would come again."
1,"Ordered four different favors of origiri for delivery. When I got it I was shocked by the fact that they boxed everything together. How am I supposed to know which is which? This is so stupid I have to cut all of it to see what is in the middle so I know which are mine and which are my co-worker. I usually got my origiri from other place and it come with their own package and have the name on it. If they don&apos;t have this kind of package at least they so have separately box each of them and write what is the favor on the box. 

打包的人是个傻比"
4,"Would give this 4.5/5 if I could

Had this 5-6 times over the course of the past two years. Really loved the food but especially liked the giant boba. Very cute place to dine in at!"
