5,"This place has been on my list for some time and I was delighted to land a table during the first week of their reopening.  The restaurant itself is very chic and stylish, with lovely strings of lights over the bar/counter where we were seated. I appreciated that during COVID, they did a great job spacing parties apart and sticking to the 25% indoor capacity guideline. 

As for the food, they currently have a 6 course prefixed menu ($125) with an optional wine pairing. For the drinks, we opted for the cocktail route and I especially enjoyed the &quot;sweater weather&quot; - a sweet gin based drink. As for the food, the menu is seafood-forward with appropriately sized portions that will leave you full but not stuffed. Every dish was beautifully presented as well. To start the meal, we were presented with an amuse-bouche which was a sea buckthorne inspired jelly bite that was bursting with tart flavors. Of the other courses, one of my favorites was the sake cured madai fish with asian pear. I could tell that the madai (a type of Japanese snapper) was fresh and the pairing with the pear and pomegranate seeds made for a memorable bite. Another lovely dish was the L&apos;aparge egg with caviar. The caviar itself sits inside a ceramic egg filled with whipped mouse and is well-suited for dipping with the toasted brioche sticks. Finally, one of the other standouts was the scallop dish which had perfectly seared scallops lying on a bed of creamy cauliflower and truffle sauce. 

Lastly, I appreciated the pace of the meal which was timely and kept us moving through the experience but didn&apos;t feel rushed. Our waitress was attentive and kept our glasses filled throughout the meal. I also appreciated that each dish was presented by one of the sous chefs and they took the time to answer our questions and explain the plates.

Overall, a lovely experience from beginning to end and absolutely met my expectations. It carries a high price tag for a Philly restaurant, but I think it&apos;s worth the splurge. I would highly recommend for a romantic date night or a celebratory occasion."
5,"We visited Laurel to celebrate my 40th birthday and it was a lovely experience. The innovation and thought behind the menu were evident in everything from presentation to passion of the staff that served it. 

They have done a good job at adjusting to COVID and we were seated outside, but in a sweet tent with nice comfortable chairs and cute decorations. 

My only area of opportunity for Laurel was my cocktail. There wasn&apos;t anything off putting about it, but I also switched to wine after only 1 drink. 

All in all we had a fantastic experience. It&apos;s a great place to celebrate something wonderful!"
5,"While I&apos;ve never been to a Michelin Star restaurant, I&apos;d imagine it to be just like Laurel. The wait staff, the chefs, and the presentation of the meals were absolutely exquisite. I imagine fine dining to be just like this.

This month was a prefixed menu with an optional wine pairing. My sister and I went with the 6 course option. And wow, the flavors of each dish and presentation was absolutely phenomenal. My favorite dishes were the toast with caviar and egg mouse, the calamari with cauliflower pur√©e and truffle, and the sake cured madai.  

Each dish was so unique and so different that it is truly difficult to explain. If you&apos;re feeling up to experience fine dining, definitely consider Laurel -- you won&apos;t be disappointed. The staff was amazing and even brought out a little birthday treat to celebrate! Thanks for such a great experience Laurel!! We will be back for m"
3,"Laurel was one of my favorite restaurants pre-covid, and I was ecstatic to revisit one of my favorite spots in Philly. However, the toils of covid and the stressors on the staff has made this dining experience sub-optimal. In terms of food, I still thought Laurel ranks one of the best in CC, but the service was off throughout the entire night. We had wanted to experience the 9-course dining experience, which we had called ahead to confirm, only to find that this option was not available on arrival. None of the dishes that were brought to us were curated or explained, and the overall interaction felt curt and rushed. The wine pairing, while very expensive, are well worth it and bring out the most out of each dish. 

At the end of the day, we definitely spent quite a bit for an excellent tasting experience, but would have liked the service to mirror the quality of the dishes themselves."
5,"We finally were able to experience Laurel and all I can say is Wow! 

I made a Reservation far in advance on OT for the 5:30 seating on Valentines Day for their 7-8 course chef tasting. Our reservation was suddenly cancelled on us a few days prior to Valentines Day. I called and spoke with reservationist Sarah and she was very courteous. There was a mix up and it was immediately remedied. 

Laurel is BYOB so we brought a nice bottle of Silver Oak we were saving for a special occasion. We were immediately seated our wine opened and poured. 

There are several staff members taking care of you all of whom were polite and knowledgeable.

We opted for the 8th course add-on because it was a ricotta gnocchi with shaved black truffle. If you know me enough said...I have no willpower when it comes to truffle.

Each dish was beautifully executed and displayed. Like edible art. 

Highlights were ~ 
1. Poached oysters, Sweet Cream ice cream, Thai basil, chamomile. The sweet &amp; salty was a gorgeous combo
2. Bowfin Cavier, whipped vodka cream, served with Acorn Blinis ~ again the sweet and salty perfect balance 
3. A5 Wagyu Beef, Local Radicchio, Caramelized Parsnip, Sour Cherry ~ the Wagyu melted in my mouth

Our Reservationist Sarah gave us a complimentary glass of champagne and we walked out with a gourmet box of gorgeous chocolates. Just top notch from beginning to end!"
4,"So I&apos;ve been wanting to try the tasting menu for here. We usually go to Italian restaurants for Valentines but wanted to do something different. I made the reservation way ahead of time like Dec 23rd and booked a 5:30 reservation for here. We usually like to eat a little later like around 7-7:30 but had to take what we could get. We decided to take off of work on Valentine&apos;s Day so we could be well rested and come here hungry enough. 

I get a phone call in the middle of January from laurel of them wanting to confirm for Valentine&apos;s Day and saying they had important info to go over. So it turns out the tasting menu which said $85 per person online is now $150 per person because it&apos;s Valentine&apos;s Day and they have a special menu. A little more than I wanted to spend, that&apos;s almost double the price but ok I guess...we already took off work and by that point other  places were already getting booked up. Ugh... I wish they had that in writing on their website before I booked it. 

Another thing that irritated me was their cancellation policy was a little confusing. On the opentable confirmation page it says you have 24 hours to cancel or else you will be charged the full cost of their tasting menu per person. But then the next section right under it it also says you have 2 days to cancel or you risk paying a $50 penalty fee for cancellation. So which one is it 24 hours or 48 hours? I understand that they want to get your credit card number ahead of time in order to protect themselves from no shows but they should at least make the policy clear not contradicting. Maybe the 48 hours was just for Valentine&apos;s Day, I dunno. I was having stomach pains the day beforehand and was considering trying to cancel but I didn&apos;t want to risk being charged any fee so we just went. 

Ok now on to the food. Sorry got sidetracked. So the food was very good. All the dishes were beautifully presented and had a lot of flavors going on with each dish. We really enjoyed every dish and the experience. My favorite was the gnocchi with shaved black truffle, but we had to pay $65 extra for this dish. It looked like marshmallows it was so light and fluffy. The first dish with the oyster, frozen sweet cream, Thai basil and chamomile was very delicious too. It looked like dippin dots ice cream on it, very different. Definitely liked all the different textures and flavors in each dish. All the drinks we ordered were very well made as well. The bowfin caviar was smaller and more salty than I expected. I had osetra caviar before that was bigger and had better flavor that wasn&apos;t as salty. 

My only complaint is I think the gnocchi should have been already included since we were paying more than the regular tasting price anyway. The A5 wagyu was very tender and melt in your mouth delicious, but it was so small and my husband and I just ate that last week anyway. I probably would have rather preferred the duck or venison or whatever was on the regular priced tasting menu on a regular day to get a bigger portion but they only had the set menu and  price for Valentines Day. 

It&apos;s probably best to come on a regular night that&apos;s not Valentines Day or another holiday. It&apos;s super expensive and good for maybe a special occasion. Even with the gnocchi addition it was barely enough food for me. Portions are VERY small. A couple of hours later I felt sorta hungry and got some snacks. I feel like that is unacceptable when you&apos;re paying this much for food. And we&apos;ve been to other restaurants that do tasting menus like this  but they&apos;re never this small. I think at least the main dishes should be a little bit bigger they shouldn&apos;t be as small as the starter dishes. Glad we tried out Laurel and we had a nice time with great  food, but this place is a one and done for us. I think a lot of places try to capitalize on Valentine&apos;s Day and overcharge everything, so next year we might stay home or we&apos;ll go somewhere that doesn&apos;t do tasting menus."
3,"I had high expectations for Laurel because my friend had talked this place up and took me here, but I was disappointed in the restaurant&apos;s execution given the price point. The food and ingredients seemed high end and some of the courses were really good (e.g. the poached oyster, oxtail/scallop, and yuzu dessert courses) and nothing tasted bad. Unfortunately, I noticed such a lack of attention to detail and lack of consistency and quality control in the plating and service, it ruined the dining experience for me.

Here are some of the things that just seemed off for me for a &quot;fancy&quot; restaurant:

--The decor was bare minimal. I appreciated the small tulip arrangement on the table but there wasn&apos;t much else.
--The wait staff dressed way too casual and they didn&apos;t have any kind of uniform. Everyone barely made eye contact and 2 out of the 3 waitstaff I saw didn&apos;t seem enthusiastic/didn&apos;t smile. I just didn&apos;t feel the wait staff was professional or attentive enough compared to what I would expect from a place like this.
--The presentation of the food, proportions of the ingredients, and portion size were inconsistent between platings. For example the waitress came out and poured dashi onto our kanpachi fish course and she gave my friend 2/3 of the dashi and 1/3 to me. For the duck course I got 3 currants on my plate, my friend got 2. Seems like I&apos;m making a big deal here but given it&apos;s a special ingredient and the small portion size, yes it matters. The meringue in my dessert was toasted way more than the ones on my friend&apos;s plate which changed the taste.
--For the caviar course, the amount of ingredients was also inconsistent. I got a good 1/2 teaspoon more of caviar and cream and my friend got more vodka in her cream. My friend didn&apos;t like hers because having more vodka in hers made it too bitter and disrupted the balance. She gave the rest to me. I don&apos;t like to waste expensive food so I took it but to my dismay, I ended up putting in my mouth a good 1 inch piece of floss/dish scrubber wire/twisty tie (I honestly don&apos;t know what it is) in a spoonful of cream thinking it was a miscellaneous herb sprig. It didn&apos;t help that I found Dungeness crab shell in the following course either. Having just complained about the mystery wire in the caviar course, I didn&apos;t call out the crab shell but spat it out on a piece of napkin and left it next to the empty plate. The waitress didn&apos;t bother clearing the soiled napkin with a foreign object on it or ask if she can trash it and just left it when she cleared the plates. I&apos;m surprised she didn&apos;t notice.

We did get comped (one person&apos;s whole meal) for the foreign object in our food but I wish it didn&apos;t happen at all because it ruined my appetite for the rest of the meal. It didn&apos;t seem like an shocking occurrence though given the rest of the QC issues.

Just for comparison&apos;s sake, two days after this visit, I went to a 2 Michelin star restaurant in NYC called the Modern (locates in the MoMa) that served a very similar French style tasting menu. It was only 6 courses instead of 9 but the portion sizes were slightly larger compared to Laurel so I would say the quantity of food was comparable. I immediately noticed the difference in service and quality control between the Modern and Laurel:

--The decor and lighting were superb and made it super pleasant and relaxing to dine there
--The waitstaff were all wearing suits and looked immaculate and professional
--I saw waitstaff ironing the table cloth, checking for exact placement of the plates, silverware, and checking the water glasses for stains.
--Each plate of food came out as identical as possible. In one dish, they even had an endive leaf in a salad curled and cut the exact same way on all 3 plates and it was placed at the same location. When serving the food, the waiters made sure to rotate the plate in the exact same orientation for everyone at the table. The cinnamon was dusted in a perfect circle. There was just not that kind of attention to detail made at Laurel.

Sure, there is no Michelin star restaurant in Philly but for a four dollar sign place on Yelp and the kitchen preparing similar types of food, Laurel has room to improve. 

The cost difference was $178 per person at The Modern vs $135 at Laurel, but the Modern is a no tipping restaurant so the price difference would have been only been around $25 more (before tax and a trip to New York) for a way better dining experience. To me, if I felt like splurging on this kind of fancy snooty food (probably even for a special occasion or just as a foodie looking for the latest adventure), I think a trek to Manhattan and paying a bit more to ensure my special occasion/date/experience goes well without a hitch is worth it. If anything, maybe I would just avoid disappointment by not spending this kind of money at Laurel in the first place."
5,"**This is a delayed post. 

Came here for the hubster&apos;s birthday celebration. We had the tasting menu which did not disappoint. 
The restaurant is very small and can accommodate only about 15 maybe 20. We had reservations at 7pm. We arrived on time and were seated promptly. Since it was BYOB, we brought two bottles of our favorite reds. The staff happily opened it for us. 

From the amuse bouche to the tasting menu courses thru dessert, the attention to detail and presentation was very precise. 

They used a lot of local seasonal ingredients and highlighted what was fresh for the season. Sauces were kept simple with focus on the meat and fish being served. 

The dessert and petit fours were great! 

Service was friendly knowledgable and accommodating. I would def love to return to try this place each time their menu changes!"
5,"What an experience -- and I was skeptical. Chef Nic has really put together an experience for the senses. Flavor, texture, temperature and beautiful food that is enjoyed on all levels. I&apos;m new to Philadelphia and Laurel was in our top 5 of places to try during our first month. 
I know that we&apos;ll be back many times to enjoy this place.  This is a level of technique and expertise in cooking that doesn&apos;t come along often. 
This is my new &quot;WOW&quot; spot !"
5,Absolutely delicious! Each course was individual yet came together for a cohesive meal. I would definitely come here again. The amuse bouche of foie gras started the meal out in such a high note and no course disappointed. The drinks were all very tasty. The wait staff was very knowledgeable and provided excellent service. A great meal by Nicholas and his staff!
5,"Laurel is in the running for the best meal I&apos;ve ever had. Yes, the hype exists. And you better take it at face value because our meal here was truly special. I&apos;m having a hard time finding the words because there was an experiential bliss that permeated every cell of our bodies at a certain point, and it&apos;s hard to accurately communicate how that felt. The service was lovely, the wine pairings were thoughtful and delicious, and the food was all that we had hoped for--and so much more. The creativity and expertise demonstrated here, start to finish, was so damn impressive. The variety, the technique, the execution...and all of the other words people use to describe a chef&apos;s vision/product. I&apos;ll throw in a few more because hyperbole is fun: Acumen. Precision. Mastery. I&apos;ll put the dictionary down now and get to the good stuff.

I live in NYC so I rarely get to come down to Philly. But when I do, I try to make it to at least one top restaurant. This city is teeming with great spots, so there&apos;s no shortage of options. The bf and I went to ITV in November 2016 and had a fantastic meal, so I was nearly paralyzed with anticipation when I found out my parents secured a reservation at Laurel. One of our close family friends is also a good friend of Nick Elmi, the Top Chef-winning ringleader of this whole affair, so she&apos;s been singing the praises of his spots even before they opened. She might be biased--and most biased people oversell--but she did not. I don&apos;t think she could have possibly done so.

For one of the best restaurants in Philly, Laurel is quite down-to-earth. I didn&apos;t find anything about this experience pretentious. The service was prompt but not brusque in the slightest and we felt taken care of the whole evening. For such a small place, they have an impressive number of people working here. Our main waiter was delightful and was able to field my overly-excited barrage of questions with poise and humor. 

Drink-wise, I&apos;d suggest the wine pairing if that&apos;s something you&apos;re into. It amounts to about three/3.5 glasses, which are spread out over the course of the tasting experience. We all felt it was just the right amount of alcohol. It enhanced the experience rather than clouded it. Nice variety of wines--highlights for me were the sparkling Riesling which kicked off the meal, the Syrah and our dessert Chenin Blanc. 

For the food, I&apos;ve sang the praises of this menu enough. I think you get the point. I won&apos;t do a deep-dive into every dish, though I&apos;ll shout out my highlights. The three of us were all pretty much collapsing after everything, so there really weren&apos;t any duds. A true display of excellence here. See below:

Winter 2018 Tasting Menu:
Collard Greens, Apple, Horseradish (Amuse): A+ 
Kombu-Brined Cabia, Calamansi Broth, Buddha Hand Caviar, Dill: A+
Santa Barbara Sea Urchin, Truffle Vinagrette, Grapefruit: A++
Frozen Foie Gras Tarte, Elderberry Vinegar, Hibiscus: A++
Marlin, Octopus Bolognese, Persimmon, Jalape√±o: A++
Slow-Roasted Stone Bass, Plum, Pear Turnip, Plum Dashi: A
Roasted Peking Duck, Caramelized Sunchoke, Quince, Cranberry, Warm Spice Jus: A+
Wagyu Beef (add-on): A+
Braised Lamb Neck, Cauliflower, Pistachio, Honey: A++

This was one of those meals that reminded me why I&apos;ve invested myself in the restaurant scene to such a degree. It&apos;s why I&apos;ve watched Chef&apos;s Table three times through and it&apos;s why I spend so much time writing reviews on here. The vision here is clear. To get such a great blend of flavors, ingredients, techniques and creativity is a gift. Every ingredient had a place, every preparation made conceptual sense, and nothing felt too overthought. Our favorites (if I HAD to choose) were the Foie Gras Tarte, the Sea Urchin, the Marlin, the Braised Lamb Neck and the Duck. We added in the Wagyu Beef (there was an option to add that or the gnocchi), which was unbelievable as well. Just sit back and soak it all in. 

Desserts (both served in cute, little bowls with cute, little spoons):
Lemon Curd, Creme Fraiche, Puffed Rice
Kaffir Lime White Chocolate Pudding, Almond

Sweet bites:
Cookies, Lemongrass Milk
Bergamot Marshmallow
Buddha Hand Gummy Bears
Blood Orange Star Anise Pate de Fruit 

Good things come in small packages. I could say that was one of the themes of the whole night. After our heartier mains, having a few lighter desserts to round out the meal was a perfect ending. And we didn&apos;t *need* to add in that Wagyu but we were happy we did. It was just the right amount of food. Just the right amount of everything."
4,"I made reservations for dinner to celebrate my husband&apos;s birthday at Laurel. In my reservations, I noted to have dessert brought out with a candle -- a perfectly fair and normal request. A week before our dinner, I get a call from Laurel confirming my reservation and acknowledging my husband&apos;s birthday and bringing out dessert with a candle. 

On the evening of our dinner, my husband and I arrived at Laurel and upon being seated, one of our waitresses blurted out if we were celebrating a birthday that night, and immediately wished my husband happy birthday. I was nonplussed over this because the point was to bring out dessert at the end, as requested, then wish him happy birthday. 

I decided to brush off what had just happened, hoping my request would still be honored when she brought out our dessert later that evening.

As far as what we thought about Nick Elmi&apos;s Laurel, the concept that he put forth in his tasting menu was a pretty cool and delicious one. He incorporated a lot of textures, so that the experience was not just about taste but texture as well. I honestly did not think he was that great in his winning season of Top Chef but were glad we went with the 9 course tasting menu, because it was actually really enjoyable.

In terms of the ambiance, it was okay. I expected more from Laurel. The music playing in the background was ill fitted for a fine dining restaurant. 

When it came time for dessert, our waitress totally disappointed me and did not bring out dessert with a candle as confirmed from our call earlier that week.

Next to us, a couple was just seated and was also celebrating a birthday. Immediately, their waiter did as our waitress had done, bringing up the girl&apos;s birthday and wishing her happy birthday. I immediately felt bad for her date, hoping his surprise was not ruined like mine.

Overall, the waitstaff were all very nice and attentive. My only gripe was that they didn&apos;t bother to honor special requests even after confirming with you."
5,"There are some people who are fancy and stuck up, some who are stuck up and not fancy, some who are not fancy or stuck up, and some who are fancy yet not stuck up. Laurel is the last one, and that is why you should carve aside an evening to enjoy a meal here. We ducked into the candlelit glowing belly of this adorable French restaurant on a frigid snow-globe-esque evening and escaped the world for a delicious 6-course meal. They offer a 9-course tasting as well, and wine pairings, which will be something to look forward to next time! Thoughts on the food:

1 - cured halibut, fermented strawberry, whipped verjus, horseradish snow: light, refreshing, bright; opened up the palate for the meal to follow; halibut and horseradish stood out and complemented each other. It was fun to eat the snow at the same time it was bitterly falling outside...

2 - braised burgundy snails, melted leeks, black onion crumble: very savory and creamy, kinda like a clam chowder/oyster chowder, perfectly rounded out the first course, equally delicious 

3 - slow roasted tilefish, celery root puree, sauce americaine, calamansi, sweet potato, quinoa: my favorite dish. delicate and tender fish with a light flavor, well supported by the accompaniments; sauce americaine was the highlight, tasted like browned butter and lobster 

4 - roasted quail, endive, winter mushrooms, orange, grilled duck jus: very delicious but almost a teaser - by the time you realized how delicious the quail was, it was devoured. 

5 - roasted venison, osso bucco, carrot, blood orange, pickled green coriander: incredibly tender venison though a little salty, but who am I to nitpick, as if I can cook a better venison; maybe my taste buds have too many salt receptors. 

6 - parsnip paw paw creme glacee, hazelnut, crispy bread: I love parsnip and think it deserves a place not only in savory foods but also in desserts! Loved this light yet creamy preparation of this humble root vegetable, which perfectly complemented the hazelnut, and didn&apos;t weigh you down at the conclusion of a phenomenal meal. 

The most amazing thing about Laurel is how friendly and warm the staff are. They make the meal most enjoyable, and for that reason alone you should stop in. Keep in mind that it is a small dining space, so reservations well ahead of time are necessary. Try to come on a &quot;special occasion&quot; because I think you get a candle and people around you get jealous..."
5,"As a fan of top chef I&apos;ve wanted to come since the open and didn&apos;t have the chance to until recently

Had a reservation for 3 and I was on crutches after a bad spill on the mountain spraining my mcl

They were very accommodating seating us at a 4 top closer to the restroom instead of the smaller table near the entrance.  

Staff was very friendly and for the most part knew their stuff tho think the one girl was newer but still nice lol. 

We brought 3 bottles of wine which helped with the meal and lower cost of the bill as we went with the 9 course menu and added the A5 wagyu which was phenomenal.  

The least favourite items while still decent wld of been the squid that came on toast that maybe would of been better as one bite but was left for us to eat with our hands and I individually picked and ate the squid pieces which were a little fishy lol. 
The amuse bouche also was okay as it was a shot but with gellatin type mix that had weird consistency unexpected.  

The two courses with the caviar were soooo awesome especially the one on the instagram with the ice cream.  The poached lobster course the burgundy snails tilefish scallop duck venison. N oh man the foie gras bon bon. 

I can&apos;t wait to go back.  Cos Eddie money and crew are rocking it"
5,"We rented out Laurel for our wedding dinner. Chef Elmi, Jane Fryer, and the staff could not have been easier to work with. They planned a nine-course menu for us that was flawless. Dinner included ice cream with caviar, oysters, juneberries, and the famous lobster press from Le Bec Fin. It was such an honor to see Chef Elmi in his element. I highly recommend this restaurant if you are planning a special event (or just want to enjoy an amazing meal!)"
5,"This was an amazing experience! Wow, I had high expectations, but they were pretty much all met when I dined at Laurel for the first time. To preface this review, I did watch the entire season of Top Chef for Nick Elmi&apos;s season, so I was super excited, and even curious whether I&apos;d get to see the chef.  

Regarding the reservation, we booked about a month earlier to get the date we wanted. They were still pretty limited on timing though, since I bet they only reserve a certain number of seatings each night, so we booked a reservation at 6pm, which was on the earlier side of what we wanted. You have to put down a credit card to reserve and there&apos;s only a tasting menu for $115. We were completely fine with this. The BEST part is that the dinner is still BYOB!!! Like, way to incorporate the best part about Philly dining into your restaurant! Even though there was a wine pairing that could go with the tasting menu for an additional $75, offering BYOB is super generous.  

So I went with my sister, who&apos;s from NYC, and she was even more excited about this BYOB part (because it&apos;s basically unheard of in NYC).  So we brought a bottle of red and a bottle of champagne, which ended up being perfect, because it paired really well with the dessert that included a champagne foam! 

So out of the seven courses, my absolute favorite, and my sister&apos;s as well, was the escargot dish. I actually like snails, and if you don&apos;t, you should still try them! But this was hands down the best and most interesting escargot dish I have ever had. It was just so, so delicious and rich! A perfect french escargot dish with a twist! Some other highlights of the night for me were the amuse-bouche dishes, which included this really good soup that looked like a piece of candy! The other dishes I really liked were the seafood dishes (striped bass and shrimp). 

So weirdly enough, I was least impressed with the lamb and pork cheek dishes, not because they were bad or anything, but just because there wasn&apos;t anything extremely special or different about the two dishes. They were very solidly cooked traditional dishes. 

Overall though, the experience was still amazing, the service was great, and the BEST part is that Nick Elmi hand delivered at least one dish to each table that night, so I got to meet the chef! I LOVED how Laurel is still a very small, local feeling restaurant, but obviously also very high-class french/delicious!"
2,"I live in NY and my husband and I have a tradition of coming to Philly every year for New Years.  We booked rezzies at Laurel for dinner on NYE.  We were a bit early for our seating so went to the bar that is next door (affiliated with the restaurant) and the craft cocktails were impressive and tasty.  I will definitely be back for the drinks.  Unfortunately, our dinner was just &apos;meh.&apos;  In full disclosure, we live in NY and I&apos;m a bit of a food snob.  However, I consider Philly restaurants to be as good as, if not better than, many NY restaurants. I had heard so many great things about Laurel, but it really missed the mark for me.  A number of the dishes were bland,  there was a dish w truffle that you couldn&apos;t even taste, we did an up charge for wagyu that was really overpowered by too much smoke, and the chocolate cake dessert was forgettable (so much so that I&apos;m not even sure it was choco cake or something else, in any case dessert was nothing special). Our dinner cost approximately $800 w the wine pairing, add-on, and tip and I&apos;d have much rather have gone to eleven mad or per se back home, which wouldn&apos;t have cost much more.  I&apos;m glad I tried it, but IMHO it doesn&apos;t live up to the hype.  Although I should say that there service was excellent.  

Maybe it was an off night, but I&apos;m guessing it was not.  It just seems that, for the price point, there needs to be better quality control of the food coming out of the kitchen.  Dishes all seemed under or over seasoned.  Overall, it was a snooze fest for my palate.  I seriously question how other could give this restaurant four or five stars.  Maybe they don&apos;t get out very often?

There are so many amazing places in Philly at a variety of price points, so save your money and skip this one."
5,"I think I died and went to heaven during this meal. 

I was super skeptical going into after reading some of these reviews and hearing different takes on others experiences. I&apos;m confused where any of the negative reviews come from.

Service was amazing. They made us feel very comfortable throughout the entire evening without pushing anything on us.

We ended up not doing the pairing which I don&apos;t think is necessary. 

All in all it was about a 3ish our experience so don&apos;t think you&apos;ll be in and out. It&apos;s the perfect spot for a special evening... I can&apos;t imagine have going in a larger party as it was just 2 of us and that felt comfortable in there. 

Sea Urchin and Marlin were two of our dishes during the evening and were out of this world. Not sure I&apos;ll ever have that again unless I go back. Don&apos;t under estimate the size of the dishes -- by the time dessert comes around you are FULL. 

I&apos;m sure this will be the #1 meal I ever have in Philly until I go back again. Thank you Nick Elmi for a delicious experience. Make sure to take the menu with you when leaving -- you won&apos;t be able to remember any of the courses by the end of it."
2,"Agree with Amanda on everything she described to a tee. This by far the most disappointing meal I ever ate and I traveled from dc area to just try out Nick Elmi&apos;s restaurant spending tons of money for hotel, cab etc so very sad.  Also agree with all reviews regarding wait staff&apos;s skills and precision, decor and most of all the totally lackluster plating and color with pile of brown and white food. We had the wine pairing with only one red wine and many low quality wine for a whopping $150 for two and I would say wine tasted just bad and not well paired. The food was not cohesive at all, scallop on oxtail, there is pretty much no protein. When we say oxtail, it was like 2 cm of mushy pulled beef swimming in potato mousse thus and need to covered with a raw  scallop sliver. I actually left the dessert as although sound promising, way too sweet. All in all, this was a restaurant I wanted to go for a long time seeing how precise Nick Elmi seemed on top chef. However this slap together cool sounding ingredients missed many fundamentals, crunch, sweet, acid, savory, umami. Overall I spent 400 on the meal, 700 in travel cost and left feeling not well with all the food combination that contradicts and battles. The best thing was the bread and it was not house baked but outsourced. I wanted so much to like this place. So much. I didn&apos;t even want to write this review as not positive but I have to be give fair opinion to perhaps giving food for thought to chef  to please rethink this direction."
5,"I watched Chef Elmi in season 11 of Top Chef and when I moved to Philly I knew this restaurant was on the top of my list.

Disclaimer: This review is written a bit late, sorry! Life got in the way! I visited Lauren back in 9/2017

To date, this is one of my favorite dining experiences that I have ever had.  Every dish was executed with such perfection in both taste and appearance. The corn chowder with uni, the sea bass, and wagyu beef dish were some of our favorites from the night (in Sept last year) but we enjoyed every single dish and ate our plates clean. My boyfriend doesn&apos;t like seafood but enjoyed the uni and the sea bass very much! They were even able to accommodate his preferences by switching out a scallop dish for pork cheek instead.

All in all, excellent food, excellent service, cozy quaint ambiance. Worth the price for an awesome meal. Will be looking for a chance to go back soon!"
