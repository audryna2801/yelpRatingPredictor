5,A favorite usually order through DoorDash but somehow my pizza is hot and delicious and made quickly. The staff has always been nice when I pick up as well.
5,"While I love going to independent (or dollar slice) pizza joints, &amp;pizza has become one of my favorite fast casual spots when I want to grab a quick meal with a friend or eat a crazy huge pizza with odd toppings. I always, always go for the create your own - which is a great value and includes great vegetarian friendly toppings like vegan sausage, which tastes very close to the real thing, and makes it easier to share with my vegetarian partner without feeling like I&apos;m missing out on meat pizza!

They have had a tremendous response during COVID - from feeding my roommate for free after long shifts at the hospital to serving as the comfort food I need (while being early / eager adopters of public health precautions). &amp;pizza - you&apos;ll always be a gem in my book. Can&apos;t wait to eat in person again!"
5,My friends and I ordered pizza from &amp;pizza the other night and absolutely loved it! We ordered the American Honey and Dirty Bird with some of their delicious garlic knots! We just HAD to come back for seconds! The restaurant has a very unique style and their prices are worth what you get! Highly recommend this place as a lunch or dinner spot.
1,"This is the most frustrating place to try to order from. I tried to order online and was hit with like $9 of added charges. Besides tax and a delivery charge, there was also a mandatory tip included AND a &quot;service&quot; charge on top of it all. The personal pizza itself was already over $10, so there&apos;s no way I&apos;m going to spend that much money on lunch, especially pizza! I get some people can be cheap but personally I tip more when I&apos;m not told that I HAVE to tip a certain amount, so that&apos;s their loss. I decided against delivery to avoid the ridiculous fees, and tried to call them to ask if they were allowing indoor seating yet(Philly just lightened the restrictions today). I was met with an automated voicemail and sat through the whole useless thing expecting to be able to talk to a person at the end, but turns out, your only options are to hear the message again, hangup, or text them.
At this point I was over it and wanted to just go somewhere simpler, but decided to text the number since I was told the pizza was great. 
All of that was for nothing though, because they don&apos;t have indoor dining anyway, and while I don&apos;t mind walking all the way there to avoid the delivery charge, if I can&apos;t eat there, my food would be cold by the time I walked all the way back. Sorry that I couldn&apos;t give this place a fair rating on its actual food, but trying to contact them is more trouble than it&apos;s worth and I&apos;ll be finding my lunch elsewhere."
4,The pizza was very tasty and the service was great. We ordered pizza for pickup and when we picked it up we were able to quickly get our pizza and it was kept in a warmer so it was nice and warm when we received it. Also good value for what we received.
5,"I would write a poem about this pizza: it&apos;s the firm crust, yet soft, crunchy, yet with a nice bite, its layers of flavors coming together with delectable cheese that&apos;s not overwhelming, that&apos;s part of the dish, not the overpowering imposition of lactose; but I&apos;m not a poet. I just love their pizza. A 10! Not much more to say, taste for yourself. Yum!"
4,"I typically don&apos;t get pizza when I decide to go out to eat, but I decided to order from &amp;pizza because I&apos;ve walked passed it several times in the past and was curious to try it.

I did an online pick up order where I created my own pizza instead of selecting the specialties. I was really impressed with all the options you could put on the pizza without any extra cost. Overall, I thought the pizza was pretty good but it definitely wasn&apos;t the best pizza I&apos;ve tried nor the worst. I will probably come back because the pizza is pretty big and I liked that I was able to create to meals out of it (depending on you usual portion sizes)."
4,This is such a dope pizza shop. It literally is a vibe on a Friday and Saturday night. I&apos;ve been hear a couple of time but never have written a review. Many celebrities come by here very casually. It&apos;s either a create your own pizza or pizza already designed! Love that you can add all the toppings you want with out be charged! Order pineapple pizza YES pineapple can go on pizza w green peppers and red chilly flakes well done! Only thing is that the pizza doesn&apos;t get that toasted nice char it&apos;s a simply glaze! I will always come here and would def recommend.
5,Pizza made to perfection. The jalape√±os were nice and crunchy and the cheese was gooey which is my favorite. Had their root beer and everything was just delicious.
5,"Despite the virus at hand, &amp; Pizza has dedicated itself to delivering free pizza to all healthcare professionals. This is absolutely amazing- I feel so supported. 

I this time got a pizza with almost every topping possible! Tell me that this doesn&apos;t look amazing?!"
3,"It might&apos;ve been just my pizza, because I&apos;ve had friends with good experiences from &amp;pizza, but it was really dry. It may have also been because I picked it up a little later than the pickup time. 

I tried making my own, and of note, the vegan sausage bits were pretty shriveled and tasteless, so avoid those. The spicy chickpeas we&apos;re pretty flavorful. I was disappointed that there wasn&apos;t much cheese on my pizza, but perhaps you can choose an option to add more. 

I probably wouldn&apos;t go here again, especially for full price. It is a pretty big portion size though!"
5,"So it&apos;s a chain, but honestly one of the best chains there are. Made-to-order pizza down a line like a Chipotle. Quality is great, and can literally make a pizza massive with lots of toppings. I recommend just making your own and putting all the ingredients you would want on a pizza on there. So many different variations you can make. Decent price. Opens late. What more do you want!?"
5,"Ok this pizza place was bomb!  It is open until super late, so it is a great choice for someone looking for late night eats.  My husband and I were looking for a very late dinner, and we stumbled on this spot.  What makes it different than blaze and pieology is the shape of the pizza.  It is a rectangular shape basically.  You can either make your own, or select from some other pizza combos.  They had a lot of cool options and unique toppings.  I got the moonstruck, and my husband got the buffalo.  It is a pretty reasonable size, i think if both people aren&apos;t starving they could probably share.  They don&apos;t really have much else here, just pizza and some drinks.  We had leftovers."
2,"This place was a colossal letdown, especially after I so thoroughly enjoyed a very similar pizza place on a trip to Florida a couple of weeks ago (&quot;@pizza&quot;, which makes me think the similarities may be intentional). But last night when my girlfriend and I ordered two of their signature pizzas (she got the &quot;Gnarlic&quot; and I got the pepperoni pizza, &quot;Little Roni&quot;), the service was awful and the product mediocre.

We went to pick up our pizzas 90+ minutes before the restaurant closes, but the doors wouldn&apos;t open when we got there. Still, there were people eating pizzas inside and 3 staff members there. At least one of them saw us trying to open the door, but never acknowledged us or came out to open it. When a second couple came and tried, they finally let us all in. No apologies, though, and when we told them that it had been locked, we were just told &quot;nah, it just does that sometimes&quot;. 

We picked up our pizzas and got home, only to see that they had written &quot;no pesto :(&quot; on the Gnarlic. They didn&apos;t call us to tell us that or even tell us when we were there to offer another sauce or something. That was just for us to learn once we&apos;d already gotten home to eat.

As for the food? It was ok, but my pepperonis were burnt and the pizza didn&apos;t leave much of an impression with me either way. It was...dry. My girlfriend said hers was ok even without the pesto, but I&apos;d hardly say she was blown away, either. 

The combination of uncaring, lazy service and bland pizza means this is likely a spot we&apos;ll be skipping in the future."
2,"This is not a Covid issue I believe... first delivery was canceled randomly after 1.3 hrs of watching this person ride in every direction other than our home, except the brief moment when she was just 5 blocks away, and then just rode off in another direction. I (stupidly) reordered, even with &quot;priority&quot; delivery, the photo I&apos;m sharing will show how that turned out... It takes less than a minute to make these pizza&apos;s, I guess quality control stops at the restaurant. I guarantee the majority of positive reviews are motivated by the fact that &amp;Pizza&apos;s are pretty cheap. Well I&apos;m done with cheap..."
4,"This is a nice casual place to grab pizza and has plenty of seating.  I tried the moonstruck pizza.  I wanted a touch of meat so I asked for meat to be added and just to experiment, I asked for cherry tomatoes and arugula to be added on half of it. I like the thin crust and it&apos;s not super pricey (about $9 for a pizza). Surprisingly it&apos;s super easy to chow down. I&apos;m not a huge eater but I felt like I could have easily chowed down the whole thing.

There&apos;s plenty of seating, some picnic-table style and others with real chairs. It&apos;s a casual environment but a nice place to grab a bite with friends or family."
4,3rd time I&apos;ve had a bad somewhat experience when it comes to customer service and being courteous to patrons...But today my pizza was remove from the oven and left to sit on the counter for almost 5mins because somehow the cashier thought it was better to handle all Pick-up orders before just handing me my pizza...Not happy about what took place today
1,"I am absolutely DISGUSTED that I found a large bug in my pizza. I have photos of my receipt and the bug. As someone who with a mild bug phobia I am appalled at this. I also have a photo of the receipt that the cashier gave me at 5:21 pm on 10/15/19.

Upper management should review the Philadelphia Center City location immediately."
5,"I don&apos;t come here enough, but I love it. Good size for a personal pizza, good toppings, classic and basic options as well as some unique options. 

They also have gluten free and whole grain options which I love. 

Location is central and on Friday and Saturday it&apos;s open late night so you can get some pizza when you&apos;re drunk aka what I did last night!!!

Staff is nice, lots of seating, reasonably priced! I&apos;m in. Highly recommend."
5,"Wow, &amp;pizza - Rittenhouse was certainly cool. I&apos;m so thrilled to be here and the atmosphere is so pretty. &amp;pizza - Rittenhouse has a terrific Farmer&apos;s Daughter / Breakfast with a Kick, try it I believe you would love it, I certainly love it. Nice people/service. Overall &amp;pizza - Rittenhouse is great, with great people, and great atmosphere."
