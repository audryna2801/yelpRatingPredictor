5,"Ten years later and Standard Tap continues to keep things above standard. 

Comfortable outdoor seating: check

Solid beer menu: check

Excellent food: delicious cooked to order Standard burger and fries 

Great service: yes 

Will I be back again? ... I&apos;m already on my way."
5,"I am so grateful that the team at Standard Tap has opened (with safety precautions ) during the pandemic because it&apos;s just so good. 
Also, hope the outdoor seating continues (god willing) post pandemic because it&apos;s so comfortable.
Everyone is so nice,  accommodating and the food is stellar! 
We&apos;ve had and I highly recommend the octopus appetizer, grilled shrimp, burger and scallops. Also, definitely try the Japanese eggplant side. 

We will definitely keep coming back. 
Thank you ST crew!!"
4,A decent place for beers and food. Love the ambiance and staff are very friendly! Available for take-out.
4,"Really get some local Philly vibes from this spot - always bustling with customers, solid music playing in the background, loud and exciting space.

They have a good menu - unique veggie options, vast beer selection. Mainly bar food, but prepared &amp; presented a bit more upscale. You gotta try their burger or chicken pot pie - they feel like their staples. I also would suggest the ricotta balls and the chili sweet potatoes - definite standouts.  

Parking is really tough in the part of the northern liberty neighborhood, so be prepared to spend some time there or just try to get their via lyft/uber."
1,"Came here with such high hopes, but unfortunately it was a complete disappointment. The reduced menu had nothing we wanted

I will come back IF they reinstate the full menu. Other than that, this place is over priced and WAY Overrated"
4,Burgers are well made and the beet salad is sublime.  Good beer selection. I&apos;ve been twice and both times have been quite good.
5,"Big fan of Standard Tap. This place is really great for any occasion. My boyfriend and I had our first date here about a year and a half ago. We just got drinks that time. It was such a good place for a first date. The bartenders were friendly (we sat at the bar) and it wasn&apos;t busy at all. I could hear my boyfriend and didn&apos;t feel like I had to scream. They have a great list of cocktails and beer. 

We decided to make our way back to where it all started for lunch this past weekend. They have a pretty decent menu for being a bar. 

We got the baked feta, New England clam chowder, standard burger, and the chicken pie. All were delicious. The dish I liked the least was the baked feta. I&apos;m a big fan of feta so I had high hopes for the dish. I didn&apos;t really enjoy the beats. The burger and chicken pie were my favorite dishes. If I had to pick one to be my ultimate favorite it would be the chicken pie. It was an explosion of the beat thanksgiving flavors in one little pie. 

Definitely recommend this place!!"
5,"My partner and I went here for a last minutes valentine&apos;s dinner and it was phenomenal!! the food was amazing and our server, Danny, was so kind and wonderful! I would absolutely come back here."
5,This is my first time eating here. Great beer selection and solid knowledge of it from the staff.  We had the haddock sandwich and the pork roll hash. Both were excellent. The rest of the menu looked excellent as well.  I would wager this is the best gastropub in Northern Liberties.
3,"I was excited to try this place given the good Yelp reviews. But I was disappointed. Maybe because I ordered take out given the Covid pandemic and didn&apos;t get to enjoy the bar scene. I ordered the standard burger with fries. The meat patty had an odd texture: felt grainy and not fresh. The burger tasted dry and not flavorful. If you&apos;re in the Fishtown/Northern Liberties area and crave a burger, I would recommend Johnny Brenda&apos;s instead (which seriously tastes like a homemade Big Mac)."
5,"This place is HUGE on the inside! My first time in this area and I came with a group of 6 on a busy Sunday during the 2nd St Festival... we just wanted a break from the heat and sun and needed to sit and enjoy some drinks! Took a chance and went inside and asked if they had seats for 6... got seated right away on the 2nd level! SCORE!

The upstairs has an open area where you&apos;re overlooking 2nd St.. so great for still enjoying the weather but not right under the hot sun! And great for people watching too! I was amazed how much room there was inside!

Drinks
They had a nice selection of about 20 beers on tap... something for everyone as they had cocktails and also a wine list to choose! They&apos;ve got options for flights as well! They do have half priced happy hour for drinks during the week, so definitely check that out!

Food
Had a small selection of food but heard from one person in our group that their food is really good! One person got a burger, portion size was huge and they definitely don&apos;t skimp on the fries! I wasn&apos;t that hungry and just opted for the Grilled Shrimp... and I was pleasantly surprised because it was more than just grilled shrimp. It was on a bed of amazing sauce and some other things mixed into it that created flavors that made it a tad spicy.. i think there was andouille sausage and corn.. but it tasted amazing!

Service was great and fast despite it being crowded! I will definitely come back to try more of their food as they change often and use seasonal and local ingredients which I like!"
5,"Food was great along with the service. I had the shrimp skewers which was cooked to perfection, it had a Smokey taste and the sauce was delicious. 
The frose was so good, I didn&apos;t realize it was a creeper until I was halfway through my second one, gave a good buzz. 
The burger was absolutely marvelous, either I was hungry or couldn&apos;t stop myself from scuffing it down because it had my taste buds asking for more while driving my mouth crazy. 
The crème brûlée was the finishing touch to this great meal and as everything else it didn&apos;t disappoint."
3,"...And now the old nagging problems come back. Very frustrating; it&apos;s hard to know what I&apos;m going to get here. Some of it is really good, some is meh...Was here with three others and had the following items:

Striped Bass ($28): Overall two in my party ordered the striped bass; one did not like it and had it replaced with a burger (which they agreed to do luckily). The other thought it was only OK. Including some type of side dish or a bit more on the side would be helpful to make people feel they got their money&apos;s worth.

Chicken Pie ($16:) Was its usual normal self; very good with a bit of salad on the bottom. Very nice consistency and one of my favorite items on the menu.

Gnocchi ($15 appetizer size): Gnocchi were very good; served in brown butter sauce and with some veggies. Enjoyed quite a bit.

Two also ordered the standard burger and really liked it (one had original ordered roast chicken which was sold out); we also had a side order of Brussels sprouts that were good.

About 3.5 starts overall based on today&apos;s visit."
4,"Enjoyed the vibe here, neat building-- loud inside (at least upstairs). We went for a birthday dinner, ordered the Cuban and tomato salad. Fries were thin and crispy, just how I like them. Tomato salad was great-- their tomatoes were super fresh-- not mealy at all. Cuban was heavy, but good. I ate half then ate the rest for lunch the next day. I&apos;m sure we&apos;ll be back."
5,"I am here to happily add yet another well deserved 5 star review for Standard Tap. It was perfect. Poutine that I have ordered was absolutely amazing, it had a lot of flavor and was absolutely yummy. Everyone was really helpful. Can&apos;t wait to go back."
4,"My first time at Standard Tap, and it was anything but standard. I ordered the CBD infused cocktail, bass, as well as mint chocolate chip ice cream sundae. The drink packed a punch. Happy hour prices were awesome for cocktails. The bass was amazing. Crunchy skin, delicious lentils. And last but not least, the ice cream. Wow. What a perfect ending to the meal. The pretzels added a nice crunch, and that salt sweet effect. Would definitely return."
5,"First time trying out this place. Came with three friends and we were all really happy with the food and drinks (we&apos;re a hard bunch to please ha). Fun little patio for all those who are Covid conscious! if you&apos;re ever in the Fishtown/Northern Liberties area, definitely come and try this place out! Kaitlyn was our server who was also wonderful."
5,"A full upgrade to five stars is long overdue for this Philly staple. I&apos;ve been back time and again and, while most visits are for drinks only, I have a great time every time. Last Saturday night we stopped in twice, for pre-dinner and post-dinner drinks. Their earl grey hot toddy is perfect for a chilly night, and the wine list has something for everyone and at reasonable price points to boot. Bartenders are friendly. The music selection is always a fun mix - loved the 70s disco jams on our recent visit! 

My previous review nearly nine years ago reflects the opinions of a different, must less mature person. I&apos;m older now, I&apos;m wiser now."
4,"On New Year&apos;s Eve, we made last minute plans to have dinner with a group of friends at Standard Tap. They were doing a New Year&apos;s Eve four course menu for $55, which looked very promising. I&apos;ve only been to Standard Tap once before for lunch and had a burger. It was fine but did not warrant a second visit from me. NYE&apos;s four course menu exceeded my expectations though. You had the option of choosing one of two dishes for each course. For the first course, most of us had the marinated sardines, which was kind of meh. The second course was the pasta course, and both the Yellowfin Bolognese and the Farro Orecchietti were amazing and could have easily given Vetri&apos;s pastas a run for its money. Everyone at the table had the duck breast for the third course. The duck breast was cooked beautifully and was delicious. Dinner came to a close with dessert. The dark chocolate tart that we had wasn&apos;t anything special, but it was made well and tasted good. I had no idea Standard Tap can put out food like that. Despite how busy it was, the kitchen was pumping out food at a good pace, and service was the absolute best. The wait staff was spectacular and unfazed by rowdiness. We randomly got a free round of Love City beers sent to our table, on top of the already free sparkling wine to ring in the new year right before midnight. Standard Tap definitely won me over with their NYE dinner and we hope to return soon for more delicious food."
5,"CHEF DRIVEN

This place looks like a dive bar but it&apos;s not. I strictly came here because the menu looked great online but when we arrived there was a chalk board with different dishes then I saw on the computer. This told me that the chef cooks seasonally and we might be eating what is available at the market that day. 

Our bartender seemed a little rough in the beginning but he softened up really fast. He was able to tell us all about the menu. He even grabbed a beer sample for my coworker. They had a nice beer list and I started with a nice pilsner from Arizona. What? I&apos;m in a Philly. How does a desert beer end up here? I will say it was refreshing and it better be if I was stranded in the hot sun. 

I decided to go with the roast pork sandwich with roasted long hot peppers, smoked provolone and raw spinach on a sesame seed roll. The roast pork was in chunks. I thought it might be sliced like a steak sandwich but it wasn&apos;t. The sandwich was good but a little difficult to eat. I kept losing my pork chunks. The peppers were so good and added just the right amount of heat. 

My co-worker got the soft shell crab sandwich. She loved it and kept trying to give me a taste. I said no thanks cause I&apos;m not a fan of eating deep fried soft shells anymore.  It kind of ruins my meal. I was really surprised to find this type of sandwich in Philly. I&apos;d expect it at an Asian restaurant in San Francisco. This just shows you the talent of the chef plus my co-worker is hard to impress. If she likes my restaurant choice them I&apos;m winning. 

Everything was really good. Our bartender was like our best friend by the time we left. He warmed up to us. We broke down that rough Philly attitude. I would totally come back here. I usually spend my time going to all the Philly joints that all the locals recommend to me. Every neighborhood has their favorite and I&apos;ve tried a lot. I&apos;m glad I went a different route this trip. I can hardly wait to come back here and see what the chef has created on our next visit."
