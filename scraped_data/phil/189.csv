5,"Went here in 2019 and it was amazing.  Steak was perfect, the drink pours were generous and the rolls were the best I&apos;ve ever had.  Would definitely go back if in Philly again."
4,Excellent Tomato soup with goat cheese crustini. Flew in and ate a late dinner here. My mother had the salmon and I had the soup and warm spinach salad. All the food was very good but the soup rocked! They also start you off with a lovely bread basket with different dips and olives. I think restaurants should always offer a free starter!! Very nice. Great service!
5,"Been to the OG in Boston many times, and finally have the Philly location a try... did not disappoint!

Atmosphere: Feels fancier than Boston. Lowly lit and candles on all the tables. White tablecloth, not your casual run of the mill that&apos;s for sure!

Service: Attentive and knowledgeable on the menu. Very classy and professional.

Food: Never lets us down! If you haven&apos;t had the spring roll sampler, get on that. An absolutely must have. This time we tried the raw bar sampler, and it was delicious and fresh. I had the veal with horseradish mashed potatoes and asparagus, so tender and tasty! My husband had the filet with risotto, and both were winners. We finished the meal off with the apple crumb cake... yum!!

Overall this is a great place to splurge on for special occasions."
3,"Came here at 7:30pm on Monday for restaurant week with my friend. We got seated on time, but the service was extremely slow. I understand that it gets busy during restaurant week, but I would expect the restaurants to accommodate the increase of diners. At my other restaurant week dinners, it wasn&apos;t this bad. It took at least 10mins for the server to come take our orders. Then from finishing our meal to getting the check,  it was another at least 15mins - it felt like forever. 
Food was ok, nothing really wowed us. And paired with the lacking service, it doesn&apos;t make us want to come back."
3,"I came here for restaurant week. I usually don&apos;t review for restaurant week because I don&apos;t expect the full experience food wise from past experiences but I had to review Davio&apos;s because there were just some things I couldn&apos;t get past. Today my team came here for a lunch outing for restaurant week lunch and we came for the bare minimum the restaurant week lunch menu and water (but Lord knows I really would&apos;ve loved a glass of wine). The food was to be expected portion wise (relatively small) but for $20 and a three course meal you should expect that, also it&apos;s lunch time you don&apos;t need that much food anyway. 

For my first course I got the butter squash gnocchi. I would give it a 4/5- it was really good but the sage in it was way too much.

Second Course : Chicken dish with carrots 5/5 no complaints I really enjoyed it with the sauce, but my coworkers was undercooked and we had to send it back.

Third Course : Dessert Trio 2/5 the tart was exceptional, the apple caramel cake was extremely dry , and the chocolate dessert was wayyyy too rich (but if you like super rich chocolate then that&apos;s for you).

Why did I give three stars? I thought the service wasn&apos;t that great from our waiter, he just seemed like he couldn&apos;t be bothered and idk if he was just busy but it just didn&apos;t seem pleasant.

I&apos;ll try them out again when it&apos;s not Restaurant Week &amp; when I&apos;m not at work so I can get a class of wine or a cocktail or both (most likely both)."
4,"SUNDAY BRUNCH
I&apos;m choosing to modify my previously posted - Sunday, July 21 review. 

On my 7/21/19 visit, I had issues that caused me to look unfavorably on my dining experience. 

Later that week, I received a call from their leadership team. 
&quot;Mike&quot; and I discussed the specifics of that event on that day. 
His call not only assuaged any concerns I may have had - it also gave me insight into what the Davio&apos;s experience is designed to be and their mission. 

Collectively we agreed it was just an &quot;off day&quot; and a complete anomaly. 

I appreciate the professional courtesy of his follow-up! 

We&apos;ve all had &quot;off days&quot; (I certainly have) and e&apos;eryone deserves a second chance. 

Nick"
5,"I&apos;ve been here many times. Sometimes in a large group, other times in a more traditional group of 4. The service has always risen to the occasion. 

Food is great. Pasta bolognese is delicious. Steaks, chops etc. 

The main room is gorgeous. Huge arched windows with true divided lights.  There are also private dining rooms on the top floor."
5,"Ahhh! Davio&apos;s!!! I was so happy my husband decided to dine here the last night of Restaurant Week. We had visited Davio&apos;s with friends once before, so we were excited to return again. 

We were seated close to the window near the back of the restaurant. Therefore, we were able to enjoy a decent view of the city. For drinks, we had the Margarita and Peroni beer. The Margarita was a strong drink that held its on. I could taste the tequila more than the Gran Mariner. My husband felt his Peroni was nice and light. The restaurant week menu had plenty of options, but we mixed it up just a little bit and ordered some items from the regular menu as well. We started with the chicken parmesan spring rolls in addition to the minestrone soup, and salad (consisted of olives, kale, tomatoes, feta cheese and vinaigrette). Everything tasted soooo good!!! For entrees, we ordered scallops, and a flat iron steak. Additionally, we asked to try the sweet corn risotto. My scallops were cooked perfectly, but the peppers and grain that accompanied them were underwhelming. Thank God, we had the sweet corn risotto bc it paired perfectly with the scallops. My husband said his flat iron steak was tender and actually tasted more like a filet than a flat iron. He also enjoyed the sweet corn risotto. 

The desert trio was cute! My favorite was the pineapple upside down tart. The chocolate portion was heavy and rich, it wasn&apos;t my favorite. However, the birthday acknowledgement that our waiter provided was the sweetest message of the evening. Thank you Davio&apos;s and to our wonderful waiter for making my birthday and dimknb experience so pleasant + enjoyable!!!!"
4,"I finally made it! I came here for a business lunch, and I highly enjoyed my meal. This restaurant is on the second floor, accessible by elevator. The restaurant is gorgeous, with a traditional steakhouse design.  We were promptly greeted and seated by a window. The server was super professional and brought a basket of bread within seconds.  For appetizers, we ordered the cheese steak rolls and gnocchi in a truffle sauce. The cheese steak rolls were amazing. They were served steaming hot, within 10 minutes of our order. The gnocchi came out a few minutes later, and was really delicious. The gnocchi was soft and tasty, and the sauce was packed with flavor.  

For my entree, I ordered the NY strip medium rare. It was cooked to perfection. It was a good portion, especially for lunch. I ate a lot, starting with too much bread. I was extremely pleased with my meal. It was hard to go back to work after that meal. I was too full for dessert, but the server brought out a delicious biscotti. And I ate it. The bill was pretty high for lunch, so make sure that either you are ready to splurge, or someone else is paying. You will definitely have an enjoyable dining experience."
4,"We made reservations for 6 people during the middle of the week. We were quickly seated and given pop-over bread- so delicious. The waiter reviewed the menu with us and answered any questions we might have had. We ordered the calamari and the meatballs to split among the table.  Most of the dishes are a la carte but portions were large. We shared the horseradish potatoes, green beans, and Brussels sprouts among 6 adults.

For an entree, I ordered the Prime iron steak cooked perfectly medium rare. It came atop the horseradish potatoes and asparagus. 

As for dessert, they had a variety of options including gelato and Panna cotta. They were just some of the options that were ordered for the table. 

Davio&apos;s is a great spot for special occasions!"
5,"Birthday Dinner Review 2!

When you find yourself dating another foodie who also hates that word, your birthday becomes a good reason to have a culinary celebration. And whether it&apos;s for its fantastic cocktails, impeccable food options, excellent service, and decadent desserts, Davio&apos;s proved to be a spot that delivered on all fronts!

Whether you&apos;re a fan of meat heavy steakhouses, traditional Italian restaurants that are heavy on pasta, or classic dishes with a modern twist, Davio&apos;s definitely delivers. They first had me at the lavish top floor dining space (even if its view did overlook office buildings) and absolutely delicious popover bread, and reeled me in further with the knowledgeable service and amazingly gooey chocolate lava cake. Toss in some well presented cocktail classics that utilized modern ingredients and local spirits, and their bar selection definitely had plenty to offer.

For the longest time one of the main thing I heard about Davio&apos;s was how impressive their cheesesteak spring rolls were. And wow they definitely lived up to the hype, grabbing the full sampler led to even more amazing bites like the shrimp &amp; cotija cheese roll, and the spinach &amp; feta. Extra bonus points go to the chicken parm one which somehow managed to fit the full on zesty flavor into a tiny spring roll!

When you dine in an Italian steakhouse you find yourself being bombarded by SO MANY tantalizing sounding pasta and meat dishes! But the more I read the description for the Mediterranean branzino, the harder it became to pass up. And the spinach, farro, peperonata jam, fennel pollen, and crispy pancetta that came with it added up one amazing dish. It also didn&apos;t hurt that I got to try some perfect bites of their HUGE prime rib with subtly spicy horseradish sauce.

Toss in amazing sides like their decadent truffled mac and cheese, and the perfectly presented chocolate lava cake that they put together for my birthday, and Davio&apos;s was a treat at every single bite!"
5,"Went here with my wife for Valentine&apos;s day. We had an 8:45 dinner so we got a cocktail ahead of time at the bar. My wife had the margarita and I had a Negroni. Both were well crafted and the bartender was gracious. For dinner they offered a Valentine&apos;s day prix fixe which we both ordered and got the opposite options to try share. This has easily become a top 5 restaurant in the city for us, especially with the relatively cheap price for the quality. The ravioli with fresh truffle and the steak were delectable. It&apos;s not often a restaurant &quot;wows&quot; my wife...she even liked it more than Jean Georges and I would have to agree. The staff are very courteous and the seating is well spaced out between tables. Can&apos;t wait to return!"
4,"Four of us while on business enjoyed a nice dining experience. Appetizers were grilled octopus and calamari. The grilled Octopus was the star of the apps for sure. Two of us had the 8 ounce beef filet and the other two had the Branzino fish. I personally had the chopped salad while others seemed to enjoy the Arugula salad and a tomato salad. 

Nothing really special with the sides Asparagus and MAC and Cheese served family style. 

Service was attentive but some confusion on who ordered what? Don&apos;t really expect that with an a&apos;la carte joint with their price points. 

Overall , good but not great when all things considered."
5,"I had trouble finding a diner in the area, so I decided to try breakfast at the hotel. I&apos;m glad I did! It was great. And inexpensive. For less than $15 I got a full breakfast with poached eggs, rye toast, home fries, coffee, and the most amazing sausage. The service was great, can&apos;t recommend it enough. Next time I will try diner."
5,"Solid lunch and amazing service.  I loved how the server greeted me by my name and the staff waits on you really well and is very attentive throughout the meal.

For restaurant week lunch, they were serving lentil soup with sausage which was ok.  The star was the ricotta gnudi, which is basically a gnocchi cooked with brown butter and parm.  Super delicious and they should have this part of their regular menu!

Ordered the veal/pork belly burger.  They cook it well done (since their&apos;s pork).  It&apos;s a really rich burger with the sundried tomato relish and the fries are cooked well too

For dessert, they have a trio of options so you didn&apos;t even need to decide which one you wanted!  Out of the three, my favorite was the chocolate mousse (others were an almond cake and a raspberry bar)

Must come here again!"
5,"Absolutely amazing experience; food was beyond my expectations. 

Came here with a large group (made a resi on OpenTable) and were seated immediately. We had a round table which was perfect for everyone to talk with each other. 

Highly recommend the Kale / Quinoa salad. The sauce was subtle. Salmon with eggplant / spinach was the highlight!! We also ordered the ice cream to finish up (they have a cart to show you each dessert; hard to say no) Overall fantastic experience. Will definitely come back again."
3,"So let&apos;s start with good highs- food pretty good. The bad- service.

My fiancé and I came for our birthdays. After being seated, we noticed our server was also tending to a table of 6 who was seated at the same time. She was super nice, however the entire time we felt like we were second to the larger party. We finished our cocktails, our apps came before the wine we ordered then well before we finished our meals came out. We had to order wine from the food  runner. I don&apos;t blame her totally but do blame the hostess for seating two tables at the same time.

Food was pretty good. We both had steaks. Me a filet, him a NY strip. My medium steak came closer to well done. 

Only reason this is getting 3 stars is because of the service. If you&apos;re paying top price for the food, I expect way better service.

Do yourself a favor and go to butcher and singer or barclary prime. Even delfriscos, which I don&apos;t love, was still an overall better experience than davios."
5,"NEAL WAS AN EXCEPTIONAL SERVER!! 
My cousin &amp; I came from Miami,Fl
He made our birthday experience amazing! HE TRULY IS WHAT A SERVER SHOULD BE/PRESENT THMSELVES. 
He knew the menu &amp; made great suggestions. 
My wine glass &amp; glass of water NEVER ran out. 
Served us fresh,hot out the oven bread.
He surprised my cousin &amp; I with candles on our birthday desert dish(made my heart smile that he did that). 
I definitely will come back ONLY to have him serve me again."
5,"Just had an incredible lunch during restaurant week!  The  Spicy Crab Soup was perfect on this cold day, with just enough spice, the Lemon Sole was absolutely delightful - perfectly prepared and just the right portion, and the Black Currant Cake was the perfect ending!  The service?
PHENOMENAL - Thank you Chuck for a wonderful lunch experience.  My first visit and will definitely be back!!"
5,"Love this restaurant. Pricey but worth it.  We had a company Christmas function here and it was amazing. On a floor all to ourselves looking out into the city. I was happy to try this place on my own for dinner to be able to try some menu items. I was not sure hungry but saw gnocchi on the menu and had to order it. Luckily they offer appetizer portions for all pasta entrees which is amazing!  It actually was still so much food. I got the arugula salad before hand which was light and simple and perfect. I would love to try a steak on my next trip here - but definitely wanted to make sure I had the appetite. 

The gnocchi was tender - I would have preferred a creamy sauce with the truffle and mushroom. Yeh sauce was tangy. Just my preference but it was good. 

Love the atmosphere in this place. Very cool, old school steak house vibe."
