5,"They&apos;re open for dine in!!!

So yeah, went for my first dine in experience since March of 2020 for a steaming bowl of ramen. No matter how good takeout has been, ramen just isn&apos;t the same when it&apos;s takeout. 

I feel bad for the staff cause they all have to wear masks and face shields, but yeah at least they&apos;re still in business and got their jobs. Once you go in, they take your name and phone number down for contact tracing I assume, in the event there is an exposure or something and take your temperature. The ramen bar is covered with plastic so the kitchen is divided from the seating area. 

They space everyone out, but I went at open so I was the only one. It was kinda a crazy feeling cause this place used to have super long lines. 

Anyway I got the shoyu ramen and some seaweed salad. Same great taste. 

Anyway, support the restaurants and tip generously if possible!"
5,"Best ramen I&apos;ve eaten in Philadelphia! Umami to the 1000th degree! 

When I want ramen, this is exactly what I think of. Service is fast, the food is amazing (the dumplings are really great too but I didn&apos;t get a picture). Help keep them open through Covid please! 

The eggs are perfectly flavored and nicely soft. 

Go here!"
5,"Philly just allowed for in room dining. This place rocked and really nailed the Japanese feeling. The place was spotless clean and sanitized. We ordered the mini Chicken Curry, which tasted like very authentic  Japanese curry. It was sweet and savory, which was a perfect blend of flavor. Top off with piece of fried Japanese chicken was icing on the cake. Next, the Takoyaki, the octopus in the middle was nice, soft, and flavorful. The meat of octopus was not rubbery or overcooked at all. The soupy broth in the middle was just delicious. Last, i got the Miso Ramen. The pork was just soft and tender. The broth was delightful light and not over powering. Everything in the dish was balanced well with the overall experience. Definitely will come here again."
5,"Hands down best ramen in Philly! I&apos;ve lived in LA for quite a few years now and have been to quite a few ramen shops. This is just as comparable! I love that they have the tan tan ramen which I feel most people don&apos;t usually order but it&apos;s one of the best ramens out there.

The edamame is a must order! I replaced my ramen with chicken instead of having the pork and it was tender, can&apos;t wait to come back and order again. 

I loved that everything was still fresh when we brought it back home. I did have to reheat my broth because I love it piping hot."
4,"Solid ramen joint. I think it&apos;s worthwhile to visit at least once. Personally, I think their curries and donburis are better than the ramen. Unlike other restaurant joints, their curries and donburis are slightly sweeter.

Never had a bad experience here. 

Consistent terrific service.

I thought this was the best Japanese ramen at first, but there&apos;s something missing. I think this place accentuates too much on that umami flavor that it forgets to emphasize other flavors. For some reason, the umami flavor is overpowering for me."
4,"We missed eating ramen, and let&apos;s be real, takeout ramen just isn&apos;t the same as eating a fresh piping hot bowl of ramen inside a restaurant. They took our temperature and made sure we sanitized our hands before seating us. We liked their ramen more than their curry (which we&apos;ve gotten takeout before). Their tempura shumai was tasty and their charshu onigiri wasn&apos;t as meaty as I was expecting it to be. Their mayu ramen was comforting and rich in flavor. The verdict is this place is a solid spot for ramen."
3,"UPDATE 11/14/2020 (3 stars down from 5 stars)

We&apos;ve been ordering takeout from Terakawa since the pandemic started and had a horrible experience today that deserves mention. My overall review is still 3 stars because of the dozens and dozens of positive experiences I&apos;ve had at Terakawa over the years.

I placed an order via phone for takeout and was told the wait was 30 minutes (which is totally fine!). We showed up 30 minutes later and were told the food would be ready in a few minutes, so we paid, tipped, and started waiting outside. 20 minutes after arriving at Terakawa, our food was finally ready. The girl in front of us threatened to cancel the order because she also had to wait much longer than the estimated time. The wait wasn&apos;t that big of an issue and isn&apos;t the reason I&apos;m updating my review. Just wanted to point it out to others who might find it helpful to add some time if they don&apos;t want to wait in the cold.

The reason why I&apos;m docking two stars is because I found HAIR in my food today (photo attached). That is absolutely unacceptable, especially with the rise of covid cases right now in Philly. Finding hair in my food is a public health hazard even without a pandemic, so I will no longer be a regular customer (at least until the pandemic ends).

---

I&apos;ve been here probably 50 times since 2012 or so. It is by far the best ramen joint in Philly. Service totally sucks most of the time, but the food more than makes up for it. 

The original terakawa ramen is THE BEST, although everything is great. The broth in the terakawa ramen is perfect, and the pork melts in your mouth. I prefer the wavy egg noodles to the straight ones, but the straight ones are great too. 

I also like the Shoyu and Miso broths, but the Tan Tan is a bit too spicy/salty for me. The appetizers are good too. It is worth the wait in my opinion, although try to come here during off-peak hours if you can. 3-4pm on weekdays tend to work well for me.

I&apos;ve tried probably half of the menu, so here are my thoughts. 

The noodles:
-Terakawa ramen 5/5 (get the wavy noodles!)
-Miso ramen 5/5
-Shoyu ramen 5/5
-Mayu ramen 4/5
-Tan Tan ramen 4/5. Broth is too salty
-Pork udon 4/5. Light broth and udon perfectly cooked. The spinach doesn&apos;t add much though
-Spicy ramen 5/5

Appetizers:
-Pork buns 5/5 (the crispy ones aren&apos;t as good, and chicken is too hard )
-Seaweed salad is standard 4/5
-Takoyaki 4/5
-Karaage chicken 4/5
-Gyoza 4/5
-Shrimp shumai. Skip this. The sauce is too sweet, and the shumai itself is meh"
4,"Ordered both the Terakawa and Chicken Soyu, along with Tempura Shumai and Takoyaki. The broth and ingredients come separate to keep from overcooking the noodles which is great. Flavorful broth, and a strong showing from a well respected Ramen shop in the city. I would definitely return when I have a craving"
5,Super yummy!! Will definitely be back!! We had pork buns too but forgot to take a picture of it. Also the spicy edamame was awesome!! I will attempt to do that one at home
5,My boyfriend loves this place. I finally tried it and I&apos;m impressed. Not by the ramen tho - I love your egg rice chicken dish.
5,"This place blew me away. The food was so good. I am definitely coming back here again to try the rest of their menu.

Takoyaki - 5/5 
Potato dumplings with small bits of octopus that appear to be deep fried. It&apos;s drizzled with delicious Japanese mayo and BBQ sauce. The texture is very soft and melts in your mouth. The octopus is savory and not hard to chew at all. Since the food is very hot the bonito flakes move in a tentacle like fashion. I tricked my friend and told him that the octopus is still alive 

Chicken Buns - 5/5
The bun was hands down the softest bun I have ever had. You could tell the whole entire appetizer was fresh.  Pan seared chicken with lettuce and spicy mayo to give it a nice kick. You get the best of both worlds. The chicken is piping hot while the veggies are nice and cool. 

Terakawa - 4.5/5 
This is their signature ramen and for good reason! It&apos;s a nice creamy pork bone based soup with a lot of noodles. So good. The roast pork was incredibly tender and just disintegrates in your mouth. It comes with a boiled egg, scallion, and red ginger."
4,I stopped by this Ramen shop a couple of weeks ago and decided to get the Terakawa Ramen which is their signature Ramen dish and then for dessert I got mochi. The broth was absolutely delicious and the Ramen was delicious the pork was perfectly seasoned it melts right in your mouth. I was able to dine indoors and they made sure to socially distance everyone. They check your temperature and give you hand sanitizer before entering. I would definitely go back there again but to try their spicy Ramen this time.
5,I always stop here on the go or when looking to dine in. Food is always consistent which is important. Service is usually quick. My favorite is the spicy ramen or the signature terakawa. The broth is great and always love an extra egg in mine. Some say this is the best place for ramen in Philly and I wouldn&apos;t argue. Great experience every time.
5,"We&apos;ve been in person many times pre-COVID, but this was our first time getting delivery. It was a standout, great delivery experience! 

We were already pretty familiar with their menu, but everything for delivery on UberEats was very clearly labeled. The add-on options were numerous. The food arrived hot, and pretty quickly. It was perfectly packaged, and once it had been picked up by the driver, the restaurant even called to let us know that they&apos;d put everything into two separate bags (in case our delivery driver only gave us one). 

The appetizers were tasty. Pork buns are a classic, as is the charshu onigiri. We went out on a limb to try the croquettes and they were super tasty as well (deep fried and served with a sweet-tangy brown sauce). 

This is arguably the best ramen in Philly. Every topping was fresh, and the broth is top tier. Their noodles are very good as well, and never overcooked. The only problem we had was finding a bowl big enough for the Kyushu Danji (whopper style) ramen"
5,Went here for lunch on a Saturday afternoon and it was great. The staff was very friendly and fast and the food was perfect!
3,"It was a rainy and chilly day so I thought what a good day for a hot bowl of ramen. Last time I was here was about a year ago. I was a little excited to come back here. I got soft and crispy pork buns. I would suggest you get soft instead of crispy. I also got tarakawa ramen. Make sure you ask for seasoning. Overall, I feel like the food was a bit bland (maybe they were stress today). The pork bun were not consistent. I feel like sometimes the cucumber was a bit powerful. I couldn&apos;t taste much of the flavor pork. For the ramen, the broth was okay, but the pork was tender. I would not suggest you to get tarakawa ramen. Get spicy ramen if you want more flavors. 

Even though we ate inside, I felt safe. The servers made sure everything was clean. And they were really nice and helpful."
5,"Yes. Yes, just so much yes. In our darkest hours, what we need to get us through is savory, spicy, slurpy noodle-y ramen. 

When I was working in Old City, we&apos;d often find ourselves at lunch walking, biking or taking the el up to grab Terakawa because nothing could compare. Or hiking it up after work, rain or shine, freezing or still a sunny 90 degrees at dinner time, for a bowl of ramen and steamed buns. Great service, good people, excellent flavors, quality ingredients - and all just done as &quot;right&quot; as it can be.

Seeing they are open for business now, and that they are doing takeout well (ramen takeout done well is the holy grail!) I am ready to make some Terakawa happen the next time I can swing by Chinatown."
3,"We came here last Thursday, right as they opened and I have to say that I&apos;m quite impressed with their COVID measures. We had to wait outside to call in and &quot;reserve&quot; a spot and once we were inside, we had to fill out a contact tracing form and they immediately removed the pens we used and sanitized them. We had our temperature taken and were told to use hand sanitizer after.

The waitress was rather abrupt and straight to the point, in fact I&apos;m pretty sure she spent less than 20 total seconds interacting with us. I understand that COVID is a current issue but she couldn&apos;t seem less than bothered to sound polite, even though we were the only patrons there. 

The food came within 3 minutes of us ordering and I want to say it&apos;s because we came right as they opened, so they had all of the ingredients prepared already.
Pros: the pork was perfect, as tender and flavorful as expected.
Cons: the broth was way too salty to the point where it was overpowering and a lot of the noodles were clumped together, not sure why.

I applaud them on their COVID precautions but I was pretty underwhelmed."
5,"I absolutely love this ramen. Indoor dining, especially at night may be a wait. Takeout might be more preferable! I always order the Terakawa (signature) ramen while my boyfriend orders the Mayu (with the black garlic). The broth is always super flavorful, the pork is very tender. Its always such a treat to eat, especially in the winter. I&apos;ve also tried their chicken kaarage and takoyaki - both are worth a try too! They have a mini chicken kaarage rice bowl for $3 - how can you beat that price?"
5,"For a long time I had the craving for some ramen.  When I was in Philly for a doctor&apos;s appointment, I found Terakawa Ramen on Yelp and decided to go.  I am glad that I did. 

Although they are located in Chinatown, I don&apos;t think I would have found them just by walking around.  They are a little on the edge of the neighborhood.  So, don&apos;t view that as a deterrence.

I ordered their signature ramen dish, and I was able to go there just on my own.  I sat at their &quot;bar.&quot;  It was something that I don&apos;t think I would have been able to cook on my own, and the prices here were low.

The service was very quick and attentive.  They knew what they were doing.  Everyone seemed to work together.  They were also great at suggesting items to service.   When I finished most of my dish, but I still had broth leftover, they recommended that I order a side of noodles to finish it up with.

I will definitely go again the next time I&apos;m in Philly."
