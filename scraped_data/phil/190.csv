5,Did take out during the middle of the winter storm. Fast service and the staff was so kind. Sandwiches were delicious. Will be back next time I&apos;m in Philly
5,"We were craving sandwiches during the quarantine and wanted to find a different deli than the one next door. We yelped and found this deli a few blocks away. I really wanted a panini and after looking at yelp reviews got the Taylor Chicken Panini and my bf got the Grilled Chicken Club. Both were delicious and STACKED. They dont skimp you on the sandwich. The panini had grilled chicken with avocado, chipotle mayo, and tomato and bacon. Their bacon is soo good -- like perfectly crispy. Will def be back here again and again. They have a huge variety on their menu and they also alter sandwiches to your liking."
5,Love the La Colombe cold brew and the hot sandwiches. Their staff is always very friendly and smiling underneath their masks. A favorite of ours in the spring garden neighborhood
5,"I had a true &quot;Holy s*it&quot; moment here. 

As in, &quot;Holy s*it! I didn&apos;t expect it to be this good!&quot; 

So I drive around the city just to see what I can find. I see this come up on Yelp as I was in the area. 

I wanted to see if this truly lived up to the hype. 

Gang, the hype is real! 

This Christie&apos;s Breakfast sandwich had the perfect balance of texture, flavor, and just general heartiness to it! 

Who knew pork roll and hash browns belonged together on a croissant anyway? People from Jersey would call that a crime. They&apos;d be wrong. 

Judging by the steady stream coming in late on a Friday morning and how busy the staff was, I&apos;m thinking this place ain&apos;t a secret to many who go about their day in this neighborhood. 

It shouldn&apos;t be."
5,"I came in and stopped by Christie&apos;s deli because the store is close by my place. The owner was very friendly, chatty, and very welcoming. It felt like chit chatting with an old friend who has known for years. 
The owner herself recommended me to give a try of breakfast sandwich special named Christie&apos;s breakfast. Did I like it? Ohh I really loved it and the price was super affordable that can&apos;t beat this anywhere else! The quality of the food has always been above and beyond!! As always brings happiness to each bite. 
This to-go deli will be my forever sandwich shop and I won&apos;t go to another deli. If you have a chance to stop by this deli, I would highly recommend it because you won&apos;t regret it!!"
4,"I got Christie&apos;s Breakfast sandwich with a hash brown delivered.  Besides me almost having a panic attack when they dropped off my food at the wrong front step without talking to me, delivery was smooth and timely.  I got a text when it arrived, would&apos;ve preferred a call, and was able to find it quickly.  The sandwich was A1.  The hash brown was a little crunchy and dry but overall the meal was delicious.  I&apos;d definitely get it again.  Overall, solid experience."
5,Happy to add another 5-star review to Christie&apos;s Deli. This place is a delight - excellent food and personable customer service. Make it a morning routine and it will be the best decision you made.
5,I ordered the grilled chicken Caesar salad wrap today for lunch. It was delivered within 20 minutes. Super delicious. Perfect amount of dressing ratio. Great size. Will definitely be ordering again soon!
5,"Christie&apos;s really is a gem.  They have an amazing selection of pocky and other snacks in general as well as different drinks to go, smoothies, and of course, their deli sandwiches!  They use Boar&apos;s head brand deli meat, so if you&apos;re not a fan then this place wouldn&apos;t be for you at all.  The deli meat is packed super generously in their sandwiches - when I was there I got a bold jerk chicken panini from their spicy menu.  Wasn&apos;t exactly spicy but also I have a super high tolerance for spice.  My partner got one of the ruebens.  We both enjoyed our sandwiches immensely, the bread was toasted to absolute perfection!  

We also got two smoothies, I got a watermelon, mango, pineapple smoothie and he got a blueberry banana.  Both were super refreshing and the fruit in it tasted super fresh too.  The weather was beautiful so we took a quick walk to Matthias Baldwin Park which is basically right next door and ate our sandwiches outside and had a perfect picnic.  There&apos;s a bit of seating inside, but honestly if it&apos;s nice out I recommend taking your goods to go.  The service is super friendly and pretty quick.

I&apos;m so, so excited to have this nearby me and would definitely stop in for a quick brunch / lunch or just snacks.  I definitely would try out the other sandwiches on the menu as well - there are so many! This place has something for everyone."
5,"I really wanted a wrap for lunch and came across this place on yelp. It&apos;s a small little deli right on spring garden. The menu is huge! They&apos;re so many options which is great if you&apos;re dealing with picky people. 

I got the chicken Caesar wrap and of course I forgot to take a picture. It was very good! Decent size wrap - they have a choice of white, wheat, spinach or tomato basil. I chose the spinach wrap and was pleasantly surprised. 

I&apos;ll be back to try more sandwiches!"
5,Stayed in the area while visiting philly. Wow this place has great breakfast sandwiches and coffee is A1. Ended up getting the Mikes Sandwich which was great. Easygoing place and a very quick system they have for ice coffees. If you need something quick and to-go this is a great choice for a easy 5 star breakfast sandwich. Can&apos;t go wrong here
5,"We&apos;ve been frequenting Christie&apos;s for about a year and a half now, and it&apos;s been perfect every single time. The sandwiches are great -- perfectly proportioned meat, etc and Christie herself is the sweetest lady. Go support her and get a great sandwich in return!"
5,"This is my first ever Yelp review and I&apos;m leaving it because that&apos;s just how much I love Christie&apos;s!!! Best breakfast sandwich in the city (Mike&apos;s Special), great customer service, I want to try their lunch food but can&apos;t stop eating the breakfast sandwich - maybe some day. Strongly recommend!!"
5,The paninis an hero&apos;s are perfectly made with proper meat/cheese/condiment ratios. Christie&apos;s has the ratios on point. They are sandwhich scientists. Today i ordered the cajun turkey panini that paired ridiculously well with honey Dijon kettle chips
5,"I always have a great experience here. Not only is the food great here, the service is really what makes me return. Everyone who works there is extremely positive, energetic, and thankful every time anyone comes in. They package the food well, great portions, fresh ingredients."
5,"Their sandwiches are fantastic here. Received excellent service, the staff was friendly. They are very quick there. Their Italian hoagie had so much flavor! We also ordered dill pickle on the side, which was the perfect addition to our order. I wish they sold a jars of their pickles, they are so tasty! Only sad thing is that they are closed on Sundays, but don&apos;t let that hold you back! Can&apos;t recommend this place enough."
5,"Super Hungry on my way to work this morning when I saw this hidden gem. It smelled amazing from the side walk . 

I order the &quot;Christie&quot; Breakfast Sandwich, a Bacon, Eggs, &amp; Cheese with a Hashbrown on a Croissant. I know Right?! So it&apos;s super affordable less than 5$. 

The inside has sitting so I sat and ate my sandwich hot and fresh and it was Phenomenal. It&apos;s my new favorite sandwich and I&apos;m sad I don&apos;t live close enough to go all the time!"
5,"If you&apos;re hosting a lunch and learn in or around center city this is a great place. 
Fast service and great food"
5,"Our turkey panini with avocado, onion, and spinach (on the spicy menu though not spicy) was delicious! The total antidote to a freezing 10-degree day before visiting the Barnes Foundation. 

Also, the owner and cook is so sweet and easygoing. A great small business to support.

5 stars!!!!!"
5,"The sandwiches and the wraps are sooo yummy. You can tell a lot of regulars go here, the prices are great specially for Philly. It&apos;s a little hole in the wall but a total gem and I&apos;ll definitely be back!"
