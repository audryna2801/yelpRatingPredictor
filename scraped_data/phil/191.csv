5,"A friend and I whom have known each other for 6 years (but haven&apos;t seen each other in 5 of them) were able to meet up in Philly and run around for a night. 

He (Julian, as it were) stumbled upon this place while maneuvering through a kitchen and beyond a door in the back that leads to The Ranstead Room [Insert compellingly provocative and suspenseful key]. 

Fast forward 200 years and we enter through the front door this time. LMJTY (I&apos;ll explain this later), place. was. packed. 

Threw GaryBusey.ftw&apos;s ESA card on top of the stack of cards presented for ID - the creative points enabled us to get two reserved seats at lucrative corner seats of the bar. 
{*side note - when swinging outside your proverbial (&amp; literal) financial/status-oriented fence, BE CREATIVE*}

Anywho, back to the cocktails, SUPERB; I was like, &quot;Damnnnnn, Gina,&quot; how they gonna hit all the keys (i.e. presentation, aroma, texture, palette progression and finish) to compose the right notes (i.e. a little known blissfully slice of flavor akin to Heaven) - apologies for the masterful run-on. 

Sidebar: a lonely woman next to us was lonely (and somewhat sad), so we struck up a convo and now Julian has dinner plans tonight. We will leave her confidential to protect the innocent. 

Sidebar II: The mixologist (do a quick Google search to review delineation between bartender and mixologist) was offering up recommendations in the &quot;Gayborhood&quot; because it had more amazing vegetarian options to offer. However, the look on this dude&apos;s face, after 3 or 4 mood-based drink requirements, was like watching somewhat of a soulful connection being made. The drink. The recommendation leading to that drink. The unbeknownst cosmic association that was created based upon serendipitous events happening in his life. 

I digress. This place was dope and I simply recommend it."
4,"Love this hidden bar. Really cute date night spot. It&apos;s definitely not recommended for groups larger than 6 people since the space is limited. 
The drinks are little pricey but very unique."
4,"Was looking for nice little hidden gem with a speakeasy vibe, and Ranstead was perfect. customer service could of been a little better but maybe it wasn&apos;t her night... nevertheless the bartender was so nice with her mixology skills! so my two drinks were delicious... don&apos;t come hungry, but they do have a small bar menu you can pick some treats from. I&apos;ll definitely be back!"
5,"Love this spot! Definitely one of my favorite places in the city. I always take out-of-towners here. A real speakeasy with great custom cocktails. Their Cocktail menu changes regularly and the bartenders can make you anything you want.

They have a small food menu (appetizers) which runs out of the same kitchen as the Mexican restaurant behind it, El Rey. The food is very good but we usually go just for cocktails. 

There&apos;s usually a wait to get in but it&apos;s worth it."
3,"Hard to get in, 2 hour wait first try, got in 2nd day right at 6pm, place was full by 6:15pm
Nice setup, had 2 good drinks but the rest were just ok. 
Service was disappointing, not going back"
5,"I love coming here for dates. You will never have to worry that your drink will go wrong. If you love creative unusual drinks and trying new bitters and flavor combos, while impressing your date go here! 
It&apos;s a super cozy place"
5,"The Ranstead Room is frequently listed as one of the top bars in Philly.  It deserves this status. First of all, it has the feeling and atmosphere of a speakeasy.  Hidden away behind a non-descript door on a tiny Center City back alley, you just have to know it&apos;s there. You would never walk by it otherwise and there are no signs identifying it.  Inside is dim lighting and sexy.  Sit in a booth or sit at the bar.  Service is formal but not pretentious at all. Order one of their specialty cocktails or perhaps one of your favorites.  I did the latter and as it was a warm late-summer evening I opted for a &quot;Hugo.&quot;  This Triveneto (Austro-Italian) cocktail is a favorite of the cognoscenti - but I happen to know and drink it anyway.  And I chose their tasty Diabolo Huevos to accompany my &apos;Hugo.&apos; Life in the Ranstead Room speakeasy was totally cool in Philly that summer evening."
4,The Ranstead Room is a nice little speakeasy just off a main road in an alleyway. The drinks are yummy and will cost you ~$14 each. The bartender was nice and the dimly lit red atmosphere makes for a relaxing night for a couple glasses of your favorite poisons. I like how it wasn&apos;t too loud inside too so you don&apos;t have to have yelling conversations. This is a great secret drinking establishment and hopefully you don&apos;t need to wait too long for a table!
4,So dark inside. Love the entrance. Very speakeasy. So dark inside. So dark. Drinks are expensive. Popcorn is even more expensive. Food is expensive. Tastes great. But expensive. Drinks are strong. But expensive. Great for dates. If he&apos;s paying.
5,"The Ranstead Room is the perfect backdrop for a fun but laid back night out in Center City. We arrived at 8:30 on a weekday night and there was still a wait to get in. Our estimated wait time was 20 minutes but we ended up getting called only 10 minutes later. 

The bartender who served us was very attentive and exhibited very professional customer service, despite the bar being flooded with patrons. We enjoyed our seasonal cocktails as well as a delightful bowl of butter popcorn. The bar stools are padded and very comfortable. I can&apos;t imagine a better way to unwind after a busy workday than at The Ranstead Room!"
5,"Did I delete an ancient review? How is it possible that I haven&apos;t written a love letter to Ranstead Room before now?
It&apos;s such a unique little space. It&apos;s dark. It&apos;s got velvet wallpaper and retro art. The candle lit ambience, the ban on cell phones being out at full brightness if they have to be out at all (hint: put it away!) There&apos;s nothing not to love here except that some nights you just might not make it in if you don&apos;t arrive early or aren&apos;t willing to wait nearby for space to open up. If you&apos;re deadset on visiting get here right after they open and do pre-dinner cocktails (or eat and drink at El Rey on Chestnut and ask your server if there&apos;s any tables available in the Ranstead Room. You&apos;ll be escorted through their kitchens via an underground access to the tiny vestibule of the bar and have a very Prohibition moment.)

At Ranstead I almost always end up starting out with Bartender&apos;s Choice... and specifically asking for  Water Lily. 
Next drink though I always let them surprise me, and have discovered some great cocktails I like that I&apos;ve never had before. Service here is always attentive and they keep you pretty well stocked in water (always smart with strong drinks...) It still remains one of my favorite places over the years!"
4,"This is a wonderful establishment if you&apos;re looking for an intimate place for a date or for drinks with a small group of friends. The main room is dimly lit and it gives off the &quot;traditional&quot; speakeasy vibe. The cocktails are tasty and you can watch as the bartender puts time and effort into crafting a quality mixed drink. All the employees - from the greeter in entryway off the street to the bartender serving drinks - take their jobs seriously and try to make your experience as good as possible. We arrived around 9:00pm on a Wednesday and were seated immediately.

The only &quot;negative&quot; thing I&apos;ll say is that this place is probably better for a couple of drinks to start the night or as a place to grab a drink after dinner or a date. With $14 cocktails, the bill can run up fairly quickly. And while the drinks were wonderful, I personally don&apos;t think I could justify spending my entire night out drinking here. But again, if you&apos;re looking for a place to start your night or end your night, this is hands down a place you should consider."
5,"Beautiful ambience - dark and sexy! Lots of wall portraits of nude women and black/red upholstery gives this place a very vintage vibe! 

The bartender is amazing! She was single handedly taking orders and creating drinks for everyone at the bar and while she was super busy and continuously at work, she never looked irritated and was really pleasant while interacting with us! 

They have a great drinks menu and also have a bunch of food items which you hardly find in a speakeasy. I asked her if they had any spicy drink, she said she&apos;d make one for me and got me a Spicy Dead Lady which was amazing!! I had two of those and switched to An Evening with Aphordite for my third one which was great as well. 

I loved the spicy drink so much that next time I am just going to order it without even looking at the menu :) Unfortunately the kitchen had closed when I went there but would definitely love to try the food next time."
5,"Vintage portraits of naked women, dark red velvet booths, and dim lighting? YES PLEASE. The speakeasy vibes just billow up from this place and won&apos;t relent. 

It is quite literally, hard to find. Perhaps, that had more to do with me being new to navigating the streets of Philadelphia, but I kept passing the ally. Once we located it, my buddy and I knew we were done for!

Be warned there will probably be a wait if you arrive anytime after 6pm and the cocktails cost a pretty penny. Just keep in mind you&apos;re paying for a unique experience and baller cocktails!

We didn&apos;t enjoy food this particular night, just drinks... and I am glad we did. Spice Up Your Life was great. Anytime rye whiskey and mezcal are cocktail companions, I have to give it a try. What I could&apos;ve say there and drank all night, though, was the Eastside. It was gin based and so bright with cucumber, lime, mint, and a little bit of simple. It was freaking delicious. If an Eastside sound remotely like something you&apos;d enjoy, just dive right in. Delicious cocktail. 

Next time I&apos;m in Phili, I will definitely be back!"
4,"The last of the Starr stops, rounding out at 10. I have an appreciation for the details that go into each vision. The brass clothes hooks and curtains to cover the liquor are great. The drinks again are delicious and strong. The art work is tasteful. We ordered the dessert sampler, I thought the churros were the best bite."
3,"The Ranstead room has a nice vibe for a late night cocktail. It&apos;s dimly lit and the only light source are candles. The walls are black and red velvet with paintings hung up on the walls. A beautiful chandelier hangs from the ceiling.

The cocktail menu is extensive and they have great signature cocktails. I got the thank you, next but was disappointed for paying $14. The drink had an ice cube as big as an iceberg and I felt kind of ripped off. It also took 15 minutes to get the drink and the place wasn&apos;t that busy. However, the server was very polite.

Recommend this place if you&apos;re on a date, or looking for somewhere to get one round before going somewhere else."
5,"I came here with a local friend one night after a work event. I wasn&apos;t sure about the location in the beginning, but before we knew it, we had come across the alley into which The Ranstead Room is tucked away.

When you step through the red door (isn&apos;t it always a red door??), you are greeted by a dark anteroom and then led into the main bar area. This place is less overdone than some speakeasies I&apos;ve been to. 

Now for the good part. All the drinks are named after 90s cartoons! &quot;Pinky &amp; the Drank&quot; and &quot;Courage the Cowardly Cocktail&quot; were two of my favorites. The cocktail menu is generally arranged from sweet &amp; light to dry &amp; strong, which was a helpful guide as the unique flavor combinations don&apos;t always make it obvious where to start. I told our server that I am working on getting into bourbon drinks and was open to try something different, so she pointed me to Courage the Cowardly Cocktail, which was imminently drinkable. Bourbon-based and with just enough maraschino for a hint of color, it was not overpowering at all and I really enjoyed it.

I had to get Pinky &amp; the Drank because...I mean, it&apos;s called Pinky &amp; the Drank...and was surprised to also thoroughly enjoy this cognac-based cocktail. We ordered some popcorn to snack on since this was a post-dinner drink stop.

The bartender was hilarious and helpful, and if I actually lived in Philly, this would definitely be one of my more regular stops. Great choice!"
5,"Want a lowkey spot with great cocktails and dope ambiance? This is the place. Down a little alley with dark moody lighting, it&apos;s a great place to go with no more than 2 people. It&apos;s one of my favorite places to go to grab a drink if I&apos;m getting to know someone. You could also take your side piece here, it&apos;s that lowkey. Never ate here but I can imagine the food being good."
3,"This place was cool. We got right in after dinner at El Ray. They took us through the kitchen and down into the cellar, through a basement to get to a back door entrance. It was good, I liked that they had non alcoholic drink options. My boyfriend liked his drink. If you liked it here though, you will LOVE hop sing laundromat."
5,"Ranstead Room is a great spot for when you want to pretend you are a sophisticated and sexy woman-about-town who knows how to get places without relying on Uber and Google Maps. Your cover will be blown when you get lost trying to find the entrance to Ranstead Room, as it&apos;s an unmarked door in a dark alley that you&apos;ve never walked down before, and you are terrified. 

Fortunately once you enter the bar, it&apos;s so dimly lit that no one will be able to tell you were profusely sweat-panicking just a few minutes before. Actually, it&apos;s so dark in there that this is an excellent choice if you are breaking out, having a bad hair day, or &quot;look tired.&quot; I suspect it&apos;s a popular Hinge date destination for similar reasons. 

The decor is what you&apos;d expect for a speakeasy, complete with tasteful, vintage paintings of scantily clad women. This is a great opportunity to find out what kind of person you&apos;re on a date with. For example, if you comment on the paintings and they respond with, &quot;Oh, so you like nudes, eh?&quot; it&apos;s probably a good indicator that the evening is not going to go well.

Cue the cocktails. If you&apos;re a vodka drinker and have a sweet tooth, the Coco Chanel is what you&apos;re ordering.  Coconut milk, ginger, lime, and vodka- so refreshing, it&apos;s almost as if you&apos;re sipping this drink on a beach in sunny Mexico instead of listening to your date pretend their French-Canadian accent is thicker than it probably is. If you&apos;re in the mood for a &quot;healthy&quot; cocktail, order the &quot;What&apos;s Up Doc?&quot;- lots of tequila with a splash of carrot juice, lemon, and honey.  

Ranstead Room is one to check out if you&apos;re into killer cocktails, speakeasy vibes, ... and nudes. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
