5,"This is place is doing amazing food that happens to be Indonesian. It&apos;s the real deal. 

I figured I wouldn&apos;t be writing many reviews during the pandemic. But I had to write this one because this place blew me away. I&apos;ve done about six different takeout dinners from fine dining spots in Center City. And Sky Cafe was my favorite above all of them. 

To start I ordered the Chicken Satay. The chicken is very tender on the bite and chunks off as you bite it very nicely. The flavor is smoky and savory with a little sweetness. The peanut sauce alongside is the right lightness balanced with the natural fat of the peanuts. 

The beef rendang entree was excellent. The beef was extremely tender. The spice blend was aromatic, densely flavored, and just spicy enough. The pickled vegetables were robust on the bite, but still tender. Almost like meat."
5,Many of my friends love eating at Sky Cafe so I had to try it! Due to covid there was no dining in so I placed a takeout order. There was a bit of a wait but it was definitely worth it! I would recommend calling it in 20-30 minutes before you arrive. Everything was made fresh and tasted so good. Amazing Indonesian food! I couldn&apos;t wait until I got back home to eat because it smelled so good! My boyfriend and I polished everything up in the car. We&apos;re definitely coming back!!
5,"They take credit card and have outdoor seating. Great spot, most items are $8-$9. Mie Komplit is bangin&apos;. Also, all of their juices are fresh and taste delicious. Huge fan and will be back."
5,"I came here with a friend because she had been here many times. It was my first time coming here and first time eating Malaysian food. I was extremely excited by all of the images on their menu. Everything smelled and looked appetizing. 
Our waiter was extremely patient and helped me through the menu. I got the spare ribs and my friend got curry noodles. Our food took almost an hour to come out. It was a Saturday morning and slightly raining. We were seated outside, slightly chilly, waiting for our food. When we asked why it was taking long, they replied with &quot;there are many to-go orders&quot; I did not know how to take this information. I was not extremely hungry at the time so I could wait, but it was inconvenient. 
Our food came out and we were not disappointed. The ribs were delicious. They were slightly sweet, which I enjoy, but other people may not enjoy sweeter food. I left with a happy tummy despite waiting for long for food."
4,"I&apos;ve ordered 4 foods, 2 in dining and 2 take out. I feel that it&apos;s better to eat dine in as the food seem to be better and portion is more. Out of the 4 options, I highly recommend the iga bakar or grilled beef ribs. It&apos;s tender and nicely charred, portion is good and comes with a side of oxtail soup. The mie komplit is good and one of the customers favs but not comparable to iga bakar.

I had Nasi ayam sambal hijau to go but unfortunately, the sambal was not enough for me. Probably would be more if I dine in. Nasi bungkus was not bad.

All in all, good positive experience and I would come back especially for the beef ribs."
5,"This is my first experience with Indonesian food, but it surely won&apos;t be my last! Man, Sky Cafe serves such delicious food for really reasonable prices. I&apos;m truly wowed at the quality of my experience here. Here are some of things I ordered:

Gado Gado: a delicious and warm peanut dressing salad filled with egg, tofu, tempeh, and shrimp chips. It&apos;s a honestly a MUST

Mie Komplit: a homey and chicken-y noodle soup that had so many goodies in it! The true star were the noodles though. So springy and yummy! 

Nasi Bungkus: wrapped in a banana leaf, this dish had so many goodies (potato, beef rendang, jackfruit, collard greens, and egg). What stunned me the most was the jackfruit which was so tender and sort of has the texture of pork. WOW.

Es Teler: a sweet ice dessert with a variety of fruits and avocado (which weirdly worked with the dessert). I was surprised at how addicting this was.

Overall, this was some great food! Every dish had a complex mix of different ingredients so I never got bored. And guess what, I paid only $40 (including tax and tip) for ALL this food. I will FOR SURE be back for more!"
5,"A killer combo of affordable + balanced + savory food. I got the mie komplit, kwetiaw goreng, and gado gado and I can&apos;t get over how cheap but filling it was! Highlights for me included the peanut sauce in the gado gado (yummy!), and the variety of ingredients and flavors in the noodle dishes. They definitely do not skimp on the food quality. I&apos;m amazed that it was as cheap as it was and honestly cannot think of another restaurant in Philadelphia that does food so well for so cheap. I will definitely be back."
4,"Came during covid, so had to get carryout. Ordered the satay pork and nasi campur medan. Both items traveled pretty well, and the grilled pork was awesome. The peanut dipping sauce was also incredible and I ended up using it with with my entree. It&apos;s essentially a little sampler platter of meats: pork sausage, bbq pork, soy egg, and a clear broth. I subbed in coconut rice which had a great ginger/coconut flavor; definitely better than plain rice. The portions aren&apos;t supersized like Chinese places, so you just have to order more food."
4,"@Nommingnomad Approved!

I was in the mood for some flavorful Indonesian food and I had been wanting to try Sky Caf√© for a while now so I stopped in for an early dinner at around 6:00pm. I was seated within a couple of minutes and handed an elaborate menu. I knew that I wanted the Gado Gado salad even before looking at the menu. 

So, I placed my order and continued to watch the episode of Kitchen Nightmares that was playing on the screen. I found it pretty amusing that they chose that show to play at a restaurant. 

The food came out pretty fast and the gado-gado was drenched in peanut sauce and I loved it. The flavors all worked well together with the fried tempeh and tofu and lettuce with the eggs and the crispies. I polished off my plate and got ready to pay but found out that they have a $15 minimum for credit cards. So, heads up to anyone going there for a light meal, bring cash. They do have an ATM inside. 

All in all, I liked the food and the service was fine. I&apos;d definitely go back to try more of their numerous options."
5,"Wow I&apos;m not sure why it took me so long to get here, but I can assure you that it won&apos;t be too long until I return. I&apos;ve been too distracted by nam phuong and le viet and that Asian grocery store to pop in here. It&apos;s byo and can accommodate a decent crowd. We had a large group they sat in the back. We came early though; I&apos;m sure it would be really difficult to have a large party later in the evening. 

We started with skewers, which were amazing and the gado-gado, which is this tofu dish with other veggies in a peanut sauce and edible shell. So worth it, even though it looks slightly unappetizing. We then ordered by number, and all our dishes came out at the same time. I got the seafood fried rice, which had slices of fish cake in it. I didn&apos;t expect to eat the whole thing, but I couldn&apos;t help myself. Can&apos;t wait to go back ASAP!"
5,"This spot is great, authentic Indonesian food served in generous portions for a great price. If you don&apos;t know what to get I would order off the first page of the menu as every option there is good."
2,"I came here for the first time after they renovated the restaurant. The entrance is right outside the mall. The seatings are congested as before. More seatings at the back of the restaurant. There are flat screens TV but I miss the wayang kulit aka shadow puppet picture.

The staff is completely different than before, very much younger. I called for my favorite fried kwetiaw and was told it took 20-30 minutes. The restaurant wasn&apos;t crowded when I arrived. I was surprised by the waiting time. In the past after I put my order in I went to the supermarket briefly and when I returned the food was ready. This time I waited a while and after about 20 minutes I asked whether it would be a while to get the food. The girl said that she already told me the time, she said that in an unfriendly and annoyed way. Too add to my disappointment to the service, the kwetiaw was bland. Not as delicious as before. It&apos;s missing the sweet Chinese sausage."
5,"If you ask me where to get authentic Indonesian food in Philadelphia, I would say Sky Cafe. Friendly staff and owner, excellent food with affordable price. 
A must try is everything on the menu (guilty as charge, yes I tried everything on the menu, not all at once tho)."
5,"Sky cafe exemplifies the hole in the wall restaurant with amazing food. It&apos;s located in an Asian mall on Washington with its entrance inside another entrance. We came around 6 on a weekday and it was moderately busy, and clearly a lot of regulars. We only tried a few things on the menu but I loved everything. 

Nasi Padang- a collection of small side dishes like spicy shrimp, chicken, beef, greens, potato patties and chiles. I&apos;ve had this before but thought the beef rendang here was especially good- the beef was amazingly tender and flavorful. It&apos;s also just a fun way to try an assortment of dishes. 

Soto betawi- delicious coconut milk based curry with beef and tripe! Again, the meat was extremely well prepared. It&apos;s not spicy in itself but comes with spicy sauces you can add. 

Ikan Bawal Bakar- I think this was an off menu fish special of the day. Not sure exactly what fish it was but it was basically an entire grilled fish. Simple flavors but really highlighted the fish. Would definitely recommend if you don&apos;t mind eating bone in fish. 

For 3 people, this was more than enough food and the bill came to under $50. Definitely a highlight of the southeast Asian food options in philly!"
5,"Located in dingy Asian Food &amp; Retail plaza ... this is a great takeout spot.

First time trying Indonesian food. VERY good. Very flavorful.

Beef Rendang ( the chili egg amazing) , chicken satay &amp; Curry Noodles all were very good for the price .

I can taste why Yelpers like this place.

** They actually know how to package Takeout properly !"
5,"Delicious. Almost anything on the menu looks amazing, with heavy sauces, noodles, seafood, beef, chicken bringing it all together. The appetizers were crunchy and tasted light, while the main dishes came out with dipping sauces and seasonings to flavor to your tastes. My main favorite was the beef Rendang and the shrimp, but you&apos;re able to mix and match all of these and try combos of all the best stuff! We only waited for 15 minutes for a table on a busy Saturday, as they are pros at keeping all the tables moving and clean. There&apos;s a grocery store nearby to waste some time if you&apos;re waiting, but otherwise, this place is worth every minute!"
5,"If you can pry away from Pho 75, tucked away in the Wing Phat Plaza is Sky Cafe. It&apos;s still somewhat of a hidden gem (maybe for some groups since this place is also bustling with Indonesian people) that serves some delicious and well priced Indonesian food. The space is pretty large and service moves quickly so you don&apos;t have to wait too long for a table. The menu is extensive with more options than you can wrap your head around. I tackle it by at least deciding on a category (platter, noodles, chicken,) and then take it from there. You will not choose a wrong or bad dish here. Everything is cooked, seasoned, and prepared with great care. I am a huge Indonesian cuisine because you can such variety in texture and flavors in one bowl/plate.

I&apos;m happy that I finally tried Sky Cafe because it quickly planted itself on my go-to list."
4,"I took my boyfriend&apos;s advice for once and ordered the first thing on the menu (he believes that&apos;s typically the best item they offer), and it did not disappoint. The egg noodles in the mie komplit were perfect cooked and tender, and whatever sauce they use was super flavorful and delicious. 
I didn&apos;t really understand what to do with the soup/broth that came on the side, but the waitress told me she typically leaves it separate and uses it for dipping/sipping. We also ordered an order of the lamb skewers which were equally as yummy and tender! Definitely recommend this place. A hole in the wall with affordable food but very clean and fairly spacious as well."
4,"My girlfriend&apos;s cousin introduced us to their go to place for good curry. This was an Indonesian restaurant which served the typical beef rendang and other curry pots. The chicken satay was really good. I loved the peanut sauce of the Gao Dao (tofu). Food was really cheap with the amount of food you are ordering. If you are into a quick Asian cuisine lunch and also stopping to get some groceries (which is beside the store), then this is the best place for you. We went here around Sunday  4pm and parking was already difficult. Restrooms are clean and the staff knew the menu very well and appreciated if you have any food allergies especially that most of their food is riddled with peanuts. I would come back to this place again."
5,"The food and service at this restaurant is really good and its not expensive. As soon as we walked in the staff were nothing short of friendly, always smiling and helpful.
As a picky eater I had a few doubts about the foods, but there&apos;s something for everything, and the food was so nicely laid out. We really enjoyed coming here. The price was very reasonable and foods came out impressive. Will definitely eat here again."
