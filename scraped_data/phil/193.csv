5,"Either my tastes have changed or Smiley&apos;s has improved.  Maybe a bit of both? Regardless, Smiley&apos;s went from an option to one of my regulars over the last several months.

Getting a beef gyro is simple but delivers a wonderfully tasty lunch or dinner.  I&apos;m hooked on their tabouli salad.  I recently tried their falafel platter.  While it doesn&apos;t replace the recently closed Mama&apos;s falafel my heart and belly miss, it does well on its own right.

I&apos;ve also enjoyed a few of their real fruit smoothies.  I really love the one with honey and coconut milk, however, the name is escaping me at the moment.  Go large FTW.

They have very limited seating even prior to COVID restrictions.  I think they only have one or two tables outside, so it is more of a to-go joint.  They staff has always been friendly. Really, I can only end by saying check them out!"
5,"One of our favorite GREEK TAKEOUT.  We&apos;ve ordered here a number of times and food is consistently delicious and you get plenty. They&apos;re vegetable platters are my favorite, especially the falafels. My husband loves the meat platters. Gyros or souvlaki.  Oh and we&apos;re ordering tonight. Can&apos;t wait."
5,"Delicious! Would eat again and again. We got the falafel platter, beef gyro, grape leaves and baba ghanoush. Honestly, it was all so perfect I can&apos;t pick which was the best. It&apos;s authentic and delicious. The owner and staff are so friendly and enthusiastic which makes me want to continue coming back and placing take out orders. Highly recommend!"
5,"My wife had a bad day so I told her I&apos;d bug her dinner. She didn&apos;t want to choose so I spun the wheel and landed on Smileys. I&apos;m bored with pizza and tacos. 
This was a more than welcome change of direction. 
If you are contemplating the smoothies you gotta pull the trigger on that shit. I got one and it was awesome. 
I got the beef platter and it was awesome. The platters are a lot of food. You get the protein, rice, salad, hummus, and pita. The salad was awesome. They put hot peppers in it and the dressing has some bite too. 
I can&apos;t wait to try this place again in the NEAR future. No need to buy tzatziki sauce The platter comes with it."
5,"Absolutely love this place! When I lived on Main St, I probably ate here once every two weeks. I always get the Greek Gyro wrap, and sometimes falafels. Everything is great. 

The place is owned by a delightful family who go above and beyond to make sure you&apos;re served your meal with a smile! 

The pita is thinner than usual pita at greek restaurants. I would consider this pita to be more-so lebanese. Delicious!"
3,"Not bad. Went for pick up and it looks really cute inside.

The food was okay, but everything was more sour then I expected. Grape leaves are expected to be sour but the other flavors and included dipping was more sour then expected."
5,"Very good Mediterranean spot. Good portions, prices and service. Got the veggie platter which basically had the entire menu and was perfect portions to share (2 of us).

The baba ganoush is probably my favorite portion of the meal and version I&apos;ve had. It&apos;s smoky but not too smoky. I find sometimes it goes overboard with the smoky flavor and that wasn&apos;t here. It still had lots of flavor but good balance. 

The service was very sweet. She threw in an extra pita for us to split evenly (normally it&apos;s 3 pitas) and even made extra pineapple lemonade for us to have. 

Definitely would come back here!"
4,"Sometimes simple is delicious.

Walking down Main Street I passed by Smiley&apos;s and suddenly had a craving for a gyro. This place definitely hit the spot for me!

I ordered the chicken gyro with the tropical craze smoothie. Food was ready relatively quickly and portions were generous. The chicken was tender and paired well with the tzatziki. The smoothie was creamy and refreshing at the same time. 

Simple ingredients that pair well together combined with great customer service had me walking out - dare I say it - smiling.

Based on the many rave reviews, I look forward to trying other items off of the menu!"
5,"Very very good food. The owners are very welcoming I tried the beef shawarma and it melted in my mouth. The owner Al, made me his special smoothie which was a perfect combo for the gyro I had.  Definitely recommend."
5,Great spot for delicious fresh Mediterranean food. Loved the beef gyro. Not greasy and flavorful! Chicken platter was huge and nicely done.
5,"Was meeting a friend down the street and arrived incredibly early and with an empty stomach. 

I love a Greek salad so I decided to try Smiley&apos;s based on the reviews. Thank you, Yelpers!  You did not disappoint. 

The woman who helped was pleasant and helpful. I think she and her husband are the owners. I ordered the large Greek salad (even though my belly told me to get the small one) and a lemonade.  

The salad was phenomenal.  Whatever seasoning was sprinkled on top needs to be sold in stores (it may already be and I&apos;m late to the game). The only thing I would change is to have the option of adding some sort of protein to the salad. The lemonade tasted homemade and fresh. It was just sweet enough. 

This place is cozy but there is outdoor seating on the side street. I did not see a bathroom so can&apos;t comment on that. Parking in Manyunk is a beast so prepare yourself mentally if you&apos;re driving and download the app or bring change. You will get a ticket. 

I can&apos;t wait to come back here."
5,"Smiley&apos;s Cafe is such a gem in Manayunk! My boyfriend and I stopped by and ordered the Falafel Platter, Beef Shawarma and Pineapple Lemonade. 

I personally loved the Falafel Platter which came with 6 pieces falafel, assorted vegetables, hummus, pita and 3 grape leaf wraps. The falafel was incredibly tasty and the entire platter was generously portioned. 

My boyfriend enjoyed his beef shawarma. It was plentiful, filling and tasty. 

The pineapple lemonade was exactly what I needed on a hot summer day - refreshing, sweet and blended cold! 

The service was super nice and welcoming. This is a great local spot that&apos;s affordable and flavorful when you&apos;re craving Mediterranean. I would highly recommend!"
5,"We had such a great experience at Smiley&apos;s! The food is delicious, prices are right, and Smiley came to our table to welcome us and thank us for visiting. Would recommend this amazing little find in Manayunk to anyone! Get the Falafel Pita!"
3,"Ordered through Caviar so I can&apos;t really comment on anything other than the food. 

Veggie mix platter came with a little bit of everything. Would we order it again? Probably not. I found it to be overpriced. It pretty much was two salads stuffed into a box with little sides of hummus and Baba ghanouj. I will admit that everything tasted pretty good, I wasn&apos;t craving it the next day or anything but I was thoroughly happy while I was eating. The falafel were crispy and well put together. Not the best but not the worst. 

Gyro sandwich... half of it was ice cold while other half hot? I threw it in the fridge and heated it up the next day. I&apos;m not crazy for the Lebanese bread, it&apos;s really thin and bland. I didn&apos;t have my glasses on. I thought my napkin next to me was another slice of bread, that&apos;s how thin and flimsy it is. 

We had free delivery, so with tip and the two food orders.. everything came out to almost $40. Not worth it. I wouldn&apos;t order the veggie mix platter again. $19 is just way too much for what you actually get. 

I don&apos;t think I would order from here again."
5,"I get something here about once per week, they are always so good! I love the smoothies. I love the falafel and gyros. Excellent staff. Thanks for being a great part of our neighborhood."
5,"A friend of mine planted the idea of Mediterranean food like Leo in Inception. The parking near my house leaves so much to be desired so I&apos;ve made it a goal to try the more popular eateries in walking/delivery distance. Grubhub/Ubereats/Postmates is further limiting my options via their service and delivery fees. I get it, advancements in tech cost money but Gee Willikers Batman! 

Here is the order I placed on 10/04/19:

Beef Gyro Sandwich
Falafel Platter 
Baklava Walnut and Honey

Total Incl Delivery: $27.51 

I placed my order via Yelp  around 530pm this day and before confirming read a notification saying the restaurant was not offering delivery confirmation until 6pm. Since I&apos;m aware that (9 times out of 10) I am only superficially hungry due to frustration or bored, I was fine with that timeline. 

Around 550pm the bell rang and a very pleasant and smiling young lady handed off my food. 

Back in the beat laboratory I unpacked my meal and immediately took note of the bright colors and fresh smell. I subsequently housed (attacked) the Gyro. After recently eating at the Yiro Yiro, I didnt have the highest expectations and was all but preparing for chewy meat. To the contrary, fresh, and flavorful. The falafel was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, the sides were zesty and the bread warm and airy. It all hit the spot and lives up to the stellar reviews from the other Yelpers.

5,This is the type of small family owned business we should all get behind! Food is fresh and delicious. Nicest people alive!
5,This is my favorite spot in Manayunk! The food is so delicious and reasonably priced. The staff are super friendly and helpful. Everyone needs to try this food!
5,I absolutely LOVE this spot. The family that runs it are so lovely and they are consistently generous. Not to mention the food and smoothies are delicious!!
5,"First things first, owners are amazing. They are so friendly that it makes me want to visit smileys cafe again. Food is also delicious! Half of us barely finished our platters because they gave us so much! They give you lots of pita bread so you can dip endlessly in their delicious hummus. I also got the beef gyro which was pretty good too. Owners gave us a small cup of free watermelon slush which was perfect for that hot Sunday. Highly recommend trying it out because the food and owners will make you want to come back!  Food + customer service = outstanding"
