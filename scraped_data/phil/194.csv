5,"Can&apos;t believe I have never written a review for Mercato! I have been here only with my husband. We came here for a date night in the summer or so about 3 years ago and ended up moving to the block in 2019! We have only been here a few times since moving in so close by. It&apos;s a challenge not to let the smells bring us in.

We mostly just do takeout these days. We did eat at Mercato in July 2020 because we eloped and wanted to go out afterward. Being that we breathe the same air as the restaurant guests on a normal day anyway, we figured it was safe to eat outdoors there. We brought our own champagne. We have done takeout at least 2 times since, last night being the most recent.

I saw on Instagram (not by walking by, ironically) that they were now offering rustic sandwiches! I love me a good sandwich and the chicken cutlet caesar was speaking to me. Husband got his first vaccine dose yesterday so we decided to celebrate with takeout (Mercato is a part of all of our major pandemic life milestones I guess haha) and I got the sandwich! It was delicious. The roll was perfectly soft and crusty all at the same time. The chicken was crispy but it definitely was a cutlet vibe, not a fried chicken sandwich vibe - just what you expect from an Italian joint. Husband got his favorite: the chicken parm. It&apos;s an old favorite and Mercato&apos;s version of it never disappoints. 

We usually get the stuffed meatball appetizer but we remembered how good the ricotta toast was in the summer (I think it was a citrus version with oranges or tangerines maybe) so we ordered the fig ricotta toast as our appetizer. That ricotta toast is so amazing and really stole the show. I hope since they have had a version of it on the menu for a while that it&apos;s going to stick around and the flavor will change seasonally. It&apos;s so light and delicious.

Mercato never disappoints! Definitely would recommend.

COVID-19 PRECAUTIONS: We still aren&apos;t ready to dine out until we are both fully vaccinated and are only doing takeout but if you want to come here, the staff is wearing masks. Indoor capacity seems a little tight now that Philly increased capacity limits... There are dividers between tables but I dunno. That&apos;s a lot of people still breathing the same air since air goes anywhere it wants... Outdoors, each table has its own &quot;bubble&quot; so if you&apos;re already around the folks in your party often anyway, you&apos;ll pretty much just be breathing the same air as them and it seems a safer option. The bubble protects you from the elements and you don&apos;t come into contact with other maskless patrons (or nearby residents who might be walking through, haha) unless they somehow enter your bubble. If you do takeout and want to eat outdoors nearby but not at the restaurant, there is a little park very close by at the corner of 11th and Pine that you could try to grab a table at. I don&apos;t think they gave us any cutlery with our order so you may have to ask or BYO if you&apos;re going picnic style."
5,"We came here for an outdoor meal with COVID19 social distancing and it was great!  

First, they have a lovely outdoor setup, with part of Camac street blocked off so tables are nicely spaced for safety, and lovely heater lanterns.  It was really beautiful!

Second, the service was excellent.  Pleasant, prompt, properly masked.

But most important, the food was delicious!  We had the meatball starter.  It came with 3 very generous sized meatballs in a rich tomato gravy, with two slices of thick grilled bread - and was totally fantastic.  I could have that every day!  For entree, I had the Orecchiette with sausage and it couldn&apos;t have been better.  

One of my favorite meals - from the setting to the food!"
5,"We needed a special dinner to celebrate our anniversary and decided to order pickup from Mercato BYOB. We order the garlic bread, ricotta gnocchi and the orecchiette. It was delicious ! I can&apos;t wait for Mercato to open up again. Everyone should support and order delivery or take away!"
3,"Came here on a Friday night. Got extremely lucky they had availability as we didn&apos;t call ahead. With Covid19 they have 4 tables spaced out inside and the rest on the sidewalk and a street blocked off. They also have huge door like windows so the breeze from outside can come indoors. Dinner is by reservation with time in between to clean the tables. The menu looked interesting online, for starters I had the whipped ricotta and fig toast. The presentation of the plate was great, it initially looked like a sweet bread but one bite and savory taste was unexpected. I went back to read the description a couple times. I enjoyed the pickled grapes and would recommend it to anyone. For the main I had the bolognese which I saw other tables had and seemed to enjoy. The presentation of the plate was nice but the taste wasn&apos;t there. The bolognese tasted like it was made with water and not chicken stock. My partner tried it and felt like it tasted like Chef Boyardee which after they said that I couldn&apos;t get it out of my head. 

Service was great, attentive but not hovering. She did ask about the meal and I told her my feelings. I was offered a replacement but I wasn&apos;t hungry so I declined. I do appreciate the offer to rectify the situation."
3,"I came in here tonight after not having been for many years, but there was a time when I visited quite frequently. Of course there are outside tables set up during COVID, so that&apos;s fine, but I was immediately kind of weirded out by the waitress (hostess?) because she wasn&apos;t very friendly to me when I came up to ask if they were still serving. She kept on pointing out they were a BYOB and I was like... yes, I know, the name of your restaurant is Mercato BYOB.

It didn&apos;t help that she never really passed on the pleasantries one expects: you know, &quot;Hi, how are you tonight? My name is Whatever, I&apos;ll be your server.&quot; And then out of nowhere another guy came to my table, and he was just downright brusque. He just spewed out a list of water choices which...I don&apos;t know, but between that and the first lady, it rubbed me the wrong way enough that I literally asked if I had done something to offend them in some way.

That being said, I had hoped to have the pumpkin ravioli I used to have but they don&apos;t make it anymore. Instead I had a delicious lobster &quot;pyramid pasta&quot; (ravioli). It was divine. I also had the stuffed artichoke which was sort of just okay. Far too much bread crumb for my liking, but I did devour it anyhow. I ordered a garlic bread that was really quite bad though. To be frank, the garlic was burned and the dish was extremely bitter.

I will say that for the rest of my meal a different man was my waiter, and he was exceedingly better than the other two people I interacted with. I left him a 50% tip accordingly because honestly anything below 20 is an insult during this pandemic, and he really was extremely good at his job. (Also he noticed I didn&apos;t eat the bread and took it off my check without my requesting it, which was a correct and extremely courteous gesture. I didn&apos;t expect it, but it was the right thing to do.)

So I&apos;m not really sure what to say, because my visit was really all over the place. I&apos;ll also note that when I left I said goodbye and thank you to that first man I interacted with (fairly certain he was the manager,) and he literally didn&apos;t respond or even acknowledge my presence.

So I may get food from here again moving forward but I think probably I&apos;ll get it to go."
3,I enjoyed the heated bubble. Food was ok. It definitely was warm enough to remove your coat.
4,"The food was good and service was great!  They have outside eating and heaters to keep you warm the best they can. 
My only suggestion going forward that they have more options for dishes with people with food allergies."
4,"To call the $54 prix fixe a &quot;tasters&apos; menu&quot; is a misnomer.  Portions were full sized and generous.  First bit of advice:  arrive hungry!  We were, and still had plenty to take home.

Course one:  the table shared an antipasto of olives, artichoke hearts, peppers, squash and burrata with crusty Italian bread and an olive oil dipping sauce.  I would  have liked a little soprosata, but this wasn&apos;t presented as charcuterie and it was chef&apos;s choice.

Course two:  Choose any appetizer from the menu.  My daughter and I each had salads, but the winner was my husband&apos;s mussels.  Served in a rich and flavorful tomato sauce, the mussels were plump and delicious.  Accompanying sourdough was perfect for sopping up the sauce.

Course three: Choose any entr√©e!  Each dish hit the spot: lamb shank (the night&apos;s special), pork chop parmesan with fresh buffalo mozzarella and chicken saltimbocca with a marsala mushroom demi glaze and polenta.  (My daughter&apos;s saltimbocca may have been the least favorite -- though I thought it good!  A bit too much gravy, and the polenta needed jazzing up.)

Course four: A trio of desserts, again restaurant&apos;s choice.  Cheesecake was the bomb, tiramisu second best and cannoli -- usually my favorite -- brought up the rear.  There was too much of an anise flavor.

I really enjoyed our dining experience. Contrary to some reviews, our service was great and the staff was really nice.  As we&apos;re finding with a number of byob&apos;s in Philly, the restaurant is small and tables are pretty close to one another.  If that&apos;s how proprietors can maintain quality and cost control, who cares?! (Couldn&apos;t help but overhear the neighboring table&apos;s discussion about politics, so without hesitating I jumped in... and they welcomed me!)

As you probably already know, cash only, reservations encouraged and parking somewhat difficult.  Expect to splurge for a garage."
3,"I was so excited to check out Mercato for Restaurant Week, and it seemed like a popular restaurant because all of the reservation times were fully booked. They had a handful of outdoor seating on the sidewalk and a few indoor tables as well. All the outdoor lights gave the restaurant a very nice, romantic ambience. 

Sadly, the meal itself was extremely disappointing. We both started out with the Fontina Stuffed Meatballs, which were way too salty. The sauce tasted like it was straight out of a can, and the meatballs were a little dry. But overall, the saltiness overpowered all the flavors for me. For the entrees, we ordered the Crab Fra Diavlo and the Chicken Piccata. The squid ink bucatini in the pasta dish was pretty nicely cooked, but the overall flavors were bland. The chicken was extremely dry, though the spinach and white wine sauce made it taste a little bit better. We held out hope for our Vanilla Bean Panna Cotta and Tiramisu desserts, but those were also mediocre. I normally love all Tiramisu, but the soaked ladyfingers in this tiramisu were too soggy. Maybe we came here on an off night, and hopefully, others have a better experience here."
4,"Our party of four was seated outside with our two bottles of wine.

What we ordered:
-Risotto - delicious! Portions are big. 
-Orecchiette - delicious! Portions are big. My friend devoured it in 10 minutes 
-Chicken Parm - the portion was huge, the spaghetti was fine but I wouldn&apos;t order this dish again. unfortunately the chicken wasn&apos;t as crispy and something tasted off maybe it&apos;s the bread crumbs? 
-Mussels (is under the apps but can be an entree) I would get this dish again it&apos;s so flavorful. Mussels were on the smaller side. Dipping the sour dough bread in the sauce was everything 

Overall, would come back again and try other things on the menu!"
5,Loved all the outside seating they have.  I wish that there were more heating lamps but the tables were well spaced out. It&apos;s BYO so that&apos;s always a plus and they don&apos;t rush you.  The food was perfectly cooked and the servers were attentive.  You definitely need reservations!
4,"This place is super tiny, but the food is great. It&apos;s BYO too which is a nice plus! 

I tried the chicken Marsala over polenta. The chicken and the sauce was so flavorful, and the chicken was super tender and crispy. The polenta was quite bland for my taste, but it paired well with the stronger flavor of the sauce. 

My boyfriend tried the lobster ravioli pasta (called pyramid pasta). Although it was good, the portion was pretty tiny- I believe it was just 3 raviolis. 

We also tried the artichoke and cheese board which was good, and the pumpkin cheesecake which was AMAZING and so decadent. The pumpkin seeds on this added a nice touch.  I still crave that cheesecake, so I would definitely try it if it&apos;s still on the menu as I believe it is seasonal!!

Only reason I&apos;m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 was because the service was extremely slow. There were also several occurrences of spills by the staff that we witnessed at multiple tables, but the place was so tiny that it was almost inevitable. The couple at the table next to us had boiling hot water accidentally spilled on them by the waitress which definitely did not seem pleasant"
5,"My 2 roommates and I went here last weekend and could not have been more pleased!  The ambiance and lights at night were so cute and the food was delicious.  We all enjoyed our meals and will be back.  The meals were reasonably priced for the quality and amount.  The bill was not too expensive as it is BYOB.  All in all, between the food, atmosphere, &amp; service it is one of my favorite restaurants in philly!  We ordered the parm garlic bread to start that was a little more crispy then I like but was very tasty.  For dinner we had the shrimp garganelli, pyramid pasta, orecchiette, and mushroom risotto.  The shrimp dish was light and filling at the same time (would recommend) and the risotto was amazing very creamy and huge portions.  If you are very hungry, the pyramid pasta was not as big as other dishes.  I am making up every excuse to go back!! Perfect spot for date night, celebrations, or girls night out where you can drink as much as you want with a cute atmosphere and great service and food!"
5,"Good dining experience! The restaurant is small and packed but it somehow adds to the charm. Everything I had was excellent: mussels, fontina stuffed meatballs, short rib risotto, tiramisu, and cannoli. Not the most creative menu options but everything tasted perfect. Our waiter was very attentive and kept our glasses full despite it being restaurant week. 

Overall, good food, good service, and good ambiance. Don&apos;t forget that this restaurant is cash only!"
4,"Great BYOB restaurant in the city.  We tried it for the first time during CC restaurant week.  As I&apos;m super picky with meatballs, I was hesitant to order these as my opening course, but I&apos;m so glad that I did.  Very good, tender, great flavor and the gravy was fantastic - I wanted to dip bread in that until it was gone.  Everything that we ordered was good, but we were not a fan of the squid ink pasta dish.  There were too many ingredients competing to be the star of the show.  I would go back here.  Service was fantastic!"
4,"Had a great dinner at this BYOB restaurant with the hubby and our brother/sister in law.  It&apos;s tiny which can be a concern with our big guys.  However, we were lucky the table next to us remained empty, so we asked if we could place our bottles of wine on the table until someone was seated . Cheers!  

The service was good and prompt, always refreshing our water glasses and checking in on us.

For appetizers, we started with the P.E.I. Mussels and the Stuffed Meatballs.  Both were nice size portions and delicious.  Loved dipping the crusty bread in the juice from the Mussels.  Yum.

Our entrees were the Bolognese, Crab Squid and Pyramid Pasta. This time the portions were small for the guys, but us girls had more than enough.  No complaints from anyone on the taste.  

For dessert, the guys had strawberry cheesecake.
  
Tip: Parking can be difficult and the restaurant only takes cash."
5,"Mercato is one of my favorite italian spots in the city! Never can go wrong with a small, quaint, italian BYOB! The servers are always so friendly and accommodating and the food is consistently delicious! I highly recommend the mussels!"
5,"Ryan was fabulous last night! Our initial reservation was messed up and he was still able to sit our party of 6. Food was phenomenal, I&apos;d go back for the Whipped Ricotta &amp; Fig Toast alone! Desserts were also to die for. Can&apos;t wait to come back!"
2,"Food was great and always is. We have eaten here several times before and everything is always fantastic. We had the pyramid pasta, pork Milanese, the squid ink pasta special, and the clams bucatini. We also shared a few appetizers, the olive oil plate and the meat and cheese board.

However, the service was far from great this time. We were definitely being rushed out, and even the couple next to us felt the same way and said something to us. We felt like we didn&apos;t really have any chance to enjoy our meal and we were being rushed out for a larger party that was coming in. The waitress even spilled a glass of red wine on us because she was rushing to get the plates off our table so quickly. 

This was our birthday dinner and the night was ruined by being rushed out. Our family came in from New Jersey and this was their first time here. It definitely ruined the meal for us and will probably try somewhere else next time instead of coming back to Mercato. It&apos;s a shame because we really do enjoy the food."
4,"The food is awesome here and I love that it&apos;s BYOB. A very tight squeeze so keep that in mind. Cash only as well. 
We tried the gnocchi - delish. Broccolini for a side. Mussels as an app was also great 
I&apos;ll be back"
