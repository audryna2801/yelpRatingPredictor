5,This is the best Korean BBQ spot all the time for us!!! We are so glad they&apos;re open for dining in now! All the staffs and customers wear masks and  practice social distance while inside. Food and service still fantastic!! Upload a picture before COVID-19 happened. Only change is bottle water instead of hot tea.
5,"this spot has been a family favorite for years, and continues to not disappoint! 
they&apos;re finally open for dine in!!  

the food: so fresh quality, and i love their set menus that come with a sashimi boat, jungol stew, and meat option. the fish is always super fresh and tasty without that gross fishy aftertaste, and pairs so nicely with some soju and spicy stew!!! they also slide in steamed eggs and other things on the house here and there, so grateful 

the service: sooo kind! the lady who serves there (short bob with blonde highlights) has been there since the dawn of time and she is the friendliest server on earth! will really love upon u and ur family"
3,Updated reviews: I tried the spicy galbi but the quality is not as good as I expected. The soup was also salty.
4,"Only been here a few times even though it&apos;s close by due to the price, but the food is probably one of the best in Philadelphia. The authentic flavors are simply delicious"
3,"Had a big meal on our way back to Jersey. Service was good and the Korean food was better than most places. The neighborhood isn&apos;t great and there are better options in NJ but the food was good. We had the beef and octopus stew, marinated crab and the spicy pork stir fry. In a pinch this is a good place to stop by for some good Korean food. They also gave us a free seafood pancake as &quot;service&quot;"
4,"Met up with a small group of friends here (pre-covid of course) to have lunch. They added their twist onto the typical small appetizers (banchan) that are served before the entrees arrive. For example their potato dish was kind of sweet, which I had not encountered before - in a good way. The bibimbab was pretty standard. You could tell its been gentrified to fit the average American tastebud, but still good in its own right. Is it authentic Korean food? No, I would not say so. If that&apos;s what you&apos;re looking for go to a mom and pop place....no, really go to a mom and pop shop place. They could use your support. But if you&apos;re hankering for some basic girl-ed Korean food look no further. Trust me it&apos;s a mood."
5,Amazing more wan good experience. We went for lunch and they have an extensive menu with very reasonable prices. I got the kimchi jigae aka stew which was great but super heavy on the kimchi flavor as expected. And also got the bento box which was delicious. Plan on going back for the Korean bbq soon!
5,The food here is authentic and delicious. And lady at the front desk really is a warm person who reminds me of my grandma. She&apos;s so genuine and welcoming. Highly recommend.
3,"(3.5) Arrived in, we were greater by a lovely grandma. The place is true to the tradition of a Korean BBQ. We were served hot tea. One thing I notice when I have been trying Korean BBQ is that they rely on you to  be very self sufficient. In order to order you press a bell next to your table. For appetizers we order a tray of  assorted sushi! If we known they  given up  complementary pancakes and other traditional Korean finger foods we would not have order this. The food was overwhelming. I order the  jambong  noodle mix with seafood spicy. The food was a little above average! I was expecting  some different  authentic flavors but it was lacking."
5,Never disappointed with the service and food!! High quality meal that is very satisfying.
5,Definitely will have try them again. Everything was delicious the staff was friendly and efficient. They also serve Sushi I think I will try it the next go around. The restaurant is well established has been there at least 10 years.
4,"I always wanted to try a hibachi style restaurant where the food is cooked in front of you, therefore I was thrilled to try a similar experience at Seorabol Korean House.

At Seorabol they offer Korean Bbq and the grills are actually built inside the table so you can cook your own food, which makes for a fun dining experience.

Seorabol has an extensive menu of Korean food that consist of soups, sushi, teriyaki and plenty more. We were a large group and we decided to do Korean Bbq. We ordered spicy galbi, bulgogi and korean bacon I forgot what the actual name was. The korean Bbq comes with a bunch of sides called banchan and that consisted of stewed fish, kimchi, and other small dishes. We also had lettuce, rice and a special spicy sauce that was included with our meal. Everything was flavorful and tender. My favorite was the spicy galbi.

Overall I looked forward to coming back to Seorabol and I recommend others to try it out. The cooking experience is super awesome so bring family and friends and have a good time!"
4,"My mom and I were looking for a good korean bbq place in Philadelphia to have dinner. To my surprise, this is one of the few legit korean bbq places in the area. It&apos;s also a bit out of the way - in somewhat of a sketchy area - but the food was not bad! TBH, I think it was quite average for all the kbbqs I&apos;ve had in the my Ze

We came at around 8PM on a Wednesday and there were about 4 other parties in the restaurant. We were quickly seated. For kbbq, you&apos;re required to order 2 meats, so we went with their classic bulgogi and the pork belly. 

The place comes with a LOT of side dishes and tofu stew as well. The bulgogi was quite good and I would definitely recommend getting this. As for her pork belly, I didn&apos;t feel it was the least bit quality at all and the waiters weren&apos;t very attentive so we ended up with burned pork belly. I ended up cooking it myself, which is totally fine, to avoid burning. However, they quickly took the prongs out of my hands so it didn&apos;t seem like they wanted me to cook the meat myself. 

Overall this place is probably the best you&apos;ll get in Philly, but don&apos;t come with high standards or you&apos;ll be quickly disappointed."
3,"Ordered sashimi regular , galbi &amp; cold noodle combo..
Sashimi was fresh. Above average 
Cold noodle was yammy. Above average 
But galbi... was too salty... and the quantity &amp; quality were not good... it seems like some left over meat..... 
even tho it is combo.. but still......  

Overall, ok experience!"
3,"The photos looked so much better than the food itself. 

I was so excited to try this place out. The menu looked very promising because it literally had everything. I should have known, places with large selection are usually subpar. 

The spicy galbi was barely lacking any flavor. It looked marinated but I could tell it didn&apos;t sit long enough. The Haemool was also light on flavors. I expected the soup to be spicy, but it barely made a dent on my spicy scale. 

The sashimi was very fresh and my favorite of the dishes. I spent most of my time eating the fish and side dishes. Not pictured side dishes made up points for the galbi and hot pot. The ohango bokum, and kimchi has the best homemade feels. 

The food was average, but for the price I wouldn&apos;t recommend it."
5,"My absolute favorite place to get KBBQ. Until I met my husband in 2013, I knew nothing about Korean food, I mean ZERO. If someone would&apos;ve said the word &quot;kimchi&quot; to me I would&apos;ve looked at them like they had two heads. Then along came who is now my husband and boom, I&apos;m a KBBQ fiend. My husband is 1/2 Korean, I am white. But I&apos;m pretty sure I could eat Korean food everyday for the rest of my life and be totally satisfied. If you&apos;re in the Philly area, look no further, THIS IS WHERE YOU WANT TO GO. 2nd to NONE. Everything is good. You can&apos;t go wrong. Over order if you want to, it&apos;s worth it, as long as you also overeat. I suggest splurging on yogurt soju. Some bibimbap, maybe even a pancake. But whatever you do, don&apos;t pass up on the Galbi. I&apos;m happy to argue with anyone who disagrees, this is HANDS DOWN the best Korean spot in Philly."
5,Authentic food and great service. If you like spicy food then this is the place to go. staff was great from start to finish.
5,"Best Korean for miles. You&apos;ll have to go to NYC, DC or Korea to get anything comparable. If you notice the same repeat Korean customers, that&apos;s because they know where the good stuff is and now, so do you."
4,"Seo Rabol, the Korean house on Old 2nd Street in the Olney section of Philadelphia, is one of the more established peninsula restaurants in the area. It is not far from the center of Seoultown on Cheltenham Avenue. They offer a full menu, but their specialty is BBQ grilled on the table. 

We were not hungry enough to deal with the mandatory 2 order minimum (@$20 per), so opted for their rendition of seafood pancake and pork gui - letting them do the grilling in the kitchen and serve it ready to eat. The banchan arrived first in small square plates. The ten or so dishes were all very good and a tour de force of spicy flavors and textures from steamed egg to mackerel. 

The pancake was frittata like, with plenty of shellfish within, and pan fried well enough to be firm, yet still tender. It was one of the better versions I have eaten. The gui was a large bowl full of pork strips grilled just right with an excellent spicy hot/sweet sauce. Much better than I could have done myself at the table, at less than half the cost. It was delicious and almost addictive. We couldn&apos;t finish either dish, so the remains were packed up for home consumption. We finished with complementary sweet ginger tea, which cleansed the pallet and was refreshing.

Throughout the meal the large HDTVs were tuned to the Winter Olympics in South Korea. National pride for sure, but no one really seemed to be watching. The table conversation was dominant across the large dining room, as it should be while enjoying a good meal with family and friends. 

Service was efficient and cordial, but it certainly helped to have someone at the table speaking Korean."
5,"Seorabol catered my wedding. Not only was it SUPER affordable, the food was delicious and beautifully prepared.  I forgot many things that happened during the wedding but I did not forget how good the food was (guests also commented).  If you&apos;re looking for authentic and great Korean food, this is one of the most authentic Korean restaurants in Philadelphia. How do I know? I&apos;m Korean and also if you look at their menu, they carry a lot of dishes that wouldn&apos;t be found in other restaurants, dishes that might not be as easy on American&apos;s tastebuds."
