5,The food and the service simply divine. The flavors jumped off the plate! I had their scallop dish and it was cooked perfectly. Best scallops I&apos;ve had in quite some time. Dining outside was made pleasant with the outdoor heaters. The waiter was very kind and informative. Everyone in my part was so pleased. I was incredibly grateful that this restaurant was open at the time because so many other restaurants were closed. I&apos;ll be going here again the next time I&apos;m in Philly. Great eats!
4,"Really cool spot in the city. I love their market. You can come in here for quick coffee and pastry, or get some really well curated grocery shopping done. 

Beyond their market, they have an amazing &amp; high-end selection of cheeses/meats. Would highly recommend getting a cheese board from here. 

You can also sit to get dinner. When we last went (pre-Covid), it was a fixed $55 menu that changes monthly (similar theme to Talula&apos;s Garden.)  Even with the fixed menu, they can accommodate dietary restrictions. Food was super fresh w/ lots of flavor.

Their seating is cool too, no matter where you are, you get a glimpse into the kitchen."
3,"I&apos;m still very excited to eventually return to Talula&apos;s for supper one day when the pandemic has passed.  Unfortunately, however, I was not thrilled with my experience ordering lunch takeout last week.  The delivery was very quick and the food tasted fine, but my husband ordered the superfood salad and then could not eat it because it was full of carrots and he is allergic.  Neither the label on the salad container nor the website menu mentioned carrots at all, but if they had, he of course would have ordered something different.  The polite note he wrote to Talula&apos;s suggesting they update their ingredients on this salad for the benefit of future customers was completely ignored.  (We did not seek a refund or anything like that -- just wanted to give them a heads up to save someone else from having the same experience we did.)
Not a great showing by a place I normally think of so highly.

**Follow Up** After I posted the above, someone from Talula&apos;s finally responded to my husband&apos;s email to apologize and assure us they had audited all their menu items and updated the ingredient lists.  They also offered us a refund on the salad and additional incentive to return.  We appreciate it and are now much more willing to give lunch takeout another try at some point."
4,"Talula&apos;s Daily is a great grab and go spot! I&apos;ve tried the peach and farro salad, chicken salad sandwich and iced coffee, all great. Service is friendly and the bathroom is nice."
5,"Hearing that this place was open on opentable day of and the party size modifiable within hours, I was looking forward to just eating some food with some new people I met at a convention, with the focus on the people and not the food.

I come here, see the nicest hosts and felt like I was maybe in for something special. Starting off with some unexpected bite sized cheeses, I felt like I might&apos;ve been in for a treat.

Then the first course, beets and cheese. I knew from this moment on, this place was either what I expected (since I don&apos;t like beets) or was going to be amazing. It was the latter, I then checked how much it cost again and couldn&apos;t believe it was 55/person.

For this price point, this was a tremendous meal and would highly recommend. Hope I can make reservations everyday last minute"
3,"This has become my new go to place for some coffee or something to eat when I&apos;m on call in the area. It&apos;s a bit like a bougie cafe/convenience store. I do enjoy the selection of sweet treats in the front..I&apos;ve not gone wrong with anything I&apos;ve tried and the hot chocolate when my body is asking me to lay off the caffeine. There&apos;s always interesting tasty food available (for the meat eater and the vegetarian). 

I will say though, they&apos;re quite slow. I&apos;m not one of those people always in a hurry but even when there are not that many people in there, I always have quite a long wait for my food to be heated up (and not all the way through) or for my ready made salad to be mixed or to have my latte made. If I didn&apos;t find the things tasty I probably would not return."
5,My boyfriend and I came here for a date night. I have heard great things about this place and couldn&apos;t wait to try it! We did the drink pairing for $35 and it was worth it! Overall the food was delicious and the service was amazing. I don&apos;t remember or waiters name but he was great at describing the wines and how the different flavors pair with the food. My favorite dish was the crab raviolis. The chicken was also delicious. There was so much food we were stuffed when we left. I can&apos;t wait to go back!
5,"We had an absolute amazing experience doing the super secret super at Talula&apos;s Daily (back in February but posting a little late)! It is such a cute quaint atmosphere for dinner. We had the tasting menu which to my knowledge is the only dinner option. We had 5 courses-appetizer, pasta, main, cheese and dessert. The appetizer was a prosciutto ricotta toast which was delicious! Great bread which was loaded with cheese and prosciutto and some balsamic. I don&apos;t remember the pasta dish but I think my boyfriend really enjoyed it! The main dish was a white fish in a lemon sauce-- it was incredible and even my boyfriend who isn&apos;t a huge fan of fish liked it. The cheese with jam and nuts was a good follow up to the main dish.  For dessert we had cannoli dip with  pizelles which was a nice light way to finish the meal. My boyfriend got the wine pairing with the meal which was a really good deal.. I think only around $30 for wine tastings paired with each course. The service was impeccable and we can&apos;t wait to go back!"
2,"In summary: overpriced, overcrowded, and wasteful! The food might be okay, but it&apos;s NOT worth the price tag. Maybe worth it for a coffee/pastry (I didn&apos;t try that part of the restaurant) but not for the food. 

I thought this would be a really neat gourmet cafe/cafeteria type place. The concept is trying to get there but it&apos;s not. First of all, it&apos;s so overpriced. I paid $15 for a small REHEATED piece of salmon and potato soup. SOUP. 1 to 2 stars down for overcharging me for reheated food. 

For the price point, you&apos;re better off having a sit down lunch/brunch somewhere in the Gayborhood. This isn&apos;t super quick either (because you have to wait for your food to be reheated) and it was hard for my party of 3 to find a place to sit. It&apos;s seat yourself  community seating but there aren&apos;t enough places to sit. 

Even more importantly, the way it all works is so wasteful! Everything is pre-made. You pick out food from the refrigerator or behind the counter and they then reheat your hot food, or toss the salad in the the dressing it comes with, or just plate the side you ordered. Everything in the refrigerator is packaged in plastic and then gets plated for you. WHY PACKAGE SOMETHING IN PLASTIC JUST TO SERVE IT ON A PLATE? The waste makes me so upset that I knocked down two stars just for that. I&apos;ve never seen anything so absurd."
4,"Serendipity? Stumbled upon this place by accident... Well, kinda, sorta, ish. After being totally underwhelmed by the South St &quot;block party&quot; and severely parched; I decided to do a quick Yelp search for an outdoor restaurant. Talula&apos;s popped up, and it was only a  7 min walk.

Ambiance: Walked in from the beautiful outdoor space, then made my way to the host, who greeted us with a huge smile. There was no available outdoor tables without a reservation, so we sat at the bar. 
The bar wasn&apos;t terrible big; it seats about 10-12. The ambiance is rustic Chic, lots of light from the glass &quot;storefront&quot;. 

Service: Amazing! Bartender was so charming and attentive. Top-notch service. Didn&apos;t get dinner just an app; the tuna crudo and it was very good and fresh. We got some complimentary &quot;brioche and chees?&quot; thingy; so good!!!

Cons: a little pricey for Philly and the drinks could have been stronger. 

I&apos;m totally coming back for dinner next time!"
5,"I&apos;ve been to Talula&apos;s Garden and while the food was good, we didnt have good service and the food didn&apos;t seem worth the price. TD is a stark contrast from next door (from my experience) and I highly recommend the supper club. 

Our waitress gave an impeccable description of the courses and our drink options.  I love when service is so good you don&apos;t notice if you need anything because they ask before you realize it.  Our waitress was also patient with figuring out what wine to choose.

The supper club menu changes monthly and every course was delicious. The current November menu includes seasonal items that are warm and comforting dishes. It is a perfect fall menu.  

The mushroom sage soup was creamy, garlicky and had a nice crunchy ciabatta topping. The potato gnocchi was so pillowy it melted in your mouth. The pork loin was perfectly cooked and so tender you didnt even need a knife to cut into it. The brown butter apples complimented this so well (reminds me of a classic apple sauce and pork chop pairing). Dessert included a deconstructed pecan pie and ice cream. I wish it had more of the pecan filling but it was just the right amount given we were so full by that point. 

You really can&apos;t beat $55 for the five course meal at Talula&apos;s Daily. I cannot wait to go back!"
4,"Great spot in the neighborhood! My BF and I were in the area and I had heard about the little shop next door to the restaurant. I was a bit disappointed that there was no actual menu. The concept is a bit confusing and no one was there to welcome us. Once we asked how the process works, we were excited to try. The food was so tasty. I had a lavender green tea latte that was SO flavorful and a smoked turkey pesto sandwich. My BF had a grilled cheese and ginger-flavored latte. His food was from the gourmet counter and mine from the ready-made. They heated everything up for us. We will definitely be back!"
5,"It was our second time here to celebrate a late Valentines Day. The food was exceptional, presentation was superb and the service was great. They always give you a goodbye treat after their dessert course. Will be looking forward to coming here again when we are back in Philly."
5,Great place for a quick lunch. Fresh salads that they will mix for you or you can take on the run. During the lunch rush it can be busy but you can usually find a spot if you are willing to share a table.
3,"Talula&apos;s Daily looked so appealing after the variety of take-out foods was increased and the place rearranged with a lot more space because of the pandemic, so I went hog-wild, trying not to pay attention to the high prices. Alas,one of the two soups was badly seasoned, the frittata was tasteless and dry, the pasta just okay, the tuna salad not exactly fresh.  Okay, the brownie was really good.  But all that money....for what?
I&apos;ll go back to picking up an occasional salad there."
5,"Wanted to update my review to reflect my experience with dinner during the nightly supper club. Can&apos;t rave about this meal enough. I preferred it over my dinner at Talula&apos;s Garden.

We went during the summertime and the meal was very fresh and light. Didn&apos;t feel heavy at all but at the same time was very filling. I love the concept as well, a fixed menu every month featuring things in season. Will be back again for sure!"
5,"Decided to study here during a beautiful spring afternoon and it was such a great atmosphere! There were some people solo working, some people having lunch, some people working together. It felt like such a diverse place that really served everyone&apos;s needs. Not too loud and not too busy. I also really liked working at their communal table! Not a ton of outlets, but there were a few here and there. Free-wifi. 

Their &quot;small&quot; for-here matcha latte was actually quite big and delicious! I even saw that they prepared it with an actual matcha whisk, so I know it was prepared well! Got a free chocolate chip walnut cookie with my check-in and it was yuuummmmyy :) Such a nice snack! Heard from my friend recently that they have unlimited coffee refills...not sure if it&apos;s still true or not, but I&apos;ll definitely be back to verify :)"
5,"This is where I like to hide, except it is not really that good of a hiding spot because lots of people I know like to come here too. So I try to hide behind my little cappuccino and croissant, but they don&apos;t really survive long enough to effectively conceal my butter smeared face as it invariably emerges from a battleground of flaky pastry shards.  

My faves:
The plain croissant - always warm and perfect
Apple strudel (sadly seasonal! Fall only?)
Cappuccino - so perfect, very milky
Breakfast sammich - ugh

Their pre-made salads are legit too, and although they cost $14 they are pretty large and chock full of things like salmon, edamame and quinoa so you feel like you&apos;re investing in your health maybe. They also have a secret supper club with a multicourse menu that changes monthly - this is not so secret and you should check it out! The menus around the holidays tend to be particularly indulgent."
2,"Little luncheonette/ cafe in Washington square offering prepared foods. You have the option to eat in or take out.  The concept: choose your pre-made salad and sandwich from the refrigerator display and you can take it to go, or they will plate it for you to eat at a table. There is also a case of prepared foods like baked chicken, Mac n cheese, roasted cauliflower-- there is a different selection daily. In addition, They also have a nice Cheese selection, baked goods, breakfast items, tea, and la Column coffee

I usually go for their breakfast sandwich , which is why I&apos;m writing this review.  They are Pre- made and heated to order. 

Here is why I&apos;m giving the place 2 stars today.. The last few times I&apos;ve been in they are sold out of their breakfast sandwich... It&apos;s super annoying to get ready go somewhere for a specific reason only to find they are sold out. They open at 7am...  I went at 8:59am and they had no more... I understand making a  limited amount... but I really don&apos;t see any excuse for them to repeatedly being sold out by 9am, And this was the case the last 4 times I went. Make less quiche !! No one wants the quiche ! I won&apos;t be going back here if it continues this way, and will be sure to spread the word. I just don&apos;t want to start my day annoyed..."
5,"Supper club was great! All 5 courses in February were so high quality, unique, and delicious. Worth the money!"
