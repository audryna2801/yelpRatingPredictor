5,"Makes me want to dance.
I was craving pizza and all the Mt. Airy neighborhood pizza spots disappoint. So I was in town and decided to give this place a try before I headed home.
Yay. Just went back a second time for the same two pies. Now, I&apos;m not a huge fan of indoor dining during a pandemic and I did see people seated inside. But they have really easy and efficient ordering online which made the process fun and quick.
So the pepperoni and the spinach pizzas are my favorite. They are packed with flavor and the crunchy edged pepperoni pieces are my favorite. Each pizza is enough for one person so on a date order at least 2 pies. They also reheat really easily in an air fryer (fun fact).
The spinach pie is white and the onions and the cheeses just make it a festival for your tastebuds. I now trust their flavor combinations enough to try other options but I probably won&apos;t. These are my go-to&apos;s from now on. 
Service seemed to be friendly. You can drive up and call in to see if your order is ready. Once they brought it to my car. Another time I had to get out and get it. Either is fine for me since I still side-eye dine-inners. Like... why. It&apos;s still a pandemic. Anyway, besides my judgment of others, I highly recommend this be your pizza night choice if you&apos;re in the area."
5,"Loved their pizza and tap water (she said it is filtered tap water).

We got lucky to dine in here without any reservation. They only have three tables inside due to COVID and reservation is recommended for indoor dine in.

Tap water tasted so soft, why am I commenting about their water but it really was tasty. 

They have a happy hour (ended 15 minutes before we arrived) and price on drinks and appetizers looked very reasonable.

We shared 28&quot; braised pork (seasonal) and the pizza was very good. I liked that texture and flavor of the dough.

Sometimes pizza sits in my tummy for a while and I tend to avoid eating pizza but this place is exception. I would eat their pizza often if I live nearby.

I enjoyed watching the chef cooking from the dining area. They all ware mask and face shield. I know why but I wondered if they get really hot near that oven.

Staff was friendly and overall it was very pleasant experience dining in here."
5,"We just ordered a large pizza for take out and was very impressed! The pizza was ready within 15 minutes and it tasted so fresh.  A lot of pizza places are skimpy on toppings but this was not the case.  There was a ton of pepperoni, great dough that was crunchy, and great tasting sauce. I just wish they put more sauce on the pizza.  The pizza is a little more pricey then other spots but it was worth it!"
5,"Pizzeria Vetri... where do I begin? Their philosophy is &quot;the best quality ingredients with simple preparations.&quot;

Pizzeria Vetri&apos;s standard margherita, as I knew from previous exposure, is a model within the prescribed parameters of the form. I particularly admire the sauce, which is less acidic and bitter than many, and about as sweet as possible without tasting sugary.

John Sidoti is skillful enough to make something exceptional out of the utterly simple: Vetri&apos;s Maurizio pizza, with four simple ingredients on a plush circle of dough: rosemary, mozzarella, sea salt, and olive oil. 

Highly recommend. Pizzeria Vetri is remarkable, and you would be doing yourself a disservice if you didn&apos;t dine here at least once."
5,"I met up with a friend for lunch outside on a gorgeous afternoon a few weeks ago. There were plenty of outdoor tables which were covered by a tent that was open along one side. Because it was so sunny, it actually felt quite warm but I bet the tent would be great at blocking some wind on a chillier day. 

I was happy to see some booze free options on the beverage list, and ordered a Don&apos;t Call Me Shirley, which was a simple club soda with housemade grenadine - fantastic! 

We shared the arugula salad, margherita and mushroom pizzas. I specifically requested the salad first but everything was brought out at the same time. Nonetheless, every single item was delicious! So delicious, that my husband and I ordered dinner from the Pizzeria Vetri in Rittenhouse that same night.

I feel like Philadelphia has gone from pizza desert to pizza wonderland in a pretty short time. I don&apos;t always think of Vetri when I think of pizza, but it&apos;s a consistently solid spot that shouldn&apos;t be overlooked."
5,"Wow...just wow! I ordered roasted cauliflower, margherita pizza, and maurizio pizza. Everything tasted incredible. Best pizza in all of Philly!!! They packed everything so neatly. I loved that the team at PV signed the delivery bag and also drew some hearts on it. I feel the extra love!!!  Thanks Pizzeria Vetri!"
3,"Good pizza spot, we tried margarita pizza and the tomato sauce on the pizza tasted very fresh, wish we could add more toppings."
5,"I first judge a pizza by the crust and this was just crispy enough on the bottom and soft/pillowy along the edges! Great toppings too, not too heavy but generous."
5,"Got pizza delivered by Door Dash. It wasn&apos;t hot anymore by the time it was delivered, but the pizza box had reheating directions. The pizza is thin and small, but delicious. The shroom pizza is very flavorful-love the black garlic aioli sauce. The margherita pizza was your typical good Margherita pizza.  I would suggest ordering a pizza per person since they are thin."
4,"After hearing a whole lot of hype about this place I can tell you that it&apos;s good pizza. Not necessarily great pizza, but good pizza. It is vastly overpriced for what it is, but that&apos;s typical amongst artisanal pizza places.

The rotolo is probably their best offering. It&apos;s unique and low priced, and a great starter in general. I love their use of pistachio, and it just all comes together to work well as a dish. The pizza is good, but nothing groundbreaking. The crust is fluffy but also floppy when you pick it up. The speck pizza I got was very tasty, but this was mostly due to its toppings. The speck was salty and flavorful, and the onions and pistachios gave it an interesting texture. 

I would have the pizza here again, but it&apos;s not something I would go out of my way for. If they dropped their prices just a smidge, I might be more willing to drop in for round two. Pretty good overall."
3,"I have had almost all of their pizza offerings and typically return for one thing. I have had the Rotolo, Caesar Salad, Maurizio, Fennel Sausage, Pepperoni, Shroom, Margharita, Nutella Pizza, and Tiramisu. I typically grab my food to go, but have eaten inside on occasion.

Most of the pizzas are tomato sauce less so keep that in mind if you&apos;re more of a traditionalist. This means that some pizzas are drier than others. The crust is great when it&apos;s done right, but they lack consistency and sometimes burn the bottom to smithereens. 

My favorite items are the Rotolo, Mushroom Pizza, and Margharita

Rotolo- Delicious dough, cheese throughout, and the pistachio pesto is a great sauce. Be careful, it might fill you up

Caesar salad - this was a mistake, the lettuce was ice cold, and the elements just were lackluster, the dressing was missing flavor

Mushroom Pizza- now this is my go to! I always add pepperoni though. The cheese, multiple types of shrooms, onions, chives, and that truffle aioli drizzled all over makes me forget that there is no tomato sauce.

Nutella Pizza - imagine a normal pizza dough stuffed with marshmallows and Nutella. Pretty good, but there is a lot of dough to chew on. RIP to my jaws!

Tiramisu- just skip it, dessert isn&apos;t their thing.

Rotolo - 5/5
Caesar Salad 1/5
Maurizio 3/5
Fennnel Sausage 3/5
Mushroom Pizza 5/5
Margherita 4/5
Pepperoni 3/5
Nutella Pizza 3/5
Tiramisu 2/5"
5,"We ordered take out from here and everything from phenomenal!!! We had a friend coming over and got 3 pizzas for the 3 of us to share. We ended up having 1-2 slices left over, but hopefully this is helpful to figure out quantity. We ordered the Shroom, the Maurizio, and the Eggplant with Straciatella pizzas. 

All 3 were great -- chewy crust, fresh ingredients, creative and tasty flavor profiles. I think the favorite was the Eggplant pizza, but honestly all 3 were great. We ordered in advance on the Caviar app and the delivery was on time. 

Also got the fried pizza dough -- that was pretty good too. All in all- definitely the best pizza we&apos;ve had in Philadelphia so far!"
4,"Ended an adventure night by visiting this gem. Great pizza selection, or build your own! We got the pork and squash pies. Who knew a squash pizza would be sooo good and savory! I should&apos;ve ordered an extra one to go. Also, had a glass of the Limoncello Spritz, very refreshing and tasteful! They are currently offering indoor and cute outdoor seating and a Emily was such a great waitress, great attitude and super informative. Would definitely visit again!"
4,"My fiance and I like Pizzeria Vetri for a low-key neighborhood date night, though we can&apos;t help feeling every time we visit that it is overpriced.  Perhaps that&apos;s why I&apos;ve never reviewed it until now?  The food is great, and the atmosphere and service are always very pleasant -- but for the price, you could certainly have a much more &quot;upscale&quot; dinner somewhere else.

But all of that applies to &quot;regular times,&quot; which are not applicable at the moment (or maybe ever again?).  I&apos;m writing now because Pizzeria Vetri&apos;s COVID-19 takeout/delivery options knock it out of the park.  One of the best meals we&apos;ve had over the past few weeks was a family takeout special that included two pizzas, a salad, a side, and a dessert for only $50.  (We asked them to hold the kids&apos; coloring pages since we&apos;re a family of only two adults!)  The delivery came quickly and the pizzas were hot and fresh.  Since we&apos;d never be able to get that much food at Pizzeria Vetri for even close to that price in regular times, we chalked this meal up to one of the few &quot;silver linings&quot; of the COVID-19 shutdown.  Highly recommend that you grab this deal while it&apos;s still available!"
4,Delicious and Highly recommended!
5,"Yup, still my favorite Margherita on Planet Earth. Do yourself a favor and get 2 pies, the 2and one being something with stracciatella cheese. That stuff is like a creamier more decadent slightly different textured mozz (with the tiniest hit of sweetness to it).

I&apos;m blown away everytime I eat at Vetri (which is at most once a year when I&apos;m in town)."
3,"After hearing much hype about this place being &apos;the best pizza&apos; Philly had to offer I must say it did not live up to expectations. Starting with the ambience, for the prices and hype you might expect a bit more but it&apos;s not much other than a basic pizza joint with metal tables, hard red chairs, lacking &apos;vibe&apos;. 

Broccoli with chili lime appetizer: sounded different with interesting ingredients but alas we were disappointed to receive cold steamed broccoli without any flavor whatsoever and some chopped dates sprinkled on top. We asked it to be heated and it was a bit better but still not great. Would rate it 2/5

Spinach pizza: actually the best thing we had there, very flavorful, cheesy and delicious! 5/5, would order this again. 

Margherita pizza: sometimes simple is the best but not here unfortunately. Red sauce was lacking, a bit dry, no flavor and skimpy on the mozzarella. 3/5

Overall, good pizza dough, excellent service- staff is very friendly and helpful, however, seems like most of the menu is hit or miss and prices are only worth it for the &apos;hits&apos;"
4,We live in strange times right now with the quarantine due to Covid. I was in the mood for a good margherita pizza so I decided to try this place via Door Dash. It was pretty good pizza but not the best I&apos;ve had. The crust was a bit too thin and flimsy for me. And not enough mozarella distributed uniformly on the pie. But I do commend Pizzeria Vetri for donating pizzas to Penn Medicine during this pandemic. So I applaud them for their sense of community.
4,Much better!  I had a bad experience but it was my fault for ordering on a busy night.  Best pizza in Philadelphia.
5,"Had delivery twice through caviar. I live just down the street but the pizza was delivered within 20 minutes of ordering. The pizza was hot, looked great, and tasted great too."
