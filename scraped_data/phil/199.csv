5,"Awesome! We really enjoyed Brunch at Honeys Sit N Eat on South Street. It&apos;s curbside outdoor dinning with tables and umbrellas. We ordered French Toast, Turkey Sausage, Scrambled eggs, and breakfast Potatoes. Everything was delicious and the service was great."
4,"Old review warning: I came here while on vacation a over a year ago with some friends for brunch. I immediately loved the homey, country vibe, and I was sold as soon as I saw that they had biscuits and gravy. Everything about our experience was really solid. The biscuits and gravy were done very well with sturdy but tender biscuits and a well-seasoned gravy. There were plenty of chunks of sausage too. My husband enjoyed it as well, and he grew up with a mom who made it all the time. My friends really enjoyed their huevos rancheros and breakfast burrito. They also said the coffee was great. Our waiter was great, and the atmosphere really made us feel like we were at a friend&apos;s house rather than in the middle of Philly. While the food wasn&apos;t groundbreaking, everything was reliably good, and I would love to come back."
4,"The food reminds me of an authentic home cooked meal. As though I went to someone&apos;s house for a full breakfast. I ordered the Honey platter which comes with 3 pancakes, potatoes, meat and eggs. I added bananas, chocolate chips and whipped cream to the pancakes, each $1 extra. I also got the latke as my potato dish. Everything was very good. It did taste as though they sautéed/pan fried everything with butter. 
I really enjoyed the potato latke. The turkey sausage was okay. My friend ordered the home fries and they were perfectly crispy and seasoned very well. Great portion size. Would definitely come back again."
2,"I ordered a breakfast burrito for takeout, and was really underwhelmed by two main problems: (1) the bottom of the tortilla was completely soggy from either the filling or the pico de gallo that was on the side and not in its own container and (2) the inside was about 50% potato and not nearly enough bacon. The sautéed peppers and onions inside, and the side of pico de gallo, were tasty though."
5,"I&apos;m not sure what took me so long to review Honey&apos;s. Maybe its because they don&apos;t need my rave review because it will pale in comparison to others. I loved my time at Honey&apos;s. I went on a Saturday morning for brunch, waited about 5-10 minutes to get seated-nothing crazy. The inside was not like i had expected. It has a very homey feeling to it and not pretentious at all which I was very drawn to. The server was perfectly nice. The food was great.  Loved everything. I can&apos;t describe how good it was. 10/10 could dunk my head in a bucket of their grits if I could afford it."
4,"Every time I am craving breakfast for dinner I come here! Well, anytime I&apos;m in philly I crave breakfast because of Honey&apos;s sit n eat! 

I have never been disappointed by an order. The eggs are always cooked perfectly, the home fries with peppers and onions are always a MUST HAVE, buttermilk biscuit is fluffy and crispy :), and you can literally never go wrong with a giant banana pancake! 

My only issues are that it is often hard to find parking in the area and it is cash only (there is an ATM inside)"
5,"I picked up some good from Honey&apos;s for brunch this morning. I ordered the Honey&apos;s platter which came with three pancakes (I added berries for $1), home fries (chunky potatoes with onions and peppers), and bacon. You could customize almost everything that it came with which I really appreciated. Everything was hot and fresh and stayed that way on my ten minute drive home. I definitely plan to order brunch from here again soon!"
4,"I&apos;m not gonna wait on this one and just start by saying this was one of the best breakfast platter I&apos;ve had in quite a while. Just the right amount of food, just the right amount of portions, and the right amount of seasoning. 

I ordered the pancakes loaded with bananas and chocolate chips cooked in the pancakes, with seasoned potatoes, eggs, and turkey sausage for $14 which wasn&apos;t a bad price compared to another fave place I went to recently that charged $13 just for baked french toast with a small fruit salad. Both were tasty, but bang for buck matters sometimes.

Honey&apos;s flavor on the potatoes and crispy edges were such a good balance to the soft eggs and maple syrup-ish sausage, but the real highlight were the pancakes....So soft due to the bananas melting all in the batter yet at the same time creating a crispy edge. Just perfect.

I&apos;m giving 5 stars but, it&apos;s more like 4.5 because it was soooooooooo drafty in there, and we were sat next to a super drafty window and it was tough to really enjoy the food. Def will be here in the summer tho lol"
4,"Delicious food with an adorable interior! We had breakfast here last Sunday and got there at 9:30. There was a 20 minute wait for a table of 5 and people just kept coming in and putting their name in to sit. There isn&apos;t a very big waiting area so be prepared to wait outside.

Once sat, coffee was poured and then our server came back to take our order. I ordered the creamed chipped beef special. Others ordered the country fried chicken and eggs Benedict. Everyone finished everything on their plate and we all could have licked them clean! My cream chipped beef was completely different/tastier than any other that I&apos;ve had. The portions are generous too.

The only reason why I didn&apos;t give five stars is because they don&apos;t take reservations and it&apos;s cash only which I rarely ever carry cash. I can&apos;t wait to go back though!!"
5,"Kudos to yelp for recommending highly Honey&apos;s Sit N Eat. I&apos;m so glad to be here and the environment is so pretty. Quite impressed with their menu, lots of great options, Country Fried Steak and Two Eggs Your Way was absolutely great. Wonderful afternoon and the staff is fantastic! It truly was a great experience."
5,"It&apos;s RARE that I go to a breakfast/brunch place and take longer than 2 minutes to order, since there&apos;s usually only one vegetarian thing on the menu. Honey&apos;s is the opposite - a vegetarian brunch heaven where the only problem is deciding between all the options.

So far I&apos;ve tried the Huevos Rancheros and the Jeb&apos;s biscuit sandwich - both are amazing. The Huevos Rancheros is comparable to (or better than) the one at Sabrina&apos;s Cafe, and came with an incredible portion size for the price. Most stuff on the menu is under $10, and is worth it.

After hearing about the crazy line length, I got here as soon as Honey&apos;s opened and had no wait and friendly, attentive service. Will definitely be back!"
3,"This place gets a lot of hype so we popped in and tried it when we were in the area earlier. The fried chicken sandwich is supposed to be really good, so we split one of those as a snack and also ordered the fried green tomatoes. It was a good sandwich, but I don&apos;t feel like it was worth all the hipster hype. The fried green tomatoes could have been more crispy, but the ranch sauce they came with was really good. I like the &quot;buy local&quot; vibe of this place, but otherwise, it was just okay to me."
5,"This place might be the perfect breakfast spot. The food was delicious, portions were just right, and the prices were reasonable (but a bit on the high side). I ordered the breakfast platter ($14) which came with two eggs, a breakfast meat, potatoes, and three small pancakes. The only way the meal could have been better is if it came with toast, but alas... still very good.

The highlights of the meal were the bacon and pancakes, I think. The bacon was just exquisitely thick and perfectly fried so that it wasn&apos;t too crisp but just crisp enough, and the pancakes were small enough to fit on the same plate as the rest of the dish. It all looked scrumptious, but if you&apos;re looking for a breakfast platter that fills you up to a 9/10, this isn&apos;t it; you&apos;ll be satisfied but not bursting at the seams, and that works for me."
4,"Ok, so I&apos;ve heard people RAVE about Honey&apos;s for years, but just never made it in. Finally got the chance with a friend on a Sunday afternoon. 

I was expecting to have to wait for a while, but it was actually pretty quick, considering it was a weekend. We put our names in (just 2 of us) and were seated in 15 minutes. Granted, it was around 2:00 so a little after the weekend brunch rush. 

I ordered the Honey Cristo and it was so good I&apos;m not sure if I inhaled it or actually ate it. Just the right combination of sweet and savory (plus the side salad). 

Nothing to complain about with our visit. Remember it is cash only, but they have an ATM if you need it. If you have the chance, definitely come by for a meal!!"
4,"We have been here multiple times and we enjoy the food at Honey&apos;s. This time around my wife got the open faced breakfast sandwich with a side of grits and I got the breakfast bomb with veggie sausage. In addition we got the tempeh steak with maple honey (this was one of their specials). 

My wife usually get the sandwich, which she loves. I normally get the breakfast quesadilla, but decided to try something new. The bomb was good, definitely different. The combo of eggs with meat tucked inside a folded pancake is an interesting array of flavors. Not sure if I would grab it again, but glad I tried it. 
The potatoes that came with it are very good as well. 
The tempeh steak was not for us. We weren&apos;t fond of the overall sweetness and would pass on it next time. 

Otherwise, Honeys is a great place to check out. Just remember, it is cash only! Service was very good, but depending on the time of day, just keep in mind that you might be waiting!"
4,"Enjoyed a wonderful brunch here with a friend. It was not too busy when we came here on a weekend afternoon. We waited about 15-20 min for seats at the bar. We were struggling to order from everything from the main menu to the specials as there were so many good options. While we decided, the staff was attentive to our beverage needs and our cups never ran dry of precious 
coffee. We both got main menu dishes with French toast and eggs. The dishes were good, although nothing mind-blowing. We tried to get house made chorizo but it was out :(. Instead we got potatoes and sausage and they were quite good. Overall - great experience, good food, would return! Nothing blew me out of the water though."
4,"I had heard a lot about Honey&apos;s, specifically their fried chicken, so I was very excited to visit! I ordered one of their specials which was like chicken and waffles but with pancakes, along with a side of mac &amp; cheese. I was a bit confused when looking at the menu because it didn&apos;t seem fried chicken was emphasized so I ordered something different that caught my eye. The menu in general had a bunch of items that seemed super yummy, so I want to go back!

(+) I scarfed down my entree, probably because I was hungry but also because it was extremely tasty. The pancakes specifically had such a great texture.
(+) Service was very very friendly!

I&apos;d skip on the mac &amp; cheese - it wasn&apos;t bad but there&apos;s definitely much better mac and cheese elsewhere.

Overall good experience, want to go back to try their other dishes!"
5,"We visited Honey&apos;s Sit N Eat on Wednesday, November 27th at about 9:30AM with a party of two.  The wait was not long and we were seated pretty quickly.  

This is the first time I have been at Honey&apos;s (either location) since 2012 -- so it has been quite a while.

The friendly service and great food still exists here.  They have the menu and then also a board of specials.  So many good choices, and they will allow you to order from any part of the menu, even at breakfast.

There were so many choices; however, I went pretty simple and had all the cheese which consisted of the fried cheese grilled cheese with a side of mac n cheese.  I know, crazy, right?  Well, let me tell you, it was so delicious!  

We all had different items at the table and everyone enjoyed the meals.  The portion sizes also seemed to be pretty good for the price charged and the area we dined.

I would most definitely return here again."
4,"This place is PACCCKEDDD, always. Make sure to bring cash! Or you can use the ATM in the building. Its also BYOB! 

The restaurant is pretty big, so the wait shouldn&apos;t be too terrible! My friends and I got here around 10:30/11 and waited for 20 minutes. The service seems to move pretty fast too! 

I ended up getting the daily special, the honey fried chicken chipotle benedict. Instead of a biscuit, its served on pancakes! It was delicious, but the only thing that I did not like about it was that the fried chicken gets soggy fast because of the sauce on top. And if you love breakfast potatoes like me, then you will like these too!"
5,"I stopped by around 10 AM on a Saturday and only had to wait a few minutes for a table of two. Everything on the menu sounded delicious but I went for the Monte Cristo and was not disappoint. The extra sweetness from the honey was a perfect topping. Plus they put it on the side so you can determine how much you want. Overall, great experience and food. Just be aware that they are cash only, but do have an ATM in the restaurant."
