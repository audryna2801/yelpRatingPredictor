5,"Parc is always reliable for good food and gorgeous French atmosphere. The last time I came here was to celebrate a 1L milestone of submitting our summary judgment brief, and it was wonderful to sit outside (bc covid), enjoying sunshine and friendship and a brief moment of freedom. They don&apos;t do bottomless brunch, but we kept the bellinis coming."
5,"I got to say this place just does things well. It&apos;s a staple of Philadelphia and of the Rittenhouse area. It&apos;s situated right on the corner of 2 streets which gives it beautiful views and lots of sunlight. During this pandemic Parc also has a lot of space for outdoor seating and they&apos;ve done a great job with that. Currently they impose a 90-minute eating time. 

I&apos;ve come here a few times throughout my time living in Philadelphia and their drinks are spot on. It&apos;s a great date spot. A bonus if you come here for drinks is that you&apos;ll also get some bread! Love bread. As for the menu I would recommend the steak frites. The service has never been poor here. And it really is an absolute pleasure to come here. I hope they stay in business for a very long time."
5,"Came here for lunch on a weekday and was surprised by how many people were in the restaurant. We sat indoors but luckily the space is huge and lovely, so they were able to separate tables easily per COVID guidelines. The restaurant has the feel of a proper french bistro; quite the scene and a good place for both a group of friends and a date. It&apos;s definitely on the pricier side but you&apos;re paying for the ambience. 

To start, we ordered espresso martinis which were strong and delicious. For the food, they brought a stuffed bread basket and were willing to have it toasted for us when we asked for it to be warmed. I then ordered the quiche lorraine and my friend got the french onion soup. The quiche was outstanding, at once light and fluffy and yet decadent with salty bacon bits. My soup was cheesy and filling as well. 

Overall, I really enjoyed my experience. The service was excellent, the food was good, and the ambience was really the star. Would recommend!"
5,"We stopped in at Parc for dinner on a last minute trip to Philly. First of all, I have to say that Philly knows what they are doing when it comes to outdoor dining but we still chose to make reservations for inside hah. 

From the decor to the menu, everything at Parc transports you to a French bistro. We opted to order most of the appetizers and asked our server Zachary to bring them out as he thought best. You know a server is knowledgeable when they take charge in what order to bring out your random assortment of food. 

We had the mushroom and French onion soup, because of course it would be wrong not to. The mushroom tart was wow, something I&apos;ll think about forever. Escargot, perfectly cooked and buttery. Tartar also, delicious and perfectly seasoned. 

All of the food and drinks we ordered were lovely. Service also was a 10/10. Zachary was very attentive and so friendly. 

Would love to return next time we&apos;re in Philly, and highly recommend to anyone looking for that perfect French menu, ambiance and service."
1,"What a wreck. I went in today for my birthday, alone, for lunch. This place clearly wants to impress with French names for things on the menu but it&apos;s nothing special.

I ordered the onion soup which was the best part of my meal. They throw chunks of bread in there before serving which is a nice touch, but it was overpowered with far too much cheese. I wound up gnawing and chewing through massive chunks of it.

I ordered the chicken club, no avocado, and asked that the chicken and bacon be cooked well done because I have autoimmune issues so I don&apos;t take risks. For an &quot;upscale&quot; restaurant they should know how to cook chicken well done without making it tough and chewy, and they clearly did not. Additionally the chicken tasted almost completely unspiced, and the garlic aioli seemed  almost non-present so I was left with a tough/burnt, flavorless sandwich for nearly $20.

The worst part though was that although they aren&apos;t even CLOSE to filled to capacity because of COVID regulations, it took nearly 30 minutes between my soup and my sandwich. After I actually ate the soup, my server came over and took the empty bowl and said my entree was &quot;on the way very soon,&quot; and it was literally 20 minutes before it came out. I am left to wonder if it sat in a heat window for a long time and that&apos;s why it was nearly inedible?

All in all with tip I spent $50 on lunch for $10 worth of food. It was really, really disappointing."
4,"We went to celebrate a birthday and we decided to share a bunch of plates. Overall, a good experience with great service. 

1. Starting off was the complimentary bread which was good but I wish it was served warm. It was accompanied with regular butter.

2. Escargots- It was delicious and the hazelnut butter it was submerged in was amazing. They give three pieces of bread but I recommend saving the complimentary bread they serve to dip in the sauce as well.

3. Steak tartare- The steak was tender and fresh. It was mixed with horseradish which I am not a fan of but my friend really enjoyed this dish. It comes with a small side salad (lettuce with dressing) and honestly that was my favorite part. 

4. Moules Frites- aka the mussels and fries. It was a good dish but I definitely had better mussels elsewhere. The fries were delicious- nice and crispy. 

5. Macaroni Au Gratin- I loved the crispy topping and it was very creamy. They used pasta that looked like long orzo pasta. I think it needed a little bit more salt because it was lacking in flavor. 

Dessert- 
6. Moelleux Au Chocolat- aka lava cake. It was really good. The molten chocolate part tasted like dark chocolate. So get this dish if you like dark chocolate. The hazelnuts gave it a nice crunch. The praline sorbet was a perfect match. There is also a slight saltiness you get as well but it all balances out.

7. Creme Brûlée- torched nicely on top. Creamy inside. Creme brûlée lovers will not be disappointed.

8. Macarons- they give 4 mini macarons which were complimentary because of the birthday! I would not order this though because they were too hard.

I am definitely coming back here to try the other items. It is on the expensive side but I believe it is worth it because of the quality of food you are served. 

Side note: For those making reservations during COVID- if you want to be in an outside tent/private dining bubble, make sure to specify. They have heaters and plant decor!"
4,"I&apos;ve lived in Philadelphia for over 5 years but never got a chance to try out this Starr restaurant. But one crisp fall morning we were feeling Bougie and made reservations. Even with the reservations we had to wait around 35 min since no one was following the 90 min table limit. They did check out temperatures and seated us. We loved the server who took her time to explain the menu and brought out the bread basket. 
We ordered the steak and frites, the burger and a bottle of Prosecco. It was perfectly splendi"
5,"This is our favorite restaurant in the Philadelphia area; we go here all the time because the food is absolutely delicious, always perfectly prepared and served, plus the menu is diverse enough that there&apos;s always something new to try. We visit Europe often and this is a great place to get French bistro/brassierie food on this side of the pond. 

Literally every single thing on the menu is worth having: as with most Stephen Starr restaurants, these dishes have been refined to the n-th degree and are prepared with painstaking precision, meaning that your favorite dishes will always taste the way you remember them. This is not the case with most restaurants.

One of my personal favorites is their signature Moules Frites (steamed mussels and fries), because the mussels are incredibly tasty and the fries are exactly like the ones you&apos;d get in France: very crispy on the outside; soft and creamy on the inside. They&apos;re really the best fries you&apos;ll find anywhere in the US.

We just had dinner their last night and I mentioned that unlike many other restaurants we&apos;ve visited, they never seem to make any mistakes. There are certainly many great restaurants in this area, but few have the consistency of Parc. 

And don&apos;t get me started about desserts! As you&apos;d expect they&apos;re phenomenal. By the way, Molleaux au Chocolate is the original Lava cake, except far more sophisticated and sublime."
5,Make sure to book a reservation because this place is packed - and for good reason. The food is delicious. The atmosphere is comfy. Great and attentive staff. Fantastic experience.
5,"This restaurant really does deserve all of the hype around it. The theme is on point, the food is thoughtful and the service is top notch. The ambiance transports you to a brassiere in Paris. The brunch at Parc is a must for when people are visiting from out of town. The Salmon Tartare, Tuna Carpaccio and Hazelnut Escargot are some of my favorites. Our server recommended the Crab and Avocado dish (pictured) and it is now a favorite. The bread basket that is complementary is addictive, it is made in house and you can never just have one piece. I cannot give this restaurant enough praise. Stephen Starr you have done it again, hat off to you."
5,"Is this place really worth the hype........?!?!

Yes, yes it is.

Having gluten and dairy allergies, I was a little hesitant to come to this fun, French Bistro... lucky for me the kind staff was more than happy to assist me and make sure I felt accommodated. Not to mention, EVERYTHING was delicious.

I am bummed their delish Froze cocktail was just for the summer... but I know they will have something just as good or better come this fall and winter. 

All the salads, salmon brunch, oysters, etc. are to die for. I keep coming back. Amazing location and great, professional service.

Thanks all!"
5,"MY #1 PLACE. Parc, I love you. I&apos;ve had many dates here and it&apos;s my favorite in Philadelphia. Every time I dine here I spend way too much money but never regret it."
4,"Parc is a great place to go if you&apos;re trying to treat yourself. If you look through my reviews you&apos;ll see I tend to gravitate towards restaurants that are cheaper and have a more casual feel, but I went out on a limb for this one with a couple friends. Parc is a fan favorite among them, and it seems that they had reason. The sandwiches got raving reviews (from them) and so did the Mac and cheese, so I&apos;ve been told to recommend those to you

For me - the chicken was fine, but the fries that we&apos;re extra crispy and flavorful. Make sure you get the fries!"
5,"WOW WOW WOW! I forgot how much I loved Parc. Everything from the service, to the outdoor dining, to the food, to the cocktails!! First off - the bread. Holy cow! I could have made a meal strictly off the cranberry walnut bread. We started with the escargot which was an absolute 10. Split a bunch of dishes for our meals....I dream of the warm shrimp salad - it&apos;s so refreshing and so delicious (it&apos;s a must). Our server (I believe his name was Talbert, as it was written on the receipt) was the BEST server I have ever had. I want to take a moment and compliment him. He was genuine, attentive and so knowledgeable on the menu. He truly was so kind and made my sisters birthday very special. I would totally recommend Parc&apos;s outdoor dining experience! It&apos;s difficult to get a reservation but if you can secure one your dining experience will be a 10/10 (very safe, very warm and very cute)."
4,"Pre-covid visit. These days, I could only wish for an experience like Parc, so now I&apos;d give them 4.5 stars! 

We had a nice window seat looking out to the rainy street. The restaurant has a really nice ambiance for dates or group celebrations. The service is excellent as well 

As for the food, we had:

Carrot and beet salad - just okay but the goat cheese tied flavors together nicely
Moules frites - not the best I&apos;ve ever had, but satisfying
Hangar steak - very good
Salmon tartare - excellent
All went perfectly with a glass of cabernet sauvignon and finished with the pot de creme dessert with cappucino 

I would definitely return for the atmosphere and solid food."
5,"Parc has been one of my favorite restaurants in Philadelphia for years. I went here yesterday with my mom and sister for the first time since COVID started. We had a fabulous and safe lunch! 

We were so happy to be seated in one of the chalets. They built personal chalets with cute christmas decorations inside that made the space really pop. Each chalet has heat inside, which was much appreciated on a cold day!

I had the aperol spritz to drink which was refreshing and delicious. The bread was to die for, as always. For my meal, I had the moules-frites, which are mussels in a white wine sauce and fries. Both were fabulous! I really loved the mayo dipping sauce for the fries. For dessert, we split the buche de noel. It was pretty good, but I wish the flavor had more punch to it. I would probably order something different next time, but it is a super cute Christmas dessert.

Overall, I definitely recommend this for a great and safe, socially distant outdoor dining experience. They have done a great job keeping everyone safe while still serving their delicious food!"
4,"3.5 stars. Decent, but not amazing French food somewhat made up for by the great location (and plentiful outdoor eating) overlooking Rittenhouse Park. I&apos;ve enjoyed the macaroni au gratin and ricotta ravioli. The complimentary bread basket (including French baguette) is top notch. 

Overall, a solid but not noteworthy French bistro that is popular for brunch."
4,"Parc is quite infamous in the Philly area, so wanted to come try it out for lunch! Honestly my favorite part of the meal was the free bread; the assortment is great and they all taste great. I asked for some more sourdough at the end of the meal and they straight up gave me HALF A LOAF in a paper bag LOL. I appreciated that.

We ordered:
Onion Soup (4/5): Covered in a huuge layer of melty cheese, I thought this soup was super flavorful but really salty also; you can&apos;t eat too much of it at a time.
Cheeseburger (4/5): It was okay, just a classic burger with fries. I liked the butter lettuce and tomato/caramelized onion.
Spaghetti Bolognese (3/5): I kind of regret getting this, it felt like spaghetti I make myself but I&apos;m not sure what I expecting hahaha. Also too salty for me.

Overall the whole meal was kind of heavy with cheese/salt so I&apos;d recommend getting some salad or something lighter. The bread is also amazing and filling so I&apos;d also order less next time!"
5,"Parc is so classic. One of my go-to&apos;s. I dine here at least once/week. You can always ensure good food, good service, and food people watching. The warm shrimp salad is obviously one of the best salads ever. The bread basket is always amazing. I miss the seafood tower! Now I order all of the raw seafood separately. The trout is phenomenal. 

Parc is overall a classic Rittenhouse staple."
5,"Oh man, what do I say here except I&apos;ve wanted to eat here for awhile.  This mandatory al fresco dining experience was a little different in the pandemic era compared to the care free sunny days of yore.  With most of the city lunch non take out dining options limited my friend and I had to circle back to here as it was the only place that seemed to be open on a slightly rainy Friday at 11am.  K&apos;Far was only doing take out so that brought us here. 

Just lucky to have a seat we received some fresh baked bread to start.  My order was some smoked salmon open faced on a French bread.  It was excellent.  I subbed fries for the regular salad which was a good option.  Had some French roast coffee as well that kept flowing.  Great experience."
