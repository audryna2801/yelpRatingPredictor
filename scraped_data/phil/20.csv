5,"The BEST cheesesteak I have EVER HAD! The hype is well earned.

Was visiting from NC and heard about John&apos;s Roast Pork. I have never been so impressed! Genos and Pats are tourist attractions, I have been there many times but if you want some real cheesesteaks then this is the place to go! 

The menu is limited to cheesesteaks and hoagies but honestly there&apos;s no reason to get anything else. Lines are very long but the staff is super efficient moving people in and out. I was in/out in 20 mins. 

Parking is rough. They are not many street parking spots. They have limited seating options outside, but well worth the trip!

COVID: They are only accepting call in orders. No walk-ups! We called in our order an hour before getting to Philly and it was ready at the exact time they stated. Excellent customer service. 

The locals will tell you John&apos;s Roast Pork is the best and as a tourist I can confirm!"
5,"JRP is by far the best cheesesteak place in the entire city of philadelphia. Starting from the bread as well as in filing, everything is so balanced and flavorful. 

Each bite you take is hardy and juicy; the meat is perfectly cooked along with my choice of onion and American cheese. The best part; price isn&apos;t that steep. For a sandwich this big and delicious, to be less than $10, worth the effort. I drove over an hour to get this and the traffic and frustration that built during the drive was gone as soon as took a bite of the sandwich. 

Can&apos;t forget about the roast pork sandwich (it&apos;s the name of the place). I personally like the cheesesteak better but, if you like the salty and porky taste, you are going to love the roast pork sandwich. Don&apos;t forget that yellow peppers as they balance out the richness of the sandwich. 

They are doing take out only and order by phone. They do have benches on the side which I recommend you eating these while it&apos;s hot so use them!

Again; best cheesesteak place in Philly; highly recommended!"
5,John&apos;s Roast Pork was the bees knees!!! James Beard Award Winning LITERALLY!! They won the award! The sandwiches are excellent!! The roast pork with spinach and provolone was AMAZING! This is the famouser!! The cheesesteak was GREAT! John&apos;s is known for their American Cheese and Sharp Provolone Cheese. They DO NOT do Cheese Wiz. I got my cheesesteak with American Cheese on it. I also tried the Roast Pork sandwich with Mustard and American cheese which I saw on online is the the &quot;owner&apos;s favorite.&quot; All were tasty! This is definitely a TOP SPOT to grab a roast pork sandwich and Philly cheesesteak! It is on all the MUST EAT lists for Philly online. You gotta call ahead during covid to reserve a spot for a sandwich!! These sandwiches are a hot commodity. A lot of people call in for them. I called 8 times before I got through to someone to put my order in! It was definitely worth it!!
5,"After a long, multi-decade traversal across the city of Philadelphia, I believe I&apos;ve found what is the best cheesesteak spot (yet - as of Feb 2021). I&apos;ve always heard about JRP and had it on my bookmarks for years, but for some reason never got around to going there, so lo and behold, several friends and I decided to take a trek to South Philly to try the supposed &quot;king&quot;.

First impressions, family-run joint in a comfortable corner of South Philly. The cheesesteaks themselves? Fairly large, and not to squishy upon first touch. Opening the wrapper, you&apos;re greeted with a crunchy, seeded bun (my first on a cheesesteak) with plenty of meat and cheese within. Each bite was incredible - the solid seeded bun held the meat and cheese together in a delectable cradle until you hit the end - then, despair.

Easily my #1 spot at the time of writing this review, and will definitely be heading back whenever the need or desire arises. Without a doubt a Philly must-see."
4,"They make a damn good cheesesteak.  The best that I&apos;ve ever had.  If the bread didn&apos;t have sesame seeds, it would&apos;ve been perfect.

Can&apos;t wait to go back."
5,"ROAST PORK SANDWICH (with spinach, sharp prov): 4/5. The sandwich itself was a bit too salty for me and the bread was soggy by the time we picked it up, but otherwise it had a unique taste to it, with LOTS of roast pork 

CHEESESTEAK (with mushrooms, american cheese): 5/5. If you had to get one thing from John&apos;s, order the cheesesteak!!! Everything in the sandwich was simply perfect... 

CHICKEN ITALIANO: 5/5. Surprisingly, the Chicken Italiano was better than their signature roast pork sandwich... the chicken was very juicy and tender and not salty, and the spinach accompanied the whole sandwich really well 

ONION RINGS: 3/5. Crispy but really greasy... the oil leaked out of our bag 

PS. ask for bell peppers on the side! Complements the heaviness/creaminess of the sandwich :) 

PPS. order ahead (an hour or so) to avoid long wait times at peak hours"
5,Hello! I&apos;ve been attempting to get in touch on behalf of my client who wants to potentially collaborate. Can one of your team members please email jmassanari@webershandwick.com or call 310-854-8215 to connect? Thank you!!
4,"Called in ahead 30 mins to order, as they took an order over the phone and upon arrival my order was ready.  Quick,  easy and no waiting best of all the transaction was very fast.  The hoogie came on a nice seeded roll with plenty of beef and cheese and a beautiful scent of beef and onions.  Although I couldn&apos;t see the onions, i knew they were there.  Good size portion, now there is no real parking so i just pulled up to the side of the restaurant and while they have benches to eat consume food, i decided to simply eat it in my car."
4,"**COVID19**

I would say this place is one of the best in PHILLY
I&apos;ve tried a lot of different places and if you want something very simple ...I would recommend this place. If you want other stuff on it and make it fancy...then go to the one in Redding terminal cause I liked that place for my fancy cheese steak. 

Funny story but if you want to get subs here during COVID19, CALL BEFORE YOU GO!!!! I&apos;ve seen so many people get mad and yelled and curse at the store as they storm into their car because they had to wait like 1 hour without making any calls"
3,"Judging by the reviews, John&apos;s Roast Pork should really be name John&apos;s Cheesesteaks, and after tasting the roast pork sandwich I would tend to agree.

It is a cool little shack located close to several grocery stores in South Philly that usually has a long line outside. I called ahead and ordered a roast pork sandwich. I sat outside on the benches and ate it (they do have some outdoor seating) expecting to be wowed. It was only... ok. It was a decent size for the price and they were very generous with the meat, but I thought it was far too salty. Even with a drink it was just overpowering and I could only eat half before I had to take the rest. But if salt is your thing, you should try it because it was really good otherwise.

Overall, if you want something super salty, try the roast pork sandwich. If not, try the cheesesteak (which I will definitely be back to try)!"
5,"Hands down - BEST Cheesesteak in Philadelphia. I have yet to find a Cheesesteak of this quality anywhere else in the city. Plus - it&apos;s the only cheesesteak I dream about at night. 

Parking is not bad and definitely recommend going on an off-time. The meat  and onions are cooked and cut to a foodie&apos;s desire, lots of cheese, bun is fresh/soft and not bready because who wants a cheesesteak on a thick roll.

When the cheesesteak sandwich is juicy and this flavorful you have no reason to travel around the city in search of the &apos;perfect Philly cheesesteak.&apos;

You&apos;ll stop here and come back again and again. Trust me."
5,"We got the pork sandwiches delivered through Goldbelly and wow they were delicious the pork was perfectly cooked seasoned and moist , the cheese they use is something we don&apos;t have here in CA it added such a great pungent flavor and don&apos;t skip the spinach even if you think you don&apos;t like spinach your missing the true full flavorful experience if you done have it all. This was the first thing we ordered from Goldbelly and will be ordering from them again for sure."
5,"Owner is a good hearted hard working dude that comes from a long line of cheese steak and roast pork connoisseurs. 

Best cheese steak in Philly. 

Order the cheese steak with American cheese and fried onions. 

Order the roast pork with raw onions and mustard. 

Don&apos;t let the haters get you down John! You guys are doing it right! 

Thick skin! For the win!"
5,"While drive from NYC to NC, I planned on dropping in for my first real Philly cheesesteak and picked John&apos;s given its reputation and location off of I-95. This little foodie mecca had about a 25 minute wait at 2pm but wait I did. 

While the lines can get long, they have an efficient operation here. If you wanted anything but a cheesesteak (roast pork, meatball, etc) you were fast-tracked up front. But I grabbed a fresh cheesesteak and roast pork sandwich for my ride back home. And wow, so good! Lovely sesame seeded roll, about 11&quot; long, stuffed with flavorful steak, provolone and onions. Loved the sliced roast pork that&apos;s simmered in a wine broth and spiked with sharp provolone. You can get it with spinach (not broccoli di rabe) at John&apos;s. 

I devoured half of my two sandwiches (they are big) on my 8 hour ride and then finished them off for lunch the next day. So simple but so good! Hope to get back up here, some day..."
4,"They are open again during COVID! You need to call  ahead and expect to wait at least one hour. Wait outside their front window and your name will be called. 

I&apos;ve tried John&apos;s Roast Pork twice and I&apos;ve had two way different experiences each time. The first time i was disappointed - both the cheesesteak and pork had a very weird taste. They both tasted like they were drowned in a peppery and herby broth. My friend had the same reaction. I decided to give them a second try and had a much better experience. 

You can tell that the cheesesteak had juices coming out of the meat. The sesame roll had a good bite to it and supplemented well. It didn&apos;t blow my mind, but my second taste was good enough to recommend to someone new to town. The roast pork sandwich was very juicy, but was too peppery for my taste, which overpowered the roast pork."
5,"I love Johns roast pork sandwich with greens and sharp provolone.   Thank-you

pork it does a sandwich good!"
5,John&apos;s Roast Pork is my favorite place in Philly to get a Philly.  The pork sandwich has so much flavor and the meat is tender and juicy.  The bread is a nice balance of chewy and soft.  There&apos;s always a line because it&apos;s so good so it&apos;s best to just think of the sandwich while you&apos;re waiting and then you&apos;ll enjoy it that much more.
3,"I was told this was the best in the city. Luckily I only had to call twice to place an order for pickup, the bun was good- meat was more seasoned but why were out of cheese whiz so I had to opt for provolone. Overall I thought it was okay."
5,"Never had anything other than the roast pork and the cheesesteak, but that&apos;s all you need! The ordering system this summer (2020) has been BRUTAL but the sandwiches make everything worth it. You have to call to place your order (good luck during peak times) and they&apos;ll give you a time to pick up your order. Not much street parking but there&apos;s a shopping center across the street with plenty of space.

Food:
Roast Pork Sandwich - 4.5/5 stars - Obviously named after this so its their bread and butter. Super tender pork that&apos;s very juicy. The broth is slightly sweet and extremely salty - could tone it back just a bit. Served with spinach instead of broccoli rabe, which makes it much less bitter than other roast pork sandwiches and puts the focus on the meat itself. If you want some complexity to the sandwich, order it with sharp provolone. The soft roll absorbs all the juices and has a nice crust on the outside, helping hold the sandwich together.

Cheesesteak - 5/5 stars - Has all the elements of a great cheesesteak and is definitely one of my favorites. The meat is tasty and doesn&apos;t have tough pieces like some other places. I used to prefer whiz but John&apos;s has turned me into an american cheese fan (they only offer american, mild provolone and sharp provolone). The cheese is melted throughout the sandwich so you never have a cheeseless bite. The onions are good and its all served on that perfect roll with a soft inside and good crust on the outside to support it."
5,"Best roast pork in Philly hands down! My sandwich was delicious with amazing  flavor, great meat / cheese ratio, and the bread was super fresh and soft. Get there early because they sell out quickly. Take my word for it, you&apos;ll love it!"
