5,Kraftwork is just terrific. The ambience is lovely. Pretty much every thing that we ordered was extra fresh and delicious. Whenever I think the workers can not possibly top themselves they do. Definitely a great find for us.
4,"Came here for dinner. They have outdoor seating with a few heaters. Great beer menu and a couple of cocktails. We were in mood for a burger and they only have house burger on menu, can add one topping with paying for more. Burger comes with fries or salad. Tasty shoestring fries.  Burger is a huge portion, well done burger. Wish they had more variety but that&apos;s ok."
4,"I was looking for a brunch place and this came up in my search. I liked the menu and decided to give it a try. Upon walking in, we were seated right away. The dishes we ordered off the brunch menu were a burger and the tortilla ensalada. Both were delicious, flavorful and good value for the price. I also ordered the party jam strawberry beer and really enjoyed it. Overall a great place to grab brunch!"
5,Michael was the best waiter. He gave the upmost consideration. Tailored our experience per each customers requests.
5,Kraftwork proved to be a hit for my group of three and my mini-me. We almost did not come here since people reported it is not good for families. I 100% disagree. Everyone was warm and friendly to Nora. High chairs were available and children&apos;s cups. They even changed the TV to Cat in the Hat without being asked. Nora had the hummus plate and their side of chicken. The hummus was definitely house made and pita was perfect for her little hand and dipping. She enjoyed every bite. For my dinner I had the Tortilla Ensalada and it was both flavorful and beautiful. The kale and rice blend were layered for great visual effect. The staff was very pleasant and engaging with our group. While no there is no &quot;kids menu&quot; and yes they specialize in Craft beers do no hostage to bring in your family.
3,The one thing that stood out to me here was the service. Our waiter was super friendly and helpful. We also had a child with us and they were very kid-friendly. They did have high chairs available. I personally got the asparagus salad with chicken. I thought the food was just ok. I didnt realize the chicken was going to be shredded. I thought it was going to be a piece of grilled chicken. My friends did enjoy their tortilla ensalada.
2,"My first 2 star review. Dinner is ok here but just had a terrible experience at brunch. Out of our table  of six, one person&apos;s meal came out super late and didn&apos;t have silverware when it arrived. My boyfriend has celiac disease and specifically asked for toast on the side so I could eat it and the waitress confirmed it would. The meal came and it did not come on the side and he couldn&apos;t eat half of his meal because of the cross contamination. Then, two of my friends didn&apos;t get their drinks until we asked another server to get them."
5,"We wanted a burger with some drinks and decided to give this place a try. We made a great decision! Great food and great customer service. I also like the way the place is designed with the original bricks. I ordered the cauliflower bites as an app, and the Kraftwork burger with caramelized onions, sharp cheddar cheese and guacamole. Both items were great. The burger was so juicy and the cheese was so savory. The fries were just mmmmmm. The cauliflower bites came with a spicy sauce which was amazing. I have to add that they have a enormous selection of kraft beer (even though, I am not a beer drinker). They also have wine and specialty drinks! Please don&apos;t sleep on this place"
5,Great place with yummy food. We went mid day on Saturday and it was super easy to find a seat. I told my waiter I liked super sweet drinks and he sweetened a cocktail just for me. Overall good and relaxed place to get a bite to eat.
4,"Things I Recommend at Kraftwork:

1. Calling ahead if you have 11 people. Probably a good idea anywhere. We had to split into two tables because you can&apos;t just walk in at prime brunchtime and expect an open table for 11. 

2. The fries. I was told they were the best fries in the world. I disagree. They are very good fries, but I think Donkey Kong is the best game ever.

3. Beer. They have a lot of it, and you should drink it. I had an excellent Founders gose, but you do you. Also, the bloody mary is very solid.

4. The roasted beet salad. Everyone likes goat cheese fritters, and if you eat beets you can all talk about the fun colors in your poop the next day. (Yes, we&apos;re delightful conversationalists.)

5. The fried chicken and waffles. With two eggs, it&apos;s a gigantic, delicious meal.

6. Telling the server that your parents are sitting at the other table, and they will be paying for your table as well.

Things I Don&apos;t Recommend at Kraftwork:

1. The beer can chicken sandwich. It wasn&apos;t bad, really it was just a little bland and the pulled chicken wasn&apos;t really what I was expecting (and I almost broke my tooth on a bone lost in there). Then again, I don&apos;t know what I was expecting. Either way, if you&apos;re in a chicken mood go for the chicken and waffles.

2. Telling the server that your parents are sitting at the other table, and that they will be paying for your table as well...unless that&apos;s actually true. This can get you in trouble.

3. Chatting the server up about the origins of electronica in the krautrock scene. They don&apos;t know what you&apos;re talking about, and you sound like a dick. Yeah, I&apos;m talking to you."
4,"I came here for lunch with Nora S. and we loved the atmosphere. The entire layout has different gears and turbines, even as the table legs as if you were really in an old craftsman&apos;s shop.  Just overall very chill and fun vibes.

The only thing to be careful about is that the service can be slow during lunch. It took a while for everyone to get their food, but I have to say the food is well worth the wait. We decided to split two salads between us, so that we could try the different options.

The arugula and beet salad is incredible. The dressing is perfect and the fried goat cheese will blow your mind. It is not your typical bar food, but so delicious and the ultimate summer salad! 

I also tried the tortilla salad which comes on top of two fried tortillas that are sandwiched between bean dip.  To me, it&apos;s the healthy alternative to nachos. Very yummy and will fill you up!"
2,"I didn&apos;t have high expectations because I didn&apos;t really have any at all. My husband and I were going back and fourth on where to go in Fishtown today for brunch and we decided here on a complete whim. When we first walked into Kraftwork we both started laughing because it smelled exactly like a Chipotle. Weird. We opted to sit outside because it was so nice. We were told to sit anywhere close to the building. The tables were nice and spacious.

The menu was decently big. I really wanted a salad, but both options they had didn&apos;t stand out to me. We ordered a round of bloody Mary&apos;s for starters and I had about four sips of mine and stopped drinking it. It was pretty bad. Very thick and overly spicy. My husband couldn&apos;t finish his either. For my meal I ended up choosing the veggie omelette. The spinach inside was very good but that was really it. The tomatoes were definitely not fresh and the fried hash was veryyyyy greasy. Also they brought out the wrong food to us and then had us wait a while before they brought anything else out to us.

A plus is that they have a good amount of vegetarian options!"
4,"Absolutely adore this place, just wish it was a tad cheaper, but the food is always worth it, and the atmosphere and vibe are always great"
5,"Was happy to find this neighborhood gem! Great place dinner and drink after work. Pretzel bites are very soft and fresh. The tortilla ensalada is my favorite dinner item on the menu; must get for salad loving vegetarians. Many of there beers on the menu were not available, but they still had an extensive menu. The peanut butter chocolate ice cream dessert is SO good and a large portion size (more than enough for 2)!"
3,"I remember coming here back in 2010 and loving it. Now not so much, I don&apos;t think anything has changed, it&apos;s always had a great beer selection that is a real plus. But it seems like the food menu has barely changed in ten years. Which isn&apos;t inherently bad, but it does seem like they are on autopilot and phoning the food in of late. I live down the street from here and eat out a lot, we regularly do that thing where we list off restaurants that we might want to go to and it&apos;s always a no for Kraftwork. Maybe they were never that good, there was just no competition in 2010"
4,"This place was heaven! The pirogies were delicious and the prime rib, French onion soup was delightful. Big kudos also to the bartender. He made a perfect old fashion. The only downside was the fried mozzarella app. It was overly smoky and we didn&apos;t finish it. Finally, service was great."
4,"It&apos;s been a while since I visited. But I now live in the area and wanted to give a local bar/restaurant some attention. 
I do like the fact that the atmosphere was just a pleasant. Casual and comfortable. I&apos;ve always remembered Kraftwork for the craft cocktails and great tap selections. 
Food has always been very well prepared. Always fresh ingredients and attention to detail. This is not as common at comparable businesses. 
To summarize, this visit was very pleasant. Not disappointed with all I&apos;ve known about before. 
The only negative I found was that my bartender was not customer centric. He appeared like he was not into working during my time there.  Maybe he was just having a bad day or he hates this job? Everyone else was very courteous and accommodating in my observation. 
I will definitely come back again and again."
5,"My absolute favorite brunch spot in fishtown! They have the best Bloody Mary&apos;s around-have the perfect kick to them. I&apos;m having major withdrawal from the kraftwork breakfast! I also recommend the wings and tender french onion sandwich The staff is always a pleasure. The female bartender (Dae? D? Sorry can&apos;t remember the name :/) is amazing- so friendly, attentive, genuine, and fun. Can&apos;t wait to get back."
5,Consistently good food. Their weekend brunch is their specialty in my opinion. The eggs benedict and chicken and waffles are outstanding. Cocktails are tasty too.  Staff is always friendly and courteous.
5,"This is a hip gastropub in Fishtown with an excellent choice of local craft beers and tasty pub grub. 
The staff are very friendly and &quot;beer knowledgeable.&quot;
It has a comfortable industrial decor. 
We have tried several items on the menu and have been impressed with all. 
Try the crispy Pierogis appetizer! Very yummy."
