5,"I loved the tomato poblano soup. That was my favorite one. 
Next was the other soup I can&apos;t remember I think it&apos;s the consume. 
I got the steak flank tacos and chicken tacos and everything was delicious ! Guac and chips too ! 
I am sad not to dine in like I used to but ah well. I remember the days of margaritas tacos and watching Football (soccer games) 
I can&apos;t believe I haven&apos;t posted until now but worth the pick up and take away. 
Dreaming of their poblano soup again"
5,I stopped here for lunch. They have outdoor seating along with heaters and they practice social distancing. The food was delicious as always and it&apos;s definitely worth visiting. If I lived closer to this place I would eat here more often.
5,"Blue Corn is one of my favorite restaurants and everything that I&apos;ve had there has been incredible, but I had their oyster tacos as a special last night and can&apos;t stop talking about them. The fried oysters were delicious and paired perfectly with the chayote slaw, but the real star was the huitlacoche sauce and avocado slice that played perfectly off each other to enhance the oyster flavor. It was brilliant. 

Blue Corn has amazing margaritas and delicious food, but the care and thought that they put into even basic dishes is unparalleled. I don&apos;t know if I&apos;ll ever enjoy any nachos as much as theirs, complete with cilantro microgreens. I haven&apos;t eaten in there since the pandemic but have been making frequent use of their takeout services and have never been disappointed."
4,"If you are ever craving a night to head out grab some margs - look no further!

Their marg options here are ridiculous - so many different flavors. Lots of fun. 

They have a very traditional menu for their mexican cuisine, but also feature some unique plates. You can&apos;t go wrong with any of the tacos, but the highlight of their menu to me is the cubana (it is not what you think it is.) Imagine a cuban sandwich on steroids...this bad boy has egg, sausage and other yummy toppings with the usual suspects ham and cheese.

Lots of color inside the restaurant, super bright and inviting. Great music too.

Super casual, very laid back."
4,"Quarantine Post!

They do have plenty of outdoor seating making this a quick easy spot. CASH ONLY! The service here is impressive for a quaint restaurant. Each server asked us about our experience about 3 times, so depends on you if that is too much. The food is definitely very authentic and they always have a special menu. We got the taquiza among two people and an appetizer. It was plenty of food and I have to say the blue chips and sauce were delicious! The skirt steak, chorizo and chicken each had its own unique flavor and seasoning which was great. Each taco was packed with meat. I would recommend coming here for the reasonable prices, good service and tasty food."
5,"Everything is simple but good, and very affordable. Try their blue corn specialty tacos."
1,My regular 9th street burrito place was not open for some strange reason so I tried Blue Corn.  I ordered a chorizo burrito and they gave me the option for fries or salad with my burrito.  Since I have a potato allergy I picked the salad although I didn&apos;t think it was necessary to tell them about the allergy.  I get home with my burrito and the thing was covered in fries!  I scraped off all the fries and the parts of the burrito that touched the fries and ate the remainder.  This burrito had no flavor at all.  It was dry - no sauce whatsoever in the thing.   Mostly white rice with what appeared to be frozen peas and corn.  Some chorizo and not much else.  It was much more expensive than my regular place.  I am stunned this place has all these good reviews.

Having heard a lot of great things about this South Philly/Italian Market spot I stopped by on a Sunday afternoon for some tacos. I was seated immediately and to their credit, they had signs plastered right at the door that they were &quot;cash only&quot; and they do have an ATM inside. It&apos;s a pretty normal interior with TVs playing a soccer game at the bar sort of vibe. Anyway, I was just there for the food so I got right down to business. After perusing the menu, I knew that I wanted tacos and I knew that I wanted the &quot;Blue corn&quot; tortillas for sure. The waiter then came up and listed some specials to me and I went with their mahi mahi tacos which he said came with avocado. SOLD! 

I requested if they could make it with the blue corn tortilla instead of the flour tortilla and he told me he would try. I didn&apos;t have to wait to long, the tacos came rolled up and tied with a little string or rather a piece of cornhusk and they were indeed the blue corn ones. The order came with three tacos, I proceeded to eat two and boxed one up. It was all good up until then.

Then the check came and I was pretty surprised at the price, my meal was around $16.50 and with the tip I ended up paying $20. I did not know the price before hand because the specials were not on the menu. I guess I should have expected it. I don&apos;t know. I&apos;m not someone who usually complains about the prices but, were they the best tacos I&apos;ve had in Philly? No! Were they good? Yes! Were they worth the price I paid? I don&apos;t think so! So, I guess what I&apos;m saying is, Take it or leave it. Because there are a lot of really great places to get tacos in the neighborhood, where it doesn&apos;t cost as much. I cannot in my right mind rate this place a 4 but I would give it a 3.5 if that were an option."
4,"I got the Al Pastor tacos.

The tortillas were fresh and hot. The pork was well executed, though could have been slightly more tender. The pineapple and pork flavors were well balanced. The tacos came with a big cooked onion which was very savory and nicely executed."
5,Best tacos in town. We got the skirt steak and lengua. Each order was around $12 and were filling and crammed with meat. It was very well seasoned and their salsa was so fresh and citrusy. Awesome experience.
4,"Cash only but there&apos;s an ATM in the restaurant. 

This place isn&apos;t spacious. Tables are close to each other. Came in on Sunday night and it was packed. I made reservations through Google, so convenient.

The complimentary blue corn chips is served with red and green salsa

I started with cactus salad. It&apos;s very delicious. Cactus is perfectly cooked, fresh and not soggy with perfect amount of olive oil. It&apos;s served with very mild cheese cut in very small dice. It&apos;s a good appetizer.

Salmon in lemon sauce is served with creamy sauce with rice and fresh steamed broccoli and sliced carrots. Salmon is on the well done side so it&apos;s a little bit overcooked. The lemon is subtle but perfect compliment to the salmon.

My husband had tuna which is special menu. It&apos;s served with beets and sugar cane. Since it&apos;s Christmas time, it&apos;s decorated with a poinsettia. No wonder I  noticed that the poinsettia in the kitchen was bald by the end of the night. My husband really enjoyed his entree.

For dessert we ordered lava cake. It&apos;s served with strawberry ice cream and diced mango. I was very disappointed when I cut the cake because I didn&apos;t find the oozing melted chocolate flowing down from the center of the cake. It&apos;s basically only a warm chocolate cake. That&apos;s why I took a star down because it&apos;s definitely not a lava cake.

Service was great. The waiter gave great descriptions on the specials.

Nice presentation of the food too."
5,not only was the food here the best mexican food me &amp; my boyfriend ever had- the service was just amazing as well!! Drinks and food came out so quick and the staff was super attentive and accommodating..My boyfriend got the pastor tacos which he says were the best tacos he ever got &amp; i got a chicken quesadilla and a mac and cheese side which was sooooo delicious! Our server was Edwin so shout out him for being the nicest and most polite/attentive server i have ever had!!
4,"This is a small Mexican restaurant located in the Italian Market.  The inside is quite clean and one of the nicer looking Mexican restaurants in this area.  The service is amazing.  It almost reminds me of staff at a resort in Mexico. 

Anyway, I got a breakfast platter with eggs and ham and the blue corn tacos.  The tacos were tasty but was greasy and made the tortilla break apart. 
The food is not bad, but there are better places within walking distance to get tacos or brunch platters.  

I would go here if I wanted a nicer sit down restaurant to eat Mexican food, but would rather probably skip this place and go to Veracruzana down the block."
5,"Great service, clean, delicious al pastor tacos, yummy hot salsa. There&apos;s limited outdoor aeating and they have heaters that Gelo with the cold."
5,"I am guilty of entry indecision everytime I stand betwixt the Blue Corn * Villa di Roma vortex. Como el perro de las dos tortas, a dinner at one is tinged with regret for what i missed next door. If you run through Philly&apos;s Italian Market recall this one-two punch rings bells.

Now, based on decisions this past year, Blue Corn is go-to on Mondays. This not meant as a jab at Roma- but they no longer weigh in seven nights a week. No problemo since Blue Corn has hooks in me deep.

I am drawn to the blue hued interior, glassware that comfortingly refracts light, craft platters that accent seafood, and a spotless kitchen overseen by multi-lingual staff. Family ownership at Blue Corn ensures routine perfection is never mundane. There is boundless positive energy here. Footy on the telly.

I am astounded every meal I&apos;ve had here is better than the last. I cannot emphasize this enough: order the lamb special when available; also off-the-menu fish tacos make a mockery of best of Baja. 
Savory sauce + fried fish + soft tortilla transports me from the wackest winter to blue sky beach. Complimented by an amaretto colada or two and you&apos;re feeling very yachty. 

I can spend a lifetime noshing here. I view the food quality consistently on par with Frontera nationally. Personalized service here is professional and orderly. Every plato is downright elegante. 

Special note to the turkey mole that expands consciousness. I didn&apos;t even know you could order that bird in fine establishments; the cut here is tender and delicious. All their sauces are ridiculous. 

Multiple hot sauces, roja, verde, cocktail, tinga- the list goes on and on. I can&apos;t stop dipping their blue chippies. A simple side of rice here is literally my favorite food ever.

Blue Corn justifies a splurge but reminder: Cash Only."
4,"tl;dr this unpretentious taquieria in the Italian Market serves up some mean tacos, although serve leaves something to be desired

In a city not renowned for Mexican fare, Blue Corn is a diamond in the rough. This colorful restaurant that makes you feel right at home, with minimalistic wooden tables, pre-set simply with folded napkins and maroon placemats. The small bar nestled in the back has shelf upon shelf of liquor options. A long mirror hangs on one wall, opposite cultural memorabilia and portraits on the other. Two TVs are hanging in opposite corners, broadcasting soccer games.

My partner and I eagerly stopped by last weekend, looking forward to discovering what the buzz is about. We opted for the Tripe Tacos, Mixed Gorditas plate, and a side of cactus salad. Our bellies grumbled as we met the aroma of each dish passing our table. After a slightly longer-than-anticipated wait, our food was finally unveiled. The tacos were out of this world -- the bright green corn tortillas were stuffed generously with rich, well-seasoned (and surprisingly not-chewy) tripe. I also was keen on adding the cactus, mixed with caramelized onions, for added dimensions of texture and flavor. The gorditas, meanwhile, were piping hot, overflowing with marinated meat and tangy cheese. While I&apos;m not the biggest fan of gorditas, I found these to be well-cooked and hearty without being overwhelmingly starchy.

While the food was solid, service was mediocre at best. Our waiter forgot to bring out chips and salsa, leaving us waiting ravenously for our dishes. Also, while he topped off my barely touched glass of water once while he took our order, he neglected to do so again until we had already paid the check. Nonetheless, the relatively cheap prices ($26 total) and remarkably tasty food, Blue Corn will remain in my comfort food repertoire."
5,"If you&apos;re in South Philly, find your way to Blue Corn. Everything here is made fresh. I got the ceviche for an appetizer and goat tacos for my meal. Both were enjoyed with a couple of margs. My friends loved their meals as well and I found it a bonus that it was a family run local restaurant."
5,"Wow!!!!!! This place is amazing! Very! Very! Great service! Servers are amazing! I had gone to very expensive mexican restaurants and the service was never good. 

This place has amazing waiters that will tell you their specials and food is
Amazing! My bf and I sat outside and we were greeted by a waiter really fast! 

Food is amazing! I will definitely will be coming back to this place and I am happy we found this place as we walk around Philly!"
5,"This place never fails to deliver great food. Awesome cocktails like the Bloody Maria, Mezcal Margarita and Michalda make this place even better. The new&apos;ish outdoor seating for Covid is nice and let&apos;s you be off the busy sidewalk. The staff is always so nice too. Check out their brunch if you haven&apos;t already!"
3,"They brought out some free chips and salsa after we ordered. The two salsas were very interesting. The dark red one was a little smoky and a little hot. The green was a bit more fruity but also hot. Not what I am used to eating chips with. The salsa are kind of liquidy and don&apos;t have much substance to it or any flavor really. Oh well. It was free. 

The nachos were good. It is your standard restaurant styled nacho plate except someone shot it with a shrink ray. Flavor was good I just wish it was bigger. 

The gorditas were not great. The fried pocket had no flavor. The cheese had a nice texture and mouthfeel and the pork inside had no flavor either. Did the price of salt/seasoning skyrocket or something? Why are they holding out on me?

The tacos were the only thing I would order again if I came here. Decent portion size and the flavor was good. Tender juicy pieces of chicken with potato on a blue corn tortilla. Loved it

Also! This place is cash only. So hit your bank&apos;s atm beforehand."
