4,"Ok where to start. Did a takeout order while the indoor dining area was still closed due to restrictions. So this review is strictly about the food:

Carne asada quesadillas: They were 10/10. Comes with sour cream, tomatoes and lettuce on the side to spread. The steak was so tender, juicy and flavorful. Completely blew away my expectations. Definitely getting this again next time I go.

Carne asada nachos: As mentioned above, the steak comes from the finest of cow and tasted just as delicious atop a set of cheesy/crispy chips with beans, jalepenos among other toppings. However, next time I HAVE to try the Nachos de Kenzo, father forgive me for missing this treasure on the menu. Mouth watering thinking about it.

TACOS: So we had the mandatory tasting of al pastor tacos along with carnitas, shrimp tacos and asada. My California home-date wasn&apos;t impressed by the tacos but I was a fan of the pastor and asadas.

Overall, the food was very enjoyable. Looking forward to coming back for some more of that premium asada as well as the Nachos de Kenzo and whatever else might float my boat that day."
5,"Dude!!! Tacos are legit! And I&apos;m from SoCal originally... ordered for takeout during quarantine and got a pitcher of fairlane, nachos de kenzo, and a variety of tacos bc we wanted to try them ALL! Fave taco was carne asada (didn&apos;t taste like authentic carne asada seasoning but it was delicious!) second was al pastor then carnitas then fried fish. Everything was super tasty. The al pastor and carnitas were the closest to authentic Mexican tacos but everything was so yummy including the cocktail."
5,such good vegan food - this is my go-to take out spot because they never seem to miss
5,"Off the charts praise for this places. I&apos;ve lived here three weeks and it&apos;s all that I can do to not order here all the time. Having said that I&apos;ve ordered here three times- to be clear I don&apos;t order in food or eat out often at all. This place is so amazingly worth it though. My favorite are the veg nachos. I love their mushrooms! Great substitute for meat is that&apos;s your preference.  I lean plant based but when it comes to it, I&apos;ll eat pretty much anything if it&apos;s worth it. I chose the veg dishes because they are absolutely worth it!!!  I&apos;ve had a couple of the meat tacos and can vouch for those too.  I mean honestly I&apos;ve tried a variety of things and all of them have been outstanding. Everything has been fresh, high quality and flavorful.  Nothing is over the top - just well executed. 
It doesn&apos;t hurt that this place is less than 10 minute walk from my place so at least I don&apos;t feel as guilty - I get some steps in.  
Also should mention they have a great beer selection and I tried a to go margarita. They could have skimped on the to go marg- but they didn&apos;t. It was excellent."
5,"One of my favorite things about Loco Pez is: the tacos are charged by the taco. I love mix and matching and trying a variety, and I have yet to eat one I do not like.

If you are going for brunch, do yourself a favor and order the TOTchos. You will thank me, and for that I say you&apos;re welcome. They are everything you need when eating brunch, even an egg. I&apos;d say it&apos;s perfect for 2-4 people depending on how much other food you plan on ordering. 

The red and green rice is just something so new and different. Rice is easy to make at home, but when you&apos;re out to eat you want something special, and that is exactly what it is, special! 

Looking for gluten free options? They are made on corn tortillas and can guide you towards which taco options are okay for you. Yes, they have vegan options as well. 

Happy eating!"
1,"A la pinche verga wey que gentrification a esto pobre tacos. This place is horrible, some of the blandest &quot;Mexican&quot; food I&apos;ve ever had. The pastor felt like it had Dole canned pineapple slime doused on top of whatever slim pickings carne they so frugally decided to actually put inside my taco. My stomach is turning while I attempt to formulate how badly this place ruined my opinion of people who thought recommending Loco Pez was even remotely passable, but I&apos;ll keep on..

The carnitas burrito? Where. To. Begin? Tasted like mashed playdough with something resembling pernil asado nuked just in time for my delivery. The beans brought me back to when I was in elementary school and the cafeteria lady whipped whatever was left from Mystery Meat Monday for Taco Tuesday. Whatever was inside my burrito, were not beans.

This place is good enough for Fishtown, where they probably know they can get away with serving up repurposed Taco Bell."
5,Great location although please get some heaters for the outdoor booth area. It&apos;s freezing. Awesome guacamole made fresh and delicious carne asada. Tasty homemade salsas too. They&apos;re taking credit card right now as well.
1,"We had a terrible dinner delivered at least 2 tacos were missing, all of the tortillas were broken and the meat tacos barely had onion and cilantro. We called to get a sense of why things were so terribly packaged. And the person on the other end was not helpful at all. Deflecting and unapologetic. 

We basically had deconstructed tacos ‍ and paid $50 for them. Never again"
1,"We did a mobile delivery order being as though the restaurant was less than 10 minutes away from us. We were highly disappointed once we received our order, first everything was mushed together.. seriously. They put the beef and pork tacos in one container and we had 3 shrimp and 2 fish tacos which looked like they just threw into a circle container. You really couldn&apos;t tell which was which. Secondly, the corn tortillas were all broken.. those of you who eat tacos know usually when you order tacos they come with two corn tortillas as they do break easily... not here. 

Okay, next $10 for a small container of Guacamole... that&apos;s fine except they literally only gave us a handful of chips to go with this... the flavor was another thing the meat and fish tacos lacked seasoning. However, the shrimp ones were good. And the tacos were supposed to come with onions and cilantro, see the photos with this review as there was none on the meat tacos just a bunch of radishes. 

Overall, we were extremely disappointed with this order. The prices are a bit aggressive (each taco being $4+) and the quality/flavor was lacking. They need to re-evaluate their packaging if they are offering take out/ delivery options. Bonus: When we called to address our dissatisfaction the employee blamed it on the delivery, never apologized and told us if we re-ordered they would make sure to &quot;fix&quot; it."
4,"I gave Loco Pez a 4 star because of the Nachos DE Kenz. These nachos were delicious and had everything on it as a topping-- cheese, refried bean, sour cream, jalapeños, pico de Gallo, and three types of meat. It is a huge portion that could basically be a meal for two people. Costs $15. 
We came around 4 on Sunday and it was fairly busy. Service wasn&apos;t the quickest. 
The tacos were just average-- I like the ones I get from my taco trucks more."
3,"Food: Got an al pastor taco and the chicken taco. The al pastor was super juicy and tender! Chicken was just okay, a little overcooked. My friends and I shared the in-house secret special that&apos;s not even on the menu, tachos (tater tot nachos). Portion was a little small, but the eggs on top were well cooked.

Interior: Not suitable for large parties, but cute place to check out with a few friends.

Service: Very friendly and when we asked for her recommendations, she knew her stuff!"
5,Came here yesterday and had a late taco lunch... amazing Gabacho tacos!  Had a fun convo with Lindsay about their new brunch and came back today.... this was the best huevos rancheros I&apos;ve ever had and I was born and raised in SoCal..... do not miss their brunch!!!!
3,Ok tasting food with a variety of menu options to choose from. Price was reasonable. Covid takeout precautions in place
2,"I wanted to try this place because my roommate recommended it. Honestly not thrilled. 

I went with a friend who brought in a slice of pizza and we ordered a burrito, app, and drinks, hoping it would be OK for him to enjoy his pizza there too. I know we should have assumed it&apos;s not OK to bring in any food from another place, but several staff members saw us walk in and didn&apos;t say a word. It wasn&apos;t until they brought my steak burrito (which was just okay by the way) that my friend took a bite of his pizza. He was told he couldn&apos;t eat it there, and  there was just no bargaining.  The situation left a bad taste. I quickly finished my burrito and we left.

The waitress was very nice an apologetic, but the situation was awkward. I wouldn&apos;t go back to this place."
5,looove loco pez. vegan nachos for $5??? happy hour pitchers of margaritas?? can&apos;t go wrong
4,"Love loco pez food. Normally get it delivered and it&apos;s great quality. I always get the pollo quesadillas, waffles fries, guac. Only 4 stars because sometimes the guac comes a little brown. But overall solid spot!"
5,"This is my favorite taco place ever! Every time I&apos;m in Philly I try to come here. Honestly, don&apos;t come here because it will ruin tacos for you forever. Nothing compares (I have looked). I have tried all their tacos here and the pollo is the best so now I only get those. I wouldn&apos;t come for $1 tacos (declared on the Facebook and Instagram pages) because it&apos;s super busy and worth paying the marginal amount more on a normal day. The tacos are small and simple and cheap. The chicken tacos come only with onion, cilantro, radishes, and a lime. The homemade sauces are all amazing. I love the verde one!

Their drinks are also amazing. The coup de ville marg is super good with the blood orange flavor.

This place is definitely quirky inside. The art is strange and it is super hipster but it&apos;s fun. It&apos;s a cool bar and super dark. If you feel brave try the 20 taco challenge and get on the Gordo Board. The record is just over 2 minutes!

I wish they would open a loco pez wherever I move!"
5,We eat here on the reg. Wonderful nachos and great prices. Thank you for making great food!
5,"Hi there, what was that? I didn&apos;t hear you over my loud chewing from these dank a$$ tacos. 

This place has a unique dive bar like vibe. They have great priced tacos ($2-$3) that are simple and delicious. Cash only but if you forget you&apos;ll be greeted with signs overhead that say things like &quot;cash only bitches&quot; lol. 

Chips and salsa is priced wonderful and is delicious too. We added salt and used their myriad of hot sauces to spice things up. 

Definitely a go to for tacos in Fishtown area"
3,"I&apos;ve hear so many good things about this place, I finally came here during happy hour. 

It&apos;s a dive bar ambiance, everyone looked so laidback. I had to waited about 10 mins to get a table, but the server would take your name and your phone #, so when you table is ready, you will get noticed through text. 

Yes, their margarita $4 and nachos $5 are the best deal for happy hour. Very good margarita, huge yet delicious nachos for just $5! You can&apos;t beat this deal! 

My friend and I ordered some tacos, unfortunately, tacos are just mediocre.

I will definitely come back for their happy hour (M-F 4pm-7pm), they also have happy hour on weekends 1pm-3pm, I think. 

Highly recommended for their happy hour, not the food though."
