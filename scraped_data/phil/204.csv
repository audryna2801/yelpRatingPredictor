5,Absolutely delicious bagels! You won&apos;t be able to get their unique flavors (bagels and cream cheese!) elsewhere. My favorite bagel shop to come back to.
4,"Cleaver name. Pretty good bagels. I&apos;m somewhat biased since I at one time lived in North Jersey and had simply the best bagels within walking distance...but I digress. 

Their online ordering is simple and easy. Place it and it&apos;s ready in no time at all. You can&apos;t enter but there is someone at the front that will get your order for you. Washington Square Park is right across the street. On a nice day, it&apos;s perfect to sit here and enjoy a bagel...even though I can enjoy a good bagel anywhere. 

My Togarashi w/lime scallion cream cheese was a unique combo. The bagel is a good size - not too big, not too doughy, but tasty enough. I wasn&apos;t sure about the scallion/lime combo but it works well. And they are generous with that cream. 

Definitely different than the Jersey bagels I am used to but I liked it. I&apos;ll leave the cheesesteaks to you Philly, just leave the bagels to Jersey ;)"
4,"Joy in a bagel!  I&apos;m so delighted to live so close to an awesome bagel place. I ordered the lox, cucumber, and cream cheese (light) on an everything bagel. The bagel was crispy on the outside and had a lovely flavor. I wish the inside were a tad softer though (and this is totally unfair, but the last lox bagel I had was in NYC and I think I&apos;m subconsciously comparing the two LOL) All in all, it was delicious and filling, and I definitely hope to return to try a few more that caught my eye. Perfect weekend pick me up :)

Ordering online was super easy and convenient and the folks there are so kind--I walked my dog to pickup my food, and he loved the love and attention. Dog approved!"
2,"Bagels were incredibly tough and made for bad sandwiches. What gets me the most is the refuse to take in person orders and automatically include a hefty 20% tip that is snuck in. I rarely rate this low, but they know exactly what they&apos;re doing."
2,"$10 for a half dozen scrawny ones. I won&apos;t call them bagels, they don&apos;t look like bagels. 
The good, the outside has a nice crisp shell but there is no soft inside doughy goodness that a bagel should have. The bagel hole was bigger than the bagel so there is no room for my favorite topping, diced tomato. One and done for me."
4,"There are more and more bagel shops popping up in the city recently, but Knead has been around for a while. They differentiate themselves by having some unique bagel and cream cheese varieties. My favorite is the togarashi bagel, which is kind of an exotic version of an everything bagel. The sandwiches are really solid and won&apos;t break the bank, compared to some of the other bagel places around."
5,"Ok so I only recently started eating bagels as I always thought they were terrible donuts. Yes, I know, I was woefully wrong and I will be the first to admit it. Places like Knead Bagels are what&apos;s really turning me over to the bagel scene. Bagel&apos;s aren&apos;t a bad donut but a bread alternative!

Anyway, I came here for a quick bite and they had such an interesting array of bagels. What caught my eye was their bagel of the day which happened to be a lavender bagel with lavender honey cream cheese spread. I have such a soft spot for lavender flavored things that I knew I had to try it. 

I have to admit, it took me a while to eat it so I didn&apos;t have it fresh and hot. Even then, it was an amazing bagel and the flavors worked surprisingly well. The lavender was light but added a nice floral hint to the bagel and to me was a great addition to the dense, slightly salted bagel. The spread was amazing as well, honey and lavender just work so well together and of course on this bagel only made things better. It wasn&apos;t overly sweet and the bit of salt enhanced the flavors all around.

If you&apos;re in the Philly area definitely check this place out for a quick bite or a quiet place to set up and study!"
4,"This is a place where you can let your bagel freak flag fly.  So many interesting combos it would take a long time to try them all so dont be afraid to get creative with your oder.

Today I tried the Lox on a togarashi bagel with scallion and lime cream cheese.  It was the perfect combo of smokey, salty, tangy, and creamy.  The bagel itself was nice and fresh, had a nice texture and was soft and light on the inside. The togarashi spice left just a bit of heat on the back of your throat and the flavor wasnt muttled down by the cream cheese The prices are also pretty reasonable especially on the sandwhiches.

I&apos;ll definately be back to try other combinations."
5,"Tucked away between two seemingly mundane buildings, Knead Bagels is one of the best bagel spots in town! We came here not knowing what to expect and left with our stomachs jumping for joy. The bagels are DELICIOUS here, although slightly pricey for a bagel. I got the special (ham, egg, and cheese with a vinegar slaw) and my girlfriend got the kale, gouda, and egg with pork sausage. While  the bill for the two sandwiches came out to around $20 in total, it was well worth it. Her sandwich was  a perfect savory blend with the melted gouda really adding so much flavor. My sandwich was very refreshing and delicious - we downed them both so quickly!


Many people came for bagels to go, and service is relatively fast (we waited maybe 10 min because ours were hot sandwiches - most people waited just a few for bagels with spreads). They also serve a variety of drinks  and other sandwiches, but I would definitely come back to have more of the bagel sandwiches next time I&apos;m in the area!"
5,"My new favorite bagel place in the area! We have been looking for a good bagel place in walking distance, and this is definitely it. Knead bagels is putting out really delicious &amp; fresh bagels. Seriously their bagels are quality - I&apos;d even go as far as saying they are New York quality. 

They have an assortment of cream cheese flavors, and my favorite is by far the roasted veggie one. Pair that with their garlic bagel, and YUMMM. My boyfriend had half of a sausage, egg, and cheese on a sesame bagel and loved it! I say he only had half, because the dog also enjoyed it...she ripped into the bag and ate the other half in under 5 seconds when we weren&apos;t looking. 

The dog and I can&apos;t wait for more awesome bagels in our future :)"
5,"Full disclosure: I&apos;m Philly&apos;s biggest bagel trash talker. Most of the Philly bagels can barely be considered bread with a hole. 

Knead Bagels is one of those few (and far between) exceptions. The bagels have fresh and doughy insides and crisp outsides, similar to those found in New York.

The added appeal and ultimate differentiation is the unique bagel and cream cheese flavors. Today&apos;s special was a Za&apos;Atar bagel with spicy artichoke cream cheese. A few weeks ago it was a Nigella seed bagel with pineapple curry cream cheese. They aren&apos;t just creative flavors, they are quality. 

You will catch me breaking my Philly bagel boycott when in Washington Square at Knead."
3,"I live a stone throw away from this place and it felt criminal that I hadn&apos;t tried Knead Bagels yet. Was super excited and came in on a rare weekday morning when I wasn&apos;t at work. I tried the much recommended Togarashi Bagel with Scallion Lime cream cheese but didn&apos;t get it heated, which is something I generally prefer. Can&apos;t say I was super impressed though - the cream cheese was extremely lime-y and the bagel was nothing extraordinary. 

Given the extraordinary reviews, I&apos;ll probably be giving this place another shot (and definitely toasting my bagel). For now, 3.5 stars."
5,"I LOVE Knead! Their bagels are delicious and they always have creative flavor combos. They also have your typical flavors too if you aren&apos;t feeling adventurous. Usually when I go I try whatever the special is. I also love their freshly squeezed orange juice.  

I went the other day and the line went all the way to the door, but it moves pretty quickly. The employees are always friendly as well. A great place to grab breakfast on your way into work or to sit down for a little if you have the time (tables and a bar with stools are available). 

Definitely one of my favorite bagel shops in the city!"
5,"Knead bagels had great service and is a very convenient place in Philadelphia. The bagels are cooked fresh daily and there are many options to choose from, although they have a suggestion for each sandwich that they offer. The ingredients were all very fresh and the homemade sauces were tasty. 

The service was amazing. Everyone was very friendly. The atmosphere was great and they also had a gender neutral bathroom which was a nice addition to the already very accepting vibe. This was definitely a great breakfast place for a quick stop!"
5,"I was so happy when they opened back up. I absolutely love their food, especially their Turkey bacon egg &amp; cheese bagel with aioli sauce. Their orange juice is freshly squeezed and is amazing."
5,"Any bagel combination is great here! They always have a special of the day which is usually a unique combination of egg, cheese and a meat or spread. The togarashi bagel is my favorite. A little pricey for a breakfast sandwich but it&apos;s worth it for the fresh bagels and amazing toppings."
5,"I really need Knead!!! I can&apos;t come back to visit Philadelphia without craving a pit stop to Old City for a bite. While the argument for best dough will always continue when it comes to bagels, the FLAVOR profiles that Knead provides are unmatched! I say this with the upmost confidence. They do bagel and cream cheese flavors better than any shop I&apos;ve been to across the mid-Atlantic and New England. Period. 

I always find myself going back to their Togarashi bagel with the scallion and lime cream cheese. I also always get their specials because they&apos;re consistently different and darn good (and you won&apos;t see them around again for a while). Yes, that means that I often get two bagels -- usually to share with a friend if they&apos;ll let me. 

The shop itself is pretty modern and cute too. Couple tables and a standing bar across the side for when things get busy. They also offer bagel sandwiches (breakfast or lunch) and a variety of coffees -- but of course I just go back to their simple and satisfying cream cheese combos when it comes to food. For coffee, it&apos;s done well, but not the best by far. They keep their focus on the bagels. I&apos;m ok with that. 

Keep doing the darn thing, Knead. It&apos;ll keep us all coming back!"
5,"You know this place is legit when you come on a horrible rainy day and it&apos;s packed inside! There will be a line when you get here, but it moves quickly. There are plenty of options and varieties to choose from whether you like the original bagel with spread or a full on breakfast sandwich. 

My choice was the Egg, Cheese (sub pepper jack), add sausage (for + $2), kneed classic aioli on an Everything bagel. The sandwich was divine. You see my photo? That cheese pull is key. Their bagels really have that perfect chew to crust ratio. I could tell their sausage was original (they form the patties and add seasoning). It&apos;s definitely not from a box. 

Customer service is great as well. Genuine nice staff with an amazing bagel is why i&apos;ll be back."
5,"Every time I visit friends in center city, I never leave without dropping by this bagel shop at least once. Their ingredients are always so fresh and delicious! And the people who work their are always so cordial no matter how busy it gets. 

90% of the time, I end up with my favorite lox bagel. I love the lavender one but it sells out pretty fast. However, the togarashi bagel comes as a close second. It adds a little spice to the palette. I tried the new strawberry balsamic cc spread today and loved it. Sweet and tart, it balances out the lox. When I&apos;m feeling generous with my wallet, I like add avocado to my bagel. 

Digging into my order always brings a smile to my face, and sinking my teeth into my bagel is like having an epiphany. Can&apos;t have a bad day after stopping by. For those who have never been here but love bagels, drop by before 2pm! There are so many ways to customize your order, and no matter what you get, their combos are so worth it."
5,"One of the best egg and cheese bagels I&apos;ve eaten maybe ever. The aiola mixed with the togarashi bagel was full of flavor and it gave my mouth a whole new experience. Simply incredible! There&apos;s no doubt about coming back to experience some more breakfast goodness! If you are I. The area, it&apos;s definitely worth checking out!"
