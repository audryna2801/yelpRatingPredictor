4,"Came here on a Thursday evening upon the recommendation of friends. During COVID, tables have been placed on the sidewalk surrounding the restaurant and social distancing guidelines are adhered to. Don&apos;t forget that Audrey Claire is a BYOB so make sure to bring your favorite bottle fo wine to accompany the meal!

Their menu is a 4 course pre fixe for $45 which is very reasonable and you&apos;ll leave quite full. To start they serve a summer tomato gazpacho. Gazpachos in general just aren&apos;t my favorite, but my friend thought it was a bright and refreshing start to the meal. For the second course, we tried the whipped ricotta and the beet salad. The whipped ricotta was such a hit - served with warm pita bread and some spring peas &amp; fava beans, we ate it right up. For the entree, we tried the seared scallops and the maple brined pork chop. The scallops were cooked perfectly and I really enjoyed the spicy brussel sprouts served with it. The pork chop was interesting and had a distinct sweet maple taste, but overall I thought it was a bit dry. Finally, for dessert we both had the tahini crusted chocolate truffles which were a nice sweet bite to the end of the meal. 

Overall, I found the meal interesting and a good value for the price. A few dishes had room for improvement, but overall was quite good. I&apos;d recommend for a nice night out with friends."
4,"I&apos;m very late at posting this but I went here for dinner before the pandemic and we ordered lots of food. Everything was extremely delicious. Also it&apos;s cash only so you should bring cash. Another great thing is that it&apos;s BYOB and they have quite a bit of space outside to eat outdoors if the weather permits. We got the 2 pound muscle, the spicy hummus, Chicken Milanese, Bosc Pear And Gorgonzola, The brussels sprouts, and shrimp pasta. This was for two people and we were definitely stuffed."
4,"A trip home to Philly is never complete without a trip to Audrey Claire. Each dish on the pre-fix menu was carefully crafted with fresh, seasonal ingredients and the service was excellent. The tables were carefully spaced out and everything was very clean. We were reminded that due to COVID we only had our table for 90 minutes which was plenty of time to enjoy our meal. I must say that the tuna entree and scallops entree were both cooked to perfection. The desserts were a great size and man those chocolate truffles are the thing of dreams. Lovely dining experience again!"
5,"We ordered NYE dinner from Audrey Claire and it surpassed my expectations. Everything was delicious. I got the chicken and while I usually opt for something I can&apos;t cook myself, this roasted chicken breast was out of this world. It was packed with flavor and the sauce complimented everything very well. I was also surprised with the hummus, which was some of the best I&apos;ve ever had. The brussels sprouts were perfectly roasted as well. 

I would definitely order from here again and I look forward to visiting in person!"
2,"I came here recently and I&apos;m sad to say that the food/experience were really just not up to par. When we arrived, there was a different menu than the one listed online. Also, some of the entrees did not have prices next to them - which is just deceptive since the bottom of the menu says $35 for 3 courses (except certain entrees are more which the menu does not state). The food was just not good. We tried the Brussel sprout appetizer, which just tasted like sautéed Brussel sprouts that you would make at home. The ricotta was cold and not creamy - it almost had a chalky consistency? Then the entrees were just overpriced and over-salted. I felt bad since it&apos;s a pandemic, but there was only one waitress for the entire restaurant and there was just a man acting as a host, but not helping her. It was a strange experience with bad food, I will sadly not be returning soon."
5,"Fascinated with the BYOB concept and obsessed with Mediterranean cuisine, I had been dying to try Audrey Claire ever since I moved to Philly. My boyfriend and I went on Saturday night and treated ourselves to the 3 course meal. We got the beet salad, brussel sprouts, soup, salmon and trout. It was all outstanding - rich, tasty and decadent. Definitely ant to go back as soon as I can!"
5,"Came for the 3 course pre fixe and enjoyed every course. We had the hummus, ricotta, butternut squash soup, brisket, and lamb meatballs. Portions were substantial and everything was fresh and well seasoned. Loved the molten chocolate cake and panna cotta! Compliments to the chef, Mia, and the wonderful staff!!! Thanks for such a lovely meal and for making my husband&apos;s birthday memorable."
3,"I&apos;d say it&apos;s an A-OK here. Pretty lil spot and fairly tasty overall, but not particularly memorable.

Perhaps it&apos;s like I had higher expectations, but nothing here particularly stood out to me. It&apos;s a cozy byo, and it&apos;s right near where I&apos;ve lived so I had wanted to go for a while. I had a good experience here overall but wasn&apos;t amazed at the restaurant. 

To me, the space inside felt really crowded and pretty squished. It may have been also because we came on a cold winter night, so I felt more huddled and the dim lighting seemed dull rather than classy. I think the right ambiance for Audrey Claire is on a bright summer&apos;s evening, because I&apos;ve walked by during those seasons and it seemed a lot more airy and open and fitting the mood of the restaurant in the summer.

I enjoyed the food, but I feel like with so many other Mediterranean spots in Philly now, this spot doesn&apos;t rank particularly high in my books for now."
5,"I went to Audrey Claire on a beautiful Saturday evening and I was so impressed! They offered a four course prix fixe menu for only $45. The first course was gazpacho, which was refreshing on a warm, summer night. For the second course, you had the option of whipped ricotta, hummus, brusselsprots, or beet salad. I went with several friends so we were able to order one of each! The pita in particular was delicious- served fresh and warm. For the main course, I opted for the pork chop. It was perfectly tender, served on mashed potatoes, and topped with applewood bacon, candied dates, and gorgonzola-apple butter. For dessert, I had the chocolate truffle, which was tiny, but very rich. I was very impressed with the food, but also the service. The staff were attentive and we did not have to wait between courses. I will certainly be back!"
3,"Although this isn&apos;t a place I&apos;d go often, it was a nice restaurant to pop in for a quaint dinner while in town. 

Right now they are offering a $45 pre-fixe menu. It starts with summer gazpacho, which oddly reminded me of salsa. What made this dish &quot;mature&quot; was the use of mint and feta. 

For our second, we shared the whipped ricotta and hummus which were both light and a nice preparation for the main dishes. 

We had the maple brined pork chop which was a good sized portion and cooked well. We also tried the seared scallops which I loved. 

The dessert wasn&apos;t great,  which is where the stars fall off. One consisted of two chocolate balls rolled in sesame seeds and a cornbread muffin."
4,"Audrey Claire is yet another hole in the wall restaurant nestled in Philadelphia&apos;s Center City. To be honest, the menu never looked especially luring to me which is why it took me nearly 2.5 years after first hearing recommendations of the restaurant. Making reservations is easy on Resy - but also too convenient to cancel. Stand out dish of the night: the burrata appetizer special. I&apos;ve had burrata at almost every Philly restaurant that offers it and Audrey Claire&apos;s was the creamiest and most flavorful among them all.

For my fiancé&apos;s birthday, we had: burrata, butternut squash soup, lamb meatballs, scallops and papardalle -- after tax and tip, it came out to $95. 

Lamb meatballs came with about 8 meatballs - more than I expected 
Scallops came with 3 atop a mound of lentils
Papardalle was a little softer than al dente but mixed well with the creamy pesto sauce. Couldn&apos;t tell if I was just full or it was just less flavorful.

Love that most of the dishes had sunflower seeds generously sprinkled as a garnish - really added a great kick! Will be back soon for brunch or another dinner with friends!"
3,"(3.5 stars) I wasn&apos;t blown away by this spot, but was happy I tried it, especially since it&apos;s a cozy byob. I think my disappointment was simply that the menu made the dishes sound better than they actually were, even though I still enjoyed the meal, and that it wasn&apos;t that cheap of a meal. We got a bunch of dishes and shared, the highlights being the Brussels sprouts and the hummus. 

My biggest disappointment was the pappardelle. The pasta was on the soggy side and the pesto really didn&apos;t pop in color or in flavor. With mushrooms and Parmesan as well, how could you go wrong right? Well it&apos;s not necessarily wrong, just not very memorable."
4,"Adorable little BYO in Rittenhouse! My friend and I went for dinner on a Thursday night and had a nice experience. We don&apos;t live far from the restaurant And we walk by it all the time. It is usually packed, as it was last night as well. 

The restaurant was small but we did not feel crowded. It has a quaint ambiance with large windows were you can see out onto the street. 

Everything we ordered was delicious and the portion sizes were nice for sharing. 

We ordered the ricotta appetizer special, which came with peppers and balsamic. The ricotta was very fresh and it came with pita on the side. This plate was delicious and we&apos;re glad we ordered it. 

We also split the lamb meatballs and a special they had, mushroom risotto with short rib. Both were delicious, especially the mushroom risotto. We would definitely go back and order any of those dishes again!"
5,"Audrey Claire is a fantastic Mediterranean restaurant which is elegant, yet also has a neighborhood charm and feel.

The restaurant is small and cozy. The building sits on the corner of two tree-lined streets in Rittenhouse, nestled between historic and beautiful brick buildings. The restaurant interior just has a few tables and chairs, and a lot of the seating is in small two-person tables outside lining the sidewalk. The staff are all friendly and welcoming, and you feel like you&apos;re part of the community here.

The dining section is delicious and authentic. We enjoyed a mix of Mediterranean appetizers and small dishes, such as hummus (great), the octopus (amazing), and a sampler of multiple different mezes (very good). Then we shared one of the fish dishes as a main course (delicious, though the portion size was a bit on the smaller side).

Overall, we had a lovely meal. The prices are high relative to an everyday dinner, but reasonable for a special meal. And it&apos;s BYO, so you can save money by bringing your own bottle of wine. They only accept cash, so make sure you bring enough to cover your bill.

Ultimately a very good experience. I&apos;ll be back next time I&apos;m looking for another special yet laid-back meal!"
4,"My boyfriend and I randomly passed by this place at the end of last school year and fell in love with it from the outside. We saw the beautiful while facade and simplicity of the place as well as the open-kitchen concept in the back where you could see your food being made. Fast forward a few months and we decided to drop by.

We arrived for an early dinner and the place was nearly empty but by the time we left the restaurant was near capacity on this Sunday night. We ordered the Chicken Skewers, Spicy Shrimp Pasta, and Pork Chop. The food was good and while there were no outstanding highlights, I would say that I heavily appreciated how fresh the pasta tasted. The Spicy Shrimp Pasta does in fact have a good kick. For those who are not good with spice, don&apos;t get it haha -- I liked it though.

Audrey Claire is a place that emphasizes simplicity and style and is a cute place for a date or for a small group. Unlike what we expected by walking passed this place, Audrey Claire has a homey vibe that is no-way super fancy dining.

An yes, it&apos;s BYOB : )

Tips &amp; Notes
- ALSO it&apos;s CASH ONLY"
5,"After my Valentine&apos;s Day experience, Audrey Claire reached out to me to offer their apologies and to handle my next reservation. My boyfriend and I went back tonight.... 

I was appreciative that they took the time to contact me in the first place. My boyfriend and I were excited to return and dig in to the mussels and other menu items we typically always order/love. Our service was awesome tonight and the food itself was unbelievable as always. They took exceptional care of us due to our last experience. I have truly never received such great customer service from any establishment in my life. I appreciate their care and I will 100% be back again."
5,"Amazing spot (pleasant surprised how good it was) and BYOB (huge). 

Highly recommend hummus, pork chop, Bronzino and mussels. Portion is big so be aware. Would definitely go back"
3,"Stumbled upon Audrey Claire more by chance (thanks Yelp!) than having it on my Philly food bucket list. The background? I was searching for a last-minute spot on a Saturday night for 6 people, and luckily Audrey Claire was able to accommodate when I called them.

Things I loved about Audrey Claire: 
-BYOB (no corkage fee) is always a plus
-Their pear and Gorgonzola flatbread and hummus were sizable enough for our group of 6 to share as appetizers
-Generally cozy vibe on a cute street
-Waitstaff was generally attentive, but they didn&apos;t rush us when it was time to leave

Things I could pass on: 
-Not great vegetarian options. Their mushroom pappardelle was fine, but a little bland and nothing I&apos;d order again
-Generally pricey for the amount of food that we got

What should you come here for? A good spot for groups who are looking to celebrate (and drop some cash) and who want to take advantage of Philly&apos;s BYOB in a cozy spot with &quot;fine&quot; food"
4,"Party of two for a birthday dinner. Definitely call ahead to make a reservation no matter the night! Fortunately, when we arrived, it was fairly empty, and just starting filling up afterwards.

If you plan on bringing a bottle of wine, once it hits the table the server politely takes it away to uncork it in for you your first glass. If you do want to keep the bag and the cork though, do you let them know!

Service was prompt and they also let you know their specials for the evening. We ordered fairly quickly, and would absolutely recommend the burrata special if they offer it! It is delicious and so smooth to the palate. Their pasta is also delicious. They added just the right amount of toppings for a nice crunch. Scallops are large on the main entree, and both cooked and seasoned beautifully. For my birthday, we ordered the flourless chocolate cake with a homemade whipped cream that was airy and delightful. Would absolutely come back!"
5,"I have now been here twice and our meal both times was delicious. We were lucky to come on a nice day and were able to sit outside. It is a bit tight inside, so sitting outside afforded us a bit more space as well as the opportunity to enjoy the warm weather. 

We ordered the whipped ricotta appetizer special with pita. It was delicious. I ordered a special which was a shrimp and homemade pasta dish. It was delicious. My girlfriend ordered the Arctic char and she really enjoyed it. We have no complaints, the food was delicious, the service was great, and we thoroughly enjoyed our dinner"
