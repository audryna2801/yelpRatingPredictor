5,"WOW, we were blown away by how delicious this meal was! We ordered delivery of the chicken for 2 which came with garlic rice, veggies (so tasty!), chicken, lumpia, and a trio of sauces. We added on some Pandesal and 2 desserts (ube cheesecake and coconut budino). Everything was delicious and we&apos;re already planning for our next order. This is the perfect meal for a nice night in. Thank you, Perla!"
5,"Perla is one of our fav restaurants on Passyunk Ave so we&apos;re trying to help save it during this pandemic! We miss getting together with friends for their Kamayan dinners. It was always our go to place for celebrating anything (small but cozy, BYOB, and super friendly staff). 

The takeout meals for 2 are the closest thing to the dinners and are just as tasty. We ordered the pork shank meal, which came with rice, vegetables, and lumpia but NOT pandesal, so we added a half dozen pandesal and an order of halo halo. The meal came in a small party tray and was surprisingly pretty heavy when I picked it up! The portions were huge so we had leftovers between the two of us. All the sauces you would get at their Kamayan dinners were individually packed, and there was even a banana leaf layer on the bottom of the tray so it was a nice touch and I guess you could recreate the dinners at your own house if you really wanted.

The pork, rice, and vegetables were flavorful as always. The pandesal wasn&apos;t as soft as the other times we had it in the restaurant, but I toasted it in the oven and it was better. It also would have been nice if just two pieces of pandesal was included in the meal. The halo halo could use more ube. Overall, I would order everything again, but we look forward to when they can fully reopen their doors for in person dining!"
5,"I was blown away by how delicious our dinner was. We ordered delivery from Perla for our anniversary after our original plans of eating outside at a different restaurant were scrapped due to bad weather. By the time we finished our food I was grateful for the rainstorm because this was the best meal I&apos;ve had in months. We had the dinner for two with pork belly, garlic rice, mixed veggies, and lumpia. We also got some dinner rolls. I loved all of it so much. We will be ordering again soon."
4,"If you want to venture outside of your comfort zone and have an adventure of a dining experience, you gotta check out this joint.

We went with the Kamayan Style Family Menu, and this was truly an AMAZING &amp; unforgettable experience. 

They plop a ton of food right on your table (already covered in banana leaves). It is huge servings, full with rice, vegetables &amp; proteins. You eat with your hands (inner child at heart jumping for joy,) and they were super accommodating for vegetarian. It was all delicious. 

Servers were really engaging and explained the culture which was greatly appreciated, and made the meal feel that much more authentic."
4,"I went here for restaurant week and ordered off the pre-fixe menu on a Thursday night. I booked a reservation on OpenTable that morning without any issues. The restaurant was small and got loud quickly. Service was good, but we were given the check right when we received our dessert even though there were multiple empty tables at the time and nobody was waiting to be seated. 

Off the menu, we tried the Spanish octopus and 
Kilawin (Arctic char) for the first course. We had the bagnet (pork belly) and pinaputok na isda (barramundi fish) for the second course. We had the chocolate coconut panna cotta and the ube cheesecake for the third course.

Spanish octopus and kilawin were both delicious! The octopus has a nice fry on the outside and was perfectly cooked. The sauce included was perfect. The kilawin was fresh and went well with the taro pur√©e. 

Bagnet - This was the most disappointing dish. There was no presentation - just the pork belly and ube with a few veggies on a big plate. The veggies and ube were refreshing and needed to offset the pork belly. The pork belly had a great crisp on both sides, but the fat was overwhelming. It would uncomfortably stick in my mouth as I was chewing. 

Pinaputok Na isda - nice presentation and delicious flaky fish. I&apos;d say this is the go-to dish on the menu. 

All dishes were pretty tasty, but pretty small. Some dishes like the dessert and pork belly lacked presentation points and were unmemorable."
5,"I came with a party of 4 for the Sunday Kamayan dinner and wow, what an experience. 

Since there are already many reviews on the dining experience, I&apos;ll keep it short. The sweet bread at the beginning was fantastic. The pork belly was a little dry and flavored purely by pork fat. Same goes for the chicken (breast was a little dry) &amp; fish, both were good but not super flavorful on their own. But there are 4 yummy sauces you get on the side to eat with the meat so that makes up for it. The rice was so simple yet so delicious, I couldn&apos;t get enough! And the dessert was the perfect end to the meal, light enough stomach after stuffing yourself to the brim. The food is more homestyle and less fine dining than Perla&apos;s typical fare, but the price is made up for by quantity. You get a lot of food regardless, but the bigger your party, the more bang for your buck you&apos;ll receive.

By far the best part of our dining experience was the staff. Our table was towards the back by the kitchen so we chatted with our waiter the entire time. I wish I caught his name, but he was just a really cool, funny, amicable guy. We laughed, joked, and had a great time thanks to him."
2,"I was looking forward to coming to Perla for some time. Sisig was my girlfriend&apos;s favorite dish while we were in the Philippines, and after seeing it on their menu and how incredible all the reviews were, I decided to make Valentine&apos;s Day reservations here.

First off, parking is difficult as to be expected with South Philly. We drove around for about 40 minutes before parking all the way on Broad, but the people at Perla were so nice to hold our reservations. The service was wonderful, friendly, attentive, and was always smiling. We were handed a Valentine&apos;s Day pre-vixed menu and, unbeknownst to us until that moment, that is all they would be serving that night. Unfortunately, no sisig, our reason for coming. Furthermore, the pre-fixed menu had completely non-filipino options. But hey, we waited quite some time for this meal and finally found parking, so let&apos;s give it a shot.

The first course, butternut coconut soup tasted nice but was served cold. We split two appetizers. The ceviche also had good flavor, but the shrimp seemed under &quot;cooked&quot; even to ceviche standards, the middle looking and feeling translucent and raw. The beef rolls tasted like stuffed cold cut roast beef; enjoyable, but not something you&apos;d expect at a nicer restaurant. For main, the duck was incredible. Perfectly cooked, tender, and pink with a crispy, savory skin surrounding it. By far my favorite dish of the night. The squid ink pasta has a delicious sauce actually made with squid ink (unlike just infused into the pasta like typically seen), but the scallops were over-salted and the pasta was undercooked and hard, overall underwhelming. The desserts, the champorado and the creme brulee, were both well constructed and a nice end to the meal.

Although this meal was a bit of a let down, I want to come back to Perla and give their actual Filipino menu, whether the a la carte or Kamayan dinner, a shot because of all of the wonderful things I&apos;ve read about it. I&apos;m still looking forward to having that Sisig."
4,"Came here to do the Kamayan after seeing so many friends rave about it! This is a really cute and small restaurant, and the food was pretty great. The amount of is good as all 4 of us were stuffed to the brim and we didn&apos;t even finish. The food is definitely visually stunning, and I liked that they put everything out in front of us by hand. I loved the chicken, veggies/rice, and sweet bread; the pork belly was quite dry, fish was so crispy but a bit bland, and some of the food was a little bit cold when it reached our table which was sad. I think the price point is a bit steep but it&apos;s a nice experience if you&apos;ve never tried it!

Making a reservation was really easy, and the staff was wonderful!"
3,"We came for Kamayan dinner -- it was a cool experience to be eating off banana leaves, not something I&apos;ve done much in Philadelphia. It&apos;s wonderful to have all the food piled up in the middle of the table! The food was good &amp; service was great.

Here&apos;s a food breakdown -- I use ^ to indicate a half-star and * for a full star. So, ***^ means 3.5 stars:

****^ Sinangag: good, rice was fried with garlic, very fragrant
****Pinakbet vegetables: there was eggplant, beans, bok choy, Brussels sprouts, maybe some radish. All of it was nicely cooked, in a flavourful sauce &amp; I wished there was more of it!
***^ Lumpia, ground pork fried up, like in a spring roll: tasty, good with the liver sauce
*** Lechon kawali, fried pork belly cubes:  ok, skin was crispy, but the meat was much too dry since it was fried to a crisp
**^ Chicken inasal: not bad, but overcooked &amp; too dry for my taste, unfortunately only the thigh was good, the rest of the meat was dry, especially the drumstick which seemed dried out &amp; crispy
** Whole Fish: ok, not very flavourful &amp; overcooked

All the overcooked meats would&apos;ve tasted better if more sauce had been provided, but only small dollops of sauce were provided -- not enough sauce to counter the dryness of the meat. We asked for more sauce when we finished ours, but we were only given an even smaller dollop. Unfortunately, they seemed rather stingy with the sauce. 

*** Dessert: Chocolate coconut pudding was okay. It was nice that they provided something else for those celebrating a special occasion

Maybe it was a bad day for the kitchen. Maybe it&apos;d be better to dine a la carte."
5,"My boyfriend and I are in Philly for the weekend for our anniversary and absolutely had to eat from Perla again!

The lumpiang shanghai is delicious (better than my parents&apos;- but don&apos;t tell them that!), with a hint of citrus that makes them super addicting.

The crispy pata paired with vinegar and garlic fried rice was our favorite and there was nothing left by the time we were finished with it. 

I adored both the palabok and pinakbet, and though they aren&apos;t typically a favorite dish of my boyfriend, he really enjoyed them as well.

Would definitely recommend anyone to try Perla out!"
5,"My wife and I joined another couple for the Kamayan dinner at Perla.  The dinner has become very popular in Philadelphia and we all wanted to hop on the train.  It&apos;s worth the stop and the price is pretty right for a fixed price deal with some truly amazing offerings and some otherwise pedestrian or mediocre additions.  I think we&apos;d like to come back and experience the rest of the menu, but what Perla does is offer a surprisingly unique experience in a City with so much to offer.  

Pros: 

The Kamayan dinner is best enjoyed amongst close friends who have no qualms about eating with their hands.  We did not (have a problem), but we appreciated the utensil option.  It&apos;s a very obvious tip that if you&apos;re a germaphobe, you may either want to reconsider or be prepared to convince everyone of the use of forks!

The food was enjoyable and massive in quantity.  We enjoyed the following:

Pan de Sal:  A nice breadroll appetizer which was much sweeter than we expected (but not a sweet roll per se).  

Sinangag:  Delicious, sticky rice that was easy to mound and enjoy with a vegetable or piece of meat.

Chicken Inasal: Flavorful and sweet and perfectly cooked.  I often scoff at chicken at a restaurant because flavoring it better than most can do at home is difficult at best and poorly executed.  This chicken was flavorful, moist and very well prepared.  Arguably one of the best chicken dishes I&apos;ve ever had out to eat.

Pinakbet vegetables: A mix of eggplant (which I found limp and soggy), beans (fresh!), bok choy (fresh!) and brussel sprouts (incredible) were a great mix with the rice and meat.  We thoroughly enjoyed the slightly glazed veggies as a whole but found the eggplant just a little too moist.  I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s common to dry out eggplant (with salt) in Filipino cooking, but if so, it was not dried out here.  

Whole Fish:  Deliciously flaky with a salty skin that was the best part of the fish!  We enjoyed ripping it apart, even if my wife was slightly put off by the whole body (including head) on our table.  She eventually gave in and tried a few chunks which she admitted were delicious.  It lacked a little extra flavor but tasted fresh, clean and was not over-salted.

Chocolate panna cotta:  For dessert, we were given small dishes of panna cotta.  They were delicious, but so is panna cotta in general.  

The service was optimal and incredible!  Our server was fast, friendly and fun.  Additionally, the host chilled my beers and was happy to pass another to me during dinner as I requested.  I appreciate their friendly and comfortable service in an otherwise cramped space.  

Price:  40 dollars per person for this dinner seems fairly reasonable for the size and quality of the meal.  

Cons:

Some of the foods we found less good:

Fried pork belly cubes:  Pork belly is easy to overcook in large quantities and these were no exception.  A dry, overcooked affair that was chewy and flavored strictly by the fat.  They were hard to eat and harder to enjoy.  

Lumpia (Filipino spring roll):  We found this to be average and comparable to other pork filled spring rolls.  The provided ginger and liver sauces were great accents though!

The space is a) odd to enter.  It feels like you&apos;re walking into an apartment building (because you are!) and the door to the restaurant is not marked (whereas the apartment door is marked &quot;private&quot;) and b) very small.  The tables aren&apos;t too cramped, but it&apos;s a small restaurant with ~8 tables or so.  The kitchen and bathroom space are basically right behind (or in front) of you.  The ambiance is otherwise unnoticeable and it&apos;s as if you&apos;re in a South Philly dining room!

Reservations are basically required for a table for the Kamayan dinner or any major dining out night (Thursday-Sunday basically).

Other notes:  My intrepid friend, reading other yelp reviews, had to inquire about the mango habanero sauce.  It cannot be acquired!  Primarily because our server, the apparent inventor, was trying to come up with a spicy sauce on the one weekend the owner was away.  He did and clearly it was well received, but because it was a one-off experience, he has no recipe and so it can never be duplicated!   So you can try again, but don&apos;t expect to find it!

It is, of course, BYOB.  

Conclusion:  Perla is such a great addition to the restaurant experience of Philadelphia.  A family affair for the restaurant and guests alike, we really enjoyed it and didn&apos;t find the price, for such a high end and unique offering to be to be absurd.  The Kamayan dinner is worth the experience and we will probably try it again in the future, but for now, we&apos;ll probably come back to experience the rest of the a la cart menu!"
4,"Definitely worth visiting on a wednesday or sunday just for the family style experience. Come with people you are close to so you won&apos;t be bothered by eating with your hands....yes you read that right. We ate with our hands...and it was delicious....no fork, spoons or knives!

The flavors and everything was just great. My favorite part of the meal was the Filipino fried rice with the curry veggies. Yummy!

The chicken, pork belly, fried fish, and lumpia were all tasty too but I just loved the rice and curry together!! 

Lovely experience....would&apos;ve given them 5 star but my friend who booked the reservations....told me they called last minute and tried to bump up our reservation by 30 minutes because they needed us to finish earlier for a larger group that booked for later...she didn&apos;t want to tell me about it but I could pried it out of her. It&apos;s understandable but we did book the reservation weeks in advance for my bday...so I understand why she was annoyed they tried to bump us earlier the day of an hour before we were suppose to be there.

My party of 3 did enjoy the overall experience. The food and the service we received was great.

Price $$$ (pricey but worth trying)
Space: small and cozy

My final rating is 4 out of 5 stars...."
4,"Situated near the epicenter of popular South Philly, Perla serves modern takes on traditional Filipino dishes. My partner and I came on a Saturday night with reservations made through RoundTable. We were quickly sat down and our bottle of wine was opened! (Perla is BYO friendly)

When you look at the menu, it can be deceiving as to what are the appetizers and what are the main courses. For us the first 5 menu items were appetizers and the rest were entrees. We started off with the Sisig followed by the Bistek and Pancit.

The Sisig came to us sizzling, as one would expect, with the freshly cracked egg on top. It was very reminiscent of home and being in the Philippines. This Sisig had a prominent liver flavor as opposed to a lechon/cartilage flavor. While I am not usually a fan of liver, this dish was definitely appetizing but wish it had more meat of the pig rather than liver.

The Bistek was the special of the day. For those who have eaten bistek before, this bistek is not thin slices of beef but rather one single steak cooked to your liking (rare to well-done), which threw for a ride. This Bistek&apos;s flavor was delicious and so were the veggies it was paired with -- brussel sprouts, which are not typically used in Filipino cuisine. Although the dish was great, the flavors were foreign to me. What I mean is that as a Filipino, none of the Bistek&apos;s flavors were recognizable.

Lastly was the Pancit. I had never tasted any pancit like this before and it was 10/10. I really wish I knew how they created their sauce, because that is something I&apos;d love to replicate!! ahhh

Overall, eating at Perla was a joy for us! The main issues I had was correlating the flavors of the food with the prices. I have been here before for Kamayan and would definitely suggest Kamayan over a la carte if you want the best food for the price.

Until next time, Perla!

BIG P.S. they do NOT serve plain/white rice here. I tried ordering a cup of rice for our entree, but was shocked when they said they did not have that in stock. For a Filipino restaurant, I would hope that next time I would be able to add just a cup of rice to my dinner!"
5,"Foodie adventure time! Brought friends and family to expand their taste horizons and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. 

We each started with pandesal, a traditional sweet bread roll. Then we dug in with our fingers to the feast spread out in front of us. I loved the garlic fried rice, crunchy pork belly and the fresh brightness of the fried fish and crisp yet moist roast chicken. 

My friend had never tried any other Filipino dishes except the lumpia egg rolls so she was willing and ready to try it all and came away impressed and full to the brim. 

Service was quick and friendly. The ambiance was cozy since the room is so small and seating is tight. Be prepared for the high noise level if you come on a busy night. I would come again for a special occasion."
5,"Punishingly great!

The meal advertized as a &apos;Kamayan&apos; which is a Filipino-style feast, was truly so without question.  I was completely stuffed well after the meal into the next day.  This feast which is that is meant to be eaten with your hands, with the food served on banana leaves laid out on a table, had everything I needed.  There was a perfectly roasted chicken, fried pork belly, fried lumpia rolls, curry veggies including okra, eggplant, bok choy, string beans and a fragrant fried rice.  Sauces accompanied the meal to augment the strong flavors, one of which was a chicken liver pate.  

The chicken was moist and a perfect texture.  It was not one second overdone.  The sauce on the side was there in augment the flavor profile but it really wasn&apos;t necessary.  The remaining items in the feast were really satisfying, the pork belly and lumpia were super crunchy.  The sauteed veggies were awesome.  There pictures don&apos;t do justice to home much food was served.  Great food in this never ending quantity, was definitely more than enough hence the review headline of punishingly great!

If there was one slight disappointment, it would have been the fried rice.  While the rice was super fragrant, the texture of the rice grains were a bit more al dente then I would have preferred, possibly because there were fried a bit longer.  I do believe that there are some that prefer rice this way I guess.

The finishing touch here, the chocolate coconut panna cotta, over the top gluttony!  

This meal was a fun way to enjoy company and eat a ton.  Leftovers were polished off a few days later with the same degree of satisfaction.  
Definitely recommended!"
5,"My friends planned this amazing dinner. We did kamayan night and it was amazing. The garlic rice And the vegetables in coconut sauce were my favorite. Fried fish and chicken were incredible too. You are eating with your hands and sharing with your friends.
The fee was 40 dollars which was not that much. And most importantly it is BYOB!
I do not know if you can get something better in philly.

Look at the picture ! They speak from
Themselves"
5,"Amazing food - the fish and rice with bone marrow were so tasty. The atmosphere is very cozy and intimate, but the sound can carry at times, making it a little hard to hear. All around very pleased!"
4,"I am still waiting to try Kamayan style with my friends but as of now - I ordered a la carte with my fianc√©. I&apos;m a little concern when I do come with a large party since it&apos;s a very tiny restaurant..

The food we ordered came out super fast and it was great. From the presentation to flavor, can&apos;t complain. My favorite(s) were the salmon, bone marrow, and Ube mousse dessert. Make sure you save room for dessert, I ate the whole mousse by myself, I almost wanted to lick the plate clean."
5,"Incredible Filipino dinner! Come for the family style meals, offered on Wednesday &amp; Sundays. Such a great deal for the amount of food you&apos;re getting! 

Atmosphere: Feels like you&apos;re walking into an apartment complex at first, but the interior is quite cozy. Dim lighting, and banana leaves set on each table. Not too loud, though the tables are quite close to each other.

Service: Staff is very friendly, and are sure to ask for any dietary restrictions/allergies before bringing out the feast! 

Food: Starts off with a small mound of bread, almost like a piece of fried dough. The food comes out relatively quickly (within 25 minutes), starting off with a large spread of garlic rice - you can smell the garlic aroma! Vegetables come after, a mix of green beans, eggplant, bok choy, and brussel sprouts soaked in coconut sauce on top of the rice. Next, the protein - slightly sweet chicken, fish, fried pork belly, and meat spring rolls, along with sauces that pair well with each (I enjoyed the sweet sauce paired with pork belly the most). Finishes up with chocolate panna cotta, with pomegranate and a tad bit of sea salt - not too sweet, and a great end to a massive meal! Definitely a bit too much rice, especially after eating so much of the meat and fish - I personally wish there were more vegetables to balance out the meat; they were soaked in the coconut sauce and so flavorful!

Notes: It&apos;s BYOB, and you eat with your hands, although you can ask for utensils if you&apos;d like! 

Recommended must-try: 100% recommend family style and especially eat a lot of the vegetables!! 

Overall: 5/5 - Incredible food, service, and price for the amount. It&apos;s also just a different, fun experience sharing a meal on banana leaves, without utensils. Definitely would love to come back!"
5,"A beautiful space serving up elevated but still delicious Filipino food. The decor is minimal and small but still feels warm and spacious. When my boyfriend and I came on a Wednesday night to celebrate his birthday the restaurant was full and bustling. The noise can sometimes be loud but there&apos;s no need to scream to your table mates. We came for the Wednesday Kamayan night with empty bellies and high hopes.

We got started with a soft roll and quickly the dinner got started. The staff did a great job explaining how Kamayan works and got started laying down the garlic fried rice. After that came the veggies tossed in coconut milk sauce, lumpia, lechon, chicken, and finally the whole fried fish. We got sauces on the side which included a spicy vinegar and ketchup which we appreciated since they really helped cut through the meal&apos;s richness. Every separate dish was well cooked, flavorful, and easily delicious on its own but the combination it all together was out of this world. I loved the crispy pieces of lechon and my boyfriend cleaned the whole fish off the bone. We got kudos from our waiter for finishing our meal and it was certainly not an easy task (and we can be big eaters). The meal ended with chocolate pot de cremes for each of us which was a great cap to such a unique meal.

The kamayan eating experience drew us to Perla and the cooking will keep us coming back to try more dishes. Perla is a great place for a special occasion dinner and I look forward to trying more of the menu."
