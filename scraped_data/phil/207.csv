5,"Great local spot for bubble tea and more. Lots of non-dairy treats, and the staff is incredibly friendly."
3,Honestly had higher expectations upon reading the reviews. I came here around the end of summer last year and got the mango and pineapple shaved ice to share with my bf. We were visiting from NY. I think the place was still trying to adjust to covid precautions and they didn&apos;t let us use the bathroom. Not a deal breaker but the customer service could have been better since we were the only customers when we stopped by. The shaved iced itself was very refreshing but I did not find anything too special and it was on the smaller portion side. I might come back to try other shaved ice flavors if I&apos;m in Philly again.
5,Winter Update: We will be hibernating in the ice cave and eating warm wheel cakes all winter (hot custard delicately hugged inside a waffle). The chocolate one is like a cup of hot chocolate cooked into a gooey delicious waffle. Gotta get it!
5,"The owner is so friendly and kind. I often forget about this place when I am in town, but the treats and bubble tea are delicious. The teas are all real brewed tea and it doesn&apos;t taste like there are any artificial powders. I recently tried the brown sugar milk, which was also delicious. Everything is the perfect amount of sweetness. Highly recommend!"
5,"I LOVE this place for authentic Taiwanese shaved ice and dessert. Bold and flavorful shaved ice that melts in your mouth, rich and smooth. The owners are very flexible and friendly, taking the time to know you and answer any questions you have (and believe me, I always have a ton!) - bless their patient hearts. 

They also have homemade refreshing popsicles, although selection is more limited during the wintertime. Summer is the best for these refreshing, colorful, and fruit filled treats (just check out the photos). 

Only sad thing is they close rather early at night, a little hard to get to in west philly, and very small space for a group more than 4. But I&apos;ll definitely be back!"
5,"This is definitely a hidden gem in West Philly--a very small place that is easy to overlook but is so worth checking out! Yeah, seating is limited but definitely still a great place to get dessert and hang out.

You can get a variety of desserts from here such as shaved ice, popsicles, bubble tea, or wheel cake (egg batter filled with custard). The owners are SO nice and they will give you recommendations if you&apos;re not sure what to order.

My friend and I got shaved ice (which comes in three sizes--kid, regular, or large). We got the Mt. Fuji (matcha flavored) and Tropical Heaven (pineapple flavored). I would 10/10 recommend both! Also there are vegan options if you want to get something non-dairy. Not only were the shaved ice really good, but the prices were very reasonable!

I&apos;m really glad I found this place and will definitely be back to try another shaved ice or popsicle."
5,Had a great visit to Ice Cave this afternoon! Perfect for hot weather. Menu was outside and then we popped inside to order and pay and he brought our treats to us outside! So delicious. Very interesting texture (in a good way). Loved the fresh fruit they use!! And mine was non-dairy which made my tummy happy!
5,"Best bubble tea, great popsicles, interesting desserts. This place is one of my favorites in philly, the owners are such a wonderful part of the neighborhood :)"
5,"My boyfriend and I enjoyed this place very much. It&apos;s hands down the best shaved ice I&apos;ve ever had. It&apos;s delicious. Ive been craving it ever since. I had to drag my boyfriend here because I really wanted it and after he tried it he apologized for giving me such a hard time for wanting to go out around 9pm to get it. He liked it that much! 

Definitely try it out :) you won&apos;t be disappointed."
4,I feel somewhat guilty I haven&apos;t reviewed this place sooner. Its my local go to for Bubble Tea and shaved ice. The guy that&apos;s there is always super friendly. Love the option to pay via Venmo which is handy if you&apos;re like me and never carry cash. Pluuuuus if you needed even more- there&apos;s the loyalty card that for every $5 you get one point and after 9 points you can claim free shaved ice/water ice.
5,"It&apos;s a small place in a spot you could very well overlook but once you find it, this like place could very well become the best big thing! The owners are very friendly and a adorable pair. You have your choices of popsicles, bubble teas, wheel called, and shaved ice. We got the shaved ice and this shaved ice is not what I expected at all. I&apos;m used to the snowball or Korean shaved ice that is more of pieces of shaved ice but this...it was almost a creamy texture like ice cream. What kind of sorcery is this!?! Very delicious. 

They also have vegan friendly options"
5,"We love this place. First off, nicest staff/owners ever. Also, they explain the menu you to you the first time you go which really helps, especially if your unfamiliar with the shaved ice. I got the pineapple coconut with mochi and strawberries and it was delicious, and dairy free. Perfect for summer time and tastes like flavored snow :). I highly recommend it to all West Philly folks."
5,"This was my first time having shave ice and was not disappointed! Everything tasted very fresh and flavorful, it is not overly sweet like water ice which is why it is now my preferred summer frozen treat."
5,Absolutely love this great find! I googled ice cream places in Philly and happened to stumble across this place. It was a little hard to find the location but once I drove back around I found it and I&apos;m happy I did. It is such a unique little place. The shaved ice cream is so hard to describe and their use of fresh fruits enriched the flavor!
5,"Stopped by for dessert after eating at Clarkville, it was a short 2-3 minute walk away.  This placed is tucked and hidden away in plain sight.  The dessert though is amazing, they are very creative with their product, the presentation is appealing, and the shaved ice is perfectly airy and fluffy.  We were thoroughly impressed with our visit, if we&apos;re around we&apos;ll definitely stop by again."
5,"I adore Ice Cave!! I will happily trek out to West Philly just to eat the soft, pillowy shaved ice here and it&apos;s quickly become one of my absolute favorite spots that I also make sure to recommend to visitors who will be in the West Philly area.

Let me just first gush about the owner - he is the sweetest person alive!  He is always so accommodating with my requests and gives great suggestions.  He recognizes me when I bring someone new in and it&apos;s always great to chat him up.

There&apos;s a great variety of shaved ice combos and flavors here and they&apos;re all fantastic.  I&apos;ve had the green tea, the thai ice tea, and the mango, and the toppings that go with them are all great, from fruits to mochi bites to different syrups.  I&apos;ve also had an ice pop during the Baltimore Ave Dollar Stroll (the birthday cake flavor, if I&apos;m remembering correctly) and it was really refreshing and just as good as the shaved ice!

I really love that there&apos;s a Taiwanese shaved ice joint here in Philly - to my knowledge I don&apos;t really know of another place that does the ice just like Ice Cave does, and so you&apos;ll definitely want to stop by! 

There&apos;s inside and outside seating, but the space is relatively small.  You can always take it to go though and eat it in Clark Park right across the street.

Make sure to also grab a punch card, you&apos;ll be making return trips here in no time."
5,"Cute little spot on Baltimore Ave. The owner is the sweetest, kindest man who makes everyone feel like an old friend he is happy to see. The bubble teas, wheel cakes and popsicles are delish. For those who prefer their boba to be sweet, these aren&apos;t. I dont mind but I thought it is worth mentioning."
5,"This place is so tucked away and you would never expect there to be an authentic Taiwanese shaved ice spot here, but take the time to look for it! It is very easy to pass by the storefront as it does not look remarkable from the outside, and even the decor inside is not astounding. 

However, the shaved ice is some of the best shaved ice I have ever had in my life- and it was so reasonably priced also! Their flavors are delicious and so creative- I will be back to try others for sure. 

The fruit tea was also fantastic. I had a bubble tea too which was alright. The owners are a cute couple and they are so friendly and nice that I just want them to be happy. Do yourself a favor and don&apos;t go to Winterfell- come here instead."
5,"FYI: They serve more than just shaved ice here! From what I remember, they also have popsicles and different flavors of ice cream!

PROS: Ok so I know I usually put a &quot;what I got&quot; section but I honestly can&apos;t remember. It had matcha flavored shaved ice with toffee and mochi bits and condensed milk I wanna say. Either way, it was bomb. Like freakin amazing. About as close to actual Taiwanese shaved ice as you&apos;re going to get in Philadelphia. First of all, that machine looked imported straight from Asia. Second of all, the texture was beyond fluffy but it was still structured and didn&apos;t feel like straight ice chunks. It was more like ice fluffs, if that makes any sense. The matcha flavor was strong and the combo of toppings worked well with its flavor since they were all on the sweeter end. Super authentic (according to the husband, who&apos;s Taiwanese) and super delicious. 

CONS: Nothing major to complain about on my end.  The only thing would probably be aesthetics wise, it&apos;s not the cleanest and the biggest but it gives off a cute hole in the wall place vibe (which is what it is)."
5,"Cute neighborhood store front in West Philly. Super friendly owners.
Great authentic Taiwanese shaved ice, slowly making my way through the list."
