5,"Outdoor seating and distanced! Menus are electronic and servers are appropriately masked! 

Came here instead of Assembly one evening and we were soooooo happy we did! There&apos;s nearby parking with the Meter Up App. 

Ambiance is so nice, it&apos;s adjacent the BFP, so there were a few loud motorcycles going by and we needed to pause our conversations. Our server was Sarah, and she was extremely knowledgeable! 

We ordered the Oregon Pinot Noir- HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! It was simply delicious. 

The complimentary corn bread was superb with that salty butter. The shrimp cocktail was flavorful and fresh! The shrimp were large! And the cheese board was awesome. The salt chips were a great savory addition to the honey and nuts. I don&apos;t like blue cheese but I loved the other two. 

We had a great time! Will certainly revisit!"

Decided to try Urban Farmer this weekend to celebrate a birthday and enjoy a &quot;modern&quot; outdoor dining steakhouse experience. We made a reservation, but there were a number of empty tables (which may have been due to the rain that cleared up an hour before we arrived). The outdoor seating had a nice view of the Logan Square garden and fountain!

They&apos;ve adapted to the times by using a virtual menu that can be accessed with your phone. They have a cocktail menu and a more extensive wine menu available upon request. We decided to split a bottle of the malbec, los medanos. I was pretty underwhelmed by this bottle unfortunately, but there are many other choices. 

For the food, we decided to build our meal around the New York steak tasting ($66) which had 3 6 oz. cuts of distinctive steaks including a leaner steak, a fattier steak, and a dry-aged steak. We loved this way of trying a number of different cuts side by side - we agreed our favorite in the end was the dry-aged steak, but all of them were delicious! In addition, we ordered the baked mac n&apos; cheese, the roasted local mushrooms, and the candied bacon. The mac n&apos; cheese was cheese and delicious. The candied bacon was interesting and not as sweet as I feared, and had an interesting bacon jam on top. The only dish that underwhelmed was the mushrooms which just weren&apos;t all that special.

Finally, our waitress was able to honor my request of a surprise birthday sundae with a candle. We were very pleased with the dessert which had vanilla ice cream and a warm soft blondie. It was the perfect sweet ending to the meal.

Overall, I thought this was a very unique take on a steakhouse and a great outdoor dining experience. Would definitely recommend the steak tasting if you decide to go!"
5,"Dined  here in its outdoor heated patio. Loved fresh salad, cornbread, steak, mac and cheese, and chicken on a bed of mushrooms. Carrots were just ok."
3,"Close to the museum so figured we give it a go.

Food was okay, Baked Mac N Cheese was good, but at the end of the day it was a bit too pricy for the food!"
5,"Five stars!  Wow, we really liked this place.  In Philly for Labor Day weekend, we stayed at the Logan Hotel (gotta get my Hilton Honors points) and this restaurant is attached to it.  The weather was perfect and since outdoor dining was the only way to go, we had a beautiful table facing the parkway.  

Service was great from the word go.  Really friendly and knowledgeable staff with great suggestions.  Complimentary cornbread started us off and it was amazing.   Then we had an order of candied bacon and some shrimp as starters and both were great.  The bacon was truly memorable.  

My fiance and I shared the steak tasting as our entree.  That included three types of steak of differing provenance.  One was from Texas, another from North Carolina (amazing) and one local from Pennsylvania.  There&apos;s an option for a 4th but but three was plenty to split between us.  All of the steaks were perfectly cooked and had wonderful flavor.  Sides of asparagus, mushrooms and potatoes were all excellent.  I could eat the mushrooms or potatoes for a meal alone.  

Dessert was also amazing, with the butterscotch pudding being the way to go.   Also, the cocktails were excellent. I had two rye old fashioneds and I felt them the next morning...and I&apos;m no lightweight, and not just because I&apos;m pudgy.  

Definitely recommend this place for great food and service."
4,"My husband and I had not planned to stop here, but a long walk to and from City Hall to The Philadelphia Art Museum during and ice storm chilled us to the core and made us hungry. First, I have to say I was drawn to the name because it had a farm-to-table vibe which I appreciate as a &apos;foodie&apos;. We didn&apos;t have a reservation, but they have overflow tables set aside (it is in a hotel after all) for just that reason so we were very happy. I had the mulled wine which took a while to get to the table, but it was made to order and it was worth the wait! They bring you a tall piece of warm cornbread that was shaped like a silo and it was moist and delicious. It was served with butter, but really didn&apos;t need it. My husband had the braised octopus, I had the foie gras torchon and we shared the cauliflower almond soup. Everything was flavored well, but we had to ask for salt to add seasoning to the soup and the octopus was so overcooked, I could see the dryness when my husband cut into it. My recommendation to the chef is to pull it off the grill a bit sooner.  The foie gras was served on top of a graham cracker, which had me scratching my head, but I was pleasantly surprised. It was a large, soft cracker with a touch of sweetness that did not overpower the foie gras and could be cut with a knife. Bravo! These issues are easy fixes and we will definitely go back to have another go at the menu!"
5,"I love you as my neighbor restaurant! Delicious steaks, great service. I remember coming here for a planned brunch with my parents and they loved it"
4,"Though I&apos;d been to the Logan several times in the past, I never had the chance to check out Urban Farmer - but this past weekend opted to brunch here with a few friends and absolutely loved it. The tables are situated far enough apart to make me feel comfortable dining indoors sans mask, the trendy yet comforting decor made me feel like I could take any guest here (parents, SO, coworker) here and they&apos;d enjoy the ambiance, and the service was friendly and nimble. We ordered the avocado eggs Benedict, lobster eggs Benedict and the waffles - all were delicious, generously proportioned and reasonably priced. I&apos;d absolutely come here for brunch again."
2,"I really, really wanted to love UF, but sadly, it just didn&apos;t live up to the hype. Let&apos;s start with the good: Ample outdoor seating that is socially distanced; friendly service; paperless menus; decent cocktails. 

The food can only be described in one word - underwhelming. I love an upscale steakhouse, but this place is not it. To start, we got the deviled eggs which were very bland. That aside, I had high hopes for the steak, but if I&apos;m being honest, it tasted similar to something we would grill at home. While this isn&apos;t a bad thing (we cook some amazing steaks at home!), I expect more from an upscale dining establishment. The potatoes we got as a side were probably the best part of the meal. 

Overall, I was disappointed with the food. For our first time out to dinner in months due to the pandemic, our dinner here left a lot to be desired, especially given the price point."
5,"Came here for brunch on a whim, not knowing this is actually a steakhouse, but was pleasantly surprised! Clean, large, and well-decorated restaurant inside Logan Hotel. They have high-quality brunch items, like crabmeat omelet with real crabmeat, short rib hash with local mushrooms, and lobster benedict. It&apos;s not the cheapest brunch, as most items hover around ~$20, but my short rib hash was amazing and the cinnamon rolls seemed freshly homemade. The wait for the food was pretty long, but our server was nice and apologetic about it. 

Will definitely be back for dinner for a special occasion!"
5,"Great steakhouse!  When you order medium rare, it does come out medium rare, unlike other steakhouses.  Not to mention the filet was perfectly seasoned.

Huge Caesar salad.  You might need a knife for it.  See the picture!

Our waitress was very attentive.  Couldn&apos;t have asked for more.  It&apos;s almost as if she was right behind us all the time even when it was full house.

I will be back!"
5,"Early cool morning in Philly today still took the walk from the hotel over to Urban Farmers. Our waiter John was a super cool guy, great attitude, and very helpful with the menu and questions. 

We started off with fresh squeezed orange juice which I have to say it was very refreshing. From the &quot;Begin&quot; menu we chose the Cinnamon Rolls which were delicious.  John happen to let us know they are cooked in house and fresh baked on the weekends and in the mornings so we made a great choice with these. 

For our meals we chose the French Toast - brioche bread, mixed berry compote, almond butter and Philadelphia maple syrup. The next meal was the Short Rib Hash- potatoes, mushrooms, little peppers,spinach,bernaise, and eggs your style. 

The food was plenty I wasn&apos;t even able to finish my French toast. Great place and the decor was beautiful with many lights, different chairs, open space layout and a bar."
4,"lunch was fantastic!

i ordered the shrimp and grits with chucks of ham and it was so hearty! the plate is topped with a sunny egg and comes with the smokey ham, which reminded me more of bacon more, added the perfect accent.  urban farmer offers a variety of items even for lunch and so glad they included something for brunch lovers!  this was super comforting on a cold chilly day.  

nice space and cozy dining room.  i would definitely return for lunch if there&apos;s another opportunity to take a leisure lunch!"
4,"Beautiful location, better service and they serve la Colombe coffee. That combination can almost never go wrong! We were a party of 16 and had booked a table for brunch in Advance, even with a large size of our group, the service was personalized and no orders were wrong. We ordered almost everything but some of the things that were a sure hit were the crab Benedict, the short rib hash, the shrimp and grits. I also happened to order the side of potato which was a super yummy hash brown. 
I can&apos;t wait to go back and try the dinner and Steaks!"
2,"So underwhelmed by my experience here. I had to remind the waiter to take our entree orders as he completely forgot after putting our appetizers in, serving our appetizers and then letting us linger longer.  Then I had to fake going to the ladies room to track our waiter down to get a bill after we had been in the restaurant for close to three hours. Our table ordered three steaks medium rare, amongst other things, and all three were served medium. The food was fine.... the asparagus was very good I have to say and I did love my drink, but feel that high end prices should be accompanied by high end service and it was really lacking that evening."
5,"My coworker recommended this place. From the outside it does not look cool but wait until you enter.
The decor and ambiance was amazing. We got seated right away.

The corn bread they give you comes in a cool presentation and tastes delicious.

I had the seared scallops for my dinner, the portion was generous and the quinoa that comes with them was amazing.
The scallops were really well prepared."
5,"OH DAMN

I had heard great things about Urban Farmer from colleagues beforehand. Even so, I was at the Logan Hotel for an event, starving, and just wanted to grab something quick. It could&apos;ve been anything and I would&apos;ve been happy. That being said, I loved this place.

I got a burger and it&apos;s unique in the sense that it was served on a house made English Muffin. That part made me curious. But it was AWESOME. Cooked perfectly at the temperature requested and it just worked, and it was different.

Service was also top notch. Also loved the ambiance.

Highly recommend - if it&apos;s in your budget."
5,"Came here for brunch on a Sunday. We made a reservation so it was easy! Our server was very awesome and attentive, let us know his favs on the menu and never let our coffee or water get too low. 

I got the short rib hash and my friend got the shrimp and grits. Both were decent sized portions and left us SUPER full! The short rib hash was really good and had a good balance of meat and veggies. The shrimp and grits was sooo flavorful and really really good, coming from me, someone who never eats grits lol. We also tried a farmerosa which was quite delicious and refreshing. 

Would def recommend. The seats are very comfortable and I never felt rushed even though it was crowded. Some people came with dogs!"
5,"Please find my dinner review separate from this. I realized that I had forgot to mention the CORNBREAD and dinner rolls. A little odd to review a standard bread basket but HOLY COW. BF said that the cornbread was AWARD WORTHY and it&apos;s absolutely true. They bring it out in a tin can and it slides right out in the bread basket all warm and yummy. The super soft sweet cream butter is made on the premises. The little dinner rolls were so warm and soft and good as well but that cornbread is something f amazing. 
I&apos;m honestly still blown away by such a wonderful dining experience. This place goes down in the books for top 5 place we have ever eaten. Definitely a 5 all around. Next time we won&apos;t do steak(the steak sampler was good, (especially the wagyu)  but I want to try the scallops and salmon.

The Urban Farmer is a well run, calm but still exciting gem. The food is amazing. The staff are kind and chill
And knowledgeable. The cocktails were good. No hangovers next day so high quality alcohol. The Logan hotel is a great spot as they have couches and seating you can wander to with your drinks from Urban Farmer. It was a wonderful experience. Locally sourced, lots of food made right on premises. Beautiful spot. 

The host at the front was amazing. Didn&apos;t get their name but super tall and slender person with great energy."
4,"I have sampled the high life a couple of times at the Logan, sipping cocktails at Assembly, the hotels rooftop bar. I have enjoyed some F$@# work bourbons at the Commons the hotels lobby bar, even had the chance to see a few members of the Wu-Tang Clan all great experiences, experiences that prepared me for the amazing dining service at Urban Farmer.

The atmosphere of this establishment doesn&apos;t have the typical steakhouse feel. The atmosphere is a little more open and brighter that most steak establishments. 

Dinner service kicked off with a nice bourbon on the rocks. The ladies in our party decided we were going to go with a seafood tower appetizer. The tower consisted of lobster tail, lamb crab, jumbo shrimp, muscles, and salmon tartare. It was not as plentiful as some of the other seafood towers I have had from other establishments. This is why I wasn&apos;t able to go above four stars. 

When it was time to order entrees I already had my sights set on the 24oz, 30 day dry-aged ribeye. What an exceptional cut of meat! When you have the opportunity to consume any premium cut of meat, dry-aged over 30 days, please do not hesitate to consume the flavors of a perfectly seared, medium-rare to medium, quality cut of dry-aged perfection. 

I am not sure where Urban Farmer ranks among my to tier steakhouse experiences, but just like the flavor of this quality cut of dry-aged goodness it&apos;s lingering up there."
