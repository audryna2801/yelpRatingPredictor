5,"Slam dunk, hands down, my favorite restaurant in Philadelphia. 

If I had a friend visiting Philly for a weekend and they could only eat one thing while they were here, Bing Bing Dim Sum&apos;s Cheesesteak Bao Bun would be it. It is the greatest food on this planet and I stand by that statement wholeheartedly. 

Seriously though, Bing Bing is the best. The vibe is great, situated right on Passyunk ave and the interior design is awesome. It&apos;s the perfect blend of cool, but not pretentious, and a spot where you can get a great cocktail but not be shamed if you just want a shot and a beer. 

THE STAFF. The staff is always so nice. I don&apos;t know why or how they are always so nice but they are and I adore them for it. 

Must eats - cheesesteak bao bun, obviously, but also the pork soup dumplings, lamb dumpling, cucumber salad, caterpillar bread, and dan dan noodles. I am a big baby when it comes to spice and everything here is so perfectly seasoned with just a little kick to it, although I&apos;m sure you could ask them to up the ante if you&apos;re into that kind of thing. 

AND - It travels well! I&apos;ve gotten takeout from here a couple times over the last few months and it&apos;s always been just as good as it is when eating in the restaurant. 

Overall 10/10!"
5,"We came here for the restaurant week $35 menu. Overall came away very impressed. Comfortable heated outdoor seating right on E Passyunk (not an enclosed tent thankfully! A patio with heat lamps). The food was elevated and memorable, I particularly loved the Brussels sprouts which had surprisingly combinations of rich flavors; and also the chicken meatballs which were savory, tangy, moist, and wonderful. Will be back!"
5,"Outstanding meal at Bing Bing.  They are doing very well with their COVID setup with their street side, covered patio setup.  There are heaters and it&apos;s completely open air on one side to keep the air flow.  The food was fantastic.  Our table favorites were the cheesesteak bao, scarlet dumplings, and far and away the mei fun noodles especially with a touch of chili oil.  All was very good though.  They also have a happy hour, so would be more cost effective to check that out, too."
3,"I went here for the E. Passyunk restaurant week and found lots of pros and cons. PRO- very spaced out seating, heaters, and the delicious brussel sprouts. CONS- Nothing was as amazing as anticipated. Eggplant was spicy but not overly flavorful and the soup dumplings were not that exciting. My friend and I also had to BOTH use the restaurant week menu or not which was a bummer. 

Overall great atmosphere but a small menu that didn&apos;t do a lot of me. Wine in a whiskey glass is also odd to me."
4,"I am a big fan of Bing Bing. I&apos;ve been there a few times already. Most recently during this pandemic. For those who haven&apos;t been there yet, I am happy to report that they have a pretty good COVID-19 setup. Despite them having such a small location, they make really good use of the curbside area for seating. They have a sufficient number of heat lamps going, the tables are spaced out far enough, menus are available via QR code, and the servers are all masked up. I&apos;ve been to a couple of places during this outbreak, and Bing Bing is one of the spots where I&apos;ve felt most at-ease. So, if you&apos;re itching to get out but worried about your safety, you can rest easy going there.

In my most recent visit, I&apos;ve gotten a few staples such as their pork soup dumplings (good lord are they amazing), their cheesesteak bao, and right now they have fried Thanksgiving dumplings with an amazing ginger cranberry sauce topping. The overall dumpling was okay, but that cranberry sauce they top them with is what really pulled it together amazingly. I doubt they&apos;ll be around beyond the week this review is being written, so if that sounds like something up your alley, give them a visit this week. And if not, go anyway. Especially as it gets colder out, it&apos;s up to us to keep places like Bing Bing busy!"
4,"This is one of those spots in the city where even if you only get a chance to eat there once, you&apos;ll never forget it. 

Firstly, the aesthetic of the interior is this cool modern play on traditional chinese culture. Their walls are covered with this graffiti style art, and there are lanterns and lights hung throughout. Just a ton of positive energy as you walk through the door. 

You can&apos;t go wrong with anything menu. Whether you are looking for dumplings or noodles, they have yummy options for both vegetarians and meat eaters. 

The dish that stole the show for us was their egg custard dessert. This is a MUST get.

While Passyunk is covered with all different types of restaurants and cuisine, you want to put this at the top of this list."
4,"I&apos;ve been dying to try this place since it always smells good and seems busy with people. There is an order window where you can pick up to-go or order delivery. There is no indoor seating, but outdoor seating is available at this time. All staff wear masks. 

The food took an hour to cook, which was a long wait, but they told us from the beginning what to expect. The food was fresh and very hot, even after we arrived home with our order. We got dan dan and mei fun noodles as well as their cheesesteak buns. It was all flavorful and delicious. Very happy to have finally tried this place and would like to try other things on their menu next time."
5,Love Bing Bing Dim Sum! So incredibly delicious and awesome staff! They have amazing safe seating outdoors. The dumplings were to die for and my glazed pork shank bon bon was so good! Also the Brussels sprouts was very good as well! Very popular place definitely make reservations early. Highly recommend stopping in. Follow me @sebbybelly on Instagram!
4,"I&apos;ve heard a lot about this place throughout my year years in Philly, but only recently got a chance to go. Made a reservation through open table, although it seemed like they had plenty of tables for walk ins. Hours are reduced so just be aware. 

Masks are required when ordering and there are options for paper menus as well as using the qr code for the menu. 

We got the caterpillar bread, the brussel sprouts, the cheese steam steak bao, and the turnip cake. I would say everything here is really good and innovative. I&apos;m not here for real super authentic Asian food. We&apos;re here for the fusion of cuisines. 

The pork in the caterpillar bread was amazing and the sweetness of the bread was such a good pairing. The cheesesteak bao was also another stand out. Pan fried with a crispy exterior and tender steak with sharp cheddar on the inside, definitely one of a kind!

Will definitely try out their other dumplings next time!"
4,"An update on my previous review! COVID-19 has rocked the city but this place definitely comes through! Their tables are situated outside and they are actually shaded due to the building! So when we got there at 6:30 on a Thursday night, it was cool and breezy and Perfect.

The staff are friendly and hope you weren&apos;t waiting for the table and sitting down. The tables are numbered so it&apos;s easy to identify. And if you wear your mask you can certainly go inside and use the restroom. Other than that, no one enters. Besides the staff

The food here is delicious and a small bit on the pricey side but it&apos;s worth it for the location, scenery, and atmosphere.

We fancy the caterpillar bread, the cheesesteak bao, the Dan Dan noodles, and the Koji beef. 
They also told us the pork soup dumplings, even though they weren&apos;t on the menu, were an option so of course we got those too! Overall, the portion sizes are pretty small for their appetizers but their meals are definitely plentiful. 
Drinks were delicious and served at a good temperature."
4,"tl;dr don&apos;t expect authentic dim sum -- a trendy, industrial vibe and twists on traditional favorites define this Asian-American fusion bar

From the group behind Cheu Noodles, Bing Bing Dim Sum takes quintessential dim sum and turns it on its head. The space itself channels red tones and trendy industrial vibes throughout an intimate room. Colorful lights illuminate the street art that is graffitied along the walls. The restaurant is abuzz with chatter, and multiple people brush past the back of your chair as they navigate the borderline-cramped walkways. Eccentrically shaped tables are custom-fit to the space, and the booths sit beneath personal pagodas. Intricate details are sprinkled throughout the room from hand-painted lamps to customized window decals.

My partner and I reserved a table for 5:15PM on a Friday -- just in time for happy hour. By the time we arrived, the restaurant was in full force, and we were escorted to the final available table. For drinks, I went with the Tired Hands pilsner on draft, my partner picked out the Milk Money cocktail. Then, we opted for an assortment of dim sum offerings: the Pickle Plate, the Cheesesteak Bao, the Mongolian Beef Dumplings, the Scarlet Dumplings, and the Caterpillar Bread. The dishes filed out as they were prepared, and our table quickly filled up with a myriad of aromatic plates.

The pickle platter consisted of carrots, green beans, kimchi, and roasted nuts -- a nice amuse-bouche, but nothing to write home about. The bao were stuffed with ribeye, cooper sharp, and long hots, with a richness perfectly complemented by sweet plum sauce. The beef dumplings were decorated with chimichurri and crispy onions -- yet, they were essentially indistinguishable from your run-of-the-mill pan-fried variety. The veggie dumplings, on the other hand, were coiled in a vibrant beet wrapper; while the texture was slightly less crisp, this dish was the freshest and least greasy vegetarian takes on dumplings I&apos;ve had the pleasure to try. Finally, the caterpillar bread had the fluffiness of bao, but was drizzled with a just-less-than-overwhelming caramelized honey syrup to perfectly contrast the rich and salty barbequed pork filling.

Bing Bing is fun, and, true to the restaurant group, doesn&apos;t take itself to seriously. My major gripe is that cocktails are beyond expensive -- during happy hour, my pint ran me $5, while my partner&apos;s drink soared upwards of $10! To put it in other words, would you rather have 1 drink or 4 cheesesteak bao? Nonetheless, with a bevy of yummy, cheap food offerings, I see myself coming back here very soon."
5,"This place is pretty bomb for their American take on dim sum! I was surprised by how everything tasted because I was a bit skeptical. There are too many times where I&apos;ve tried Asian food with an American twist and it goes wrong but this place took me by surprise. 

We ordered the pork soup dumplings, cucumber salad, cheesesteak bao, and Dan Dan Noodles. Cheesesteak bao was actually one of my favorites and definitely unique. It was perfectly baked on the outside while the inside was tender and the cheese was melted perfectly with the steak! Pork soup dumplings were delicious. The cucumber salad was refreshing and love that we started off our dinner with this! Dan dan noodles were okay, it could be more peanut-y, or more sauce. 

I suggest making a reservation. We came during quarantine but the waiter was super accommodating and we got to our seat without having to wait. Def will come back again!"
2,"Good service but I&apos;m not really sure where the hype for this place came from. I read tons of good reviews but when I went there, it was just an overpriced gentrified dim sum house. None of it tasted like dim sum... they serve the dishes on asian plates and in steamers to give it that asian aesthetic feel but the food was not satisfying at all. Everything we got was really sweet (maybe that was the Jewish twist?) and lacked flavor. My party of 5 and I were quite disappointed. Am I shocked to find an over glorified and gentrified dim sum house in the middle of philly?? Nah. I just expected the flavors to maybe be there with all the hype. I hope people that come here don&apos;t actually think this is what dim sum is supposed to taste like. If you&apos;re going to be a fusion, maybe make it more clear you&apos;re a fusion and not a dim sum place."
5,"I can&apos;t believe it took me this long to get to Bing Bing - what a great fusion spot! I came here with two friends on a Saturday night around 5:30pm. We didn&apos;t have a reservation, but they were able to seat us outside right away.

I had the rotating Tired Hands draft to drink (a honey saison), which was amazing (as I expected it to be). We decided to share a few dishes. My favorite by far was the Brussels Sprouts (with fried tofu, maple sweet and sour, and pickled red onion). Holy moly - they were so caramelized and delicious. We also had the Dan Dan Noodles and subbed shiitake mushrooms for the ground pork (the noodles also came with cucumber, radish, and peanut). We had some of these noodles leftover and took them home, and weirdly enough, they were better the second day! Finally, we got the Eggplant Mapo Tofu (sichuan chili sauce, yu choy, jasmine rice). While this was probably my least favorite dish (just because the tofu preparation didn&apos;t blow me away as much as I was expecting based on the two previous dishes), it was still yummy."
2,"Sadly this was my first meal following months of quarantine. Although the accommodations made for COVID-19 were on point the food left much to be desired. 

We got two orders of pork soup dumplings, a caterpillar bread, and dan dan noodles to share. The soup dumplings were the best of the trio and had a lot of soup in each dumping. The vinegar and ginger sauce on the side could have come with a few more slices of ginger and although the soup was plenty it did not have a rich pork flavor. These came 4 for $9 when other places in Philly will give you 6 or 8 soup dumplings for the same price.

The caterpillar bread was disappointing for the price, $10 for a bit of pulled pork in bread with honey drizzled on the plate. The dan dan noodles were okay but the beef was a bit salty for my taste and the noodles were too hard/chewy. 

Overall if you are looking for dim sum there are a lot better places to go in Philly that have more variety, better prices and more traditional dishes done right."
5,Adorable outdoor dining with really powerful heaters for each table. Their options are great for vegetarians and meat eaters - the Dan Dan wirh mushrooms are fantastic but their Brussel sprouts are to die for! They also have a great assortment of cocktails - the hot toddy they have on special right now is my favorite.
5,"It&apos;s my first night in Philadelphia and my friend just so happens to live around the corner from Bing Bing Dim Sum. We had Shane as our server and he was amazing! All of his recommendations were outstanding and he made our experience great! The menu recently changed so two of the suggestions we tried were the Brussels sprouts and the Taiwanese duck noodle soup. I will definitely be back for the soup alone! Also, the cocktails are delicious. Thank you, Shane, for a perfect first night in Philadelphia."
4,Even though Bing Bing didn&apos;t have as diverse of a menu as other dim sum places that I&apos;ve been to...I&apos;ve seriously considered making the nearly five-hour drive back to Philly just to get the bao bun cheesesteak again. I think that says it all.
1,"Rude staff! I understand they are tired but I don&apos;t know why they put their stress on their customers, giving side stares and scratching their tummy in front of me (...?)

Super americanized food. Shrimp dumplings were a nightmare for a Korean. Frozen dumplings from HMart are better than these. Horrifying."
4,"Bing Bing is such a great, vegetarian friendly Asian fusion restaurant! I came here for dinner with two friends and we all split the Brussels Sprouts (served with fried tofu, a sweet and sour maple sauce, and pickled red onion), Dan Dan Noodles (with cucumber, radish, peanuts, and shiitake mushrooms instead of ground pork), and the Eggplant Mapo Tofu (with chili sauce, yu choy, and jasmine rice).
The Dan Dan Noodles and Eggplant Mapo Tofu were good and while I definitely appreciated how they were vegetarian alternatives to traditionally meat-heavy dishes, I felt that they were lacking spice and flavor. I didn&apos;t get any of the szechuan peppercorn taste that you&apos;re supposed to get with the traditional dishes which was a bummer.
Out of all of them, the Brussels Sprouts were my favorite! They were phenomenal. The sauce was amazing and they were roasted to perfection. One of my friends was also raving about the Spicy Sichuan Cucumbers so it was a shame we didn&apos;t have the stomach space to try it as well! Portions were big and we even had leftovers."
