4,"I&apos;m updating my review after I came back and dined indoors, which was a whole new experience!

Takeout was a bit hectic since they&apos;re so popular, and the service seemed lacking because of it. I wanted to give it another try since the dim sum is tasty. 

This time, the service was amazing. The waiter who served us was nice and tentative. I ordered xiao long bao, Shanghainese pan dumpling, shu mai, and scallion pancake. None of it disappointed. In fact, it tasted so much better fresh and hot, as expected. 

I loved the dining-in experience and I can&apos;t wait to be back."
4,"4 stars for ease of takeout process - order online and quickly can pick up orders right at the front. 

4.5 stars for the pan-fried soup dumplings - my personal favorite coming here - not something you see on the menus that often, the crispy solid exterior with a burst of warm soup and delicious pork inside. 

3.5 stars for regular soup-dumplings - I think the takeout process is hard for soup-dumplings in general, but the flavor and soup held up well about 45 minutes after I picked up my order and actually went to dig-in. 

3.5 stars for charred BBQ &quot;cha-siu&quot; meats - this comes in their cold appetizer selection. Easy to refrigerate and eat as a supplemental snack to lunch or dinner as leftovers. Bite sized cuts of meat.

3 stars for noodle dishes - I think I&apos;ve run into this mistake several times I have come, the sauces tend to be too heavy-handed and end up drowning the noodles. The cuts of meat usually are delicious but the noodles themselves left something to be desired.

This place usually has a long line in pre-covid times, so I would order online early.

Tips/Takeaways:
-Get the pan-fried soup dumplings over the regular soup-dumplings for something different and to hold up better with Takeout
-Available online for ordering
-Would recommend checking out for Takeout
-Would recommend elsewhere for Noodle dishes
-Support local!"
5,"Haven&apos;t dined in, in a very long while but the takeout is just as delicious. My husband and I make it a point to stop here every time we visit Philly. We&apos;ve eaten it at the airport, in the car wherever and it&apos;s still just as delicious as dining in. The menu is loaded with delicious choices and so many dumplings! Our favorite are the chicken, shrimp shumai, and the pork and chive. I would also recommend the noodles, all hand drawn right on premises. One thing to note if you dine in they may still be cash only!"
3,"Maybe I should have stuck to the dim sum. I tried the sesame chicken. Mistake. It tastes like fried dough drenched in ketchup. I wasn&apos;t impressed at all with this dish. I&apos;ve been spoiled by China Lights in DC which has the best sesame chicken I&apos;ve ever had. This is one of my favorite meals and there&apos;s a spot off City Avenue in West Philly that makes it really well too. Unfortunately, this garden needs to stick to dim sum. 
BUT the brisket and noodles was good. The flavors mended well and the noodles were perfectly cooked. The brisket was fatty but it was still tasty and hot and tender. That is a dish I&apos;d order again and highly recommend to others.
The spring rolls were fine. I liked how much cabbage they had in them. But they are really small so get plenty if you are feeding more than 2 people. 
Ultimately, I think I&apos;d go back for the noodles and the dim sum which they are known for. Don&apos;t try your luck on anything else on the menu."
5,"This place is the absolute best! We have been going for a long time (just after they relocated to their current spot), but it&apos;s gotten so popular and busy the past couple years. There would always be people lined up inside the restaurant waiting for a table.

Pretty much everything they have is delicious, and the best part is that because it&apos;s dim sum, you can try so many different items. The soup dumplings are the one thing you MUST get, though! They are the specialty here. Once you&apos;ve stuffed yourself with so much delicious food, you will be surprised at how affordable the bill is. Especially if you&apos;re going with a bunch of people and sharing, this can actually be a very cheap meal for the incredible quality of food you get."
5,"If you want soup dumplings, come to this place! They have a really good soup dumplings with pork, pork and crab, and chicken. They even have panfried soup dumplings, which I would like to try next. 

They, of course, have other dim sum dishes, such as scallion pancakes, dumplings, and shao mai. They also have a variety of cold dish appetizers, like yummy spicy beef tripe. You can get a variety of Chinese food here!

One of my favorite dishes that they have is the sweet-and-sour spareribs. You definitely get your money&apos;s worth! I would probably stay away from the beef ho fun.  It was just OK. There was nothing too special about it, and I think there are a lot more places that have better noodles."
3,Ordered a delivery of the famous spicy pork soup dumplings and fish in spicy sauce. The soup dumplings tasted much better in the restaurant then by delivery as was getting cold. The fish was just okay there wasn&apos;t much flavor to it and did not enjoy it as much. Did not find it value for money given the food got cold by the time it was delivered and lacked some flavors for sure! Also ordered Mango smoothie which was just crushed ice and water with some Mango syrup in it. Very disappointed by what they call it smoothie.
5,Ordered takeout here online and it was so delicious! We got the beef brisket noodles (without soup) and the pork dumplings. The pork dumplings were juicy and steaming hot when we got them. The chili oil and vinegar are a must. You pay an additional charge for them when you order online. My only con from the meal was that the beef brisket noodles were super oily. It may be less oily if you get it with soup. Forgot to snap any pics because I was too excited to eat the meal. Would def recommend this place if you&apos;re looking for a place to eat in Chinatown!
3,"My friend recommended us to come here specifically for the soup dumplings (my favorite!) and warned us that there would be a wait. We tried to get a table outside but the wait was too long so we opt for a to go order. We were told to come back in 25 mins so we did. When we came back we were rudely greeted by a server/host, I understand that he was very busy and I don&apos;t mind waiting but he would just ignore us (me and a few other customers waiting for pick up) and walked away. When he came back all he would ask is &quot;phone?&quot; &quot;Phone?&quot; As if he can&apos;t help us if we don&apos;t have the order confirmation ready on our phone to show him. So customer service wise, I give this place 1 star.
Food wise, soup dumplings barely had any soup in it and the buns were dry and not as flavorful as it should have been. Overall very average"
5,"Listen here:

This place is my friends favorite restaurant..in the WORLD.. so getting to see him eat 18 pork dumplings was euphoric. But onto my personal review
Service- funniest coolest server I&apos;ve had since nam. He was everything we needed being hungover.. always keeping up with the eaters and that stuff.
Food- Obviously amazing. The flavors are fantastic and the dim sum sauce at the table is a must! As well as the chilli spice sauce. I am veggie girl so I got noods instead of the famous dumplings.. but watching my friends eat the dumplings was good enough for me. My noodles were thick just how i likem.
Atmosphere- Its a no muss no fuss kinda place, looks well taken care of, the place is more long and narroa which gives it a cool vibe."
4,"During Covid times unfortunately there is not much social distancing inside the stores. There is outside seating available but it&apos;s very busy with cars running down the road. The soup dumplings were so chewy and delicious, and the potato pancakes were so crispy. The shumai was OK."
4,"5 stars for the pan fried pork soup dumplings; they will change your life! So flavorful, juicy and savory. 

I also loved the crispy noodles with chicken! This dish had something (maybe egg-y) in the sauce that made it stand out from everything else + a nice variety of shrooms/veggies mixed in. Will order again!

veggie steamed buns - will skip next time (there was a pungent flavor in there that was very off-putting though the texture of the bun was nice) 

Wonton soup - this is a huge portion for what I was expecting, refreshing in comparison to the other dishes but still brightly flavored

Chili cabbage pork noodles - tasty but I could probably do without. It was overwhelmingly flavored with soy sauce and oils, just too greasy

It seems like there&apos;s always a wait here, but it goes quickly, and is absolutely worth it"
5,"So many wonderful Chinese places to eat in Chinatown and the greater Philly area, but I&apos;m glad we stumbled across Dim Sum Garden tonight. 

We understood this place can be really busy so we budgeted in enough time but were then happy to find that there were a couple small tables when we walked up for dinner. 

For the two of us we ordered 2 roast pork buns, an order of steamed pork soup dumplings (8 count), 6 pan fried spicy pork soup dumplings and a fried rice. Our eyes were bigger than our stomachs as we ended taking the fried rice to-go. 

With the one exception being that the roast pork buns were a little dried out and hard, the food was fantastic! Everything tasted amazing, came out piping hot, and the wait staff were attentive and making sure everything g was to our satisfaction and our waters were topped off. 

Great experience, excellent food and very reasonable prices. 

Pro tip: Cash only so come prepared with greenbacks."
1,"The most trash service on take out! 
They matched my order quantity buy missed three dishes! I ordered 12 different dishes! They gave me 9 dishes and missed three dishes but gave me some off the menu dishes just to match the quantity of my order! Never again! I even asked the Chinese dude, he was like ya ya everything there yea ye ya."
5,"Obv this is the place you come to in Philly if you want soup dumplings. Our server was great - funny &amp; awkward, just the way I like it. Food was quick, hot, plentiful, and SO FLAVORFUL! Only complaint is that they should rinse off the glass sauce containers on the tables, they were quite sticky! But other than that, just go and try for yourself. You won&apos;t find another place to get quality soup dumplings like this in the city. Cash only if you are dinning in."
4,"Very friendly and COVID safe spot. I ordered the crystal veggie dumplings (the difference between these and the regular ones; these are gluten free), and they were delicious. The dumplings were filled with minced veggies and while I didn&apos;t mind at all, the texture was an issue for my kids (they still enjoyed the flavor though)."
5,"Dim Sum Garden is absolutely incredible. 5 stars. 10/10. Highly recommend. Everyone should go. 

Something I am particularly excited about is they are offering delivery of frozen dim sum during the pandemic. You can order packs of dumplings, prepared but not cooked scallion pancakes, buns, etc. I got a bunch of stuff! Super easy prep. And I have pretty left in the freezer for another day! Even the soup dumplings turned out perfectly."
4,"Solid Philly dim sum tucked into Chinatown! I definitely can&apos;t say it&apos;s the best dim sum I&apos;ve ever had in my entire life, but it&apos;s enjoyable and the prices are fair. Service was standard, and the restaurant itself has a homey vibe to it. Keep in mind it&apos;s cash only, but they do have an ATM inside. I was seated immediately on a walk-in basis on a Monday morning. I also did takeout on another occasion.

I had the Shanghai crabmeat and pork soup dumplings, Yeung Chow fried rice and shrimp dumplings. The soup dumplings were probably my favorite, because the broth was quite flavorful. The shrimp dumplings were solid, not necessarily better than the next dim sum spot&apos;s; they&apos;re just standard. The fried rice was also not standout but not bad. 

Overall a very safe place to go to for dim sum on the east coast."
5,"This place never fails! The service is extremely fast and everything is reasonably priced. You&apos;ll have leftovers for days. This time, my bf and I ordered beef Ho fun noodles, sweet and sour chicken, and ma po tofu with minced pork. The ma po tofu with pork was a tad bit too spicy for me, but very flavorful. The version with no pork is not spicy whatsoever. The Ho fun noodles was so good and the tender beef was a nice touch!"
5,"We waited a little bit but it was worth it!!! The staff was funny and really nice! I wish we had one of these places in Kansas City! I loved their spicy Xiao long bao (soup dumplings)- a must try!! Everything was literally soo good!! We had the pork soup dumplings, the spicy ones, crabmeat + pork, fried beef and potato cake, pork bao buns, pan fried soup dumplings!!"
