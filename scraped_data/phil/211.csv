5,"One of my favorite studios when on the road...most certainly better than many of the Boston studios, about on par with Austin, but not quite as fab at Castro. 
Well-designed with locker rooms upstairs and a well laid-out studio. Front desk staff are lovely and the instructors I&apos;ve taken - Nick and Ryan - were both great. 
Two thumbs up!"
2,"Spinning in a dark, loud room that could be mistaken for a club is not for me apparently. With it being extremely difficult to hear the instructor and little to no instruction provided other than &quot;we spin to the beat of the music&quot;, I didn&apos;t find it very welcoming to beginners. While not for me, I encourage you to decide for yourself as it was a packed house for a fitness center!

Pros included a killer music mix. I basically made up my own work out because I couldn&apos;t hear the directions over the music and while I could look around everyone appeared to be doing something different. The time on the bike flew by as well.

Speaking of the bike, I&apos;ve spun before and know good equipment when I use it. The shower facilities were also top notch.

Cons include what I mentioned already. I come to a class to learn from an instructor, and hate not being able to follow along. I&apos;m used to be lost or confused a bit, but I was on my own the entire class. I can use a stationary bike at another gym with my own music selection for much cheaper. I could embrace the DJ experience if the room wasn&apos;t kept pitch black 80% of the time. Also, sweat alone does not equal a good workout and the room was kept hot. I don&apos;t need the ac blasting but some cool circulation is appropriate."
3,"Everyone was pretty welcoming. This was mostly spinning, a little bit of dance movements, and some light upper body dumbbell work, all stationary on a spin bike. Overall, it was hard to hear anything and the instruction was meant for people that have already been there. Great playlist and instructor gave a little bit of a story with a life lesson. You can tell pretty fast who is a regular, and people are all synched up to the music. The studio is very clean, but dark and hot. Hard to justify $20 for the class."
2,"Cults are not my thing. I got dragged here for a friend&apos;s birthday celebration. Not my idea of fun, but I love my friend, so I shelled out the $$ for the class. I exercise pretty regularly and generally enjoy spin classes, but SoulCycle was different. The moment I walked in, I felt like an outsider. There was some sort of weird energy in the room. The staff was friendly enough, and the lockers were pretty straightforward.

How would I describe the experience? Well, the episode of Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt doing that spin class (I believe the episode is &quot;Kimmy Rides a Bike&quot;) perfectly portrays SoulCycle. Being on the bike and seeing dozens of people around me simultaneously move together in a dimly-lit room to the beat of loud rave music evoked images of North Korean propaganda videos. I&apos;m personally not a fan of that type of vibe when I&apos;m trying to exercise, but I can see how it can appeal to some people.

The workout itself was great though!"
4,"Went in for another visit.  There&apos;s a shoe rental fee which no one noticed for my account until now.  Kinda with I had it all paid for beforehand.  Don&apos;t like the idea that I have to be charged automatically from having a card on file, and would like to know that I have the option to pay for the rental in addition to the classes beforehand.

Nick was a great instructor, and was very enthusiastic and personal with a smaller classes.  I&apos;m guessing that an early session might have less people in it too. I was in the last evening session of the day as an earlier one would not accommodate my work schedule. 

If you can get in a less crowded session, I think there is generally more comfort because you don&apos;t feel like you will bump into anyone, at least if you don&apos;t know anyone at the studio.

With the smaller numbers, a female staffer double checked and gave me some more than helpful tips for properly tightening the bike back up.

He had a good variety of exercises, and pace was a bit fast for me, but I tried to keep up when I could.  His husband was there that day, who I think congratulated me after the workout.  It was obvious I was new as he has his regulars."
5,"Extremely clean facility, very cool workers, and even better workout. I just finished my first Soul Cycle class and I loved the energy of it. It really gets your heart pumping and I got extremely sweaty. I felt so comfortable that I even took off my shirt.

The thing I would do next time is probably go a little heavier on weights during the &quot;weightlifting&quot; part. I just didn&apos;t know what to expect so kept the weights they gave me. I do wish this part was a little longer, but considering it&apos;s a cycling class, I shouldn&apos;t ask for more weights. Lol

Can&apos;t wait to go back and do another class"
4,"(To the tune of &quot;Happy&quot; by Pharrell)

It might seem crazy what I&apos;m &apos;bout to say
SoulCycle Rittenhouse is here to stay.
And though I have yet to drink the Kool-Aid
I can see why folks come here most every day.

It makes them happy
Tap it back if you feel like you&apos;re riding that Soul high
Oh yes, they&apos;re happy
Tap it back if you feel like endorphins to the sky
Heck yes, they&apos;re happy
Tap it back if you are jazzed up, and you&apos;re drenched in sweat
(And yes, I&apos;m happy)
Tap it back, because Soul - well, I just haven&apos;t quit you yet.

A few things: SoulCycle is definitely towards the higher end when it comes to pricing of boutique fitness in Philadelphia. And, to me, it&apos;s good - but I don&apos;t know if it warrants QUITE the price tag attached to it.

That said, if you&apos;ve got the cash and enjoy the ride, there&apos;s nothing like it in Philadelphia. The standard SoulCycle class often feels like, to me, a combination of cycling and setting intentions a la yoga. There&apos;s always great tunes, there&apos;s always a lot of emotion attached to the ride, and (if you&apos;re in a class with a lot of regulars), it can be intimidating. But if you just kind of &quot;let go&quot; and enjoy, it&apos;s hard to not enjoy yourself! 

Their newest class style, SoulActivate, is a little more my nature - a little more performance-based, feels athletic instead of emotive, and more intense. I&apos;m a fan."
1,"I love spinning and am an avid spinner.  I have tried soul cycle several times, with several different instructors and different locations and states.  I just don&apos;t understand the cult following. 

The room is insanely hot when you walk in, and then everyone else shows up and the temperature climbs even higher, and we haven&apos;t even started working out yet!  this is such a millenial sham, where you feel like you are working hard because you walk out drenched, but in reality its because the room is a sauna and we are stuffed in like sardines with 60 other people.  I asked to turn on the fans (which I swear, are purely for decorative purposes), and was told that its the instructor that makes the decision.  I&apos;m the one paying 30 plus a class to work out, I think the customers should make that decision. 

I have tried several smaller (not chain) studios and am so much happier.  Everyone is laid back and don&apos;t take themselves so seriously.  The studios are cold, where you have to work hard to get that sweat.  

  I just feel bad that people are spending so much money to get an illusion of being healthy or working out."
4,"I&apos;ve been interested in seeing what SoulCycle is all about so I booked a class. Upon arrival the staff was extremely friendly and helpful. They explained everything to the detail. 

I will admit that the facility is very clean and organized. I arrived in a dark room with a very enthusiastic trainer. She really hypes you up and gets you excited during the workout, which helps you overcome even during the most challenging parts. The one con that I have is if your form is wrong or if you put the bike on the wrong setting then it messes up the whole workout. I would recommend Soul Cycle to beginners who want some kind of motivation and definitely to have fun during their workouts because it feels like you&apos;re dancing while cycling."
5,"My happy place  amazing staff and instructors, killer classes with great music!! 
Studio is super clean, and has a great vibe. I always leave happy even after the worst days :)"
4,"My friend and I are on a SoulCycle high. We tried our first $20 class 2 weeks ago with Bryant and we were not disappointed. This was my first cycling/spinning class ever. As a huge fan of fitness and trying out different ways to get my sweat on, SoulCycling is towards the top of my &quot;favorite forms of cardio&quot; list.

When we walked into our class, we were met with a small candle lit room. Not to mention -- wall shaking music. During the 1 hour session, you get a whole music blasting cycling journey that is more than just doing cardio. It&apos;s so fun you actually forget you&apos;re working out! The class instructor guides you through a mentally exhilarating (and challenging) workout which includes pumping your legs vigorously on the cycle while pushing yourself to increase the bike&apos;s resistance as well as do movements such as push ups &amp; crunches to activate other muscles in the body. For the most part you&apos;re giving it your all during this entire session, but then again, it&apos;s up to you how much effort you put in. 

After our first class and feeling like jello for days, we were determined to come back to redeem ourselves. My first class I took a good amount of breaks and definitely could&apos;ve pushed myself more. The following week, we opted to buy the $60 for 3 classes package (this does not include cycle shoe rentals) . And again, the 1 hour SoulCycle class challenged me physically &amp; calmed me mentally.

If you&apos;re looking for a FUN way to burn calories for that summer body or just to get your cardiovascular system working better, I would say give SoulCycling a shot! One star knocked off for the pricing, but of course you&apos;re paying for what you get for.

Tips for first timers:
1) Get there early!!! You will definitely need help with setting up these cycles before the class starts.
2) Bring a bottle of water (preferably a bigger sized one)
3) Give it your all! If you don&apos;t you&apos;re probably going to feel like you didn&apos;t get your money&apos;s worth"
5,"I could not love Soul Cycle more!  Every day that I am signed up and the middle of the work day hits, my mind says &quot;ughhh I don&apos;t want to work out&quot; and then I say, &quot;wait it&apos;s Soul Cycle.&quot;

My first class I felt a little corny, but the moves, the motivational talks - they&apos;re part of the experience.  It&apos;s insane how fast a 45 minute class goes!

Yes, the price is expensive, but it&apos;s cheaper than therapy and Soul Cycle has seriously helped my mind!  I only go once a week but it helps with my endurance and breathing during other work outs!

The studio itself is brand new, super clean and organized.  The staff could not be more friendly!  They all welcome you right away, ask if you need help.  I&apos;ve only ever had Byrant and Nick as instructors - both are great!  Different styles, but each are equally as amazing!  

Do yourself a favor, splurge even if it&apos;s once a month."
4,"Alright, I gave in to the SoulCycle hype... classes are hard AF, and there&apos;s no way you&apos;ll leave without sweating your ass off during class. But what makes SoulCycle stand out from other boutique fitness classes, IMO, is that both the instructors AND the riders bring so much spirit and energy to each class. Another thing I love about SoulCycle is that the playlists give me so much life during rides. The biggest criticisms I have, though, are that SoulCycle is expensive AF, there&apos;s no teaching on form or choreography for first-timers, and the types of people they attract tend to be part of the hipster, super in-shape demographic, which for me, can be intimidating. I honestly can&apos;t wait to continue taking SoulCycle when I fly back home to SF later this week. But if you&apos;re in the area, I&apos;d recommend Nick Turk or Keith Watson as your instructors."
3,"SoulCycle is fun-- it&apos;s like that workout where you go in and come out feeling happy and free. However, I&apos;m not sure it&apos;s the workout for me, especially with the price tag. 

4 stars because the workout is fun and instructors are great! However, the incorporation of pushups on the bike and clapping really took away from focusing on form and safety and more on staying on rhythm. I have a bad ankle and knee, so I was looking for something low-impact. Something about the standing on the bike or the way I&apos;m riding puts a lot of impact on that ankle and knee, so I left with my ankle and knee feeling not too right for the next few days. At first, I thought it was a fluke, but second time it happened again. 

The studio itself is beautiful and bright. It smells amazing, first of all, and the locker room is huge and lockers are big! However, the front desk have not always been the friendliest - both times I went. When I told them it was my first time, they just had me sign a waiver and gave me shoes-- no introduction of what to expect or a tour of the place. I had to sort of figure it out on my own- even where to go to put my stuff.  

Overall, I would say it&apos;s a very niche work out place.  Candles lit in the room as well as a sort of biker hierarchy system (front row leads the pack).  After my trial pack, I&apos;m not sure I would add it as a regular to my workouts."
5,"MY FAVORITE SOULCYCLE STUDIO. The front desk staff are super welcoming, helpful and sweet, and keep the studio clean. I always feel comfortable talking with them, asking for assistance and enjoy coming here for classes. The instructors are phenomenal and I have never experienced a bad workout here before. I could not recommend a better studio than this one in Rittenhouse! I&apos;m hooked!"
5,"After what felt like an eternity, I finally got back to Soul the last few weeks. I actually committed to a 20 class package and enjoying every session so far. I especially love Elysse&apos;s classes as well as Bryant&apos;s Soul Survivor (60 min instead of 45) class on Saturdays. Whether you like hip hop, EDM, rap, they&apos;ve got something for everyone. It&apos;s a bit pricey but I think it&apos;s worth it considering how good of a workout you get and how good it makes me feel after!"
5,"Soulcycle has become my escape from work life and personal life. I tried this out almost a year ago and it has been the best decision! I haven&apos;t been as consistent as I want cause of life, but I&apos;m currently now going two times a week and hope to go more! I ride with Ryan, Nikola, and Denita and I absolutely love each one of them! Every instructor brings their own swagger to their class and they are all great for that reason. The workout is hard, definitely when finding the right rhythms. But instructors always encourage riders to take it at their own pace. I recommend Soulcycle to everyone. The class is 30 bucks but I have found that to be a pretty average price for fitness classes in the city. This is definitely my favorite workout in the city and will continue to be my weekly escape!"
4,"SoulCycle is an experience that I recommend you try (they always have an introductory offer for new clients, so it&apos;s less of an investment than their normal class packs) I purchased an introductory pass then a triple pack of classes shortly after. The experience is strangely addictive (if you are a workout junkie like me) and a lot of fun. The general flow is upon arrival you check in and either rent shoes ($3 per rental) or bring your own. They do have bathrooms with showers for changing/showering before/after your workout. From there once they&apos;ve cleaned the room from the previous class, you find your bike and set it up. If you are new to spinning the staff is great with helping you do so. The ride is generally 45 minutes and you go through the normal spin class moves with some more dance-y moved thrown in (lots of tap backs to the beat). 

Pros
The instructors are super friendly and willing to help set up the bike 

The studio space is clean and inviting

The work out is great,  you will leave sweating (see below!) and it has been a good workout the 4 times I went.  

Cons
During the actual class, there really isn&apos;t anyone to  help correct your form, if you are in a more surrounded bike and you are doing something wrong, you will likely not be corrected.  (However most instructors will verbalize what you should be doing and where your weight should be distributed). But I have seen people with incorrect form that goes uncorrected for the entire class. 

A problem that most studios (especially spin studios) are guilty of is keeping the room warmer than it needs to be to make client feel as though they worked out harder than they may have because they sweat so much.  I have no evidence of this occurring in the room, no hidden thermometer anywhere, however that room was far warmer than a spin room needs to be and lighting candles in an enclosed space with 40 people spinning hardly helps. 

Price :  if you want a more touchy-feely experience, I suggest soul cycle. If you want to spin and get a great workout without the frills there are a few other spin studios in the city that offer that without the hefty price tag. 

With all that said, I would probably go back for a class or two. I have incorporated a different spin studio into my routine simply because it is a better fit for me."
5,"Forgive me Flywheel for I have sinned.  I tried the &quot;other&quot; spinning studio.  

I was in Philadelphia for work and one of my coworkers pointed out that SoulCycle was a block from our hotel.  Despite being a cult follower of Flywheel, I thought I&apos;d give it a try.  I arrived shortly before 6:00 am with preconceived notions of what it would be like, but I left at 6:45 am a true believer.  SoulCycle is AWESOME!

Checking in at the front counter was very simple and straightforward.  Shoe rental is free for your first class.  (I own my own cleats because I think communal shoes are disgusting, but I was a little surprised that they charge you to rent them here.)  The two story space itself is swanky.  It&apos;s so crisp, clean, yellow, and white.  Someone is a serious marketing genius for making such a sleek and aesthetically appealing workout environment.  No wonder people want to join this cult.  It&apos;s the nicest boutique fitness studio I&apos;ve ever been to.

The spinning studio itself was more or less exactly what I expected.  Dark and filled with tons of yellow bikes.  The instructor Ryan was super friendly came over and introduced himself to me to see if I had any questions as the only SoulCycle virgin in the class.  I told him that I was in town for work and this wasn&apos;t my first rodeo.  Once the class got started, he introduced me to the whole class as, &quot;Mary is in town for work from Charleston, SC and goes to the &apos;other place.&apos;&quot;  Clearly the SoulCycle vs. Flywheel rivalry is real.

SoulCycle is a lot more dance-y and fun and uplifting than the &quot;other place.&quot;  There&apos;s definitely a lot more rhythm and uplifting messages than I&apos;m used to.  The whole room was pumped up at 6:00 am.  It was a party on a bike for sure.  The 45 minutes flew by so quickly because I was legitimately having a blast while working out.  The tap backs and bumping song remixes make it seem more like a club than a workout.  I was sweating profusely and smiling ear to ear by the end of the class.  Ryan deserves a huge shout out for teaching such a fun class.  He&apos;s definitely one of the best instructors I&apos;ve ever encountered. 

As an extreme Type A personality, I came in with a lot of preconceived notions about SoulCycle.  By the end of my first class though, I was hooked.  If I lived in a big city with SoulCycle, I would absolutely be there on a regular basis.  Everything about this place is five stars."
3,"I want to preface this review with my baseline just so you can figure out if Soul cycle is for you. In general, I don&apos;t enjoy loud music, raves, clubs, etc. I run or do some cardio 5x/week and have just started strength straining but coordination isn&apos;t my strong suit. So I don&apos;t know if I am the phenotype Soul cycle is designed for. 

This was my first ever spinning class, and it was just average. Despite my best efforts, I got there with only 5 minutes to spare, and between signing in and getting the shoes, I was already a few minutes late to the class. Everyone in the studio was wonderful. One of the girls helped me get on the cycle, and adjust it for me (I couldn&apos;t even figure out how to lock my shoes, but she showed me what she could in the short time we had since class had already started). So if there&apos;s anything a first timer soul cycler takes from this, it&apos;s to show up at least 20 minutes early so somebody can show you how to adjust the bike, get locked in, how to adjust resistance, and how to do some of the common moves without losing your balance.

As for the class itself, it&apos;s very dark (instead of adding to my comfort, it just made it hard to see the instructor) with only a few candles. At some point, it was pretty close to pitch black. The instructor NIck was very energetic, and had a good playlist to get you going, but since I hadn&apos;t shown up early, I felt really uncomfortable doing some of the maneuvers like tap packs, push ups, etc since it felt very unstable as soon as I would go to do those moves. I honestly couldn&apos;t figure out how to coordinate my upper and lower body. Near the end of the class, we stopped cycling, and did an upper body segment which was great since spinning largely works lower body. And then we ended with a cool down. 

45 minutes flew by, and I sweated, but none of my muscles felt particularly worked out, and the class felt more like a warm up than a true exercise. This could  be because I might not have been able to put my all since I couldn&apos;t properly do all the moves, but even the simple cycling part (no upper and lower body coordination required) didn&apos;t really make me sweat that much. I unfortunately didn&apos;t bring my apple watch, but I would predict I barely burned 200 calories. 

Overall, it was a good one time experience, but I haven&apos;t drunk the kool aid on this, and likely won&apos;t be coming back."
