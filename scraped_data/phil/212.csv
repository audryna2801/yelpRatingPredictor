5,"This spot has become one of my go to spots for Korean food, the restaurant prides itself in serving quality traditional Korean dishes. The two wonderful women that served us has always welcomed us with hospitality. They remembered my friend and I after not seeing them for months! 

Out of the Korean restaurants in Philly, Jong Ka Jib gives you more of a cozy feel when you&apos;re inside. It&apos;s not modern by any means, the food and service shines through. If you ever order the short ribs, Galbi they do not skimp on the meat and rice. As long as I&apos;m in Philly this will be one of my staple places."
4,Pretty good Korean food. Altho I personally prefer DuBu (5mins away and near HMart). I got the tofu stew with medium spicy...didn&apos;t get too much flavor from the broth. My friend got the kalbi beef short ribs and that&apos;s was yummy. I love their banchan spread. My favorite is the fish cake and the cured cucumbers! The service was very nice too.
5,Nice food.   awesom flavour....good portion ...afotable price....thank u so much for awonderful time
5,One of the most authentic Korean atmospheres with the best soup for a cold day. I love going here so much and miss it so much.
2,"I was craving authentic Korean food but I got some place that was sub-par. Belly is full at least. Not much to talk about here I ordered 3 different main dishes. Bul-go gi , gal bi, je-wo bokeum. Most was bland. And the flavors definitely had korean but also like a Latin twist that did not compliment it. Sorry didn&apos;t take pix of main dishes. Here are the sides we got instead."
3,Read so many good reviews about this place and was excited to try but overall was slightly disappointed. Ordered beef soondubu and seafood soondubu which both tasted great except it was missing the vegetables such as zucchini and enoki mushroom that I typically get from korean restaurants in other states not sure if this is typical in Philly. High quality of tufu which I will give credit. Would like more of other ingredients.
5,"This place has always been our go-to for soft tofu and it&apos;s always been and still is delicious and consistent. The service is absolutely wonderful. They&apos;ve always welcomed my children as their own. I recently acquired new dietary needs from some recent issues and they were more than happy to suggest and accommodate my needs. We haven&apos;t been there in over a year and everything was exactly the same as if we had been there yesterday. I highly suggest any of their soft tofu (Soondubu) dishes, as well as the dumplings, and Korean fried chicken wings that my kids absolutely loved!! They are a perfect place for a family on a budget looking for friendly warm service and delicious food. I cant say enough and thank them for being the best!"
5,"This is the place to go if you insist on having your rice cooked like it was cooked 300 years ago in granite pots without electricity , just fire. This is the place to go if you insist on having your Korean food so delicious that it makes you want to order another serving of everything, so you can bring it home with you. It&apos;s fantastic food and it  leaves you wanting more."
1,"This is the worst Korean restaurant place I have ever been.  The restaurant has no customer satisfaction at all.  The waiter was telling me there&apos;s a doorbell to press if I want him.  So he doesn&apos;t go to your table to ask if you need anything except he will just come to the table if you press the doorbell.  So I guess, why even tip the waiter. 

The food has no taste at all!   I don&apos;t know if they&apos;re cheaping out in the spiciness or that&apos;s how they prepare it.  Place is dark and musty. I really wonder how they had a good review.   Oh I forgot they deliver your food through cart and the cart is so dirty as they rolling with your food and dust from the floor.  Ughhh sooo awful food awful atmosphere."
1,"One of the worst service restaurant i been, their tofu stew had way to much msg.  many Korean restaurant in phila. area doesn&apos;t know how to cook good korean food use a lot of msg and sugar to make their food. this place is one of them. I think people who give 4 to 5 stars really doesn&apos;t know taste of msg. i personally do not go again if they use to much msg. Why should i drive there and pay for food you can make very easily at home. just add a lots of mag."
5,"A local Korean restaurant, which has a pretty tricky parking lot (be careful of the hill!), but has a nice quiet environment inside. I came here for lunch and the prices were decent for the weekend. I got the beef soft tofu, while my boyfriend got the kalbi. Our friends also got some other tofus. You are able to say how much spice level you want for the tofu (the spiciest one is not too spicy according to my Korean friend!), and each entree also comes with a huge bowl of rice even though it does not say it on the menu. 

They had a good variety of banchan, as I loved the pickled cucumbers, radish and kimchi. They definitely give a lot of tofu and ingredients inside it, as I had a lot of tofu leftover and less soup. It tastes amazing, perfect for a cold day! There was also a good amount of kalbi, and they come uncut, but provide scissors for you to cut them however you want. The flavor and tenderness of the meat was perfect. 

A great place to try if you are in Philly, but the location is outside of the city skirts so it is only accessible if you have a car!"
5,"This place has a parking lot fyi!

The restaurant may look kind of shady and can be easliy overlooked.. However, the inside is very nice. All the tables are booths with benches which makes it look vert traditional. They use flat steel chopsticks which can be hard to use but they do have regular wooden disposable chopsticks.

There&apos;s a button on the table and they only come to you if you press it.. The waitress didn&apos;t know much English but she knew enough to understand me and she was super friendly.

You&apos;re served free mini apps while you wait for your food.. The apps can range but usually its Kimchi and pickled veggies.

They&apos;re known for their tofu stews which are great for the chilly weather or a cold.. I ordered the stew with beef and seafood. It comes boiling hot in a bowl and It comes with a raw egg that you crack to put in the stew. You can also pick what spice level you want. I also ordered the ribs which were good."
5,"Wow! This place is amazing. All who love Korean food need to come here. Everything I tried was very good. I came with my group of friends and all loved it. 
It feels like you are truly in Korea, thanks to the atmosphere and the design. 
LOVED IT!"
4,This spot is one of my fav Korean restaurant. I do be craving for seafood tofu soup sometimes. The only suggestion is that if only they would add more seafood(whatever it comes with) instead of just mainly plain tofu!
5,"The best soondubu in Philly! Literally no other place compares. The tofu is soft, the broth is flavorful and the rice is perfect. The sides are also delicious - especially the kimchi cucumbers - I always ask for refills. Although prices have increased throughout the years (from $9 to $12), it&apos;s still a very affordable meal. A lot of my friends have trouble finishing one by themselves. The other dishes are also very tasty like the grilled pork, bibimbap and kalbi. Perfect place for a cold rainy day. Usually never too crowded either."
4,"The prices you see on the yelp menu are not up to date.

Very tasty tofu.  Their tofu are in large generous chunks and  served in a tasty broth. I got mild as in little spicy, and it wasn&apos;t spicy at all so I think it&apos;s safe to go on the spicier side.  We got the beef soft tofu and the mushroom soft tofu.  It tastes the same, just different topping.  For mushroom, I think they use black mushrooms which I am not a fan.  Nonetheless, I love the flavor and tofu. This may be my new comfort food.  It&apos;s like chicken noodle soup. I could curl up in a blanket on the couch all day and have this.  Not sure if it says on the menu, but it comes with rice :-)

I didn&apos;t give it 5 because the BBQ squid was an utter disappointment.  It came in large pieces and was not sliced. It&apos;s also just topped with kimchi like something. I don&apos;t recommend the BBQ squid."
5,"Best soondubu in the area. Always piping hot and delicious. You can customize your spice. I can&apos;t handle spice too well so I usually get the little spicy which adds just enough flavor. Boyfriend loves the spicy so he gets the very spicy which in my opinion, burns a hole in your throat but hey, personal preference right? 

Soup is always boiling when it comes out and the perfect temperature to crack your egg right in. Couple seconds or minutes later (depending on how you like your egg cooked) it&apos;ll be ready! Rice comes cooked in a stone pot. When you&apos;re done you can ask the waiter to pour hot tea into for a Korean classic.

For $12 a bowl you can&apos;t go wrong."
4,"This is hands down my favorite  restaurant in philly. I grew up coming to this restaurant with my family, came about 1-2 times a month. The same waitress is also there, and it&apos;s so great to see her sweet kind soul. 

I just have one complaint. The  (the side dishes) have gotten worse over the years.  is probably the most important &quot;part&quot; or food in the Korean culture. I just wished that they would have better quality side dishes. Also I don&apos;t recommend ordering anything but the soft tofu soup and the galbi. My grandparents ordered a Korean seafood noodle dish which was about $13 and there was nothing in there. Literally nothing. Just noodles and 3 pieces of shrimp and other seafood. But other than that I love coming here for the only the . C"
3,"3.5 yelps. So it seems like our experience was not the norm and that&apos;s unfortunate for us. Seeing all of the other rave reviews makes me want to head back and see if the Sunday when we dined was just a rare fluke. I feel like we were jipped out of this amazing experience everyone else had. We were so excited to treat my parents to this meal. We were a tad embarrassed about how it turned out....

Right off the bat, ordering was fairly difficult. They did not speak one word of English. Many mistakes were made and any special requests we had were unable to be fulfilled because of the language barrier. We spoke with two individuals, neither understood us. At all. I think that unfortunately set the tone for the meal. 

We had a larger party and below is what everyone had to say. I personally can only comment on the mushroom tofu soup which I actually really loved and am totally craving right now after looking over my photos. The scallion pancakes were a tad soggy and lacking in flavor for me and the dumplings were just ok. I&apos;ve had better. A tad too slippery and slimy for my taste. The plain rice was so delicious for some reason. Piping hot. Yum. 

3 yelps Beef soup. Not enough beef. Banchan Sides were good. Ribs were good. Chicken was just alright. 

3 yelps seafood tofu soup just two shrimp (one with eyeballs) Barely any seafood. &quot;Floating yuck&quot;. Beef was really good. Chicken was just ok. &quot;$12 for a bowl of tofu?&quot;  Dumplings were good. A little mushy. 

2 yelps they don&apos;t have anything for kids. 

4 yelps Excellent rice plains and simple. 

3 yelps mushroom tofu soup was very good. Beef was the best out of everything. Chicken was average. 

3.5 yelps Chicken was not BBQ as stated. 
Scallion pancakes weren&apos;t crisp, were too greasy and a tad bland. 

Tons of food so think twice when ordering. Don&apos;t forget about all of the side that come first. The place was pretty cute. A nice find for the area. I think everyone could appreciate the authenticity of the meal for example the raw egg to place in our soon du bu, but Something just wasn&apos;t happening the way we had hoped and the way it seemed to for others."
4,"My wife absolutely is addicted to this place. It&apos;s definitely the best soon du bu in Philly. Other dishes can be either extremely amazing or so-so. I&apos;ve tried everything here from their BBQ, to appetizers, and of course, the soft tofu soup.

My go to order is normally the spicy pork stir fry. The pork has a nice kick and not too much fat on it. I do wish they used less onions and peppers, but that&apos;s because I&apos;m not a big fan of those veggies. 

Scallion pancake is decent. I&apos;m not a big fan of scallions, but my wife seems to love this dish and orders it at most Korean places to try and find the best.

Soon du bu - I always only eat this from my wife (she shares). The broth is extremely flavorful and if you ask for spicy, prepare for spicy! My favorite would definitely be the beef one.

Bonchon dishes - ehhhh - very limited. I normally only eat maybe the kimchee and maybe one other. 

Fish cakes - greasy, but good. My son loves it!

Overall - I know I will be back. It&apos;s our go to spot when we want good Korean (non bbq - we have a different go to spot for BBQ)"
