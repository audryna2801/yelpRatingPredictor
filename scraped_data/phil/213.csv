5,"During this pandemic I have become quite fond of TikTok sooooo while walking through Reading Terminal with my girlfriend we literally had a Tik Tok moment when I stopped at Beck&apos;s Cajun Cafe. 
Me: looking at the alligator gumbo
My girlfriend : girl don&apos;t do it. It&apos;s just not worth it . Don&apos;t do it girl
Me: I&apos;m not going to do it girl , I was just thinking about it, I&apos;m not going to do it. 
Store Employee: Hi , May I help you 
Me: I would like an order of the gator gumbo over white rice ... then looking at my girlfriend and saying I DID IT 

... and it was delicious"
5,The fried oyster po&apos; boy and shrimp &apos;n crawfish etouffee brought me right back to New Orleans. This is the real deal cajun spot. Awesome y&apos;all!
4,"Any time I am in Philly, I know I have to bring home food lol Not that I don&apos;t cook at home, but you know 
I ordered Jambalaya, Fried Oysters platter, Cajun fries  and Fried Mac and cheese  balls. Everything was great per usual. The only thing that irked my nerve was...one female (I am not shouting her out because maybe it was an off day for her) she had just come to work (03/06/2021 around 1 something in the afternoon) and she... DID. NOT. PUT. HER. HAIR. BACK 
It was hanging over the food, and I just hoped and prayed she washed it earlier or something at least  Something to soothe my urge to tell her something. She handed me my food and I was like &quot;Gurl... you don&apos;t even know&quot; Still coming back, but I will speak up next time,"
3,"I&apos;ve always liked Beck&apos;s a lot. I hadn&apos;t been here for several years. But today I decided to give them a shot. 

Now, at the risk of coming off as a complete snob here, I was a little let down today. Since the last time I had Beck&apos;s I&apos;ve been to New Orleans. I&apos;ve tasted the real deal. They&apos;re playing on a different culinary level down there. 

I now know why Beck&apos;s is considered really good for Philadelphia. But in New Orleans I sense they wouldn&apos;t quite cut it. And maybe that&apos;s not a fair comparison. But I believe it&apos;s true now. 

I went with a catfish finger platter with red beans and rice. My biggest complaint was the catfish. They came off a little chewy and overdone. The seasoning was way more salty than anything. Not bad, but far from great. 

I will say that the beans and rice were tremendous. That flavor was on point with more spice than salt. And I still like the cornbread. 

It&apos;s quite possible I just didn&apos;t get their best dish. I still have love for them. But I&apos;m calling this one as I see it, or in this case taste it."
4,"So this Southern Cajun boy needed some good ol&apos; cajun fare and a Po&apos;boy just sounded like what I needed at the time. Its been a hot second since I&apos;ve had one and walking by this little store front gave me pretty good vibes.

I ordered the fried shrimp po&apos;boy and I was thoroughly impressed. The pricing was good, about $10 for a large sandwich. I literally split it into two meals, maybe I wasn&apos;t super hungry as I&apos;d eaten my way through Philly but its definitely a hearty meal if you eat the full sandwich. The shrimp was fried well, good crunch, good shrimp flavor, a bit overfried so a little dry. However, the sauce made up for it and really brought the po&apos;boy together. The bread held up very well too, this wasn&apos;t one of those sandwiches that just fall apart the second you take a bite!

I&apos;ll definitely have to come back some day and try their other fare. They have your menu of NOLA classics like jambalaya, gumbo, etoufee so there&apos;s plenty of options for anyone trying to fill a cajun itch."
4,"While perusing Reading Terminal Market on a surprisingly quiet Sunday afternoon, I was lured by Beck&apos;s Cajun Cafe with their massive menu and delicious-looking tomato Creole sauce (spoiler alert: it was as good as it looked).

I wanted literally all of the options, but my greedy stomach settled for a blackened catfish platter with grilled cornbread and red beans and rice. Plus, I just had to get some tomato Creole sauce on the side. The catfish was perfectly cooked and very flavorful, and the dish as a whole was delightful.

A very comforting and affordable meal for $12, and I look forward to returning for more."
5,"I&apos;ve had a Po&apos;boy here, but let&apos;s not talk about a meal I&apos;ve eaten here...  Let&apos;s discuss me ordering King Cake&apos;s every year.  I have a King Cake shipped from the New Orleans area every year.  Okay, almost every year...  My wife is going to read this and tell me I didn&apos;t order one when I was two years old... Back to the King Cakes... I wasn&apos;t fully feeling them in recent years, so I&apos;ve tried some other places and even made my own last year.  This year, I was talking to co-workers and thought about local places.  I knew a place in Reading Terminal Market, didn&apos;t recall the name, but after some quick yelp searches, remembered it was Beck&apos;s...  I reached out to them and inquired about the King Cake on Instagram.  After a small conversation, I placed an order.  On the day to pickup, there were a lot of King Cakes there.  I was given mine and I got a quick peek before paying.  

&quot;Wow&quot; was seriously my first thought.  I think every company from New Orleans ships with FedEx, along with special FedEx boxes.  They&apos;re almost all the same...  None, that I&apos;ve found, were this large.  Those are smaller, I&apos;m sure for shipping reasons, and sometimes filled with custard, but this was so much larger.  

I personally loved the flavors so much more.  The sugar topping, which is usually too much for me, was more balanced on the Beck&apos;s King Cake.  I enjoyed the more brioche like center.   The only complaint I received, was that someone said theirs didn&apos;t have a filling in it...  I think they wanted custard...  Which another co-worker won&apos;t eat, because he doesn&apos;t eat cream cheese...  Even though I don&apos;t think there is cream cheese in the Bavarian custard we sometimes get?  I don&apos;t like people...  Why do I get these things for everyone?  

Forgetting the &quot;extras&quot; that goes inside, this was a fantastic King Cake and probably the best value I&apos;ve gotten.  These cakes were decorated nicely too.  You can do that when you aren&apos;t depending on FedEx to ship...  I can baby, get it, this cake filled with a baby, all the way back to the office in my car.  I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if this is the place I go for now on...  It&apos;s more work on my behalf, but I think it&apos;s worth it.  I&apos;ll just get a tub of custard and fruit fillings and let people dip in the future...  Just to shut them up..."
5,"@NommingNomad Approved!

Beck&apos;s Cajun cafe, which is at the heart of my beloved Reading Terminal Market is one of the places that I take everyone who visits me in Philly to. All their food is so delicious and flavorful, I&apos;ve never once had a bad experience here. With all their delicious food one is instantly  transported to the streets of NoLa and I personally love that feeling!  I&apos;ve had their jambalaya which is bomb as well as their corn bread  and Mac and cheese. They also have king cake as a whole or in slices during specific times of the year!

They recently  started serving breakfast and boy oh boy is their brioche French toast bake good. When I think of Beck&apos;s I don&apos;t think brunch but man did this french toast change that. It is topped with pecan pralines and fresh berries and whipped cream and is also served with cajun fries with an amazing creole mayo dipping sauce and a choice of meat on the side. They do not skimp on the toppings or the sides and I guarantee that you will go home a happy camper. 

They also have specials during weekends like this peanut butter and fluff French toast that I enjoyed. It is perfectly executed French toast with generous helping of peanut butter and fluff in the middle and topped with a chocolate anglaise and a homemade  peanut butter cookie crumble. Doesn&apos;t that just want to make you run over there right now and demand it. 

Anyway, when you&apos;re at the Reading Terminal Market. You just have to stop by Becks and try their New Orleans food and go home feeling happy in your heart and your tum! You can thank me later!"
5,"WHOO-HOO, finally found a proper cajun New Orleans restaurant that delivers that awesome cajun flavor.  No surprise finding it in a major city but in the smack middle of crazy busy Reading Terminal in Philly; too funny and way too crowded.  But for food and flavor like this, it is so worth it.

It took us a while to finally locate Becks among the crazies of Reading Terminal, but when we did the good times started.  From a sample tasting to actually getting two counter stools during Christmas week. 

After a quick Q&amp;A about menus items and spice levels, we landed on what was to be an awesome late lunch consisting of Shrimp and crawfish etouffee- which was delightful and packed a nice flavor over white rice plus my wife ordered the Chicken &amp; Andouille Gumbo with Dirty Rice which packed a fantastic flavor that hung on.  Nice kick.  The two dishes together complemented one another as we enjoyed sharing each overs dish along with an order of cornbread-- perfect for the soul.  Washed down with sweet tea.  There is a time and place and this was it.

Glad we didn&apos;t have to die to go to food cajun heaven.  

We will be back with an appetite."
5,This place is heavily! Never had one bad thing to eat here and the staff is excellent. Seating is limited and &quot;first come first serve&quot; but worth the wait. You can also order to go.
4,"Philly&apos;s best gator spot hands down. My gator po boy and baguette brought me back to NOLA. 

Don&apos;t forget to check in on Yelp for 5% off.

They have breakfast options, but breakfast stops at 11am, which is unfortunate.

Becks is popular and the food is made to order so expect a wait. It&apos;s worth it though."
5,"The bread on the po&apos; boys is back to the quality it used to be and Beck&apos;s Cajun has been back in my regular lunch rotation for a while now. I used to do pick-up all the time but now I plop my behind on a stool and eat there most of the time. The staff is always so friendly that it makes the experience of eating those delicious po&apos; boys that much better! The fried shrimp is my usual go to, but I&apos;ve had the trainwreck and that is amazing as well. They may not be 100% New Orleans authentic po&apos; boys, but it&apos;s still the best version I&apos;ve found in Philly."
4,"This Cajun spot is unique and adds to the diverse amount of options available in The Reading Terminal Market. They allow you to try a few items that are displayed such as the gumbo, jambalaya, and etouffee. I liked the etouffee which had a slight kick of heat to it.

I ended up getting the jambalaya with had shrimp, andouille sausage, chicken, and some vegetables. The chicken was a bit dry and not as tasty as the sausage and shrimp. The rice was cooked in a tomato-based sauce and actually not bad for cajun food. I also got their alligator sausage on a stick. It was very unique and the wrapping gave it a nice chew. Their cornbreads were decent.

It&apos;s nice that The Reading Terminal Market has different types of cuisines. This spot in particular brought me nostalgic NOLA vibes. I would definitely want to try their po boys in the future."
5,"Amazing brunch place at Reading Terminal Market. We tried the alligator sausage, fried catfish and fried shrimp po&apos;boys. The alligator sausage was mildly spicy, juicy and almost pork-ish. It came with fried eggs, cheese, onions and peppers. A very unique way to try alligator!

The fried catfish and shrimp po&apos;boys were excellent too. The sandwiches are filled generously with lettuce, tomato and pickles. The creole mayo pulled everything together - we ordered an extra side of mayo as dip for the bacon mac n cheese balls.

With all the fried food, we couldn&apos;t finish the bread, which was of terrific quality. Crusty on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside.

Highly recommend this restaurant with the counter seating!!"
2,Not good place to eat New Orleans food. Ordered the fried oyster po boy. For $13.49 for four oysters is horrible it was more lettuce and bread than oysters. Sad experience I will never go back to. To the owner I paid with a card very poor quality of food.
4,"Beck&apos;s Cajun Cafe is one of the many wonderful and delicious options available at Reading Terminal Market. The food is filling and portions are generous, which is always appreciated after an exhausting walk around the city. The shrimp po&apos; boy is flavorful, with a bit of a kick. The line and service at Beck&apos;s really varies based on when you come. On a very busy day, you may have to wait quite a while before receiving your order, but on less crowded days the wait is much much shorter. Limited seating is available in the area."
5,"Went to Reading Terminal for lunch and found this gem of a place in the middle of the market.  They serve an assortment of cajun food, po boys, jambalaya, and an assortment of fried seafoods.  I decided to order a fried shrimp platter for about $12 that came with red beans and rice and a piece of their cornbread.  The lunch rush was moderately busy for a weekday but the meal did not dissapoint.  Looking forward to visiting again."
5,"Chalk this up as yet another deeply satisfying gem in The Reading Terminal Market. I give the above rating even without having tried their signatures like the near-legendary Trainwreck Po Boi, and the idea that I have so much more to explore is exciting. 

What have I had? My first time there, I just got a basic order of jambalaya with tomato Creole sauce to test the waters, and it was delicious. The portions of shrimp, andouille, and chicken were all balanced and generous, and each was the exact texture I&apos;d have hoped for it to be, while the peppers, onions, and celery all left distinct imprints on the overall flavor, which was not lacking. 

More recently, I returned and ordered a blackened catfish platter and that was even better. I got mine with red beans and rice, and it default came with two slices of cornbread. Everything about it nailed the landing, as it were. The catfish was tender and bursting with flavor. It started off feeling pretty spicy (not to excess, but noticeable) and then my palette adjusted to it and it became a tad less noticeable, while no less flavorful. The beans and rice were hearty and savory, with tasty bits of pork mixed in, while the cornbread as fantastic - on the sweet side, but also perfect for sopping up additional blackened juices from the main event. 

I&apos;ve been a bit less impressed by the service, but keep in mind I&apos;ve only ever gotten taken (unfortunately). The first time I went I felt like it ruined the employee who served me&apos;s day by simply being there - a very aloof vibe was given off. But things are trending in the right direction for me now - the second time the service left me feeling neutral, with even nods to friendliness. 

All told, I&apos;m mostly just eager to keep exploring that menu."
5,"My boyfriend and I managed to come here twice over the course of a tight weekend because we loved it so much! Got the shrimp and crawfish etouffee, various poboys, and some eggs. The red beans and rice are really just sausage + rice and some beans - they&apos;re delicious! Cornbread comes out hot and buttery (a wee sweet) so eat those before they get cold!

The portions are enormous and the staff are super friendly. I seriously don&apos;t know how they make money on those poboys, but maybe I&apos;m just thinking of West coast prices. I could only finish half at a time! The best part of coming here for early breakfast was the conversation. With food so good, and the environment so casual, we met folks from all walks of life. And if you&apos;re not into chatting with folks, it makes for perfect people watching. 

Great vibe, food, people - what&apos;s not to like?"
5,"I went here twice because it was that good!

I had the shrimp &amp; crawfish étouffée, jambalaya, fried oysters, fried catfish, and Cajun fries.

They were all good but I would say that the catfish and étouffée was super tasty!

I recommend coming here and I&apos;d love to come back again."
