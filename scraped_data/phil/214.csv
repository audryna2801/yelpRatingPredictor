5,"Rybread is a wonderful staple in the Fairmount neighborhood! I ordered online for curbside pickup and my order was ready in just a few minutes. The menu had a lot of variety and there were so many ways to customize a sandwich - cheeses, meats, spreads... even how much you wanted your bagel toasted! It took all my restraint not to order the cupcakes, ice cream and cookies!

For my weekend breakfast, I went with an everything bagel with veggie cream cheese, tomato and spinach, along with an iced coffee. The bagel was delicious, it had the perfect amount of cream cheese and was toasted exactly how much I asked for! The coffee was a great brew. I definitely want to try the cold brew next time!

I have a feeling I will become a regular here and try the rest of the menu!"
5,"Love love this place! Good quality ALL around. I&apos;m not based in philly so with me having dietary restrictions in different cities, it&apos;s always a toss up. Rybread landed for sure. I had a gluten free breakfast sandwich with lox and vegan cream cheese.  then 2 custom salads one of which had the crab cake that was fantastic. They also have vegan ice cream! The coconut macaroon was amazing. An entire full course worth of food that I can eat outside of a vegan/gluten-free establishment is pretty much unheard of. So I&apos;m thankful beyond that RyBread saw fit to accommodate us food-allergy kids. It was a win overall especially during the pandemic. Give em a try."
5,"This is my weekend staple. Absolutely love the New York Panini...I always say I want to branch out, but that panini is so good that I order it almost every time. 

Also strongly recommend their milkshakes/smoothies!!"
4,"This was a cozy little spot in Fairmount! Great place to bring work or a book and relax.

Their menu is full of different sandwiches, soups, and salads. I have tried most options from here, and all of them are delicious.

Ideal breakfast spot for dine-in or takeout."
3,"I&apos;m always on the lookout for good breakfast spots so I decided stop in for coffee, scones and breakfast sandwhiches.  The staff was really friendly and I could tell they were providing service with a smile despite the masks.

I got the blueberry scone, chocolate chip scone, bacon and cheese on a croissant and sausage egg and cheese on brioche.  The breakfast sandwhiches were good (its hard to mess that up) but the scones were a bit dry.  The coffee also seemed a tad on the weak side and tasted like tea had been previously brewed in it at some point.

I hope to come back soon to try the quiche because the types available sounded interesting, but in terms of what I had today it was just ok."
5,"Okay this place is awesome, especially when you are tired of overpriced underwhelming bagels and sandwiches in the city.  I&apos;ve tried their customized bagel sammies and paninis and both are great.  I have yet to try a dessert but I&apos;ve got my eye on the enormous cupcakes behind the glass display. Will be back again and again!"
4,"While in town for an event, this became the go-to breakfast stop on the walk to the Philadelphia Convention Center. (We stopped here twice because we really enjoyed our breakfast choices during our first visit!)

The wait was long on Saturday - it is obviously a local favorite. Because the menu options were hearty and healthy we stuck around, and it was worth the wait. (I hope during the week they can handle the crowd a bit better.) Rybread is simple and small, but makes up for that with its fantastic menu.

On day one I had the Meat Quiche and a Breakfast Smoothie. On day two I got the Veggie Quiche. Honestly, I could eat those quiches every day. If you&apos;re a local or simply visiting and looking for a healthy meal or snack, I would totally recommend stopping at Rybread!"
5,"My bf and I already made a trip back to Rybread for another delicious breakfast sandwich. This time he ordered the sausage, egg, cheese on everything bagel and I ordered the sausage, egg, cheese on 7-grain bagel. Both very delicious! Everything bagel is where it&apos;s at!"
3,I needed a quick breakfast sandwich and this place is one of the earlier morning breakfast places that opens at 7 am in the area. The bagel was pretty good BUT they over did it on the cream cheese and there wasn&apos;t a lot of salmon on the bagel
3,There weren&apos;t too many good choices in the immediate area so Rybread was good enough.  The food or sandwiches were pretty good.
4,"Nice spot in Fairmount Ave. I had Cuban panini and plain bagel with veg cheese spread. Both were nice. Probably be my go to bagel spot in town. 
Staff were friendly and the menu was extensive with plenty of sandwiches and panini choice. The price is right and the panini was filling."
5,"Truth be told, I came here because my friends were late for our original dinner plans and this area of the city doesn&apos;t have a ton of cafes, restaurants, or shops. It was really the only coffee spot in the area but I was pleasantly surprised at how cute it was!! The staff was very kind when I just ordered a measly cup of tea (lol). There are five small tables and one big communal one, so not a ton of seating but the outlets are placed perfectly if you come to do work. They had delicious looking pastries (those cupcakes!!!) but I couldn&apos;t spoil my actual dinner. If I ever stumbled back over to this neighborhood of Philadelphia, I would definitely want to try their coffee and food."
5,"My friend and I had some time to kill so we decided to come for a little bite! I ended up really liking it. It&apos;s a cute little place with a good variety. Also their baked goods.... yummy! My friend got an English breakfast tea with a carrot cake cupcake, I got their green machine (really recommend) with their cinnamon apple scone(also super tasty + fluffy!) I would definitely go again &amp; try something savory! 

Definitely Recommend!"
5,"Went to Rybread for the first time yesterday afternoon. I had heard about this resturant from one of my entrepreneurship classes I was in, the owner of this establishment had came in to talk about her story as an entrepreneur and all the struggles she went through in the business. I thought the resturant sounded awesome and her story was amazing so I thought I would try it out! 

My friend and I stopped in around noon yesterday. We both got iced coffees and we decided to split the buffalo chicken panini on chibbata bread. The panini had Gorgonzola cheese, mozzarella cheese, shredded buffalo chicken and shredded carrots. I thought it was awesome! Was the perfect amount of food for a light lunch for my friend and I. We weren&apos;t too too hungry but we did want something little to hold us over. I loved everything about the panini besides the fact that there was Gorgonzola cheese on it; but that was my bad because I had forgotten to ask them to not put any on there. I also got a brownie which was very delicious as well! 

Besides that, everything at Ryebread was great! The coffee was fresh, the atmosphere was cool and friendly, as were the employees and the resturant was impeccably clean! I really enjoyed my experience here and my friend Lex did as well! I will definitely be returning in the near future very soon!"
4,"Cute little spot in brewerytown! There&apos;s more seating inside than you think, this place can easily fit a large group. Plenty of delicious sandwich options and a huge variety of beer to pair it with.
I had the Banh Mi which was a good bite. A little sweet for my taste but still pretty good. Check it out!"
5,"I&apos;m not sure if I was really hungover or this food was just really good but I thoroughly enjoyed my sandwich and coffee from Rybread! I got the Santa Monica which is a BLT with egg avocado and mayo. The bread was warm and soft and the flavors of the sandwich along with the runny egg were the perfect combo. My boyfriend got the Cuban which he also enjoyed. 
If you are dining in you order at the counter and they bring the food to your table. Food took a little bit long to come out but it was obviously because everything is made fresh. I would have waited even longer for how good this sandwich was lol!! There&apos;s a decent sized seating area here including a few tables, community table, and outdoor seating.  They also have free WiFi avail if you are coming to do work! Noticed that they had a dog bowl of water outside for the pups which is a nice touch. 
We were just visiting the area for the weekend but will deff come back to Rybread when we&apos;re around again!"
5,I ordered a &quot;build your own breakfast sandwich&quot; the other day and it was delicious! I got caramelized onions and brie on my egg sandwich. Something I&apos;ve never had before but it definitely hit the spot.
5,"We used Rybread for a big catering order and they were great. Super responsive. Perfect sandwiches for omnivore, vegetarian, vegan and gluten-free eaters. Everyone was happy! Surprisingly tricky to find a sandwich shop that accommodates that variety."
5,"Hands down my favorite place for a quick breakfast.  The smoothies are delicious and so are the breakfast sandwiches.  Haven&apos;t ventured too much away from the typical order of a Strawberry/Banana Smoothie &amp; a Pork Roll, Egg, &amp; Cheese on Rye sandwich, because its too good.

I know that they offer a bunch of pastries &amp; other sandwiches which I am sure I will try out eventually!"
5,Best bagel breakfast sandwich by far in Philadelphia
