5,"Good vibes, cool setting. Great place to grab a drink outside during COVID."
3,"SPTaproom is the epitome of just your classic corner city bar. We really liked it here. It was so inviting...the kind of place that feels like home.

Everything about it was good, but just didn&apos;t have anything that was over the top. Would go back, but never see it as a destination since I live on the other side of the city.

Really impressive house cocktails &amp; beer menu. Comfort food is what they are known for (cheeseburgers, fried chicken, french fries, etc.) They do have one of the better grilled cheeses in the city - so good place to eat for vegetarians."
4,"Been here twice so far and had a great experience both times! The first time, my boyfriend and I both got the burger with bacon - hands down once of the best burgers I&apos;ve had in Philly. The second time I got the Pear &amp; Gorgonzola salad and Shishito Peppers. The salad was good but a little dressing heavy, I would ask for it on the side next time. Peppers were also decent - I&apos;m not a huge pepper fan but my boyfriend is and he loved them. 

They have great beer, wine &amp; cocktail list. I&apos;m not a huge beer person but have tried a few of their sours and really liked them. The staff was knowledgeable and helpful offering suggestions off the menu."
3,"We were looking for a bar close to the Wells Fargo Center that served tasty food and beer (that wasn&apos;t Chickie&apos;s and Pete&apos;s) and stumbled upon South Philly Tap Room. 

For starters - this place BLEEDS Philly. That sentence may not make sense to out-of-towners but I hope it does to locals and for anyone who visits after reading this. 

Good beer selection, interesting food menu and good tunes on the jukebox aka my kinda place. Our server was friendly, checking up on us when she could. They have happy hour Mon.-Fri. 4-6 which includes half off local drafts which is an added bonus. 

I ordered the grass-fed burger with smoked cheddar, lto and secret sauce. I was a bit surprised to find you can only order it 2 ways - rare or well done. I&apos;m a medium rare guy so I went with rare. It came out medium rare so I don&apos;t have anything to complain about but this could turn some folks off. 

The burger was...good but for $15 I was expecting to be really wow&apos;d. The fries were also a bit underwhelming. Perhaps I ordered the wrong thing...

My brother ordered the wild boar tacos (which seem to be quite popular here) and said they were great. 

I enjoyed my time here but wouldn&apos;t rush to get back. At least it&apos;s nice knowing that there is a neighborhood bar close to the stadiums next time I&apos;m looking to hunker down away from the bright lights and Miller Lite girls trying to pass off water as beer."
4,"What&apos;s not to like? Great brews on tap, a wide variety of food, weekend brunch, al fresco seating, vegan and GF options and a cool laid back, welcoming neighborhood vibe. 

We split a few plates included vegan wings, which essentially come a bit deconstructed in the sense that the tangy hot sauce is in ranch form and placed on the side for dipping rather than smothered in them. The wings are big chunks of breaded seitan. Bigger than ones you would expect. I&apos;m admittedly somewhat of a vegan wings, and these honestly weren&apos;t my favorite, but the sauce was very delicious! My daughter however loved them so I&apos;ll be sure to give them another try with her. 

We also split fish and chips which were outrageous and rivaled those we&apos;ve had in Iceland, where they&apos;re notoriously excellent. These were HUGE chunks with perfectly fried exterior served appropriately with tarter. The &quot;chips&quot; were actually purple fingerlings with vinegar. Different and tasty, and while I enjoyed the mix up, I think hubs missed actual traditional fries. 

Mac and cheese was fair. It&apos;s homemade with creamy shells. They come topped with fried onions and scallions which we loved and there&apos;s an option to add toppings. We added summer veggies, which were delish!

Orecchiette pasta with eggplant ragu was wonderful! Meaty and savory with chunks of zucchini too. Yum!! A winner

We also split a refreshing pomegranate and pear sour on draft although the cocktails, some named after South Philly spots were intriguing. The beer list was solid and we found ourselves wanting to come back just to keep up with what&apos;s rotating. 

The desserts sounded tempting as did the vegan BLT Sammy and their brunch menu, so a return visit is definitely in the cards. 

I love and appreciate their variety of offerings and the seasonal additions. It&apos;s a chill seat yourself type place so don&apos;t feel strange if you walk in and don&apos;t get addressed immediately. It&apos;s the kind of place that make me love South Philly, especially West Passyunk....it just has that cool vibe. 

Parking isn&apos;t the easier, so bring your patience and your parallel parking skills."
5,"Came here for happy hourrr and what a pleasure it was to enjoy half off beers and there small but delicious selection of happy hour foods... ugh so sooo good highly recommend the wild boar tacos, be careful if you don&apos;t like spicy foods... it&apos;s got a bit of a kick which I loved, and the meat was cooked kind of crispy but just so delicious and for 2$ a taco...  wish I ordered another 3 lol... happy hours from 5-7. Amazing service and great time with some friends, def a family friendly atmosphere as well. Will be back soon without a doubt."
4,"Went here a few weekends ago with my girlfriend and another couple.  This is the 44th Diners Drive Ins and Dives I&apos;ve been to.  We arrived there at 2:45, had to wait until 3 for the kitchen to open (gotta get the prep in, so I get that).  Parking wasn&apos;t horrible, but it is street parking so it could be bad I&apos;m sure.  The drink/beer list was great.  Everyone enjoyed the food, especially the deep fried PB &amp; J.  I would go here again for sure."
5,"Enjoyed our time here. There were a lot of interesting, unique beers to choose from, but I went with a more basic option ($4 Kenzinger draft) while here. We had a spot along the window, which did get a little toasty in the winter (right against the heater) - but it was a nice spot to people watch folks walking around outside. We had a server, who was friendly and attentive. I impulsively ordered the cheese ball, and was super happy with my choice. What&apos;s not to love with cream cheese and jalapeños rolled in a nice crunchy topping and served with ritz crackers? Would happily return for drinks and a meal or appetizers."
5,"My friend and I came here for happy hour on a Tuesday and were seated right away. The space is super cozy with a lot of string lights and candles. My friend and I each got a draft beer off the happy hour menu which was a great deal (our beers were $3 and $3.50). I also ordered the Fried Brussels Sprouts with a vegan caesar dressing. They were some of the best brussels sprouts I&apos;ve ever had - a crunchy exterior, tender interior, and the caesar dressing gave them amazing umami. I didn&apos;t even realize they were also part of the happy hour deals, so I was pleasantly surprised when we got the bill and they were half off! 

I definitely plan to come back to enjoy more food and drinks with a great ambience."
3,"I have visited SPTR many times - definitely around Beer Week.  I enjoy the rotating brews offered and the atmosphere of the place is always friendly and cool vibes.  

The beers offered are reasonably priced and the the brews that are draft are usually great selections.  They also have a larger assortment of bottled beers.  I always get the homemade pickles when I visit.  

Now the food options could be better.  This trip I had the wings, empanadas, and Mac &amp; Cheese.  The wings were &quot;ok&quot;, but not great. the empanadas (Lamb) were delicious and I the Mac &amp; Cheese - could use an upgrade!  I do enjoy the more exotic menu items, but I always like to try different foods when I visit.

Parking can be challenging, so if you come to the area be prepared and be patient till you find a good spot."
3,"Mehhh... This place was just okay, I was not impressed. The staff was friendly but not very attentive and the food was just aight. 

When I first arrived I was kind of exited because the place has a cool vibe. However, that&apos;s about where the goodness ended. When it comes to service, the staff was friendly when they were there. But it was like hide and seek to find someone at times. Our server checked on us once and then didn&apos;t come back for an hour. We had to walk around and find her to get our check. 

For food I got the boar tacos. They were dry, possibly overcooked, and not flavorful at all. The friend I was with got the grilled cheese and bourbon tomato soup. He was also not impressed with his meal either. Sooo.... Good drink selection, nice vibe, everything else is below average. 

Probably won&apos;t be back, On to the next place."
4,"Randomly ended up here because it was pouring rain but what a great happy hour and excellent food!

Nice beer selection and even the happy hour beer options have some excellent choices. The 5$ smash burger isn&apos;t a ton of food, but its an excellent basic burger for 5$. They also have things like mac n cheese and tacos on their happy hour menu. My friend got the very odd carrot sandwich but you know what, it was excellent! They were also very nice about letting me order some happy hour stuff for friends that were going to arrive a couple minutes after happy hour ended. 

Service was a bit spotty. They got one order wrong and never brought half of us water. Fries were OK at best and pretty small serving. 

A great little gem in this part of town and very different from the rest of the food options around! Would definitely check it out."
1,"Over priced and stuffy staff.  Mike is pretty much the only cool bartender left there since I last went.  Their menu is stale, too limited and boring.  This place used to be good, but got to uppity for its britches.  SPTR is tapped out in my opinion and is in my rearview mirror of restaurants worth going to or talking about.  

Also, one of my pet peeves on yelp is when a place claims they have something and they don&apos;t have it. I was doing a search for pizza and South Philly taproom pops up. Get your searches right!"
3,"Stopped by here for dinner as the food and beer menus looked enticing. I tried the veggie wings, fall salad, and the burger. The veggie wings are massive and more like an imitation of fried chicken thighs. It has an amazing fried crust, with a hot ranch style sauce on the side to dip. However there was just a lot of seitan and it ends up being kind of dry, whereas I&apos;d prefer the wings to be bite size and and saucy. The fall salad was great, with kale, goat cheese, beets, an pear. I had high expectations of the burger, but it turned out to be pretty mediocre. The patty could have had more flavor.

Beer selection was pretty nice and featured a lot of local microbreweries, and the atmosphere was cozy and warm. It just seems the food was hit or miss."
5,"I&apos;m a long time customer here,  like maybe 8-9 years, and never wrote a review. Anyway, it&apos;s my favorite go to spot for a late lunch bite. 

Their Happy Hour is always reasonable. Their food is always good. Great beer, great staff. I&apos;ve always felt welcomed. They&apos;re always opened during a blizzard. It&apos;s just overall one of my favorite spot in South  Philly."
4,"I&apos;ve been hearing about SPTR for some time, but when I saw a replay of their stint on triple D last weekend on the Food Network, I decided it was finally time to check it out. I&apos;m a big fan of the other south philly locations owned by the same guy - Sardine Bar and Second District - so I knew, based on that alone, that I&apos;d love this place.

I popped in around 2:30 on a Sunday - and I could not have timed it more perfectly. The place was pretty quiet, with brunch served until 3, we had the option to either get a last minute breakfast order in or wait about 30 minutes for the lunch menu. While the brunch menu had some interesting options, I was hopeful the lunch menu might offer a little more variety. I ordered one of their craft drafts, an order of fries, and indulged in some conversation while I waited for the lunch menu. The fries were very good, but the ketchup was different. A homemade spin on the condiment, definitely not Heinz. It was very good, just different. 

The bartender was amazing- very accommodating to making sure my glass was never empty, and offering a preview of the lunch menu - letting us know the second the kitchen was ready for our food orders. As expected, the lunch menu offered slightly more variety. My friend ordered the wild boar tacos, I ordered the mac &amp; cheese, and we shared an order of the fried pickled mushrooms. The food came out crazy fast, crazy hot. Everything was very tasty. The menu was varied, but not extensive, and the options are a little more limited if you&apos;ve got a picky palate or food restrictions.

Their draft selection and specialty cocktail list are pretty great, but definitely on the higher price end. They&apos;ve got a Pimm&apos;s Cup cocktail, which is one of my favorites, but with a price tag of $10, I opted for the $3 Kenzinger. 

The vibe here is great. Everyone is friendly and the music is good. Overall, I&apos;m a fan. I definitely want to come back to try the fried PB&amp;J."
4,"Stopped in for lunch and had some awesome wild boar tacos. The tortillas were the perfect crispness, still pliable but with crisp edges that had a crunch. The meat was juicy and delicious and the guacamole was creamy. The order came with two tacos, but I would have happily eaten two more. Mexican street corn was available as a special and I ordered that as a side. While the seasonings were good, the corn itself was small and tough and altogether not a good piece of corn. It was a bit of a letdown for this reason.

The beer selection is good with a nice selection of crafts on draft and a cooler with bottles and cans as well. I enjoyed a grisette from St. Benjamin on draft. I liked the atmosphere, a good local bar feel with better than expected food. I will likely return to try more food items and drink more tasty beers."
5,"A+ for amosphere
A++ for food selection
A+++ overall experience

SPTR has been on my bookmarks for awhile now. My husband and I decided to finally venture on over last night for dinner. Luckily we arrived around 5:30ish and caught the tail end of happy hour. Half priced drinks / apps. These days I&apos;m all about half priced apps ! ! !

When we arrived we were told to seat ourselves so we opted for the upstairs level at a table by the window. Our waitress immediately came over and introduced herself and brought us water. She was very sweet and a great waitress as well. The menu isn&apos;t much, but a lot catches your eye! We decided on sharing the Mac and cheese for a starter. But Yelp told me I would be missing out if I didn&apos;t order the wild boar tacos as well. Both were fantastic. I&apos;m not much of a Mac and cheese fan, but this was one of the best I&apos;ve had! You can also add bacon on top for $2 or jalapeños for $1. The boar tacos were a perfect blend of spice and flavor. The scoop of guacamole on it was too good. 

For meals my husband ordered the grass-fed burger (it was uuuuge) and I ordered the grilled cheese w/ tomato lager soup. They also added a side of fries and pickles / pickled tomatoes. My entire plate was filled with food! Way too much food for me, but great for leftovers. -- we were thrilled with everything. 

SPRR doesn&apos;t have much going on inside but the atmosphere is cozy and totally a bar you would want to get trapped in on a snowy Philadelphia day. Already looking forward to coming back in!"
5,"Recommend by Guy, diners dives and drive ins show. The tacos were amazing, full of flavor. We went during hour and got the happy hour prices. Also, service and cocktails were great. The staff was very attentive. I definitely will be back. On an other note, the parking is not great, but it&apos;s the city.  Parked three blocks away"
4,"I returned to SPTR after a long hiatus for Memorial Day brunch. Or lunch. We saw a tweet by the restaurant linking to the brunch menu, but when we arrived it was the regular menu plus a small handful of brunch specials. I was disappointed because I had been looking forward to the brunch burger, but I ended up going with the regular menu burger instead, with salad instead of fries. 

The burger was okay; not super juicy and probably a bit more on the med-well side than medium. I had a couple bites of the fried clams which were awesome and the perfect summer menu item. Service was solid. 

Going back to four stars for SPTR but it&apos;s still a reliable neighborhood spot."
