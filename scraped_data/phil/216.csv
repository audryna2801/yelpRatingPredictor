5,"I have had nothing but great experiences at Harpers! I&apos;ve visited for brunch both pre and during COVID and the experiences were equally incredible. The outdoor patio is wonderful especially during the warmer months.

Food and cocktails are on point. You cannot beat the bottomless mimosas! I&apos;ve also custom ordered an Irish Coffee during brunch (not on the menu) and it was fantastic. For food I&apos;ve had the Benedict (on point) as well as a short rib breakfast sandwich, but that sadly seems to have been taken off the menu.

I will always recommend Harpers for brunch or cocktails and look forward every time I get to go back!"
5,"We went here for dinner in December and it was one of the best dinners out I have had recently. We sat outdoors and were seated in our own individual heated booths. We tried a few cocktails, which were excellent. We also split the octopus appetizer which was so good we still talk about it. I had the oysters for dinner, which I would also recommend, and my boyfriend raved about his jerk chicken. For dessert, we had a very good creme brûlée with two nice sized cookies on the side. The service was friendly as well.

Although indoor dining was closed, it was beautifully decorated inside. They also posted the lyrics to a few popular songs near the bathroom sinks to encourage 20 second hand washing, which I thought was a fun idea."
5,"First of all I wanted to give a shout out to the amazing set up in this covid situation. Personalized pods and heater set ups to comfort in the cold weather - it was perfect!!!
Now the food, started with curry spiced butternut squash which was so rich in taste and very creamy. For entrees, tried pan roasted redfish and jerk marinated roasted chicken. Fish was AH-MAZING!!!! Hazelnut crust on the fish with the side of swiss chard..the combination was perfect and so delicious. Jerk chicken was good but not the best. I prefer chicken that is tender but this was a little chewy for me. Although I loved the chicken meatballs that came with it had a nice sweet spicy flavor. Oh and did I say Harper&apos;s Punch cocktail was a good punch to the fish with the crunch ;) 

Overall great experience eating out after such a long time!!!"
4,"This review is from a pre COVID visit.

Harper&apos;s Garden is located on a quaint street by Rittenhouse Square. It&apos;s a super cute place and I highly recommend eating outside since their garden/patio area is exquisite.

The times that I&apos;ve been there I&apos;ve always felt rushed by the waitress to put out food orders in and to leave. I&apos;m not sure if this is because they&apos;re so popular and have to accommodate later reservations but it&apos;d be nice if we were told so rather than feeling rushed through dinner. 

Frankly, I tend to frequent Harpers Garden more for the ambiance than for the food itself. The dishes are more on the pricey side and I&apos;m not 100% convinced it&apos;s worth the value. With that being said it&apos;s all good -- just nothing truly memorable. One thing they do well is the various cheese plates options which is a great accompaniment with a nice glass of wine. 

I would visit again but not necessarily at the top of my list. I think it&apos;s a great location for some birthday brunch or a classier date night!"
3,"Adorable location. But overall not a cohesive space. The outdoor dining is cute. The main dining room with bar is well structured. But the add on building that&apos;s all black inside with some frames on the wall. That just seems lazy. It felt like a pop up. And if you&apos;re seated facing away from the windows, it&apos;s dull.

Food next. Ordered the burrata, scallops, octopus, and burger.

Scallops. Now although they were actually good I cant remember the last time I ordered scallops and only received 2. Decent sized scallops, the two thing did throw me off. The last two scallop dishes I had were Boston and Santa Monica, and both came with more than 2. Granted this is its own thing, but not friendly if you&apos;re trying to share with more than one person. 
We&apos;re order everything to share type of people. And this dish isn&apos;t friendly to that.

Burrata special. Only complaint is our bread came out way too burnt. Like break your teeth burnt. We had to send it back for different bread, which lightly toasted helped tremendously.

Burger. Wanted to love it, but it came out extremely salty. Wife and I agreed once we finished that it was doused in salt. 

Overall impressed by their cocktail menu and bar service. The food can still wow me. The service dragged a little. (Waited 15 min for check, finished all food before un-burnt bread came)

Maybe it was an off day. But I&apos;ll give this place another chance to wow me. Definitely not sitting in that black room again though."
5,"Updating the review to include a new brunch experience. This time we were in the greenhouses which were nice and toasty! 

The Port of Call cocktail was a great start. Avocado toast with pickled peppers and pesto was delicious, The Kabocha quiche was gluten free and had a squash crust instead of pastry, which was a bit of a bummer (the waitress let us know this beforehand), but it ended up working well together, although the squash to egg was ratio was off. The Crueller was like a soft funnel cake and had a yummy grapefruit curd. Finally the sticky toffee cake was a nice finish!"
4,"Updating my review!

Came back in COVID times for brunch with some friends. We sat outside in a cute little greenhouse, and the experience was great! Our host was awesome; he customized drinks for us, and shared opinions on food choices etc. We ended up several drinks deep, and left with smiles and full tummies. I had a kabocha squash quiche which was really yummy. I was surprised that it actually came in a squash! Cool presentation and delish meal."
5,I enjoyed another great meal at Harper&apos;s. I was in PHL for work and needed a good meal with a few good drinks to chill and help the kiddos at home do HW. The Lamb Chops were calling my name and so was the Squash Soup. Meal was as great as last time. The Tender was serving me and she was a little busy so I patiently waited a little longer than usual before I was able to receive my check and leave. Not a completely bad thing but whatever.
5,"Im so happy this place Is still up and running! Definitely one of my favorite restaurants in the city and they have been taking great precautions during covid. 
I love their whole menu! Everything tastes so good! 
The most recent thing I had off the menu is the marinated portobello dinner- Im a pescatarian and they always have something new on the menu to try that is within my dietary restrictions. 
They have an amazing outdoor dining area that is heated and closed off you won&apos;t even feel like you&apos;re outside in the freezing cold! They also have private igloos for those who don&apos;t want to dine with others in the patio. I&apos;ll definitely be returning during and post covid!"
4,I personally enjoy my time here with friends a few nights ago. The food was enjoyable as well as the drinks. I just didn&apos;t like the fact that I had to wait alil more than 10 mins for a sample of the wines I&apos;d asked. But it wasn&apos;t as bad. Over all a great night even tho it was a cold one haha.
4,"Gorgeous location and great tasting food! Service was fantastic for a outdoor dining experience with nice cold temperatures! This place really made sure everything was on point! And coming from miami I&apos;ve experienced quality food! And this place  has got it down packed! 

I would love to comeback when they allow indoor dining. This place looks amazing inside!"
3,"I&apos;m truly puzzled on how to express my dinner experience at Harper&apos;s Garden. It&apos;s during the pandemic, on one of the first coldest windy days in a while and dining is outside on the street.

I try to give waitstaff grace because we all know it&apos;s not always easy to wait on people (especially outside, with a mask on, peeling through plastic and at night). With all that said, service was terrible last night. The server was pretty awful. He got a little better at the end but took extremely long putting in our orders. Ugh. It was bad. The servers bringing the food were nice.

We made reservations and was seated outside. Outside dining is uniquely built with heating and surrounded by plastic. Also, it was decorated with Christmas decor!

As for the drinks and food: tried the Harper&apos;s Punch that&apos;s already made for the night -- it taste like sparkling water (had to send it back). Tried another cocktail called, &quot;What&apos;s up Doc&quot; -- it was cool. The pommes frites (fries) was my favorite! The fries came with a beef fat-rosemary aioli. Wanted to order the roasted half rack of lamb but medium well would have taken 30 mins and the waiter already was taking a while to place our orders. So, I went with the roasted monkfish and shrimp. Hmm, the fish had an unpleasant smell that I wasn&apos;t fond of -- not that it taste horrible -- just was not pleasing to me. The shrimp was cool and the lentils. Interesting taste combination.

Payment is completed on your phone. Best part of the night! Easy peasy!"
4,I came here for brunch and they have $20 bottomless mimosas. The food was pretty decent. We all ordered the standard eggs and a side. At the time I&apos;m going to this restaurant they had seating outside in the glass area but now that there&apos;s Covid I&apos;m not really sure if that area is open for dining in.
5,"Celebrated my friends 40th with dinner at this very cute, intimate, clean and COVID safe restaurant. We had a private green house and it was very nice. The birthday girl was able to relax and really enjoy. The waitress was very friendly and accommodating. She also wore a mask properly in addition to a face shield. 

The drinks were great especially the harpers punch! The Brussels were really flavorful and and overall we had a very nice night out. We walked here from the Kimpton Palamor hotel in less than 5 minutes. If your in Philly and want 5 star treatment make reservation and check it out."
4,"Went here last night with some girlfriends and I cannot say enough good things!! I&apos;m so glad I found a (actual) COVID friendly and delicious restaurant!

We had to book a 7:30 reservation because we wanted the greenhouses. I didn&apos;t realize how popular this place was but I totally understand it now! When we got to our greenhouse I was in awe!! It was completely shut off from everyone else, SO warm, and absolutely adorable. It was a freezing cold night and I was so thankful it was actually heated. The decor was so adorable and I couldn&apos;t stop taking pictures! Just a warning, the greenhouses are clear so you can see/hear the people around you. We had a loud group next to us but honestly didn&apos;t bother us at all!

We got our drink and food menu and it took us awhile to decide. Between the four of us we got two Harper&apos;s Punches, a glass of Pinot Noir, and a glass of Brut Rose. I&apos;m unsure of how Harper&apos;s Punch works because it seemed on the menu like it switches? Either way, our waitress told us that it was an assortment of fruits and Bacardi, which sounded amazing, and let me tell you it was!! Make sure you ask for a straw to mix it up. It was delicious and quite strong! My friends enjoy their glasses of wine as well.

We ordered our food and I would say the only downside to this place is the wait. We wanted a bit for our drinks, but the food was very long. I understand that they are busy, so trust me I&apos;m not angry, I was just super hungry! I finished my drink before my food even came so that was a bummer (didn&apos;t order another because I was driving!) Our waitress came and told us she was sorry for the wait and that it would be out in a minute, and it was still about a 5-10 minute wait from there. I understand it was a busy time so I didn&apos;t let this affect my opinion! 

My food was amazing!! I got the Black Caraway Triangoli Pasta. I was nervous to try it because it had apple and mushrooms, but honestly it was a delicious combo! My friend and I split the fries and the aioli it comes with was amazing! I could not stop eating them! My one girlfriend got the butternut squash soup. It is listed as an appetizer but she wanted to try it. She said it definitely needed some salt but wasn&apos;t terrible. If she were to come back though, she wouldn&apos;t get it. My two other friends got the burger and the oysters. Both were amazing! We were very much satisfied.

Overall, one of the most beautiful and safe places I&apos;ve found in the city to dine at. Great food and great service! I will be returning shortly to try out their brunch because that seems to be the rave here!!"
5,"Came here for a friend&apos;s birthday and we sat in the greenhouses. The greenhouses are closed off to others but there is not much circulation. The atmosphere though is cute.

The food though was delicious, I got oysters, the autumn drink, and burger. The oysters have lemon juice on it that was bitter (almost tasted like I was eating the lemon skin). The burger though was good and I&apos;d recommend that."
5,"I visited Harper&apos;s Garden for the first time recently. It&apos;s a beautiful spot! Their usual outdoor dining area is gorgeous and adorned with plants and pretty lights. Right know they also just opened a few private greenhouses for guests in groups of 4 to 8 people. The greenhouses are heated and have lighting for night time. A perfect spot for brunch or a date night. 

Service for my brunch at Harper&apos;s Garden was great. Waiter was very friendly, our food and drinks came very quickly and he checked on us often. 

I got the peach pancakes which were delicious. Mimosas are yummy too. Their roasted breakfast potatoes are great!!

I can&apos;t wait to come back here and try lunch or dinner food."
5,"My boyfriend and I have been trying to venture to socially distant outdoor dining at least once a month. A few weeks ago we went to Harper&apos;s. Ive been there in the summer and pre-Covid, so I wasn&apos;t sure how it would work out. They added lots of more glass to the outdoor Terrance area, so there&apos;s less air flow but more heat. The decor is great as usual. They also had these separate outdoor glass bubble-looking seats, however, we were not seated in those. 

Wait staff was attentive, but honestly during covid times, I&apos;m totally okay if they literally only bring my food and take orders and pay remotely. They still have paper menus but paying the bill can be done completely online via QR code. 

We went on a Monday night and Harpers was great with accommodating a time change (from 7 to 8pm) for us. 

Their fall menu was delicious, with us both sharing their special fries and ordering squash toast and the chicken."
5,You have to check out Harpers Garden perfect for date nights!! Great food and amazing staff! The atmosphere is truly amazing! @sebbybelly Instagram
2,"Didn&apos;t have a wonderful time here at all. Not counting the blustery cold morning and our table being dirty, we still had a less-than-great experience.

I&apos;m giving two stars simply because the cinnamon bun was awesome. The sweet and savory was delicious.

But my pork belly BLT was mostly fat. And whatever sauce is put on the oysters just took away from the flavor. We couldn&apos;t even finish them. 

I&apos;m sad because the atmosphere here is so pretty, but there&apos;s much better places for a tasty brunch than here."
