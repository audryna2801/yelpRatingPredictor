5,"I haven&apos;t been here post covid, but we order delivery from here a few times a month.  

Pre covid we used to love coming here, sitting at the bar, eating some great food and having a nice drink.  It was very reasonable, and I felt lucky to live within walking distance.

Now we order delivery (yes we are lazy) and the food almost seems better.  The pizza is the best around!  

I can&apos;t wait for this all to be over so I can get back to my bar seat."
5,"Sidecar has been a happy place for me during the pandemic. Their outdoor dining space is perfect (covered and heated, but it is still open). Food is fantastic...I don&apos;t think you can go wrong with anything on the menu."
5,"Wow! Super impressed by my recent experience with Sidecar. Needed a pizza and wings delivery fix amidst the pandemic and saw this spot had some promising reviews. I&apos;ve wanted to try Sidecar in person many times, but it&apos;s a bit out of the way from my usual neighborhood. With nothing else to do, we decided to order in and were very glad we did.

We went with the red Detroit-style pizza, brussels sprouts, and buffalo wings. The order arrived right on time and was still the perfect temperature. I am a NY pizza snob, so the unique Detroit-style pizza was a welcome change. It was UNREAL! The crispy cheese crust might&apos;ve honestly changed my life. The brussels were perfect, and the dipping sauce was delish (I honestly scarfed these down before letting my boyfriend try one... oops). As for the wings, they were perfectly crispy yet tender and the flavor was on point. Even the side of blue cheese was better than usual.

I&apos;m super excited to get into this spot when everything opens back up, but also excited to order delivery again soon."
5,"The service, ambiance, music playlist in the background, drinks and food were all on point. Love this place!!!!"
2,"Be careful based on the reviews. This place has had numerous management changes and one policy that stopped me from ordering food in the bar literally...

Came here at 4pm after a two mile walk and the place was fairly packed with what looked like all college students. I ordered the Cleat Hitch dry hopped extra pale ale, lean bodied, balanced and full of classic American hops. Pretty good although felt like a maze in there to determine what was actually on special.

That being said I went to order the Fried Shishito and was told they do not make specials until 5pm. First off, this is not an ecentric menu item that is hard to make and the business is turning away dollars. Picked up and left after one beer. 

Not a good first impression and this bar is out of my way so again to quote Ariana Grande, &quot;Thank you Next!&quot;"
3,"We&apos;ve been to Sidecar Bar &amp; Grille 4 times, since it&apos;s changed management. The menu is small with limited offerings, but think bar food and you won&apos;t be disappointed.  The warm and intimate two-level restaurant-bar has a great atmosphere. The bartenders and staff have been professional. 

Our first visit was coincidentally, the day the new owners took over.  The menus weren&apos;t quite ready and neither were all their happy hour food specials.  It&apos;s ok, chock it up to &quot;just getting their act together&quot; on day 1.

Our subsequent visits, were on Monday evenings for Trivia night (which is quite fun!).  We&apos;ve had the Fried Brussels spouts, which come out quite burnt. I would pass on this.  The Hamburger and the Aioli French Fries and are good.  The fries are a generous portion.  The surprising winner has been the Seared Tofu Sandwich."
3,"My boyfriend and I stopped in mid way through our afternoon bike ride. I Wasn&apos;t as impressed as the reviews made it seem. Their beer list isn&apos;t anything special, and doesn&apos;t include variety of types of beers. They have a lot of stouts, porters currently on their tap, but I am sure it rotates a lot however we were not provided the draft list and kept asking what each beer was since the chalkboard only included the brewery and name of the beer. It wasn&apos;t until someone else sat down next to us at the bar that we realized they had a draft list menu as well as cans and bottles. 

The bartender wasn&apos;t all that helpful and the food menu was small. My Nashville chicken sandwich was good, just good and my my boyfriend had a burger that was very big- two patties. He enjoyed it very much but said very confidently it wouldn&apos;t be something he would come back to have. We both agreed the fries were fantastic.

Our experience was shaped around the staff not being too helpful. It seemed like us being the only customers sitting at the bar was an inconvenience. 

Overall, I believe it is a great place to stop by for brunch/lunch and enjoy a drink and food. It&apos;s not a place I&apos;d frequent, but it&apos;s definitely worth trying!"
5,"Some reviews can&apos;t wait until the morning. Y&apos;all, Sidecar is back!!!

I have to admit, my last few visits to Sidecar had gone from so-so to bad. After our last visit, it sort of became this unspoken rule in our house that we weren&apos;t going back. Yet, I didn&apos;t have the heart to downgrade my review. Sidecar has been a neighborhood staple - the first neighborhood staple, actually - for more than a decade. I definitely wasn&apos;t cheering for its demise. 

Then, news came of how the crew behind Mike&apos;s BBQ and Stockyard Sandwich had taken over Sidecar. The photos of new menu items looked extremely promising. Finally, after late nights at work, my husband and I met up in our neighborhood and hit Sidecar for a late bite. The place was packed, like it used to be. 

We sat upstairs and perused the menu. I was thrilled to see Heineken 0.0 on the beer list! This is my go-to NA beer and I am so so happy to see it in my hood! 

We tried to order a pizza after seeing so many photos of it on the &apos;gram, but our late arrival meant they were already out. So I ordered a hot chicken sandwich with a side of fries, instead. You guyyyys. They did Nashville proud! Easily one of the best takes on Nashville hot chicken I&apos;ve had outside of Nashville. And the fries were bomb, too! 

We didn&apos;t have room for dessert but I&apos;ve got my eye on the carrot cake. So stoked we have our neighborhood bar back and wishing the new owners all the best!"
5,"Update as of 12/2/19 - this place has now become a gastropub of superior quality. Since new ownership, this place has gone from a decent neighborhood bar to a must-try for all foodies. The hot chicken sandwich  is the best I&apos;ve had in the city. The fries are also fresh and delicious. The Detroit style pizza is very tasty, though that type of dough is not my favorite type of thick crust dough, it is still one heck of pie. The sauce is crazy good. The portions were good. The service was also good. I saw one of the new owners, Mike from Mike&apos;s BBQ all times I&apos;ve been there since new ownership. I am one happy local. 

This place is a great local bar with impressive food for brunch and casual dinner. It is two floors with tabling seating and a bar on each floor. They have delicious burgers and tacos.  I love their roasted potatoes served with brunch too. The servers and bartenders are always nice. I prefer upstairs because it is usually less crowded and feels less cramped. There is sometimes a wait for a table for weekend brunch, but there are two bars to keep you occupied. I also recommend the Vietnamese coffee. It&apos;s delicious."
5,"I live only a few blocks from The Sidecar. I usually go to a different area bar, but The Sidecar is a great place with and intelligently put together beer list and excellent food. Never let me down yet."
2,"I ordered to go during the pandemic so this isn&apos;t a review of the bar, just some food. I got two things, the Red Pizza with pepperoni and Nashville Hot Chicken Sandwich.

I have had a lot of pizza in this city, so the Detroit style is right up my alley. But, this pizza tasted and smelled like it came from the dumpsters in an alley. Wow, the cheese was pungent, oily, and the crust was too greasy. I was constipated for the entire weekend, never again. Disgusting!

The hot chicken sandwich wasn&apos;t nearly as bad, but I won&apos;t be returning for it that&apos;s for sure.

Red Pizza 1/5
Nashville Hot Chicken Sandwich 3/5"
4,Good happy hour! Good selection of beers along with great choices for happy hour snacks. I would definitely come back to try the different sliders and maybe order a pizza! (They looked super thick and yummy!)
4,"We ordered the buffalo chicken cheesesteak (no blue cheese) and grilled cheese &amp; tomato bisque for delivery, both were delicious! I would say the bisque was a bit too salty though, I couldn&apos;t finish it. Though I did enjoy dipping the grilled cheese, and they added some nice parmesan crisps as a garnish on the bisque!"
5,"It&apos;s everything you&apos;d hope for from the local neighborhood bar. It&apos;s got good eats, a super solid beer list, and staff is quick.

Of the food options, I was a big fan of the wings.

I&apos;d be more elaborate here, but I spent a lot of time here and got drunk really fast. I didn&apos;t drive home, didn&apos;t make any horrible mistakes, and I saw a bunch of friends...but my ability to really pontificate about the food options is limited. Usually I try to be more comprehensive of the food but I&apos;m really dropping the ball here.

I guess what I&apos;m saying is that I have bar ADD and I like to skip from spot to spot as quickly as possible. I didn&apos;t do that here. I love this place."
5,"It&apos;s BACK! (But better than ever)

My Husband and I have lived in this neighborhood for five years (been coming to Eat here for almost 10) and sadly experienced the decline of Sidecar until the last two visits earlier this year were sooooo bad we swore it off forever, UNTIL we heard the Mike&apos;s BBQ crew was involved in the new ownership. We love Mike&apos;s and when the new menu came across our insta a few weeks ago we were so excited.

Tonight&apos;s visit for the grand reopening did not disappoint. I&apos;m not embarrassed to say we arrived right at 4pm when the doors opened. Friendly staff. Terrific beer list!! I love &amp; appreciate the diversity of options (pet peeve when a place has all IPAs) I had a great Sour and there were Lagers and Wheats and Tired Hands options for the IPAers. 

The food was fantastic. Detroit style pizza was really good even though I was skeptical. One pie could have easily fed 3 or 4 people. We also split a grilled cheese and tomato soup special and honestly we both said we&apos;d come back just for that. Done perfectly and the soup was exceptional. 

The table behind us was raving about the Nashville hot chicken sandwich and the burger slider. That will be next on my list to try. 

We are Thankful the new owners seemed to have turned this place around for the better. So glad we have this local option again. 

Check it out!"
5,"If you last visited prior to November 2019, you need to try it again. New management took over and totally revamped the menu, and it is amazing.

I love being able to get a solid meal and excellent drinks at the same time. Lots of local beers on tap. The food is better than at most restaurants.

This is worth mentioning but they serve what is possibly the best fried chicken sandwich in town. We also liked the shrimp and grits, the pork belly mac &amp; cheese, and the s&apos;more pancakes.

They have a Saturday and Sunday brunch menu, and a dinner menu. We came on Sunday for brunch with our kids, and we were well accommodated."
5,"Best Buffalo chicken cheesesteak I&apos;ve ever had.  Used real pieces of chicken, not that ground up crap you get at pizza places.  The sauce, ranch, blue cheese proportions were perfect (and I am not a ranch fan).  Also got fried cheese curds, solid."
2,"We knew Sidecar was under new ownership, checked out the new brunch menu, and it actually had quite a few options that sounded good! Alas, the reviews about the changes at this beloved GradHo spot are all true. 

Food. My partner had the Daddy&apos;s Mojo sandwich. It was dry, didn&apos;t have cheese (as per the description), and was overall disappointing. I ordered the chorizo brunch pizza - specifically because it had &quot;baked eggs&quot; on it (I&apos;m a strong believer that if it doesn&apos;t have eggs it&apos;s not brunch). It came out with clearly no eggs, I asked the server about it, he said &quot;right, of course&quot;, picked it up &amp; brought it into the kitchen. 2 minutes later brought it back and told me that the eggs were &quot;mixed in&quot;? Wha??? (Btw, there were clearly no eggs in that pizza.) Flavor was fine, but seriously? 

Service. See above - a waiter who doesn&apos;t know the food? Why pick up my pizza and bring it to the kitchen? My partner&apos;s drink (greyhound - although the bartender made it with tequila? again, wha???) sat on the bar for like 20 min (the waiter acknowledged he forgot about it). And we know that because my drink (the chili paloma) took FOREVER to come out - we watched the bartender make multiple bloody marys instead. 

Also, hostess, using your teeth to get the plastic off the top of a bottle of Heinz ketchup is NOT OK. Especially in front of guests. 

And the overall bro-ish culture is not our scene. The bartender both (a) high-fived a waiter with a loud &quot;let&apos;s do this!&quot; and (b) exclaimed at one point &quot;DUDE, I just won&apos;t be able to deal if the Birds lose today.&quot; 

Last visit for us."
4,"Sidecar is a local favorite. They have an amazing burger and the pizza is even better. Overall the food is good and service is excellent. I think if anything, the to-go drinks could be more reasonably priced."
5,"If you like Detroit style pizza, this place is great. Pizza was just as expected. Went with the supreme but will be trying some of the other variations soon. Also got the wings with the original sauce. Good wings but could&apos;ve been deep-fried a little bit more."
