5,"Truly the best coffee shop in Francisville. So happy they are able to be open during COVID through the mini window. My go to here is iced chi &amp; their Maple Ham crepe  (best crepe EVER). I come here for a morning work drink or after a long night where I KNOW I need my crepe. Staff is so friendly, highly recommend if you are in the area!"
5,"I am a HUGE fan of Vineyards Cafe! The staff is all super friendly, and I am a big fan of how they do iced coffee (essentially a red eye, which is DELICIOUS!) And honestly, their pesto sandwich is one of my top favorite sandwiches. I love that they&apos;re right down the street from me, and I appreciate that they were able to open up again to do takeout service during the pandemic. Definitely check them out!!!"
5,"Had lunch here with a friend. The crepe, potatoes, and coffee were perfect. The atmosphere is so elegant- I love their plants! I&apos;ll definitely come back."
4,"Cute little spot in francisville for delicious crepes! just a note though, there are some photos on this yelp page from a previous menu - they do not serve any eggs anymore. I love the nutella crepe, the philly crepe, and I&apos;ve also had a few sandwiches that were good as well. 

My favorite drink here is an iced mochaccino- it will keep you up to get work done. I wish they had oat milk as a non-dairy option though. 

Pre-covid they were also pet friendly in the upstairs portion!"
4,"Solid little cafe serving crepes and coffee 

Crepes were huge, with fresh fillings and a great batter. 

The coffees looked great though I didn&apos;t have one."
4,"I&apos;ve been dying to try this place and am so glad I did. I pass by Vineyards Cafe during my commute to work in the morning. It&apos;s usually not open yet since I get in so early, but one day, I was running late and thought f*** it, I&apos;m getting myself a cappuccino! 

Small, quaint, and cozy, this little neighborhood cafe is such a treat. I&apos;ll definitely be back to try a crepe next time."
4,"It&apos;s in the neighborhood and very easy to access even during COVID. I think they are opened from 8 am-1 pm but their window is opened and you can order, grab, and go. Contactless, of course."
1,"Yoooooo this place is scary as hell. You wanna feel uncomfortable??? Just make your way to Vineyards Cafe and make sure you are specifically non-caucasian!
I am writing this review on behalf of a friend who felt so uncomfortable at this establishment. 
The coffee she had was not made well at all. It tasted like soap. 
The workers were unfriendly and felt hassled by my friend and even annoyed when she wanted to stay in the cafe to do her work like everyone else and have her nasty ass drink. They were unwelcoming."
3,"Edit: The owner (I think) responded, he explained they do not have direct contact with Postmates so the menu was not up-to-date; hence, items not being available. They also shared they typically do not recommend crepes for delivery, as they should be eaten within a few minutes of being prepared. All that said, I respect him reaching out and respectfully adding context. Kudos for good customer service. 

We ordered delivery this morning, we are so so so disappointed. First, we found out they were out of 3 of the 6 items we ordered - blackberry jam for a crepe, fresh OJ, and one of the other crepes. In the end, we picked the sucre crepe, Norwegian crepe, crepe with apricot jam, everything bagel with fig jam, and an iced coffee drink. The only thing that was good was the bagel and coffee. I don&apos;t understand all the reviews praising these crepes as special. I know this will sound super pretentious, but I have had crepes in France and at many places in CA - none of them have tasted as poorly as these. All 3 were lacking flavor and the consistency/style of crepe was  not appetizing, plain, not crispy, more brown colored, and lacking. The Norwegian has salmon, goat cheese, and avocado - the salmon was overpowering, while a good quantity of protein is usually welcome, this was super fishy and with a lack of flavor/spices, it was as if rating straight salmon, not a crepe with other ingredients. The plain with apricot jam was like soaking up apricot syrup with a plain piece of bread and the sucre one didn&apos;t even taste of sugar, I couldn&apos;t even see the sugar inside.I dislike giving low reviews, but I am confused why this has high reviews which misled us and was why we ordered here. We all have different taste buds and preferences, this was our experience, hopefully others enjoy this place."
5,"I&apos;m late posting this Yelp review. I stayed for the weekend in Philly nearby this gem. Stopped in on a Sunday AM looking for a cup of good coffee and maybe just a quick bite. The menu is pretty varied (who knew there were so many choices for crepes?). I decided on the goat bacon and was not disappointed. 
There was a small wait, but the ingredients are fresh, and made as ordered. Grabbed a great cup of coffee, sat down for a bit and took in the sights. It is located in a neighborhood that is undergoing a resonance. 
The crepe was just scrumptious! Great way to start my day. 
Highly recommend."
4,"A pretty great cafe in the Francisville area.  Upon arrival I was a little bit wary because it looked pretty tiny with only one table and some high top seating. I was pleasantly surprised to find out there&apos;s a floor downstairs with some extra tables and even couches! The aesthetic does what it can to be hip/trendy. It is also very clean and bright which I love. 

Vineyards seems to be known for their crepes, but I didn&apos;t get to try one during my first trip here. I got a hot latte. It was $6!!! That is v expensive for a cup of coffee and if I&apos;m being honest it was not that good. That got me a bit turned off. My friend got a mocha chino which was just as expensive and a chocolate chip cookie.

I don&apos;t wanna hate on a local small business, so even though I do think that this place is overpriced, I&apos;m gonna back it.  I&apos;ll definitely be back to give a crepe a try and recommend it if you need a cup of coffee or a place to get some work done."
5,Best. Crepes. Ever. This is a little pricey but you really can&apos;t beat it. The employees were great too
4,"Such a cute little neighborhood cafe, I met with clients here and their basement space is perfect for a meeting or just a quiet breakfast/lunch. It makes you feel you are in your own leaving room.

Tea and coffee are very good and their crepes are delicious, although I am giving 4 stars because I ordered a Nutella crepe but it was not fully Nutella, it was more of a mix between Nutella and chocolate syrup, I was expecting pure Nutella filling (as the name says) and not a mix of chocolates so that was a bit disappointing."
4,"Yelp suggested this cafe for me. So decided to try it! It was located on this cute little corner midst a residential area. The cafe has seating downstairs too. Though it looks super tiny, it can seat a lot of people.

The menu was huge- it was all squeezed onto a blackboard but surprisingly legible! They offered savory and sweet crepes, sandwiches and freshly baked choco-chip and oatmeal raisin cookies (which were not made in house).  They were ginormous and oh so soft!! 

Coffee was given to you plain, and you can walk up to the little coffee maker corner and add whatever you please.

We ordered-
Maple Ham crepe: pretty large size, over-drizzled with syrup. It was pretty tasty if you like all sweet things. But half way in, it was a little too much of the same taste.

Pesto Sandwich: has pesto, mozzarella, tomatoes and avocado. The baguette was a little too hard for my taste. Was difficult to actually bite it.

Maybe we just had bad selection of food this time, but it looked like a pretty busy little cafe on a saturday.  I would definitely return to give it another chance! But the cookies- yum yum for sure! I&apos;d probably go back at least for one of those!"
5,"The crepes are always spot on. I normally get the Nutella crepe w/ strawberries &amp; bananas, but last time I switched it up and got the Philly crepe. It was amazing!! This place is a gem!"
5,Great little cafe. I had a goat cheese turkey and dog jam crepe and it was delicious. Good prices and good service.
5,"Amazing place!!! Cozy atmosphere!!!
Such a friendly stuff!!! Sooo delicious food and COFFEE"
5,"Best creperie I&apos;ve come across in Philly. It&apos;s a small cafe, located on the ground floor in a new development. My first observations were that it&apos;s very clean, and that it has a neat wood decor.

They feature a tantalizing variety of savory and sweet crepes. I opted for the Honeybee
(mozzarella, scrambled egg, and spinach - finished with a honey drizzle) and then took home a Nutella/banana for dessert. Both crepes were super appetizing, well portioned, and priced appropriately.

I&apos;ll also mention the service was very friendly (two women behind the counter). And they offer free wifi!"
5,Such good iced coffee. Tastes like hot coffee tastes but actually is iced coffee. Some iced coffees are more bitter or not enough bitter but this one is the nice amount of bitter. And good ice to coffee ratio. Love the Halloween decorations too. Lovely.
5,"We went to Vineyards Cafe for breakfast after reading about how delicious their crepes are. The inside is pretty small, but has a very warm and inviting atmosphere.  There&apos;s also more room downstairs but we never got a chance to check it out. Both servers were very friendly. This place really does feel like your neighborhood cafe, just like their sign says!

I ordered the Norwegian crepe. These were really packed with salmon and avocado.  I never had this combination of foodstuffs together before, but it somehow works. Even my girlfriend who admittedly doesn&apos;t like goat cheese or avocados commented on how much she liked the dish. 

I was also able to try a bite or two of her caramel ricotta crepe. Also very delicious and not too sweet. Would be interested in coming back here to try more of their crepes and some of their coffee."
