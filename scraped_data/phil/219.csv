5,"Definitely a favorite dessert place for the fam! It&apos;s so unique &amp; incredibly delish!! 

The kiddos like to keep it tropical with their coconut bowls that come with UNLIMITED TOPPINGS from most recently my daughter made one filled with lychee rose and topped with mochi, strawberries, Pocky...and an umbrella, of course! 

We absolutely LOVE creating their own fun, colorful treats! The toppings, drizzle options &amp; flavors are incredibly whimsical and unique! Pandan is my eldest daughter&apos;s usual go-to, while the little one likes to pile on the Fruity Pebbles. 

The fam has previously enjoyed treats like red velvet cones with taro, strawberries &amp; strawberry drizzle, a salted blue corn cone with almond cookie ice cream topped with chocolate chips &amp; caramel &amp; coconuts filled with pandan ice cream, sticky rice, &amp; topped with fresh fruit, mochi with condensed milk drizzle with Pocky! 

Enjoy your own special combo in a cup, house-made cone (hello, green tea &amp; red velvet!!) or even in a Hong Kong street waffle, made fresh &amp; hot to order ! So cool! 

They have milkshakes &amp; delicious smoothies also! 

This isn&apos;t your typical ice cream shop, that&apos;s for sure!! It&apos;s really an adventure! 

Arctic Scoop is currently operating on a call when you&apos;re outside/they&apos;ll bring it to the door system. No entry at all! Cards requested. It&apos;s a super easy, virtually no contact system during COVID 

Arctic Scoop is without a doubt a shining star of East Passyunk! A MUST!!"
5,"Came here today with my hubby! Being pregnant I was really craving an egg waffle ice cream. They have regular flavors but if you know me I go for different flavors. This time I ordered a egg waffle with taro ice cream. Oreo shavings, reeses pieces because why not and to add a little healthy twist I added fresh strawberries 

This was my second time here but my hubbys first time here. When we went to CA there was a lot of egg waffle places but here in PA I do not think there is a lot of places that do egg waffles. 

An egg waffle is a must its like funnel cake  everyone should come try this place out! Staff is super nice. And because there is still no walk ins you order by calling the number. The full menu is taped to the outside so you can call and order if you have any questions everyone is super nice and can help you."
5,"Stopped here for a nice fix of ice cream during COVID-19 times. The order setup was extremely safe and contactless requiring customers to call in orders after viewing menus posted on the windows. The menu featured many unique flavors such as taro, pandan, rose lychee, and more. I called in my order and was greeted by a pleasant employee. I placed my order for a &quot;Sweet Blue Corn Waffle Cone&quot; with &quot;Taro Ice Cream&quot; and &quot;Condensed Milk Drizzle.&quot; 

In under three minutes, my order was brought to a window that was opened and handed over a ledge by a gloved employee. My ice cream cone was also wrapped in a napkin to prevent employee contact.

After having my first lick of ice cream, I was amazed by the delicious taro flavor and creaminess. The condensed milk drizzle was minimal, yet added a nice flavor without making the ice cream too heavy. The &quot;Sweet Blue Corn&quot; waffle cone had a subtly salty and sweet flavor that I loved.

Overall, I cannot say anything bad about this experience at all. Quality and speed of service was great. My food quality was delicious and enjoyable. I just wish they were open a little later than 9 on a summer night!"
5,"Wonderful creative tasty treats with a wide range of unique flavors! 

I generally don&apos;t go out of my way to get ice cream, but Arctic Scoop is an exception. I had rose lychee on my previous visit and would highly recommend. The rose lychee is very floral and light yet full of flavor, so you can really eat the whole large scoop without feeling sugared out. The toppings/cones are very cute and aesthetically yum too, with a lot of options. I hope to be back soon to try all the different ice cream flavors and toppings!"
4,"Tucked away in the heart of E. Passyunk Avenue between a pizzeria and a barbershop, Artic Scoop brings many unique ice cream flavors that are delicious. 

Given the ongoing pandemic, they were very cautious as they required customers to place an order over phone. They had menus posted on the windows and showed the size of the cones and cup as well. The employees are very nice and all wore masks. 

Artic Scoop had some of the most unique ice cream flavors I have ever seen. My recommendation is to get the Pandan ice cream with fruitty pebbles and condensed milk drizzle. Writing this review has left me wanting to go back already. 

the only reason why I gave it 4 stars is because of the lack of seating outdoors to eat the ice cream. I also thought $4.50 for one scoop of ice cream was pricey, but definitely worth it if you have it every once in a while. Last, my girlfriend had asked for pretzel topping. As you can see in the photo, they only give one large pretzel rather than crushing it and putting it on top. I wish they would have specified that it was a singular pretzel."
5,"I saw all the cute photos of the egg waffle cones and just had to try! The taro ice cream was super delicious and not too sweet, which was perfect! The egg waffle was light and fluffy. It was filling but I ate every single bite"
5,"Amazing dessert! Got 2 egg waffle cones and they were legitimately works of art and super scrumptious! I got a egg waffle cone with coconut ice cream topped with toasted coconut flakes, dark chocolate chips, Oreos, Pocky, Oreo dust and a chocolate drizzle. My husband got an egg waffle cone with Taro ice cream topped with bananas, toasted coconut flakes, Pocky and a condensed milk drizzle. These dessert were delicious and beautiful. This place also takes great care in terms of COVID by only taking phone orders and bringing the ice cream to the door when ready so you don&apos;t even enter the shop at all. Great shop and great ice cream! Will always return and definitely recommending to friends!!!"
5,This place is amazing!!! I can not emphasize how helpful they were with my problem dealing with a delivery situation. They were so nice and understanding of the predicament. I would highly recommend anybody who wants some ice as a quick bite or a container to take home to come by this establishment.
5,"Came in before they close for the season to get free cone.

The waffle is made fresh. Not overly sweet, crispy on the edges. The ice cream is ok, it&apos;s dense instead of creamy. The mochi is a little bit dry. I guess it&apos;s because of the end of the season. The strawberry boba tasted very artificial. Don&apos;t get this.

The guy who helped me with my order was super nice and friendly. He put my free ice cream in a cup with a lid and put the cone on the side. Five stars on customer service."
5,"We were walking down East Passyunk last weekend enjoying the weather (and some varying to-go cocktails) and we decided we wanted something sweet. We found Arctic Scoop and we&apos;re intrigued by the flavored cones so we gave it a try.

During yellow phase, they are taking orders via phone (even if you&apos;re standing outside) and then they&apos;ll bring your order out to you and grab your card (or I suppose cash) to run it back inside. The menu is posted on their window and seems like a standard full menu.

I ordered a simple dark chocolate cone with cookie dough ice cream and bae ordered a midnight vanilla cone with chocolate ice cream and jimmies (JIMMIES, I SAY, NOT SPRINKLES).  The cones had nice, subtle flavors that didn&apos;t overpower the ice cream. The ice cream was super creamy and the scoops were JUST the right amount.

I would definitely come here again if I was in the area! They had smoothies, milkshakes, and lots of different flavors on their menu. There&apos;s a bbq spot across the street so we mentally planned to come back when we can dine-in again, eat at the bbq spot for dinner, and then get some ice cream for dessert."
5,"The effort and pride they put into making each sundae is exhibited in the sheer cuteness and deliciousness of each one. The flavors are unique and fresh, and you have so much room to play with the bevy of toppings. I got the coconut bowl, but I&apos;ll be back for one waffle cone. Great experience and would definitely recommend."
5,"Philly&apos;s most amazing ice cream.  I love the coconut ice cream here but this season is not available.  pandan ice cream is not bad, taste is great"
5,"Loved it here! I can&apos;t wait to be back! My boyfriend and I shared an Egg waffle with pandan ice cream, strawberry, coconut flakes, fruity pebbles, mochi, pocky, and condensed milk drizzle. It was phenomenal. I love their unique flavors. It is one of my favorite desserts EVER, and I don&apos;t even love ice cream that much."
5,"This place has many asian flavored ice creams (matcha, sesame, taro, pandan), and they execute it very well! Each scoop is very large, so one scoop is likely enough.  It&apos;s always a difficult decision for me to choose a flavor since I love matcha, taro, and pandan all so much (and definitely can&apos;t finish more than 1.5 scoops).

The ice cream itself is on the chewier side in terms of texture. I think it works well especially with the taro and pandan flavors.  I enjoy more creamy textures for traditional flavors like chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry so I tend to stick to the asian flavors at Arctic Scoop."
5,"Nice little ice cream shop! 
It&apos;s a small ice cream shop that has egg waffle ice cream or ice cream in a coconut bowl! You can also just get ice cream in a cup or cone, and coffee, tea, or smoothie.

My friend and I got the original egg waffle with matcha ice cream and topped it with Mochi, pocket, strawberries, trix, etc
The egg waffle was good, not hard and not too mushy or uncooked - it was just right. The matcha ice cream was good too. Not the best green tea ice cream but not the worst. It was just an average green tea ice cream. Al in all the experience was good and the dessert was good. 

I will be going back to try the ice cream in a coconut bowl :)"
5,"Great ice cream shop! A fun and unique experience. They make homemade sugar cones - I&apos;ve had the vanilla and the chocolate and both were delicious. There is a great selection of toppings and unique flavors. 

The staff is always friendly and helpful. If there is a line, It&apos;s worth the wait!"
5,"We randomly decided to come here after lunch one day. It was a weekday afternoon so it wasn&apos;t crowded. The guy working at the counter was friendly and patient and let us sample flavors before deciding. 

They were out of the mocha chip flavor that I wanted to try. But I guess it kinda was a good thing so I can try other flavors I don&apos;t normally have. I ended up getting the  lychee rose ice cream in a cone with coconut flakes and a strawberry topping. It was very refreshing on a hot day. 

Afterwards I was kind of jealous seeing other people&apos;s huge egg waffles with all different kinds of ice cream and toppings. I didn&apos;t even notice that on the menu and kind of wanted one. But I was full from lunch anyway so my smaller cone was the best choice. We will have to go back another time for the huge egg waffle thing or the ice cream in the coconut. This might be one of our favorite ice cream places now."
5,"We had an impromptu trip to Passyunk ave and after eating some lunch, we walked towards Arctic Scoop. No lines and ninety degrees outside in the middle of the day was a no-brainer.  We tried a few flavors and I decided I had to go with the purple Taro ice cream.  My wife went with the lychee rose flavor.  With our cones, we also get one topping and one drizzle.  There was so much care put into each topping.  Seriously, absolute perfection in the way the ice cream cones look.  

I&apos;m really glad we were able to stop in here and try this place out.  There are so many toppings and drizzles you could offer.  Ice Cream in a coconut or an Egg Waffle.  Different waffle cone flavors too.  Most ice cream you want to eat right away.  Arctic Scoop will require you to pause until you capture a photo of their masterpiece.  Not sure when we&apos;ll be back, but we will be back for the waffle...  One day..."
5,"I loved the taro ice cream! Hubby got the cookies and cream flavor I think. I did not get a chance to taste his because I was thoroughly enjoying the taro ice cream. If you like taro you will definitely like this ice cream. 

Pros: unlimited toppings if you get a bubble waffle or coconut bowl. Generous portion size, great mochi, pocky included too 
Cons: hard to eat in the container because I was afraid the toppings would fall off. The bubble waffle was not as crisp as I thought it would be. I guess u can&apos;t expect crispy due to the ice cream when I have had it before the Hong Kong bubble waffle was crispy but this was a totally different location. It&apos;s more like a regular waffle with the ice cream. 
Seating: limited. There was only a bench, some bar seating and then one more picnic bench table set up. 

Overall I would recommend this place to try out their many flavors. They even had a sesame flavor that I did not get to try. It seems to be the flavors rotate, so I&apos;m definitely waiting for black sesame!"
2,"Average ice cream parlor. Instagram-able ice cream creations.
I have been here twice. I love green tea flavored ice cream, but their green tea is a bit milky and not much of a strong green tea flavor. With a scoop of ice cream, you get one topping and one drizzle for $4.50.  Limited seat available."
