5,"Reopened!! Been closed the whole year due to covid, now re opened with mask requirements and limited attendance. Reserve your tickets online!

Student discount senior discount and after 5pm pay what you wish; many ways to save. Currently they&apos;re only offering pay what you wish only Friday night, maybe they&apos;ll bring back the Wednesday nights soon. Opened til 8:45pm

Recommend coming here several times as there are way too many things to see. Overall everything is organized by country and era, they&apos;ve done a great job recreating historic atmospheres. 

Will be back again soon!"
5,"The museum&apos;s main building will reopen on Friday (Jan. 8).  The temporary hours will continue (Fridays from 10-8:45 and Saturday-Monday from 10-5).  Admission to the main building will be &quot;pay what you wish&quot; on Fridays from 5-8:45 p.m. and on the first Sunday of every month.

Tickets will go on sale on January 6, and advance reservations are strongly recommended."
5,"Over its long history, the PMA has amassed a deep, diverse collection of the finest and most recognizable art works in history.

Due to pandemic limitations, a reserved/timed ticket is required.
A serendipitous obligation that makes viewing art much more pleasurable because there&apos;s fewer visitors to contend. 

Numerous Mondrian and Kandinsky paintings.
Amazing rooms dedicated to Twombly, Johns, and Brancusi.
Exceptional groupings of Hudson River School.
Classic Monet and Van Gogh.
The iconic Eakins canvases.
Even a Munch Mermaid. 
Just the second floor takes hours to appreciate. 

Staff is informative, accessible and friendly.

If you are in Philly and don&apos;t visit the PMA, you missed a wonderful visual experience on par with the world&apos;s finest museum venues."
5,"This museum is fantastic!!! I&apos;m a DC snob, spoiled by free Smithsonian museums, so I wasn&apos;t expecting much but this museum blew me away! I loved the architecture pieces incorporated as art, the Japanese tea garden installation, and the many amusing paintings. We came on a Friday evening (discount!!) and had a blast."
5,We stopped by the museum last weekend and it was the first visit we had made since covid started.  Wow!  Their procedures were very impressive from cleanliness to temperature stations upon entry.  It was also so nice to have space to breathe and take in the art without fighting a crowd- this is the sort of social distancing I could get used to!
4,"Due to Covid, the main building is the only building that&apos;s currently open. All the bathrooms are closed except for the ones near the main entrance and the gift shop limits customers so there will be a wait to get in. Parking is $15 for the first 4 hours and then $2 per hour after that. Make sure to get it validated at the museum.

The museum main building is large and even though my boyfriend and I were there for a little over 5 hours we still didn&apos;t see everything. The exhibit &quot;A Tribute to Nurses and Doctors&quot; was really good and is now one of my favorites.

The employees were really attentive and was always around to make sure people had on their masks. One thing that made me side eye the establishment was the fact that small bags couldn&apos;t be on both shoulders for &quot;safety reasons&quot;, I don&apos;t understand how having on a small bag strapped to both shoulders isn&apos;t safe.

I would be back to see the rest of the museum, but I would make sure I brought a shoulder bag."
4,"With how COVID-19 has changed our world it&apos;s difficult to enjoy the museum without feeling like you&apos;ll contract something from persons not respecting personal boundaries, mandates and such. But at night, when the air is cool; you enjoy the atmosphere that the beautiful architecture provides and you work out! I love the aesthetics of this space. From exquisite architecture, to our nation&apos;s history  and breathtaking views, you will get your fill. I haven&apos;t actually been inside since the pandemic, but all of the out side spaces are open and they&apos;ve brought back parks on tap with CCD. So get out! Exercise! Move! But mask up!!"
5,GO In besides running the steps go in! Go in to Americas finest art musuem make a day of it and come back for what you missed
5,"I&apos;ve been here twice, and have been delighted by both experiences. From the iconic Rocky Steps, to the mix of classic and vibrant exhibit, the Philadelphia Museum of Art is a must-see if you&apos;re in town. 

It&apos;s large size lends itself to become a place one could (and should) become completely and totally lost in!"
5,"I live in DC so I&apos;m used to free museums but I have to say, the Philadelphia Museum of Art is well worth the admission price. Your ticket will also include other galleries like the Rodin Museum and the Barnes Collection and be valid for two days.

I was amazed at the art on display and how close you could get to it! There&apos;s a whole room for Ellsworth Kelly! The hallways are  even gorgeous.

It&apos;s also fun seeing everyone run up the Rocky steps and pose by the statue.

It&apos;s a must for all art people!"
2,"Listen, this museum has a great art collection, you can&apos;t take that away from it. It&apos;s also a iconic location, and the building itself is a work of art of its own.

What I strongly dislike about this museum is the multiple negative interactions I&apos;ve had with staff, in my last two visits.

For example, being told that I cannot take pictures in the lobby unless I buy a ticket.

Or having what seems to be the head of security, and reprimand me for using a selfie stick, even though this so-called selfie stick is a 6&quot; handle on my phone, not an extending rod.

But it&apos;s not like I&apos;m surprised, the management of this institution has clearly come under severe scrutiny for its attitudes toward its own employees, and if the museum cannot respect its own employees, why expected it respect the guests, or to properly train those employees?

Get your act together, Philadelphia Museum of Art"
5,"Recently here after reopening in January. The COVID restrictions and guidelines here made me and my partner feel really safe. The museum seems to only be allowing 50 or so people in every 15 mins (with preordered online tickets no walk ups) so most of the time we felt like we were at a private viewing even with the most popular paintings like Van Gogh&apos;s sunflowers. The staff is great, very accommodating and kind. The tickets are currently &apos;pay what you can&apos; but please consider paying the suggested amount of $25! This was one of the best experiences we have had since the pandemic began! Really amazing!"
5,"I was truly blown away by my day at the Philadelphia Art Museum. I was especially drawn to their &quot;Designs for Different Futures&quot; exhibition, which was packed with unique, educational exhibits on the intersection of sex, fashion, the environment, technology, and so forth. 

The rest of the museum was super intriguing too, it was packed with notable names such as Picasso, Duchamp, and Van Gogh. Plus, be sure to check out the Asian section, which even offers a replica of a Japanese home within the museum! 

If you&apos;re looking to grab a bite, you can choose between the cafeteria or a more high-end sit-down dining experience."
5,"Bottom Line:  Definitely one of the best collections of art in the United States.

Oh gosh, where to start?!?  The Philadelphia Museum of Art is a huge art museum and one of the best in the country.  Its collection is eclectic and includes a wide range of mediums including tin type photos, pressed glass, oil paintings, china plates, painted tiles, sculpture, early-American furniture, arms and armor, masonry and even architecture.  

Because the museum is so huge, be sure to get a map.  For me, I knew my husband and I were not going to last all day so we prioritized what sounded the most interesting to us and spent about two hours at the museum.  (I suspect that is a quick trip by most standards.) I appreciate that the museum indicates on their map what the &quot;must-see artworks&quot; are and indicates them with a star.  

One of the most famous works of art in the collection is Vincent van Gogh&apos;s Sunflowers.  But he is just one of many famous artists featured in the museum.  Gehry, Picasso, Cassatt, O&apos;Keefe, Tiffany, Wyeth, Monet, Peale, and Rembrandt are some of the name that come to mind. 

The building was completed in the 1920s and is very prominent in Fairmount Park and on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway.  The building was built as a temple to art but probably became the most iconic after the movie Rocky was released in 1976.

The building was undergoing renovations when we visited so that was a bit distracting at times but I suspect a building of this size is probably always in some sort of state of maintenance and repair. 

For amenities, there is a cafe and a few coffee bars.  They also have a sizeable gift shop and at least one pop-up shop on an upper floor. There is a parking garage conveniently located by the North Entrance and the art museum does validate parking so that it is discounted.

As far as the front &quot;Rocky Steps&quot; go, it was a tourist trap out there.  Lots of people running around, music playing, etc. But we did enjoy the serenity on the back side of the museum. 

In addition to the &quot;main building&quot; which I discussed above, the museum has various other buildings in the area (Perelman Building, Rodin Building and some historic homes) and but we saved those for our next visit."
5,"The Philadelphia Museum of Art is one of the biggest attractions in Philadelphia. At a minimum, it takes hours to explore, but can easily take days if you visit the Anne d&apos;Harnoncourt Sculpture Garden behind the main building, the nearby Perelman Building (photography, fashion, textiles, contemporary design) and Rodin Museum (about 150 sculptures by Auguste Rodin, including The Thinker out front), and two historic houses, Cedar Grove and Mount Pleasant. All are owned by the city.

At the time of writing this review, two-day general admission allows you access to all of the above buildings and costs:

$20 for adults (age 19+)
$18 for seniors (age 65+)
$14 for students and youth (valid with student ID or age 13-18)
Free for kids (age 12 and under)

On the first Sunday of every month, 10am-5pm, and every Wednesday, 5-8:45pm, admission is &quot;pay what you wish.&quot; The main building is open six days a week, typically closed every Monday, but open most holidays like Memorial Day and Labor Day. Along with being open Wednesday nights for &quot;pay what you wish,&quot; the main building is also open on Friday nights for live music and drinks. Parking at the main building&apos;s on-site garage is only $5 on Wednesday and Friday nights with validation from the Visitor Services desk.

The standard parking rate is $12 for the first four hours plus $2 for each additional hour. The entrance to the parking deck is located on Anne d&apos;Harnoncourt Drive, close to Kelly Drive. Follow the signs.

The museum is one of the largest and most visited in the world. The main building itself is gargantuan and a work of art. It looks like a grand and magnificent Greek temple with towering columns, majestic fountains, and manicured gardens. While the main building opened in 1928, it&apos;s probably best known for its appearances in the Rocky movies beginning in 1976. Since then, the wide stairway leading up to the front of the museum has been known as the Rocky Steps (https://www.yelp.com/biz/rocky-steps-philadelphia). The popular Rocky Statue (https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-rocky-statue-philadelphia) is located at the base of the stairs, off to the right (if facing the museum).

At the end of Rocky V (1990), Sylvester Stallone and his son, Sage Stallone, are in front of the main building. Sylvester says to his son, &quot;Look at this, you know. I&apos;ve been running up and down these steps for 20 years and I never knew there was valuable pictures in this building, you know.&quot; In response, Sage says, &quot;Well, you&apos;re never too old to learn something new. You&apos;re going to love Picasso,&quot; as they walk towards the museum (https://youtu.be/I7nWj8Q_FgI). The museum houses over a quarter-million pieces of art from Asia to Europe, Impressionist to Renaissance; there are hundreds of galleries spanning thousands of years. Some of the more well-known artists whose work is on display include the aforementioned Pablo Picasso, Marcel Duchamp (this is home to the largest Duchamp collection in the world), Salvador Dali, and Vincent van Gogh.

If you have time, walk around to the west side of the building. There&apos;s a small forest with benches where you can sit down and relax. It&apos;s peaceful and serene. My fiancee loved that little wispy and willowy area."
5,Great and friendly staff. They all seemed to be on top of enforcing COVID guidelines as well. I always love visiting this museum.
5,"The Philadelphia Art Museum is not only one of Philly&apos;s greatest landmarks, but one of the great collections of art and institutions.

I&apos;m embarrassed to admit that I&apos;ve lived in Fairmount a very long time without visiting. One thing I particularly enjoyed was the museum&apos;s commentary on modern times. While the majority of the sections haven&apos;t changed since last visit, near a painting of the Cathédrale Notre-Dame de Paris, there was a note about the recent fire. 

I was lucky to visit during the last few days of the Impressionist&apos;s Eye Exhibit. The number of Van Gogh, Monet and Degas paintings was mind blowing. The exhibits change regularly so that&apos;s a good reason to keep going back.

The entrance price was reasonable. It was $20 for an adult entrance, and it included next day re-entrance. If you read each description or take a tour, you&apos;ll need all the time you can get. 

I&apos;m no stranger to the Art Museum &quot;Rocky&quot; steps. Don&apos;t forget to take photos there too. The various views of the skyline and Schuylkill River from inside the museum are also noteworthy, as is the architecture of the building.

They also have events, such as jazz on Friday nights and yoga on Wednesday&apos;s. 

The Philadelphia Museum of Art is a landmark and institution for a reason."
4,"The main reason I went to visit Philadelphia. I was excited to go to the museum and see what was all in their collection. I wasn&apos;t disappointed. I do wish they had had a few more Henry O&apos;Tanner pieces but they have two spectacular ones. 

I love impressionist and Renaissance art mostly and mostly representational. Monet, Van Gogh, Turner, Whistler, Sargeant, Corbet. 

I was on a two hour schedule so of course I&apos;ll have to go back and spend more time. Great museum and nice building."
4,"What a great museum! The architecture is beautiful. Love the sculptures and fountain in front of the museums. Also, the Rocky statue and the famous Rocky stairs!! This is a popular tourist attraction stop. All the hop-on hop-off tour bus stop at this location. 

Definitely a must visit place!"
5,What a beautiful museum. I can&apos;t wait to visit again. I liked their restaurant downstairs
