5,"As a self-proclaimed boba-fanatic (I even decided to work at a boba place in ATL for a while after graduating college), I was craving bubble tea and exploring the Chinatown region with my family this week. Stumbled upon Mr. Wish, and am so GLAD I did! 

Ordering by phone during COVID and picking up the order was convenient and safe. We ordered a grapefruit green tea with 30% sugar, and a pearl milk tea with 30% sugar as well. I loved both--the grapefruit seems to be made with real juice, and had chunks of fruit inside as well. The pearl milk tea was creamy, slightly floral and the boba perfectly chewy with a rich sweetness. If you are averse to anything too sweet, I&apos;d def recommend ordering below 50% sugar. 

Our teas hit the spot on a hot August afternoon; I look forward to returning and trying the other drinks as well!"
5,"We&apos;re late to the Black Tiger Milk Tea party, but wanted to try some anyway. Black Tiger Milk Tea is essentially just brown sugar milk tea with streaks of caramel that looks like tiger stripes. It was apparent that the only place that sells this was Mr. Wish in the Chinatown location. 

We called to place our orders and were told that for this specific drink, they follow a strict recipe and only serve it in one size (medium) and you can&apos;t make adjustments to the ice level, etc. Boooooooo.

The Black Tiger Milk Tea ended up tasting delicious! The ratio of the bubbles, ice, and everything was spot on. My only wish is that they would offer them in bigger sizes!"
1,"I hate to leave a negative review because it&apos;s not about their drinks, which I do enjoy but rather the horrible experience with customer service from one particular young girl. First of all, I got there at 7:55 p.m and I was waiting in line behind one guy who was ordering a large drink order. When it was my turn, I asked to order a smoothie. She looked at me and rudely said they don&apos;t have anymore smoothies, green teas and oolong teas because they closed at 8:00 and it was 8:01 when I was ordering. I then asked her what did they have because I wanted something fruity. Her snarky response was &quot;you can order black milk tea&quot;. How is black milk tea fruity?? Thankfully her co worker was much nicer and recommended some fruity options for me that they didn&apos;t run out of. 
On top of that, I&apos;ve witnessed her being super rude to other customers and saying snarky remarks after they left. One guy asked for straws because he didn&apos;t see it all the way at the bottom of the bag (and to his defense I couldn&apos;t see it either), she gave him the meanest, nastiest look as if he asked her something super offensive. She just stared at him until he looked at the bottom and said oh never mind. After he left, she scuffed to her co worker and said &quot;can you believe he asked for straws?&quot; Like seriously girl?? Not to mention the whole time she was complaining about how bad she wanted to go home. 
I understand they close at 8, but if a customer steps foot in before then, you need to take their orders. If you decide you don&apos;t want to, that&apos;s fine too but don&apos;t take the customer and treat them nasty because you don&apos;t want to be there. I am pretty sure this is the same rude girl all the negative reviews are for. I wonder if the owner care enough to realize the impact one disgruntled employee can have on a small business."
1,"You would think during a pandemic they would try to make their customers happy. All I wanted was a black tea with bubbles. No milk, since I grew up lactose intolerant, I hate the taste of milk in pretty much anything. I could see the big containers behind the worker, one saying BLACK TEA! She just kept saying no. That they didn&apos;t have a recipe for black tea and bubbles. I told her to use the same recipe as the milk black tea and just disregard the milk. I told her I didn&apos;t care if it came up short in the cup or about paying the same price. She just kept telling me no. This is exactly why I NEVER go to Mr Wish nor will I ever try to support them.

1. Add bubbles to cup
2. Add ice
3. Add pre-made black tea
4. Add simple syrup

Guess thats considered rocket science"
4,"Did not want to come to Philly to get bubble tea at a spot that I&apos;d normally get from in NY (Vivis/KFTEA) so Mr.Wish was the bubble tea spot for the weekend. There is one in NY, but I&apos;ve never been so came here to try out their drinks. I ordered the Lychee pulp drink and my fiance got the Mr. Wish special which is basically a mix of some fruit pieces, tea and orange juice (if I heard the worker correctly). I also saw that they have mini cakes, I guess I was hoping for something similar to what Quickly&apos;s use to have back in the days so we got an order of the custard cake as well. Without our cakes, we might have gotten our orders a lot quicker but they make those fresh on the spot so we had to wait about 10 mins for it. 
Both drinks were really refreshing so I would go back for more. We did not eat the cakes on the spot because our hands were dirty so we had it after we had dinner. It was okay, I would probably skip. 
Overall, solid spot for fruit teas- I do want to try their brown sugar bubble tea since it seems like others recommend it."
4,"Drinks can be hit or okay, but I love their combo of the QQ Milk Tea - boba, grass jelly, and lychee jelly. You definitely can&apos;t go wrong with any of the milk teas, and the bobas are chewy. Their puff waffle with filling are okay, a good snack if you&apos;re hungry but nothing to write home about. I tried the recent limited edition strawberry drinks with the strawberry boba - definitely not worth it. The strawberry bobas tasted plain, not strawberry-like, and wasn&apos;t sweet. Definitely better off with the regular boba"
4,"This is not what I usually get. I just tried a different flavor to go outside my box.  I should say this is really good. It&apos;s creamy and fruity , not too sweet. I&apos;m glad I tried this."
5,"Some of the best boba I&apos;ve had!! I got the black tiger milk tea. It was a bit sweet so I made sure to stir all of the sugar into the milk. It tasted like Carmel milk. It was really good, the boba itself was perfect!! Not too hard not too soft. 100% recommend, and will come back if I&apos;m in Philly again."
2,"After seeing so many high reviews about this place and their overall rating, I was excited to come here and try the bubble tea drinks. Sadly, I was left disappointed with the entire experience. I came to Philly with my boyfriend for the weekend and Mr. Wish was our last stop before heading back home. We were around the area and did a walk in at around 12PM. We ordered two regular pearl milk teas (one with 60% sugar and another at 30% sugar level). We regret not calling up earlier in advance since there was a handful amount of people when we got there. We just decided to wait since we figured it couldn&apos;t be too bad but boy was I wrong. We waited for almost 45 minutes probably and the staff was extremely slow with probably about 1-2 people making the drinks. I have seen way longer lines at other bubble tea stores before, along with pickups.

What really pushed me to give this place 2 stars overall is the woman working at the register who was taking orders. She did not smile once and she was not friendly whatsoever, as we observed the way she talked to other customers. Not once was she courteous and said thank you. I wanted to use the bathroom as I had a drive back home. Although I knew the answer was probably going to be a no, I still asked because I figured it couldn&apos;t hurt. I probably should never have asked because her response was just &quot;no, it&apos;s closed&quot; in a very rude tone. With covid and all, the least you can do is just try to be nice to others. 

I do have to say though, we enjoyed our bubble teas as the tea taste was strong and the bubbles were very soft. The 30% was perfect to me and if you don&apos;t like your drinks too sweet, I&apos;d say 30% is the way to go. As much as I want to give this place a high review, the customer service needs to be better if they want to attract more customers. I see other reviews mentioning about horrible customer service as well. I tried Tea Do which is right nearby and my experience there was insanely better, with quicker service. I probably would take my money there instead and not sure if I would return back here if I&apos;m visiting Philly again."
4,"So happy that Mr.Wish is open during times like this but did you know if you order on the app it is more expensive than in store?! As I was placing my order, my app crashed and had an error so I had to order in store. 

When you order online, the drinks are about a dollar more plus there&apos;s a service fee! Yikes! If you do want to order ahead and save some $$, I suggest just calling in and ordering. It was about a $5 difference for me when ordering on app vs in store. 

It&apos;s not Mr.Wish fault, it&apos;s grub hub ~"
4,"It can be overwhelming to pick the &quot;perfect&quot; boba place in Chinatown. I don&apos;t think there is such place since every place is similar in price (expect $4 a drink) and taste.

It was my first time here. I got the Wish special fruit tea with 60% less sugar. It was refreshing and different from the usual boba places. There were pieces of fruit. However, it was a little too tart for my taste...it seemed like there was too much lemon. I&apos;ll have to try a different fruit tea next time. 

Overall a solid place for refreshing fruit tea.

Tip: Place does accept credit cards without minimum purchase."
5,"Mr. Wish is the best bubble tea in the city. If you&apos;re looking for somewhere to sit down and hang, then I would recommend going to the Mr. Wish in rhittenhouse. But if you&apos;re just looking to grab a drink then this place is great! Their boba is really soft and is coated with a warm sugar. All the teas are great and there&apos;s a lot of variety."
5,"Doors open at 10a, but if you&apos;re looking for boba, consider visiting at 12pm.

Must get: peach macchiato, mango smoothie (fresh fruit), bobba pearls
Meh: passion fruit tea
Missed out: every other combo

I am not a big fan of boba tea, but I can appreciate fresh fruits, hot pearls, and expedient service. I came here with my wife the moment the stored opened, as many of the yelp photos showed long wait lines. This was also when we realized that all boba teas were available at noon, when all of the pearls are cooked. We ordered the fresh mango smoothie (sooooo good and refreshing, prefer less sugar though), paid for a passion fruit boba tea, and picked it up 2 hours later. We also were surprised to see that Mr. Wish offers the new cheese tea that&apos;s all the rage in China and we were delighted to finally jump on the hype train.

In my honest opinion, the cheese milk foam is a must get, especially if you&apos;ve never had the experience. It&apos;s slightly salty, but married so well with the fresh peach with neither flavors stealing center stage. The passion fruit boba tea was...ok, but too sweet for my liking.

At the end of the day, boba tea is a &apos;healthier-ish&apos; alternative and expensive no matter where you go. However, if you are craving a boba tea in Chinatown, I can&apos;t think of a better place to visit than Mr. Wish.

Food: 4 stars
Price: 3 stars
Service: 5 stars"
5,"ITS THE WEEKEND AND YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS. 
Black tiger milk is served after 12pm on the weekends. If you have not been to Mr. wish or have not had the privilege of trying their Black tiger milk then I would seriously consider visiting on the weekend (srsly)

The boba at Mr. wish has never disappointed me. With the black tiger milk specifically, the boba always comes freshly made, to the point where you can feel the warmth emanating from the cup. You&apos;ll feel more warmth and comfort emanating from this delicious serving of boba than you have ever felt from your parents (sry not sry) 

Pictured: eager hand that could not wait for basic yelp pic"
5,"I LOVE Mr Wish!! Their boba and their drinks are so consistent here and the tea flavor here is excellent. We got the tiger sugar milk tea with boba and a hot oolong milk tea with boba. The boba in the tiger sugar milk tea came out piping hot and it was so warm and chewy and just the right amount of sweetness. The oolong milk tea has a rich roasted flavor and really hits the spot on a cold day, and the boba is extra soft but still chewy in the warm drink. There tends to be quite a lot of traffic in the Chinatown area and this place was pretty busy, so our drinks took a lot longer than normal but mr. wish is probably the only boba place I would come back to consistently in philly. I&apos;m not really a fruit drinks person, but I know my friends are usually a fan of their fruit drinks because they add a lot of fresh fruit pieces. I wish all boba places in Philly had drinks as good as Mr. Wish!"
1,I am a regular customer here and I like they drinks and store. Here is why only one star. The owner of this store got the worst attitude and unprofessional. He shouldn&apos;t be at the counter or answer the phone at all if he doesn&apos;t have any social skill. I love MR. WISH and want them to be successful. But he give a bad reputation and bad name to other MR. WISH as well. Hopefully the other location doesn&apos;t own by him. My advice just in case he answer the phone or at the counter make sure you being nice and please him or get ready to get a lecture from him. I want his business to be success but if this behavior still going I&apos;m sure he will loose a lot of customers.
5,"Best bubble tea in Philly. The plain black milk tea with bubbles is the litmus test and they did it well. Their fruit drinks are made with fresh fruit and are delicious. The apple cider vinegar one is great, but may be too vinegary for some. The tapioca pearls in the milk teas are high quality and you could eat them on their own. Avocado smoothie could use more avocado, though."
5,"This may be an unpopular opinion, but Mr. Wish is my favorite bubble tea spot in Philly Chinatown ( sorry Kung Fu Tea and Tea Do). Unfortunately, I can&apos;t really comment on the extent of the menu since I get the same thing 99% of the time. However, my order is always ready before the estimated time and quality has been consistent - I appreciate when the boba has that desirable QQ texture. In case anyone is curious, my go-to is the pearl milk tea with 30% sugar."
2,"Mr. Wish has been one of my family&apos;s favorite bubble tea spots, but our experience with their customer service has sadly left a pretty negative impression on us.

Atmosphere: Clean, with 4-5 tables inside for seating. Can get very crowded after dinner time on the weekends, so be prepared for long lines (which is true for all bubble tea spots in Chinatown, for the most part).

Drinks: Their drinks are standardized across locations, and we&apos;ve tried a variety of menu items - fruit teas, milk teas, cheese macchiatos - and generally have enjoyed them all! Good spot for bubble teas, but the service at this location unfortunately has turned us away from coming here, especially with other great bubble tea spots in the same area.

Poor Service Experience #1: This is where I think this store has room for improvement. First, I walked in with my friends, and we were not greeted or acknowledged at all, even though there was only 1 other customer in the store. This usually wouldn&apos;t bother me that much, but it felt a bit rude, paired with the following experiences. Soon after we entered, a customer walked in and approached the counter. A member of the staff made eye contact with her, but then immediately turned away as if the customer wasn&apos;t even there, without greeting or saying anything. The customer then just walked out. Very strange.

Poor Service Experience #2: My friend ordered a matcha macchiato, which comes with a cheese foam. We were in a bit of a rush, but patiently waited for the drinks to be prepared. However, we noticed that the staff finished making the matcha drink, and only afterwards checked if they still had cheese foam - turns out, they didn&apos;t. Not a big deal; I totally get that mistakes happen, and they didn&apos;t have the inventory. But the way this situation was handled was quite poor and felt rude - instead of apologizing, the staff member made it seem like it was our fault that we were in a rush, and couldn&apos;t wait for the cheese foam. We left without the cheese foam, and felt quite disappointed with the entire experience. It left a pretty sour taste overall.

Overall: 2 / 5 - again, if you like bubble tea and fruit tea, go for it. I have nothing against their drinks and food - My family and I have loved their drinks and have been pretty loyal customers for a while! We&apos;ve just had negative experiences with customer service at this location, and wish it could be improved in the future."
5,"Delicious happiness in a cup. I am very picky with my bubble tea, and I really appreciate that Mr. wish uses all fresh ingredients. No powdered drinks here. So much so that my cousin who is a candy bar prepared type of girl, was turned off by how natural the mango smoothie tasted. Ha ha! Will be back again and again"
