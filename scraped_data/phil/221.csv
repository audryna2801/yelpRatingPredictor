5,"My favorite place for cookies and cookiewich (aka ice cream sandwich)!

The shop is super tiny but the line goes by really fast since everyone is in and out. My favorite cookies are snickerdoodles and chocolate chunk. I tried to just stick with one or two cookies but I always end up with a 6 pack lol. And no not 6 pack abs, 6 cookies going home."
2,"This is my *very *local Insomnia Cookies location. While I want to love it for providing me delicious cookies late at night, it&apos;s hard to give it a good review given how mediocre it is (especially compared to other Insomnia locations).

This location has always been a little hit-or-miss. It is conveniently located next to tons of bars / eateries, so is a good late-night option post roaming (pre-COVID at least). The service can be quite slow and there is something dingy about it. During COVID, you see long lines out the door, but that is mostly a function of the fact that the space is so small. The real reason that I would never go back is the general disregard for safety that I&apos;ve seen over my last few visits. Staff aren&apos;t wearing masks (or the masks aren&apos;t covering their nose) and are also sitting naskless while super close to where the cookies are on display.

There are plenty of dessert options in the area. Would recommend skipping this option until they can get it under control."
1,"The slowest and absolutely worst service I have ever experienced...ever.

It&apos;s a sh*thole of a place."
4,Was in Philly for a few nights and this place was on the same block as our hotel and made for a perfect late night stop after dinner digested a bit. First night we stopped in was a Sunday. They were out of half the cookies on the menu and had absolutely no milk in the fridge. Not a single bottle. The said that it was the end of the week so they sometimes run out of things - total BS answer. I didn&apos;t know the area and it all looked quite so ended up just getting ice cream. The next night they must have gotten a new shipment since the fridge was stocked and they had all the cookie flavors. Totally would crush some more of these right now.
5,"Insomnia cookies are soooo good! You wouldn&apos;t think they&apos;re that great because it&apos;s a chain, but these cookies are seriously some of the best I&apos;ve ever had. You can&apos;t go wrong with the flavors. Also, their ice cream is really yummy too. I&apos;m not sure where they get they&apos;re ice cream from, but it&apos;s super creamy and rich. There&apos;s plenty of locations around the city, so you should definitely check it out if you get a chance."
2,"Underwhelming. Cookies were good, but honestly no better than what you can get at a grocery store bakery. Staff member who waited on us left much to be desired, she was reluctant to interact when we were asking her questions about the cookies/ice cream. I&apos;d pass on a second visit."
2,"The only thing good about this place is that it is open so late. We ordered two deluxe combos which includes two deluxe cookies and a beverage. We got a peanut butter cup cookie and a walnut oatmeal chocolate chip cookie with a 2% milk. We ordered online and opted for curbside pick up. Ordering online turned out to be a good idea because when we arrived there was a line out the door. We called as instructed in our email so that our order could be brought and were told they&apos;d be right out. After 10 minutes my husband went inside to pick up the order so that we wouldn&apos;t wait any longer. Turns out there was several employees inside that were not engaged with activities and could have brought our order out but did not. So ordering online and opting for curbside pick up was pointless. Additionally, they only had whole milk and neglected to tell us that when we called for our pick up. When we finally got home to eat our cookies both the peanut butter cookies and walnut oatmeal chocolate chip cookies were burnt, so they were hard and bitter. They looked delicious but tasted horrible.  Needless to say, this was a waste of money. We won&apos;t return and do not recommend."
4,"Nice, soft, CHOCOLATEY cookie! So good. Very rich so you&apos;ll definitely need some milk with these. Not really worth the price, but they were pretty good. Place is small. Just grab your cookies and go."
4,"Insomnia is honestly my go-to when I want a sweet treat. This location just happens to be on my walking path to and from work. It is so hard to walk past when you can smell the fresh bakes cookies every day. The shop is very small with only two or three bar height seats, but you&apos;ll probably finish your cookies before you think to sit down. The cookies are always warm and soft when you get them. They ice cream is very good too and pairs well with their bakes treats. 
The only issue I&apos;ve had with this location is their inability to take cash. On more than one occasion, I&apos;ve ordered cookies and get out my cash to pay, only to be told they can&apos;t take cash at all. I&apos;m not sure if this is on specific days or just when I go in, but there&apos;s never a sign stating they don&apos;t take cash."
1,"Ordered cookies for ASAP delivery and they still weren&apos;t delivered after an hour- so called, and after 10
minutes on hold, was told they were on the way. Still didn&apos;t arrive after 2 hours so called to cancel and get a refund, which was essentially refused unless we ignored the delivery once they came (pretty rude to their drivers). Absolutely awful customer service- will definitely hesitate from ordering from here again. Any reputable business would have offered a full refund, apology and the cookies for free once they came- incredibly disappointed how they handled this situation."
4,"Slightly larger than a hole in the wall...the counter has two stool and room for one more to stand...3 people could be in line while 3 people ate.

The warm cookies went perfectly with the creamy ice cream...a perfect dessert after a long day of sightseeing and eating through historic Philadelphia.

Courteous friendly staff was a nice bonus...but the &quot;food&quot; (cookies) were great!"
5,"Crazy delicious. Not a fancy place at all. Only big enough for about 6 people to be in there at one time. But they will have some very good warm cookies and very good ice cream if you go for a ice cream sandwich. 
It&apos;s a treat to enjoy and by far worth the trip and waiting in line if there is one"
1,"Extremely rude!!!! Have you ever been to a cookie/ice cream shop and had a rude server?? SMH! This is supposed to be a happy place- LOL! This chick didnt know the items on the menu and did not make the sundae properly. I asked her about it and she did not attempt to fix it. Her own co-worker asked if she needed the bowl to make the sundae properly and she said no! WTF! So she purposely made it wrong and did not care whatsoever. I like Insomnia, but that server needs to learn customer service. Horrible! Just horrible. Definitely wont go back to that location. Thumbs down!"
5,"They deliver to hotels! Often when I&apos;m traveling for business, my girlfriend gives me a surprise order of Insomnia (and Philadelphia is no failure within this trend) because she is wonderful and thoughtful in every way. Top notch, can also order milk."
1,My 1 star rating isn&apos;t for the cookies but for the customer service. No greeting and they couldn&apos;t even focus for 2 seconds to get our order down. They were very unprofessional and messed up our order. We didn&apos;t even go back to correct it because we already had to wait 15 min for the cookies we wanted just for us to come back and be told that they had burned some of them. Insomnia cookies are awesome. If you want some go to any location but avoid this one at all cost.
5,So damn good!!! Got White Chocolate Macadamia and Double Chocolate Chunk. Fantastic price $1.75 for size and quality.
4,"My obsession with insomnia cookies started in college since it was my go to place when I had late night sugar cravings. Though I don&apos;t eat cookies as much as I used to, I still indulge once in awhile. 

This was my first time going into this location and it was a pretty tight space, so don&apos;t be surprised if you have to wait outside in line since the store can only fit a few customers at a time. We ordered a six pack that contained triple chocolate chunk, snickerdoodle, chocolate chip, macadamia, m&amp;m, and peanut butter. I have nothing bad to say about the cookies as they tasted and came out perfectly.

I will say that I haven&apos;t yet had negative customer service experience at this location like some other people. Some of the workers are actually really friendly, but I have also had a few that weren&apos;t and had slight attitudes. Overall I haven&apos;t had any issues with any orders, and I will probably continue to come here because of the convenient location in center city."
4,"Impromptu cookie purchase! 

Fianc√© and I randomly came to Philly and were headed back to Jersey when I saw the sign. Ran out of the car to get a S&apos;mores and Peanut Butter one. They were good choices, but the chocolate addict I am, of course I loved the S&apos;mores cookie more. Packaging is cute and service was nice and prompt. The cookies were good, but weren&apos;t my favorite. Definitely worth trying, but I wouldn&apos;t necessarily go out of my way for them."
3,"This review is only on specific items I tried. The regular cookies ( all favors) tasted of pure sugar with a bit of cookie dough and a hint of flavoring here and there. Some cookies I could only take one bite and hand it over to my husband because I was busy spitting the bites out. Thought I had me a few cavities by the end of those. Needless to day, the regular cookies are for sugar junkies.

The larger, deluxe style cookies ( all flavors) were actually pretty good because they were sort of semi sweet and you could actually taste the flavors. The S&apos;mores and Peanut Butter were the best. No issue there. Would like to go back to try the ice creams. I&apos;d definitely buy the deluxe cookies again, but the regular cookies? That&apos;s a hell to the naw naw naw."
3,"I love insomnia cookies and this is in a good location by some great restaurants.

However, the staff here is insanely incompetent and at times very rude. I cannot believe they manage to operate the location this way but I suppose if you want late night cookies, this is your sport."
