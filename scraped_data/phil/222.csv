5,"Just walking on the same block as Ekta evokes cartoon scenes of Donald Duck getting grabbed by the nostrils by some magnificent aroma that carries him down the street. 
My husband and I got Ekta the evening of our at-home Zoom wedding reception (bc covid, lol) if that tells you anything about how good this place is. It was also our Thanksgiving meal- we got it the day before (they were closed for the holiday) and warmed it back up so it could be our holiday feast. Can you tell I really like it? 
Honestly, everything from this place is delicious. Navratna korma, butter chicken, onion pakora, chicken biryani... all mouth-watering and savory. I&apos;m an Indian and this is my go-to Indian spot in the area. Prices are decent for the portions. Service and pickup are easy breezy."
5,I always order takeout from here and the experience is seamless. They take your credit card over the phone and within 20 minutes you&apos;re good to go! The Chicken Tikka Masala is one of my favorites but if I&apos;m feeling adventurous I&apos;ll just pick something random on the menu. You really can&apos;t go wrong here!
5,"Super tiny little shop. I called in a takeout order. I walked over in 20minutes and it was ready. They took my credit card through the phone. It was contactless delivery. I ordered a mango lassi, appetizer gobi manchurian, and alu gobi. The mango lassi is delicious, thick, and creamy. I like to put it in the freezer to make it super cold. The gobi manchurian was crispy and spice correctly. The alu gobi also came was a pint of rice that was flavored with ginger and other spices. The alu gobi was enough to last me 2 to 3 meals. The spices blended so well together. I definitely would be a returning customer soon!!!"
4,"I love ordering the food directly from the restaurant because there&apos;s no delivery fee and other service fees that can add up your food bill. Very friendly service and willing to adjust the level of spiciness. 

Mango chicken: I asked for very mild but still tasted the depth of spice of the dish. It&apos;s not a heavy meal, I dipped my paratha into this creamy and flavorful gravy. The chicken cubes is a little bit overcooked.

It takes about an hour for delivery."
5,Always excellent here. Got the chicken tikka masala and my friend got the lamb. Garlic naan was Food arrived hot and fast!!
4,"So glad this place exists! I had ordered from here long ago and remember enjoying the food but sadly never reviewed them.

COVID got me to remember about this place and so glad they&apos;re still around! Solid spot for Indian food - and I&apos;ve tried some not so great spots in the past.

If you go for pick up, the place is completely unassuming but don&apos;t judge it by the facade - there are surprises in store with the food quality! 

We had ordered pick up (they partner with the different delivery services and also do their own delivering for free!) We ordered the shaag paneer, garlic naan, and veggie biriyani.

The order delivery was right within the time window they quoted and the delivery guy was super friendly. Everything came well packaged and nothing was out of place when we unpacked it at home.

The food quality is where it&apos;s at though. Great flavor, solid portions, not heavy on the oil - just hits all the right cravings. 

Will definitely be hitting this place up again as quarantine looms on. Check it out - so much to offer!"
5,"We ordered take out. I got the goan shrimp curry and the mango shrimp. They were both super good!  The mango shrimp was sweet and really good! That was my favorite of the two. The goan shrimp curry had more of a spice taste to it, but still really good! I know my go to Indian place now! I also had the guava lassi which I really enjoyed"
5,"I had a bit of a saga trying to order Indian food last night, and Ekta saved me when I was hangry and frustrated.

I ordered from an unnamed competitor who told me 35 minutes for pickup. 45 later, I showed up and it wasn&apos;t ready- 10 minutes they said. 10 minutes later, they admitted my order was taken by accident by a delivery driver and they were &quot;trying to get it back&quot;. I asked for a new order and they said they&apos;d refund me. I was hungry and SO annoyed at the way they handled it.

I called Ekta to explain the situation and they said they&apos;d make my order ASAP. And they did! 15 minutes later they brought my food right to my car and I was delighted. The person on the phone said I&apos;d like my food better than unnamed competitor and they were right. The samosa chaat was so flavorful and lovely. The chicken tikka masala was delicious, topped off with garlic naan. I am so excited for leftovers for lunch today!

Can&apos;t wait to order again from them soon! Thank you Ekta for saving me!"
5,I live around the corner and eat here every other week. It&apos;s so good! Highly recommend the kadai paneer if you like spicy. The paneer mangoli is the best thing on the menu.
1,"This is $14 worth of Tandoori Chicken. It arrived an hour later, cold, and SKIMP as fk. It usually comes with larger pieces of chicken, mixed peppers and onions. Y&apos;all see what we got.

UPDATE: We got dry leftovers. The basmati rice was awful. The naan was tough and cold. It&apos;s upsetting bc we order from there every week and this was the worst service we&apos;ve ever had."
4,Mostly a take out place but does have a small dining area. Table cloths &amp; Table service. No alcohol. Food was good. Definitely would get the chicken masala.
5,"This review is long, LONG overdue. I have been getting Ekta delivered ALMOST every week for a couple years now. It is ALWAYS amazing. It ranges from being outstanding to UNBELIEVABLE. When I eat their food, it&apos;s one of those things where I can&apos;t NOT say how good it is as I&apos;m eating it. It honestly doesn&apos;t even make sense. That&apos;s how good it is. 
They offer delivery, which is very nice. I never order through apps, I always call the restaurant. I talk to the guy who answers the phone more than i do my own mother! I wish I was joking, but that&apos;s the truth.  
To me, their food is just total comfort food. No place even comes close. I went to India a year ago and I was very interested to see how I would feel about Ekta after eating food IN India. Guess what? Ekta is still the best!
When I ask for it to be extra spicy, they give it to me and I appreciate that. The food is just outstanding. The flavors are so much more complex than your average Indian restaurant. 
Sometimes I think about moving away and the one thing that really keeps me here is that Ekta is here. If I can&apos;t be near Ekta, I&apos;m not sure I can survive. If i was on death row, you better believe I would ask for a meal from Ekta for my last meal. That&apos;s how good it is. I know this praise might seem over the top, but it is genuinely how I feel. 
I LOVE YOU EKTA!!!! 
I attached some pictures of my go-to order. I know chicken tikka masala is super basic, but I cant help it. I love it extra spicy. I wont even order it at other places because it&apos;s just not even like this. 
I love the onion bhaji and the malai kofta. I&apos;ve tried the samosas, chandrakala, garlic naan, mango chicken, saag paneer, Ekta murg, lamb Rogan josh, lamb vindaloo, lamb chetinad, kadai lamb and tandoori salmon. You honestly can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu. Everything is outstanding."
4,"We got take out from here. We had gobi manchurian, malai kofta curry, chicken tikka masala and garlic naan. Mali kofta and chicken tikka masala were really good. Gobi manchurian was below average. The gobi pieces were too big and under cooked in the center."
4,"Ordered here for take out recently after some recommendations. Got regular naan, garlic naan. Naans were typical naan you would expect. For mains I tried the chicken Tikka and lamb Josh Rogan. The lamb I ordered very spicy which was their highest. Was spicy but nothing that you couldn&apos;t handle and doesn&apos;t get to real Indian spicy. Lamb was tasty and the sauce great. Chicken was good as well. A bit pricey for Indian food at $16 an entree that only comes with rice and nothing else. Tasty though"
5,"I find it hard to believe I haven&apos;t reviewed this place yet. 
I&apos;m not privy to all the ins and outs of Indian food. 
I love this place. 

The bathroom signs have Braille on them but it&apos;s just a printed piece of paper that has been laminated. 

I know a guy that stayed there for five weeks. He said it was great and tasted just like real Indian food."
4,"I&apos;ve been looking for a good Indian spot in philly and up until now I&apos;ve been disappointed. Lots of so-so places but none really worth noting or returning too.. again until now. 

Rita has all the classic dishes but calls out vegan options very clearly which seems rare. 

Ordered the eggplant and chickpea dish. Both had strong flavors and were good portions."
5,"Always terrific food, now even more special because everything can be delivered - food always comes well packaged and hot. We especially love the sag paneer, the chicken tikka, the eggplant, and the daal, but all the food we have tried has been consistently good. We also like being able to choose our spice level. We get mild for our kids and medium or hot for ourselves - and the complex spices in every dish are wonderful."
5,"Came here for dinner. No wait. Love the butter chicken here and lamb sagwla. We usually go to the one in Bryn Mawr. So happy there&apos;s one closer to home and the food taste the same! I would say this is the best Indian I&apos;ve had in the Philadelphia area. 
Garlic nann is also a great choice to accompany your meal. 
Not sure if they offer any discounts for lunch like they do in Bryn Mawr. 
Street parking so it&apos;s a bit difficult sometimes because it&apos;s around residential area."
5,"I can&apos;t stop thinking about Ekta.

My vegan sister came to visit me a couple of weeks ago and every time we are together we eat Indian food so we knew we had to go someplace good. Once we read the reviews for Ekta we decided to give it a try and it did not disappoint!

First, we got vegan samosas for an appetizer which were heavenly.

I can&apos;t remember what my sister got for her entree but I got the spicy chicken vindaloo and it was everythinggg. The flavors were spot on and it was exactly the level of spicy I wanted (which was very). You can choose to make any of it spicy or not spicy I believe.

Their garlic naan is also something I could not get enough of. Even when I was stuffed from all of the delicious appetizer and entree food, I still made room for more garlic naan because it was so good.

The staff is also so nice. They made sure our water was always filled and helped us with deciding what to order and packaged our food up for us when we were too full and needed to take it to go.

I can&apos;t stop telling people about this place. It&apos;s also v convenient because it&apos;s near the Girard Septa station so I know I will definitely be going back ASAP."
