5,"Really cute outdoors dining during covid. Pricey - you pay mostly for the ambiance, great service, and healthy-ish, high end dishes. The shabazi fries with harissa aioli stole the show for me, and we even ordered a second round of them. Also had the berbere carrots, chili chicken kabab, peri-peri shrimp, and a few cocktails - all okay, but my heart was set on the fries."
5,"COVID Update: First and foremost, I want to emphasize that they label every take out item on the container, which is so helpful. I mean anyone could recognize the peri peri shrimp, but what&apos;s this red thing? Beet borani, oh okay sweet (don&apos;t know what that means, but at least I have a general idea). Small things matter, and Spice Finch&apos;s attention to detail doesn&apos;t suffer with takeout.

They are offering a limited menu right now, which is still very comprehensive - some of their best dishes are on there. However, I wasn&apos;t paying attention to what vegan, gluten free, etc options were still on there. They have an extensive menu for people with food restrictions usually. We got a takeout tasting with 2 small plates and an added entree for 2 people, and it was plenty of food (maybe too much?)

The quality of the food was still excellent. Everything tasted just as good as dining in except the baked cheese. You can&apos;t replicate the crispy bottom from the cast iron skillet or the crunchy shredded phyllo dough, but that was a risk we were willing to take - still DELISH. While I missed their clover club (like a lot), I must say, it was really nice to be able to pair the meal with a bottle of our own wine."
5,"This review is long overdue, and I can&apos;t wait for them to open back up after the pandemic. This restaurant has a special place in my heart and everything is outstanding. I have been here on two occasions and the food has never disappointed.

Ambiance 5/5
Service 5/5
Food 5/5

I&apos;ve visited on the weekend and the restaurant is never too packed, dim lights, beautiful decor, stately bar, very nice ambiance. On to the food.

Starters: We got the Flatbread and two spreads and chose the tahina and garlic yogurt. Bread was delicious, and I wanted to lick my plate clean of those spreads. 

Small plates: Shabaka fries, Date Truffles, Stuffed Grape Leaves, Baked Cheese. All delectable. The fries had a great seasoning and were thin cut and crispy. The date truffles were delicious, but really sweet so maybe you should wait to partake during dessert. The grape leaves reminded me of my time in Greece and the baked cheese was warm, soft, and I kept going back for more.

Vegetables: Baby green salad was refreshing, had a great crunch and was perfectly dressed. A wonderful palette cleanser.

Seafood/Meat: Lamb Ribs and Chili-Chicken Kebab. Those RIBS!!!! oh my goodness, they are perfect. The fat to meat ratio, sweet glaze, fall off the bone ribs were to die for. You MUST get these. The kebabs were over top of a nice yogurt dip and were juicy.

Dessert: Chocolate Tahina Cake and Apple Streusel. Both were a great finish to an awesome meal. Great pairings of chocolate and blood orange sorbet. The Apple was tart, sweet and delicious.

To top it off the service is amazing. On our first visit we experienced a slight hiccup where one of our entrees they graciously packed up was left out of our bag. Upon emailing them about this problem, management mailed us a gift card for our troubles and not only did we return, they also placed a note in the system and they decided to comp a dessert which was a surprise. Now that is service! 

Do yourself a favor and make a stop here."
3,"Hit or miss -  let me start with the misses - 
so the frittata was actually gross ; as was the peri peri shrimp - literally killed our appetites 

But the trio spread and the baked cheese were bombastic ; service was good- fresh OJ pitcher or glass ; la Colombe coffee ( Philly signature ) ; great ambience so make of it what you will"
4,"I went here during restaurant week and had a really good experience. We sat outside and were distanced fairly well from other tables despite being on the sidewalk. While the food was good I&apos;d say the best part of the experience was the staff--super friendly and attentive. 

For the food, first we were brought spreads for the table (there were two spreads and i think it was the trio of spreads from small plates). I ordered the tortilla appetizer, roasted cauliflower for my main and chocolate tahini cake for dessert. Honestly the best dish I tried though was the shishito peppers my friend ordered. 

The reason I didn&apos;t give a full 5 stars though was I thought the tortilla dish was rather bland and I don&apos;t think I received good value on my meal as a vegetarian. I should&apos;ve checked prices before going for the restaurant week menu but all of my dishes added up on the menu were $31 and I paid $35. Definitely had a great experience overall though!"
4,"Went here for restaurant week. I&apos;m not a sweet tooth person so normally I ask for 2 appetizers instead of dessert and they obliged. So we were off to a good start! 

Ordered the peppers, tabouleh and cauliflower dish. 

The tabouleh was by far the best and the peppers had some nice kick. The cauliflower sauce was on the sweeter side. 

Drinks were $13 and very standard average."
4,"Had a friend coming to town for the weekend. I made some reservations on open table for a Saturday at 12 as there was outdoor seating (during these COVID times).

I got there at 12 on the dot but I think this may be opening time since staff was still hustling and bustling about getting things set up and I was asked to wait an additional 10 minutes before being seated. 

The tables outside were tiny so keeping all the plates and drinks on the table (along with any purses or phones) was going to be a challenge...but it was also adorable and bright green.

On the menu, the hibiscus lemonade had 2 prices listed, we assumed one was for a glass and other was for a pitcher...turns out it means the price of a non-alcoholic drink and one with added vodka. I had the non-alcoholic version, tasty but very TART. Refreshing, which was what I needed because by this time, the sun was uncomfortably beating down on us...please make sure you wear your sunblock because all the outdoor tables were fully exposed to the midday sun. Not just eggs were being fried. 

I ordered the pancakes which turned out to be wonderfully fluffy and filling (I should have asked them to hold the granola on top which was just soggy and unappetizing sitting in the whipped cream). My brunch partner got the lamb sausage on the advice of the waiter and that was an excellent decision...juicy and perfect. 

We had the baked cheese (which came with LOTS of tomatoes) starter in addition to our entrees so no room for dessert. 

By the way: the restroom is in the hotel that&apos;s attached. To use it, you&apos;ll have to go to the front desk in the hotel for a key card."
4,Stopped here for breakfast after a night out in Philly (pre covid). This place was so cute and the staff was attentive. The yogurt parfait was delicious and I really enjoyed the orange pancakes.
5,"2nd birthday dinner review!

Thanks to Top Chef, Jennifer Carroll is one of those Philly chefs that I&apos;ve been following for years. But outside of Bravo her food has been something that has constantly alluded me, so when I first heard that Spice Finch was set to open, and that she was using it to add a modern twist to Mediterranean cuisine, I was determined to change that!

Courtney&apos;s flavorful review, and Michelle&apos;s spot on review confirmed it to be a spot worthy of a celebration, so I booked a reservation which led to an incredible experience from start to finish!

With it being connected to the Warwick Hotel, Spice Finch might just be the most easily accessible restaurant spot of any Philly Top Chef alum. But don&apos;t let the hotel restaurant be a deterrent, because it also rises above any other hotel restaurant that I&apos;ve ever experienced! the interior was chic and modern, but also managed to be fun and comfortable. It may have helped a bit that she knew my cousin, but Nicole was an incredible server, who made spot on recommendations throughout, and had some incredible bussers helping her throughout.

Whether you go with a Spice Finch original, grab a classic, or even go non-alcoholic, there were plenty of impressive cocktails to choose from. But I was definitely impressed with the Hangman&apos;s Beautiful Daughter with its bourbon, averna, orange, and rosemary. For beers they have a good selection of cans, bottles, and drafts. But I was all about Port Brewing&apos;s Mongo double IPA.

For food we had and were very impressed with the following:

Flatbreads w/ spreads - Do yourself a favor and get both homemade sourdough and Ethiopian spiced crisps. I could swim in their Tahini and Beet Borani!

Stuffed grape leaves - done perfectly with farro, fennel, apricot, and lemon yogurt!

Baked cheese - an impressive blend of ricotta and mozzarella with shredded phlyo dough. So good!

Roasted cauliflower - One of the best I&apos;ve had with its coriander cashew butter, pickled onion, and herb oil.

Mushroom &quot;Nwassar&quot; pasta - and incredible dish that combined three of my favorite veggies in mushrooms, sunchokes, and brussel sprouts with Manchego cheese.

Braised pork belly - perfectly cooked with its eggplant, pickled cranberries, romanesco, shishito peppers, flatbread, and Za&apos;atar spices!

Chili-chicken kebab - an incredible surprise with its swiss chard, sesame yogurt and garlic streusel topping.

Whole roasted seabass - Best wholefish dish I ever had with its incredible leek vinaigrette and preserved lemon flavoring.

Date braised lamb shank - the main event complete with a warm grain salad, roasted vegetables, and cucumber. cooked perfectly with meat that fell right off the bone!

With dessert we got to enjoy a little bit of all the things. But I especially fell in love with the pumpkin roll with cream cheese frosting, and the AMAZING chocolate tahini cake with buttercream and a blood orange sorbet! Overall it was a meal that delivered an incredible experience and had me ready for more."
4,"We&apos;ve been eyeing the menu of Spice Finch for a few months now, and finally got the chance to try for last week&apos;s date night for dinner. 

Based on our experience, I would say that for a larger group it would be nice to get a bunch of dishes and share everything family style. For a couple or smaller groups I would recommend a la carte or the tasting menu. We opted to go a la carte because one of the main dishes for the tasting menu is their lamb, and we don&apos;t eat red meat. They can accommodate the dietary restrictions - but we welt like the price point wasn&apos;t worth it if we weren&apos;t getting the &quot;main meat&quot; attraction. 

We went all out and ordered the 2 flatbreads + 4 spreads. Their homemade flatbread is excellent - such a great texture. The berbere crisps are a nice contrast to the chewy, soft flatbread. My favorite spreads were the beet borani and the lemon yogurt which I believe was labne, if not - very similar. 

We started off with the baked cheese which I can highly recommend. The rich and savory cheese was well contrasted with the texture of the shredded phyllo - and the acidity of the tomatoes was a welcomed bright note. 

We also ordered teh Clini-Chicken Kebab which was very juicy and tender. Another well balanced dish with the swiss chard. 

Lastly we also ordered the Shakshuka and the mushroom pasta. We were a bit too full to fully enjoy the Shakshuka but it was very good, and you scoop up the goodness with more homemade flatbread. The mushroom pasta was very good, but disappointing because all the noodles were stuck together and when you bit in the middle - it tasted floury almost like when it&apos;s just barely undercooked /al dente. I took a picture so you can see what I mean. it was very good otherwise, loved the flavors of the sauce - however we didn&apos;t finish the dish because the texture/dryness of the stuck-together pasta was unpleasant to eat. 

Service was great, our server was friendly and personable and explained their tasting menu options very well. 

Between 2 people I would say you probably only need 4 dishes, the 5th is what tipped us over. 5 dishes, 4 beers tax and tip came to about $145. Overall I would say that Spice Finch is worth a visit!"
4,"We went to Spice Finch, located inside the Warwick hotel, for brunch recently.  

I love Shakshuka which is generally a hearty combination of spiced tomatoes, onions, and peppers. We decided to get a large order, which was designed to be split by 2.  It was definitely tasty, although not quite as hearty as other preparations I have had. The accompanying flat bread was fresh and delicious. 

Although good, here&apos;s where I think this entree offering had some shortcomings. If it&apos;s designed to be split by 2 people, including 3 poached eggs doesn&apos;t quite cut it. Does sharing 1 1/2 poached eggs per person really make sense? Same with the flatbread; it was one piece that was to be shared. We could have easily each ate our own piece. I&apos;ve ordered Shakshuka at other restaurants and an order typically comes with 2 eggs. We left feeling a little underwhelmed. Fortunately, we weren&apos;t too hungry. Otherwise, this entree designed to be shared by two would have left us feeling under satisfied as well."
4,"Awesome place! Came here with a few friends. Only dropping it down one star since I wasn&apos;t a fan of the lamb dishes (sweeter flavor profile) The rest of the dishes were amazing! The entree sizes are very large so id stick to one of those and a few smaller dishes 

What to get:
Chicken kibbeh
Shabazi friess
Dry rubbed Chicken 
Roasted Cauliflower 

Drinks are great too! Cute, lively atmosphere"
5,"Went for rw lunch. Waiters were phenomenal and made accommodations for gluten free friend. Service was fast and great. 

First off I got the crisps, shared the flat bread and crudités with friends also. We tried all the sauces and they were all great- the flatbread was the best  but the vegetables were also nice and crispy with a slight sweet tinge. Garlic yogurt was a hit. 

The chili chicken flatbread was fantastIc. Perfectly seasoned and very filling without being overwhelming, although the fries kind of disappointed. 

Chocolate tahini cake was pretty dry and not worth, the cream on top was good but the cake itself was bad. 

Overall, service and atmosphere was a highlight and some dishes really stood out while some left a lot to be desired. I&apos;d give it a 4.5 but I&apos;ll round up for great service."
4,"Great Mediterranean fusion resturant right by Rittenhouse Square. If you&apos;re going with a group of people, it&apos;s best to just order a bunch of small plates and entrees and share everything family style. They do have chefs tasting menu of that are $45 and $60 per person but I personally think it&apos;s better to just pick what you want and split it. It ends up being around the same price, even a bit cheaper, and you get the flexibility to choose what you want. I went with a group of 6 people so we ordered a lot. Some of my favorites: 

- Beet Borani Spread
- Shabazi Fries: I&apos;m usually not a big fries person but these fries were seasoned and extra crispy, and the aioli dipping sauce was the perfect compliment 
- Roasted Cauliflower: A whole roasted cauliflower with perfect blend of spices. If you&apos;re looking for a veggie plate, I highly recommend it 
- Lamb Ribs: Hands down the BEST item on the menu. The meat is cooked to perfection it melts right off the bone. It&apos;s simmered in a apple vinegar sauce so you get the perfect blend of sweetness in the afterbite. This is a must order.

Peri peri shrimp and braised pork belly were also good options. We also got the NY strip steak, but I thought the steak was just mediocre, there&apos;s definitely better options. 

If you&apos;re ordering cocktails, the Where&apos;s the Smoke, There&apos;s Fire is an execellent choice. It does have a kick to it, so if you don&apos;t like heat, I&apos;d probably order something else. This isn&apos;t your traditional Mediterranean restaurant, but overall it&apos;s a great spot and I highly recommend."
5,"Spice Finch was the best pick ever to kick off the New Year with an unforgettable brunch! Several of my friends were in town for the holiday and we took one of them out to brunch for his birthday which was the next day.  It truly was the best decision we could have ever made.  There were 7 of us, and ample space for our group.  He&apos;s vegetarian, and the menu definitely had a great selection for him to pick from.  The rest of my group also had no problem choosing what to eat - the menu was not only extremely interesting, but everything just looked incredibly delicious. The interior was gorgeous and surprisingly spacious for a Rittenhouse restaurant. There was bright lighting, gorgeous decorations, and overall just a classy atmosphere that is perfect for everything between special occasions and nice weekend brunches.  

Our group together got a few brunch drinks (a house made lemonade, Bloody Mary, and mimosa) and some coffees (La Colombe).  We also ordered several different flatbreads, a basket of fries, and the shakshuka.  I was one of the people who ordered the shakshuka and I absolutely loved it. The large size actually wasn&apos;t too big and I felt was a perfect size for one person if you&apos;re really, really hungry.  The pita it came with was generously portioned as well, with the eggs perfectly cooked and so gooey on the inside.  The shakshuka itself had that nice, classic, rich tomato flavor with a hint of ras-al-hanout.  It was incredible, and one of the best shakshukas I&apos;ve had.  The fries were also really great, well seasoned with a side dipping sauce that was creamy and perfect.

We brought a cake for our friend and the kitchen was able to light candles for us and cut the cake for us as well, which was so generous. Our service was absolutely perfect, and I can&apos;t emphasize enough how everyone 1) loved the experience and 2) loved their food. Not a single complaint, we stayed for forever just chatting and having a good time and I am so thankful to Spice Finch for helping us celebrate our friend in the best way possible! I will 100% be back for dinner, I would be a fool to not return over such a stellar brunch experience."
3,"I have literally avoided writing bad reviews during COVID and have been deleting previous ones. But this is the one time I felt let down by Yelp. I came here expecting the 4.5 start experience and got something below mediocre even though we were hungry and would have been easy to impress. Firstly, yes it&apos;s expensive. But I have never had an issue with price when getting something worthwhile. The decor was not mind blowing and neither was the service. It was GOOD. Then comes the menu with &quot;fattoush&quot; and &quot;tabouleh&quot; labels and clear attempts to sound Mediterranean. Tabouleh had broccoli, there was NOTHING tabouleh about it. Would people call a bagel a croissant? Or a burger a philly cheese steak? That&apos;s what this place was doing. It is a little offensive to middle eastern people that food labels would be exploited to that level. There is so much room for creativity when it comes to modernizing traditional dishes but this place was just all over the place. Nothing made sense. The fattoush was literally kale and apples. Fattoush is traditionally a finely chopped salad with cucumbers, tomatoes, parsley, and toasted/ deep friend pita as the essential ingredients then it varies from one Arabic country to another but they ALL drown the salad with olive oil. This salad had no trace of olive oil or fattoush. We liked the idea of the carrot hummus but it tasted like bland purée. There was no texture, it was so runny and just a major fail. I never thought it was possible to screw up hummus, but I guess I was wrong. The cherry on top was that the hummus isn&apos;t served with complimentary pita, we had to order a tiny pita. What are $2 for a fine dining type of restaurant? Why would you even charge your customers for bread? Customers who&apos;d frequent these types of restaurants would be indifferent about an extra $2, but I know it simply does not reflect well on the owners. I wondered if perhaps the owners had ever seen people scoop out hummus with a spoon to eat it? I was very confused. That said, the complimentary side dish of fresh herbs, cucumbers and turnips was a nice touch. Secondly, 3 out of the 4 things we ordered were just drowning in dill. The menu had not mentioned the dill, but I felt like all I could taste was the dill. Garnish in Mediterranean food varies and dill is probably one of the least used herbs for garnish. The fish was the least offensive dish, (the one thing that is served with dill didn&apos;t have dill in it ) but the side of rice which had delicious chopped preserved lemons was drowning in an extremely salty scoop of butter. We had to dump the butter out to be able to enjoy the rice. I couldn&apos;t help but wonder if the restaurant had just run out of olive oil. Lastly, to use the restroom, I had to exit the restaurant, walk through a hotel lobby and use a beat up public bathroom. what kind of a 5 star dining experience makes you use a beat up restroom to wash your hands? I felt like this place was just a bit of a scam.  $100 for the two of us was so not worthwhile - I was genuinely upset for sacrificing my last meal in Philly to a place like this. In summary, if you&apos;re looking for modern Mediterranean cuisine, look up Illili (Manhattan), Albi (DC), or the following places in Philly: Zahav, Surayya, Cafe La Maude, etc."
4,"We loved our experience here and wanted to try it during restaurant week but never got the chance. The venue itself is connected to the Warwick hotel, which is home to a couple other nice restaurants worth checking out as well. The decor was unassuming yet classy and stylish. There was a stellar music selection and the bougie, upscale bar-restaurant ambience set the perfect vibe to enjoy the equally impressive food and drink. Our server was knowledgable about the menu and specials, which is always a plus. We really enjoyed the date-braised lamb which was cooked to perfection, had amazing flavor and was served generously with seasonal vegetables. Though served in measly portions, the trio of dips was really tasty and the pita bread/chip which accompanied were great too! Wish we could&apos;ve gotten to try more of their menu, it was hard to settle and decide as most of the items sounded tempting, but we had no real complaints with our food. Altogether, a worthwhile spot to try when you want to splurge a little and enjoy sophisticated food in a chic space."
2,"Spice Finch serves up good Mediterranean food, albeit at high prices, and with very risqué decor choices.

We came here as a large group for Restaurant Week, and we feasted on many of the different items in the menu. They were all delicious and well-prepared. Portion sizes are a bit smaller, so beware if you&apos;re super hungry. But if you have just a normal hunger level and want something fancier, then the food here will please.

The biggest detractor for me was the fact that there were literally sex scenes covering the entire wall. I found that incredibly inappropriate, and it turned me off the experience. For that reason alone, I don&apos;t plan on returning.

So if you&apos;re looking for expensive but good Mediterranean food, then Spice Finch has what you want - though you&apos;ll need to either get takeout or be comfortable with pornographic wallpaper if you want to enjoy it."
4,"Vibes: cool, casual but sophisticated; can be intimate and romantic but also group-friendly 

Tasting notes:
-Grape leaves: as an appetizer, light, refreshing, but has substance, just a touch sweet; farro is chewy but not too firm
-Muhumara dip: sweet, fragrant from the dill; loved the added crunch from the walnut; flatbread was fluffy, not too dense or thick 
-Peri-Peri Shrimp: comes with flatbread for picking up the soupy, deeply lemon-y sauce; shrimp served whole but head comes off very easily; meat is springy and flavorful 
-Roasted Cauliflower: tender bite, stem is fairly firm; cashew butter adds a unique taste and creaminess especially with the fragrant herb oil 
-Date-Braised Lamb Shank: meat falls off the bone with the lightest fork pull; sauce is fairly salty, recommend mixing it with the accompanying grain salad, which is fluffy with delightful crunchy rice puffs interspersed; loved the roasted, flavorful vegetables; a substantial dish to share among 2-3 people

Other notes:
-Absolutely loved the beautiful glassware and plates
-This set of dishes was satisfying for 3 people
-Besides the lamb shank, the other dishes were appetizer-sized"
4,"Lovely ambience, large space, and a great selection of healthy, fresh Mediterranean dishes to choose from.

I went to Spice Finch during restaurant week, and the $20 three-course lunch deal was more than worthwhile. 
I&apos;d recommend starting out with a mix of the different appetizer sauces (especially the tahina and garlic yogurt), then opting for a flatbread or salad if you&apos;re looking for an entree on the lighter side of things.

The berbere carrot flatbread was filling without being too heavy, and packed with fresh, seasonal vegetables that were perfectly cooked. 

The only part of the meal that failed to impress was the dessert - the chocolate cake was good, but not overly tasty, and the date truffles didn&apos;t wow beyond their strong date flavor - but otherwise a great place to go with a group (if you make a reservation beforehand) or on a slightly more upscale date night."
