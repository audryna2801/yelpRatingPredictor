5,"Fun for kids of all ages including me!

I was thinking this would be another kids friendly place and I would find a chair somewhere to sit and wait.... I was wrong. I ended up having more fun than I originally thought.

Yes it is kids friendly but they are made very well with depth of information. 

My favorite section was about trains. They talked about science behind the train, how it works. I might have known most of the information but it was still fun to read all about trains.

Planetarium was open and play different show hourly. It wasn&apos;t all about stars, I felt like I was just watching an educational show about the planet earth.

They have hand sanitizer and wipes throughout. Staff constantly cleaning every possible place we might have touched. I kept a wipe with me and wiped every place I touched for the next person.

We stayed just about 3 hours but when everything is back open, it will be easy to stay all day."
5,"I was not sure about how it was going to be with Covid19 around.  Well it turned out great!  I have been with my kids before and we had a blast again.  Most of the exhibits/ experiences are open.  Although the planetarium show was running, I missed the IMAX.  I loved the combustion show in the main court as well.  The special exhibit was the Wax museum presidents.  Worth the extra money.  The kids loved it and Harriet Tubman, MLK, Michelle Obama, Beyonce and Bieber, etc, etc.. were also there.  

The food court is closed but google or ask the desk where food is nearby.  Eat outside in the side court of the museum.  There was a few tables inside.

I saw lots of cleaning.  So A+ for that.  Not crowded at all, but it was during the week.  

All in all, a fun day and certainly enough to see and do, to spend the day."
5,"Our wedding at the Franklin Institute was perfect and STUNNING!

My husband and I knew we wanted our wedding to be in Philly because it represents us as a couple since we spend so much time out and about in the city. We have no regrets with choosing the Franklin Institute as our reception venue. It was an amazing night that our guests and we will never forget! 

My Mom and I booked tours at 9 different reception venues in Philly. The Franklin Institute was the first of our 9 visits. As a teacher that has had field trips at the FI, I just wasn&apos;t sure that I wanted to have my wedding at the same location that I&apos;ve brought kindergarteners to for a field trip. Boy am I glad I gave it a chance. After seeing the Franklin Institute on the first day of our first visits, it was clear that every other venue paled in comparison. Sure, there were some beautiful venues but none of them came close to the unique and breathtaking elements that the FI had to offer.

You can have your cocktail hour in the brain which is so unique. We loved that our guests could have an interactive experience! It was really neat for out-of-towners as well as people that just haven&apos;t been to the FI in ages.

The light and sound package can&apos;t be beat! As your guests enter the main dining room, the lights change, a video plays and the whole reception experience transforms right before your eyes. You choose all of your light settings ahead of time and you are able to project any logos, photos or videos that you want! There are engineers on site the night of your wedding to ensure everything is running smoothly. We got lots of compliments on the slideshow we had running throughout the length of the reception.

Even more amazing than the light and sound package?! The GINORMOUS statue of Ben overlooking the most amazing night of your life. 

You can&apos;t get a better dance floor than a true marble floor. We were able to line the stairs with candlelight which looked gorgeous. The chiavari chairs unfortunately aren&apos;t included but they are absolutely worth it and will make your room look amazing!

We had a representative from the FI and one from the catering company that worked together to help us plan our event. On the night of our wedding, we had a bridal attendant that was amazing! She was there for everything we needed the entire night!

We loved that there can only be one wedding per night so everyone was focused on our event and not multitasking with other weddings. 

They validate parking for $7 per car which is amazing considering it&apos;s Philly. Trolleys will drop your guests off at the front steps which makes for an epic entrance!

The bathrooms are pretty ugly since they aren&apos;t a fancy venue but you can do things on your own to give them a personal touch.

There are soooooo many amazing photo opportunities throughout the FI and they give the bride/groom and photographer full access.

Lots of options as far as where you put your bars, your food stations, photo booth, etc. The food is all made from scratch from the Frog Commissary.

We had a few bumps in the road during our two year planning process but overall everything was great; our wedding day was everything we dreamed of and so much more! The Franklin Institute is an amazingly unique venue that you and your guests will rave about. 

Thank you to Gina, Beth and everyone else that helped make our wedding reception the most special, amazing night of our lives. We will never forget it!!!"
3,"This review is solely based on the exhibit &apos;Worst Case Scenario&apos;!  I had the opportunity to get free tickets to check the exhibit out and I was excited!  That excitement quickly left my body when you see many stations where there were &apos;worst case scenarios&apos; (floods; bear or snake attacks) presented and how would you deal with it!  This exhibit is more informational (lots of reading involved) of survival facts and minimal amounts of interactive items!  

The exhibit is geared definitely towards school aged groups...who would enjoy the ball pit and wall climbing (similar to rock wall) because those stations got the juices flowing!  The ball pit simulated being stuck in quick sand and the wall climbing was illustrating could you survive rising flood waters!

I love the Franklin Institute and all exhibits can&apos;t be winners and this one was a miss in my opinion!  

No matter...I will be back for future exhibits!"
4,"It&apos;s nostalgic to enter the Franklin Institute as an adult. It reminds me of when I visited the institute for a field trip as a child. I don&apos;t remember all the bells and whistles but it&apos;s an interesting place for everyone!

This review is based on my last visit, which was for the &quot;Worst-Case Scenario Survival Experience&quot; exhibit. I was a bit excited to see what would happen in a &quot;worst case scenario&quot; and what you should do to get out. In a decent sized location, the exhibit had: information about what you should do &quot;if&quot;..., they had locks you could try to unlock with bobby pins, a section for children to play in balls, you can jump on a display that mimics a moving training, etc. My favorite part of the exhibit was when an actress was portraying that zombies were going to attack! I thought it was going to be people dressed as zombies around the exhibit. Wrong! It was a mini section sit-down on what to do in a zombie apocalypse.

As I mentioned, the Franklin Institute is a pretty cool and interactive place for all ages. Wasn&apos;t too crazy about the exhibit. Wish it had more of a hands-on experience. Overall, I had a nice time."
5,"I love the Franklin institute!  I&apos;m a nerd by day and night and this place satisfies my thrill of science.  I&apos;ve been to the facility about 3 times and I still don&apos;t think I&apos;ve seen everything I wanted to see.  There is so much information in every area.

I&apos;ve gone during the week and on weekends.  Saturday&apos;s are usually PACKED but I went last week Sunday and it was a low volume of people.  I&apos;ve seen the gaming exhibition and worse case scenario exhibition.  They were both interesting, the gaming was interesting to see the history of games but the worst case scenario lacked interactivity.  Not sure what I expected since I&apos;ve been looking forward to it but I left feeling some disappointment.

My absolute favorite area though is the aeronautical section.  I love planes, aerodynamics, and flying!  So this was where I spent the majority of my time."
5,"Been here twice so far..love it every time!

I visit from Jersey and also work in the museum world. So I&apos;m always critical of science centers and museums. But I love the Franklin! Layout is nice, exhibits are always great, etc. 

I&apos;m a nerd so..museums are just my thing. I noticed 2 differences since my last visit 2 years ago. They got rid of the bicycle over the main forum/ticketing area &amp; the tech/3D printer type studio turned into a whole floor section which was more interactive. No issues with the changes but thought it was interesting! 

Each museum operates differently but Franklin definitely has something great to offer always."
4,"Heard about the &quot;Survival Experience&quot; at the Franklin Institute and decided to go with my daughter (on 12/26).  Had never been to this Museum as a child and wanted to experience it. 

The Survival Experience is an interactive exhibit on surviving different scenarios.  Some of the interactive stations: &quot;how to unlock a lock with a bobby pin&quot;, &quot;scaling a wall horizontally during rising floodwaters&quot;, &quot;how the mind adjust playing tic tac toe upside down&quot;. 

If you go, pay to see the entire museum.  The Survival Experience exhibit alone is not worth the money.  Me and favorite daughter learned a lot by touring the Human Heart, Flight Simulator, The Brain, Sports Zone.  All are a part of the admissions to the museum. 

This is one I can check off my bucket list."
3,"Walking back into the Franklin Institute as an adult certainly brought back some memories and nostalgic feelings of past class field trips and Girl Scout outings. The Franklin institute was exactly the same as when I was in here 10+ years ago. To say the least, it&apos;s definitely in need of a revamping. 

My boyfriend and I had tickets to the Worst Case Scenario exhibit. It was interesting, but I wouldn&apos;t say it was worth the extra fee. We were in and out of it in about 10 minutes. 

We enjoyed walking around and looking at the exhibits, especially the classic heart of course! Many of the exhibits were dirty or the interactive parts were broken. It made it seem like the upkeep of this museum just wasn&apos;t really there. 

On a positive note, I had my service dog in training with me and I had absolutely no access issues. It was a great training experience for him altogether. Also, the music in the parking garage was GREAT (haha)."
4,"I&apos;ve been to the Franklin Institute a TON of times. Growing up it was the best place for field trips and Saturday trips from the suburbs into town. They have so many interactive experiences which makes for a really exciting time when you are a kid.

In recent years I&apos;ve been intrigued by their feature exhibits and equally enjoyed my time in the museum as an adult. Some things are just as fun as an adult especially the giant heart. 

Most recently I went to the Worst-case Scenario: Survival Experience. I think it was more geared towards children - I kept thinking how much fun I would&apos;ve had as a child. I wouldn&apos;t suggest going to this unless you are bringing someone under the age of 12."
3,"I would give 3.5 stars if possible. I&apos;ve visited here several times primarily to see their traveling exhibits like Mummies, Dead Sea Scrolls, and most recently the Worst Case Scenario exhibit. I felt that recent one missed the mark. The coolest part was learning how to pick a lock, but the other parts were just quick walk thru with not a lot of information. You could easily breeze through it in 15 minutes. We walked around after and while the information is great, the museum need a face-lift. It&apos;s dated and doesn&apos;t feel like any vast improvements have been made over the last 10 years. 

It&apos;s a must-go to place for kids, they love playing in the heart and pushing all the buttons on the interactive displays, but some buttons don&apos;t work anymore. I wouldn&apos;t go all the way into the city from the burbs, definitely pair it with another fun thing to do. There&apos;s other places nearby to pop in and make a day of it."
4,"My husband and I have visited a few times over the last few years for different speakers, events, and special exhibits. For the most part, we have enjoyed our visits, however, we have experienced days where some exhibits seem to need repairs or updating.

For this review, I will primarily focus on our most recent visit to the Worst Case Scenario special exhibit. The Franklin Institute is known as a science museum targeted towards children, but many of the exhibits, including this one, can be enjoyed by all. The exhibit is based on a book by Philadelphia authors for Y2K. 

As you enter the exhibit, you can read about some Worst Case Scenarios that people have survived and how. After that, it&apos;s primarily a hands on, interactive exhibit. You can practice scaling a wall, simulate jumping between trains, learn to pick locks, and dive into a massive ball pit (we avoided as 1. we are adults and way bigger than those enjoying it and 2. it&apos;s flu season). 

As we walked through the exhibit, we saw scout troops enjoying taking in all the information and practicing their new skills- this is the perfect exhibit for little adventure seekers. 

The cost is a bit much, even the upcharge for members, but we understand the cost of maintaining the museum. You can easily get an entire day of entertainment for your children from the museum, especially on those cold winter school holidays. They also host community nights, so be sure to check the website before you go."
3,"*** This review is strictly for the Worst-Case Scenario Survival Experience ***

The Franklin Institute is beautiful.. right when you walk in you&apos;re greeted with the moon and none other than Benjamin Franklin himself.

I received some free tickets from Yelp.. so thank you as always for taking care of your Yelpers!! So I was excited to check it out as I&apos;ve never been to The Franklin Institute yet. But the Worst-Case Scenario was geared more for kids 12 and below I&apos;d say. So if you have kids and have a few hours in the city to spend some time learning and trying your hands on some activities, this is the exhibit for you! I guess I thought there would be more hands on activities to try and be able to choose what to do in certain situations. It just felt like I was there reading the book out loud instead of sitting at home.

It was organized nice inside though. I went on a Sunday in the afternoon at around 2 and it wasn&apos;t crowded at all. So that was good because you could really take your time. 
Some activities there:
- there was this scale the wall activity that you tried to scale across with the scenario of escaping a flood or you&apos;re scaling the side of the building
- picking a lock! I was disappointed I didn&apos;t succeed haha.. but makes me want to get a lock and practice. Wish there was someone there to show you how to do it
- jumping on a platform simulating jumping from train to train. It didn&apos;t really do anything lol.. I thought it would be shaking and unsteady.. it really wasn&apos;t
- big ball pit to jump in. I thought this was kinda funny because it was right after the germ information and I&apos;m pretty sure this was germ infested haha!

We got through it pretty fast and I just remember thinking.. was that it?? I saw lots of kids enjoying themselves... so it might have been worth it if you had kids. I didn&apos;t check to see how much tickets were but for adults I thought I saw it was close to $30! So I&apos;m glad I got to try this experience for free!

Again thank you Yelp!! I will definitely be returning to check out more exhibits here because the museum is really beautiful!"
3,"Franklin Institute was a definitely bucket list item for wife and I while here in Philly.

There are several educational resources about Benjamin Franklin and famous scientists throughout history. We thought there would be a few more hands on exercises and simulations for adults (less paper airplanes, ball pits, and static electricity science project, etc.).

To be clear, it&apos;s a great spot with plenty of family friendly activities throughout the museum exhibits. I&apos;d actually say that it&apos;s a more exciting opportunity for younger audiences.

Unless taking young kids or friends, I likely wouldn&apos;t return at the current price ($30). However, keep your eyes out for the special touring  exhibits if there&apos;s one that you&apos;re really interested in viewing."
5,"In December, I decided to take my class on a field trip to the Franklin Institute. It was my first time here in a long time but not much had changed. They had a little bit of everything to create a fun and interactive learning experience for my students. They enjoyed exploring the heart, learning about and exploring electricity, learning about how erosion works and enjoyed the VR exhibit. Their favorite part was the sports area where they learned more about the science of sports. For the most part, the Franklin Institute made it easy to check in and store our lunches in a private lunch area. A lot of work went into the trip but it was worth it. Unless you park on the property, parking can be a little tricky."
4,"This is one of those places that could easily get a 5 star rating  because of the diversity of things to see and do but in reality it falls between a 3 and a 4.  As it was when I was a kid, many things don&apos;t work when you push the button or touch the screen. At the price they charge for entry they should ensure that a higher percentage of things actually work.  

The food court is overpriced and not very good. We usually go to a local restaurant to eat and then come back in. 

It&apos;s still worth a visit. Where else can a kid sit in a real jet plane or climb into the cab of a giant steam locomotive?"
4,"You are a Marvel fan.... you don&apos;t want to miss this special exhibition!!! This is always a popular place for school field trip. This museum is very well maintained. 

Several museums in the neighborhood, all walking distance. If you are in the Philly, definitely check out this museum!!"
3,I really didn&apos;t know what I was getting into by visiting The Franklin Institute. It&apos;s a science museum for kids. If you have kids then by all means visit. If you don&apos;t have kids this might not be for you. It was not for me. I did enjoy the planetarium show though. I may have taken a little snooze during part of it but it was relaxing and silent in there. The food choices here are fine if you have the palate of a seven year old but if you don&apos;t you might want to eat elsewhere.
5,"Believe the hype. This is one of the coolest museums I&apos;ve ever been to. It was amazing when I was a kid and we took field trips. Somehow it&apos;s gotten more fun!

Sometimes they have stuff that isn&apos;t super interactive which isn&apos;t as cool as the brain or the heart. But those two things are always there for you. So be sure to see everything. Not just whatever event. 
Also their night sky events on the rooftop are so cool. You go up there and look at stars through telescopes and drink wine. There are people there to explain what you see. 

Be sure to get space ice cream."
5,"Absolutely wonderful!

We came here because I got my hands on some free tickets through YELP so me, the husband and our 2 kids (3 &amp; 5) made the trek down to Philly to experience some science. We ended up being here for HOURS. We saw almost everything there and enjoyed every inch of this museum, even my kids! There is ALOT of hands on things for the kids. Lots of buttons to push and such. My personal favorite portion was the sports area. When I asked my 5 year old what his favorite part was he said &quot;everything!&quot; We also really enjoyed the planetarium. There is truly something for everyone here. Exhibits on: the brain, heart, electricity, the earth, space, general mechanics, and IMAX theater...I can&apos;t even name it all!

We also did go to the special exhibit at the time which was called &quot;Worst Case Scenario&quot;....we could have done without that. They only cool thing in there was the enormous ball pit for the kids to play in. Other than that, that exhibit requires a lot of reading (which we couldn&apos;t do because our kids are running all over). Maybe if we didn&apos;t have the kids and had time to read everything I would have taken more away from this exhibit. 

The only &apos;downfall&apos; was we went on a weekday and you WILL run into school groups and they can be very annoying. They come in quickly and take over an exhibit, slamming buttons, general loudness....do your best to avoid them.

We will definitely be back again someday!!!"
