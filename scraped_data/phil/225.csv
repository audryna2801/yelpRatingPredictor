5,"Outdoor dining for COVID, vegan and GF options.  It is a place my whole family enjoys!"
5,Amazing! Veg combination has lots of flavor at a reasonable price as well. Most Ethiopian places are very expensive. The staff is super friendly and there is small seating outside and plenty of room inside.
4,Almaz serves up delicious Ethiopian cuisine from a sizable menu of options. The lamb tibs were tasty though a bit tough. My friend got the chicken which was scrumptious. The restaurant interior is cozy and a bit diner-esque. It was fun to be able to see into the kitchen and watch the chef work. Overall a nice Ethiopian hole-in-the-wall for next time you&apos;re in the mood for meat and veggies over injera.
5,Their veggie combo is an absolutely delicious vegan option! Love coming here the staff is always so sweet.
2,"Solid 2.5 stars!

Never a good sign when you walk into a restaurant and there&apos;s no one dining there. 

Pros: Clean restaurant, 2 story so lots of seatings available, fast service. 

Cons: injera was too sour, to a point where it&apos;s inedible. Chicken stew was decent but chicken was dry and over cooked. Vegetarian platter wasn&apos;t good, bland. The food came out too quick, not a good sign. 

Overall, I expected so much from this place. I love Ethiopian cuisine and dine in one in my hometown but this was far from perfection."
4,"4.3/5

Pretty good! Not as &quot;traditional&quot; of an interior as other Ethiopian places I&apos;ve been to, but the food is tasty. 

We got a vegetarian combo and the Doro Wat (chicken stew), and shared between us -- I definitely recommend doing that if you&apos;re eating with multiple people, so that you get to try as many things as possible! I was partial to the veggie sampler myself, and especially enjoyed the lentil-based options. They also provide a lot of injera, and the lady who was there when we went was really nice!"
4,"I was running and passed this cafe and noticed the sandwich board advertised Ethiopian coffee. I finished the run and walked back to this little place. Coming from West Philly I live in heart of delicious Ethiopian restaurants and never realized that this little place existed. The place itself is lovely. Sweet little spot...clean, brightly colored and a big lovely window. I was picking my kid up from theater class so I ordered two smoothies to go. They were delicious. The service was spectacular and I was served with a smile. Their menu looks great. A mix of American breakfast, sandwiches and a full Ethiopian menu as well. I&apos;m looking forward to trying more. I&apos;ll be back."
3,"Food is tasty, less oily than other Ethiopian food I&apos;ve eaten. I liked that they were adventurous with some of their dishes. I had the veggie combo and one of the options were sauteed beets which I had never had.  My husband was disappointed that they didn&apos;t have a meat combo. Very friendly service. Restaurant is tiny."
4,"Pretty good overall, and a bit of a hidden treasure. One of the few (perhaps the only?) Ethiopian restaurants in Center City. Also has American food and wraps, breakfast, etc., but you should mostly come for the coffee and Ethiopian foods. Seldom crowded, but should be more so. Food can take a bit of time to come out.

Good options:

American Food; BBQ Chicken Wrap

Ethiopian Food: Firfir, Chicken Stew, Misir (lentils), Kik-Alchia (peas), Vegetarian Combo, Foule."
5,"It was delightful. We came as a send off of a family member who is a vegan. She likes this place. She ordered the vegetable combination platter which has different lentils and beets. It looked good. My platter had a few of the same sides so I didn&apos;t bother to dive into her dish. 

I shared three orders of meat (chicken stew, beef stew and lamb tips). And it was good. The waitress stated that with the order of 3 meats we can get more vegetables. I&apos;m not sure if we got &apos;more&apos;, but what we had was enough. We ended up with collard greens, cabbage, lentils and beets w/potatoes. I enjoyed the cabbage. It&apos;s crunchy! The beef stew was served over rice and YES this was my favorite of the night. But over all everything was good. I did not get the spicy kick I was expecting, but the food paired well with my wine. And yes we tried to eat traditionally, but that was hard to do. 

We also tried the coffee, as I read all the tips, my cafe latte was good. But the coffee itself black was smooth. 

I love that&apos;s it&apos;s BYOB. Small restaurant and simple. Our waitress was very helpful and suggested anything with lamb (the people&apos;s choice), Although that&apos;s not her favorite in the menu. Also, there are at least 2 parking lots across the street. Enjoy!"
4,"Came here with a couple of friends for dinner. I don&apos;t eat a lot of Ethiopian food; this was my second time, but it&apos;s always a fun experience. I do agree that the injera tastes sour but I also don&apos;t know what authentic injera tastes like. Between the 4 of us, we had the vegetarian combo, the doro wat (chicken stew) and yebege aleche (curry lamb cubes). The food was fine but service was top notch. The owner and the staff were very nice and hospitable; they kept refilling our waters and checking on us. If you want to make reservations, they&apos;re not on opentable so just call in advance. It&apos;s BYOB but keep in mind there&apos;s a $5 corking fee."
5,"I am a slow convert to Ethiopian food, starting with a spontaneous visit to a spot in D.C. and basically came back home and craved Injera. Almaz Cafe is accessible, and honestly has a great deal of food for the price. I&apos;ve had their Firfir as well as the vegetarian combo and I have no complaints. I think both are very newbie friendly than some of the other options, and I feel like are the most popular here. The service is really quick, and if you&apos;re just looking to order for takeout it&apos;s a pretty simple process. 

The only real issue is the size of the establishment as there&apos;s really only seating on the loft and the very side of the first floor, which happens to be right next to the door. There are other tables but they hold them off for potential reservations, so I would suggest maybe making a reservation if you really want to come here, which I really do recommend. The staff is very nice and I would probably spend all of my money here!"
5,"Almaz really is a small cafe.  Walking it, i had to ask if food was served beyond the delicious looking pastries, coffees, and smoothies promoted at the &quot;bar&quot; area. The restaurant features loft area dining for roughly 8-10 people, in addition to the cozy first floor seating.  My selection was prepared in a satisfactory time period and delivered to me as I sat in the window and people watched.  I thoroughly enjoyed my veggie combination and Keye Wot (beef stew), which I surprisingly ate completely....  Now I&apos;m filled and ready to sleep!"
5,"As any keen eyed reader will observe, we in the Publius household enjoy Ethiopian food.

I first enjoyed Almaz Cafe way back in the spring of 2008 (I believe it had recently opened). Imagine our surprise when we found it was still there and serving delicious, home style Ethiopian cuisine.

Of course we recently stopped in- we had beef tibs (forgetting the name) and a combination of their vegetarian dishes. If you eat meat, I recommend ordering this way.

Food was delicious- fresh and flavorful. Injera was nice and sour but not at all dried out. The service was warm and welcoming. The place is very casual but honestly I&apos;ve never been to any formal Ethiopian restaurant, so no concerns.

Recommended!"
4,"Quaint little cafe that my friends and I almost walked past, but I&apos;m glad we didn&apos;t! 

I didn&apos;t ask for much but man oh man, I got plenty!! I ordered a coffee milkshake... from first sip, I&apos;m head over heels for it! The milkshake doesn&apos;t come dressed up with fancy whip cream but it&apos;s worth the $5 off taste alone."
5,"I&apos;ve walked past Almaz Cafe dozens of times, but had no idea it was an Ethiopian restaurant! Located conveniently on 20th and Walnut, right by Rittenhouse Square, this cozy place is definitely a hidden gem amongst the more popular places in the area. 

A friend and I came here on a Saturday night and split the Dora Tibs (strips of chicken saut√©ed with onions and tomatoes) as well as the vegetarian platter (a sampling of all of their vegetarian dishes - highly recommend!) Served with extra injera (spongy, sourdough pancake) on the side, it was more than enough food for the two of us to share. Of the five or six veggie dishes, my favorite was the Tikil Gomen (yellow split pea) and the Shiro (legumes) but loved trying everything. I am definitely interested in a beef or lamb dish in the future!

The prices may seem high ($14-16ish) and Ethiopian food may seem intimidating if you&apos;ve never had it before, but the portion size, friendly staff, and of course good food will convince you otherwise."
5,I&apos;ve been coming here for years. Very friendly family owned staff. The owners will do anything for the customers and it&apos;s a great example of a small business catering to its customers. The food is fresh and prepared on site. The firfir is delicious. Support local businesses in philly!
5,"I&apos;ve eaten here several times. My takeout is always packed mindfully with care to detail, neatly wrapped in plastic wrap with the fork wetnap and &quot;thank you&quot; mint nicely centered underneath. It feels touched with love, and that means a lot to me.

Everyone who works here is very, very kind and gentle. The food is reliably delicious and fresh, the portions are great. I feel the prices are reasonable for the portions and area - my takeout entree always comes with two sides.

I think their injera is mad yum. To each their own I suppose!

Is it Abyssinia? As a fellow West Philly dweller, well, no. But bottom line - The best self care food experience I&apos;ve found in this part of the city."
4,"Solid Ethiopian place a few blocks from Rittenhouse square, which is great since I feel that overall the ethnic food options in the nearby area is a bit lacking. It&apos;s never been too busy, so it&apos;s easy to find a seat. I&apos;ve been 3 times, and between two people, we often share two items. My go-tos are the Doro Tibs (chicken breast) and Vegetarian combo! The Injera is nice and spongy, and not too sour in my opinion though some other people have commented on that. Although I&apos;ve had better Ethiopian (Dukem in the DC area), this is a reliable option if you are craving Ethiopian in the area! Prices are a touch on the higher side, but the portions are decent!"
3,"Decent Ethiopian food, but not astounding.  The injera was overwhelmingly sour, which threw off the whole meal.  The lentils were good, but the other vegetables tasted more or less the same.  The night we went it was a bit short staffed, so we walked downstairs and paid at the counter.  Overall, wouldn&apos;t go back again."
