5,"The service at on point is amazing and they know how to elevate breakfast food! I called this On Point Bistro as a walk in and the service was very accommodating. They fit me in around reservations even though they were very busy. 

After sitting down we ordered a speciality gnocchi and eggs and huevos rancheros. Both were spectacular! I highly recommend both. 

I have lived in Philly for 3 years and I just found my new favorite breakfast spot! 

The experience was so good it made my day!"
5,"Michelle was so friendly. 

Took a quick trip for work and had a lot of trouble navigating the city,  the plus part was I discovered this gem. 

Michelle greeted us quickly and was helpful in entertaining our questions about the current COVID restrictions in the city along with some great tips of places to check out. 

She made a recommendation on the menu and they made some edits to easily accommodate my food allergy. 

The food was great, coffee tasty and the outside table was a nice change from being cooped up indoors. 

A BIG THANKS to Michelle and the chef for making our experience so fun. 

Oh, and it&apos;s byob ... you can&apos;t get what sounds like a fantastic Bloody Mary there but we weren&apos;t equipped with the proper alcohol to make one so I guess I&apos;ll just have to make another trip."
5,"It&apos;s been a while since my last review for On Point when they first popped up in Point Breeze. Since that time, they&apos;ve become one of my go-to delivery spots, typically for breakfast/brunch. Their omelettes are simply fantastic; I wish I knew how to make eggs like that! The huevos rancheros dish is great as well; there is so much flavor and the restaurant puts sauce on the side when you get delivery which is really helpful. 

Before the pandemic, I met a friend for lunch and tried the falafel pita - it was awesome and I&apos;ve been wanting to get it again ever since! 

My only suggestion would be to add more options to the create-your-own omelet when ordering delivery. I would love to see pico de gallo and beans as an add-in, since they already have them in other dishes on the menu. Or maybe even a new, Mexican-style omelet option? Either way, love this spot and will continue to support them from afar until it&apos;s safe to dine in again!"
4,"Enjoyed dining here and BYOB with no corkage fee was a bonus. Nice, quiet atmosphere.  My husband said the lamb burger was quite good. The brussels sprouts appetizer was somewhat greasy but tasty overall. I&apos;m not used to having falafel chopped up, but the falafel wrap had delicious flavor and the fries were great.
The food was good but missing a star because the service was sub par. The waitress seamed rushed. After receiving our meals she followed up several minutes later by mouthing &quot;OK?&quot; from afar while walking to another customer&apos;s table. She took my husband&apos;s plate away while I was still eating my meal and then dropped off the check while I was still eating. It was kind of awkward and we felt rushed, despite them being open for another hour and a half.
We will definitely return but hope that the service will be better next time."
4,"There wasn&apos;t anything that wasn&apos;t &quot;on point&quot; about my experience here yesterday. 

I met up with some girlfriends around 11:15 for an outdoor brunch. When we arrived, we were shown to our table and the hostess let us know about the new COVID procedures that were in place and also pointed out where the restroom was. The place was packed, both inside and outside, but the staff did an amazing job at keeping everyone distanced properly. 

I started off with a coffee -- cream and sugar were provided on the side. Free refills! When the last person in our party arrived, she arrived with champagne, so we asked for a pitcher of OJ and flutes to get the mimosas flowing. I love that On Point is a BYOB establishment. It couldn&apos;t have been more perfect. 

I ordered the avocado toast. Typically, avo toast isn&apos;t my first choice when I dine out, but this one sounded intriguing. It came topped with two poached eggs and the bread was thick and buttery. The mashed avocado was creamy and piled high on the bread. It paired very well with my mimosas! 

We were initially told there was a time limit at the table and I know for sure we exceeded the allotted 90 minutes, but it was nice that the waitress wasn&apos;t pushy or forceful about us getting up and leaving. It wasn&apos;t until she brought the bill that she said a party of 4 needed our table in ten minutes. 

It was great to enjoy brunch in Point Breeze on a 75Â° day in November. I&apos;m interested in returning to try the items on their dinner menu."
3,"Classic little brunch spot in the city. The place was generally empty, the service was good and quick. The brunch food was average. The breakfast sandwich was big but lacked any unique flavors. The Philly cheesesteak omelet was also similar in flavor and lacked any unique flavor."
5,"Hands down my husband&apos;s and my favorite brunch spot in Philly. The dining room is very clean and the food exceeded all our expectations. We got the turkey club, breakfast burger, and challah french toast. Would recommend this to anyone easily! Try On Point, you won&apos;t regret it!"
4,"Tasty brunch for pick up this weekend. Got to sample a few things on the menu. Although the idea of eggs was interesting for take out, I really did enjoy my poached eggs, chicken and waffle. Waffle was cinnamon but a little floppy, but the chicken was perfectly cooked and flavored. Huevos rancheros came with hard tortillas but lots of guacamole, salsa, and seasoning. I heard the omelets and potatoes were good as well. Would most definitely try more items here, as they were great in transit, stayed warm, were tasty and were obviously fresh. Made with love!"
5,"I yelp&apos;ed this restaurant while in Philly because I needed some GOOD food for brunch.  This place was ON POINT!!! Omg!!! Omg!!! Omg!!!  Make a reservation so that you don&apos;t have a long wait. It&apos;s a BYOB so be sure to bring your favorite bottle of champs or vino. 
We had a lovely table outside that was sanitized.  Our server, who&apos;s also the manager was lovey!!!   I order mixed green salad to start and the steak and eggs for my main. So good, so good.   Great prices! Very clean Excellent service.  I wish I lived in Philly because I&apos;d eat here at least once a week or more.  Thanks On point and thanks Yelp fam!!!!"
5,"Outside dining in the winter is something I hope continues post-covid. On a brisk day with the help of a heat lamp, my friend and I had a blast! We enjoyed a light brunch with burrata, toast, coffee, salad, and french toast! The staff was friendly, the food was fresh, and our experience was lovely. There are some menu items that I think are a bit more expensive that necessary (even before covid), but the food will always be good!"
4,"Brunch is one of my favorite meals, specifically  any type of breakfast food. I love how each restaurant has their unique take on the classics. I&apos;m open minded and I like to try them all. So, I got 4 things: Farm Omelette, Chicken and Waffles, Pancakes, and Challah French Toast. All were delicious! The cheesy omelette and home fries hit the spot. The pancakes were simple, executed well, and the berry compote really brought it together. The sweet potato waffles were good, but the chicken was a little dry. The French toast with the mascarpone and delicious pecan butter took the cake!

Overall:
Farmhouse Omelette 4/5
Sweet Potato Waffle and Chicken 3/5
Pancakes 4/5
French Toast 5/5"
5,I&apos;ve been in Philly for two years looking for the best burger and I&apos;ve finally found it. Got the on point burger and was blown away by the crisp of of the lettuce and tomato along with the flavor of the beef. Get it with bacon and damn!....those fries were crispy and garnished perfectly. Best value in Philly. Service was shockingly friendly for this city.
5,"We go here pretty often and never disappointed. Today we had the avocado toast and bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich. Both were incredible. Both of these dishes are more complex and delicious than their normal counterparts without giving up what you love about them. Also, the service is always top notch. Everyone is friendly and helpful and ready to make sure your experience is great."
4,"I stopped here for Saturday brunch on a nice July summer day. There is outdoor seating but I sat inside by the window. Service was quick and friendly. I was seated right away, my order was taken quickly, and the food was on the table soon after. I ordered the challah french toast with bacon. It came with plenty of butter and syrup. The bacon was cooked perfectly and the French toast was delicious.  I tasted my friend&apos;s home fries and they were good too. I could see that her over easy eggs were cooked perfectly. They serve brunch every day except monday,  so almost any day a brunch craving hits On Point is open and would be a good choice to satisfy that need."
4,Such good quality. Turkey club was to die for with the bacon glaze. Very highly reccomended.
4,"My experience here today was not the greatest. 

First we were told they were &quot;fully booked&quot; with reservations, however only 2 tables were occupied out of 6. The host ended up being able to accommodate us which was great but the service was really slow. Next, our server greets a table that was sat after us and took a long time to take our order. It was hard to find the server most of our dining experience, however the food here is really good. 

I tried to be to understanding given the circumstances, however I do not think I would return to this business. The rating is solely for the food alone."
5,"Great experience all around, from the service to the food itself. 
My boyfriend and I sat outside since it wasn&apos;t too cold, and there was a table already set for two. It was quieter than inside also. Huzzah for no wait times!
My chicken and waffles were amazing! My man got the breakfast burger, which looked awesome. 
I love that this place is byob. Boy, does that save on brunch costs!
They use La Colombe coffee, I believe it was the dark roast, Corsica, which is one of my favorites. Brewed to perfection. The staff were super friendly.
We will definitely be back soon. I&apos;m glad Point Breeze is finally getting more quality establishments such as On Point!"
5,"I have been here twice now and both times have had such good breakfasts, I can&apos;t wait to get back!    Last time six of us visited and each meal was delish!   My avocado toast was probably the best I have had, not sure what they season it with but it&apos;s good.  It normally comes with a poached egg, which I&apos;m not a fan of so I asked for a fried egg.  It was so good.  Also ordered a side of their potatoes which are too die for.  Burgers, sweet potato waffle and turkey club so good! The food is just good! Service also was too."
4,"We had a lovely birthday dinner for my mom-in-law at this spot in Point Breeze.

Our server was really nice, and as we arrived in waves, she was sure to inform everyone of the specials when they sat down.

The restaurant had plenty of seating at 6pm on a Thursday, and we were able to get a reservation with no problem.

It&apos;s a BYOB, and they also had a nice selection of bottled drinks as supplemental (no fountain soda.) They were a little weird when my mother-in-law asked for hot water, and they said they had to charge her for tea...

We started with the fried brussels sprouts, which were divine.

I got the roasted chicken with carrots and mashed potatoes, which was filling, but not overwhelming. The chicken was perfectly cooked. My husband and his sister also got the cobb salad, which had a grilled chicken that was also delicious. The salads were great, and my sister-in-law also tried the French onion soup, which she enjoyed! Brother-in-law got a nice burger, which was standard, but exactly how he ordered it.

One note: they don&apos;t have a vestibule, so sitting close to the door in the winter is a bit rough!

We did really enjoy our meal here, and we will be back if we were going to be hanging out close by!"
5,On Point Bistro is so awesome. I only had very high expectations only because I&apos;ve heard so much about On Point Bistro. One of the absolute best dishes that I have ever had was Huevos Rancheros. Team was very sweet and helpful in every way possible. Can not wait to come back to On Point Bistro. Definitely recommending to others.
