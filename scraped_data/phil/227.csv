4,"I have always loved Green Eggs Café!! I used to eat there in my early days of Nursing and took the majority of my coworkers and family to eat breakfast and|or brunch.

The food is always great and they have very healthy portions. I used to (and still do) tell people if they ate at Green Eggs Café, then they wouldn&apos;t need to eat for the rest of the day.

As their reputation grew, so did the people wanting to eat there. They have many locations, but it&apos;s something about the original spot. Now I can only eat here occasionally.

Today, I woke up and decided to treat myself to brunch. I arrived, gave my name to the hostess and waited outside. I was a party of one and I stood outside for nearly an hour, while parties of two and three (especially some who arrived after me) were seated first. How hard is it to accommodate ONE person. IDK

Anyway, once I was seated, I was ready to place my order because I knew what I wanted. I&apos;m a French Toast person and if it&apos;s on the menu that&apos;s what I order.

My brunch consisted of:

Large Orange Juice x1

Apple Jacks French Toast -- Sofitel bread, dipped in creme brûlée batter, coated with crushed Apple Jacks cereal, topped with Apple Jacks anglaise, cinnamon walnut caramel sauce, chantilly cream, and diced Granny Smith apples

Eggs Your Way -- Three farm fresh eggs served with toasted bread and your choice of breakfast meat

Normally they also bring you a glass of water, but the restaurant was pretty busy so I didn&apos;t ask. The servers were there if I needed them but didn&apos;t hover.

All in all I will always return to this location. I may have to wake up extra early and get there before they open so that I l&apos;m not waiting long."
4,"One of my more favorite brunch places in the city. Have had the egg white omelette with veggies ($14) and the Creme Brûlée French Toast ($15). The French toast was delicious; made of challah  bread (best way to do it in my opinion) and had a delicious vanilla bean custard and berry combo on top! I will forever think $15 for French toast/$14 for an omelette is border line ridiculous(but it&apos;s the standard in any brunch place in the city let&apos;s be real). 
Be ware it is CASH ONLY (which truly just bothers me in this day in age)"
4,"The location in Northern Liberties is right on 2nd and in walking distance from my apartment, dangerous! The interior is clean, with potted greenery on each table. We went on a Friday morning, and did not have to wait for a table. I do know that it gets crowded on the weekends and wait time varies. Service was perfect, no issues at all!

To drink, I opted for the Nutella latte, just do it! So yummy, with that hazelnut taste you crave. You can get it iced or hot, but on this below freezing morning, I chose hot! For breakfast, I got the special benedict which was &quot;croque madame&quot;. Basically a grilled ham and cheese with poached eggs on top, what could be better?! So delicious, and the eggs were poached perfectly. You get a choice of fruit, grits (for an upcharge) or breakfast potatoes (with onions/peppers or rosemary). I chose the potatoes with onions/peppers, however some of my potatoes weren&apos;t cooked all the way through. No biggie, I was completely full from my huge benedict!"
4,"Went in for brunch. The initial wait time was 20 minutes but we were seated sooner than that. The food was good, and the servers were very friendly. The only complaint we had was that it seemed a little chaotic and disorganized. They brought us the wrong food initially and didn&apos;t realize until we asked. When we were leaving, they got us a box for our food leftovers but then took the food. We understood since it was very busy, but could be better organized. Overall a positive experience."
5,"We have been to Green Eggs Cafe a few times, and it never disappoints!  They have a wide variety of brunch items to please anyone, from sweet to savory and everything in between.

I got the Kitchen Sink, which was an amazing combination of eggs, sausage, potatoes, peppers, onions, and gruyere cheese all cooked together in a skillet, topped with a biscuit and sausage gravy. The flavors worked amazing together, and the portion size was generous!  I didn&apos;t get it this time, but their cookie dough French toast is also amazing!

And don&apos;t forget, they have La Colombe coffee, which makes the experience even better!"
4,"On one of the hottest days of the year so far, I walked inside this location and experienced pure bliss for an hour. The only reason I took off a star is because of the wait-time to order, and the wait time to get your food on a not-so-busy day. Also, with how expensive it is, cash only doesn&apos;t make a lot of sense, but once a year I allow myself to throw all of my dollars at large platters, sweet breakfasts, and giant burgers. I got the chicken and waffle, which was tender and sweet and tangy all at once, with a deliciously creamy side of grits. The burger was stacked with bacon, sauces, and came with a giant side of fries that didn&apos;t even come close to being finished! 

This place is packed on the weekends, but on weekdays during breakfast/brunch time, you&apos;ll have a little room to spread out."
4,"The food is FANTASTIC I&apos;ve loved everything I&apos;ve gotten here (been multiple times, tried lots of the food) from the kitchen sink to the cookie dough stuffed French bread. Delicious. There&apos;s no reservations though so sometimes you have to wait a while to be seated and they only take cash so you definitely have to plan in advance (unless you want ATM fees). But it&apos;s obvious why people wait... for the food!!"
5,"Cash only!! Good breakfast menu. Lunch menu served all day. Ordered Guacamole and Pepper Benedict and Vegetarian burger with spanish fries. Both were good specially the veggie burger patty made of oats, beans etc. Good service. Creme Brulee Latte was really delicious"
5,"This great local favorite gets crowded early. One taste of their food and you will understand why. Everything is made fresh from locally sourced suppliers. Lively energetic atmosphere in the heart of the city. This is a cash only operation so make sure you stop at an atm before visiting. If not, there is an atm located inside. There is seating both inside and outside.

We started our breakfast with the cafe bom bom. This is expresso layered with condensed milk which makes for an orgasmic experience. I ordered the peach steal cut oatmeal with fresh peaches and Chantilly cream. It was delightfully sweet with the perfect balance of cream in an ideal portion size.  My husband ordered the kitchen sink which seams to be a local favorite. This egg dish had everything and came served on a hot skillet. Bring champagne to make your own mimosas and enhance your experience. 

This fantastic experience had made this eatery one of our top ten breakfast places to celebrate a special occasion or enjoy a fantastic meal while taking in the city vibe."
4,"Ive been to this exact green eggs before and it was a totally different experience this time I went. I believe because I went closer to the closing time everything seemed more relaxed and way better. I order the Mac and cheese with buffalo chicken. The presentation was amazing which also makes the food experience more enjoyable. I do believe the cheese was liquid which is not what I am use to I think creating a 4 cheese sauce broiling it and then having a little cheese on top with parsley as a garnish would make this a stable here. I also tried the French toast which were great a little on the sweeter side. John front end manager was pleasant and was visiting every table which is always great to see. I would recommend this particular location because there is an outside seating area, parking in front and across the street and it doesn&apos;t feel overcrowded as other green eggs location.

P.S- there need to be a greeen eggs option on the menu as this is the name of the restaurant!
J"
4,"Delicious! I think this is the biggest of the locations. The omelette we got was good however we just wished the cheese was on the inside instead of on top. Also we got the cookie dough stuffed French toast which was very good but also extremely sweet!!!! If you don&apos;t like very sweet breakfast foods I would consider a different option! 

There is parking right in front of this location, in addition to all around the block. The staff is very nice and friendly and attentive. Overall, enjoyed the place and it&apos;s reasonable prices!"
5,"Exceptional service, food that is tantalizing for your taste buds and a menu that offers something for even the most discerning foodies!!! When I come here I usually order my favorite, Creme Brulee French Toast, but today I decided to try something new and I ordered Chorizo Eggs Benedict. It was divine!!! The Green Egg is my go to whenever ever I visit home and it continues to impress with a good variety of menu items and drinks.  If you&apos;re visiting Philadelphia give them a try and I apologize in advance for your impending Green Egg Cafe addiction!!!"
3,"I&apos;ve been to other green eggs cafes and always had a great experience. My experience at the original was unfortunately pretty average at best. I started out with a bombon coffee which was sweet, foamy, and delicious.

For my breakfast, I ended up ordering the chorizo eggs benny. When the dish came out it, it looked beautiful with two poached eggs, hollandaise sauce, corn, and chorizo atop of jalapeño corn bread. Upon cutting into the eggs, they&apos;re were totally overcooked. Complete bummer. We ended up letting our server know (this happened on my cousin&apos;s dish as well) and they discounted the meal.

There was a ton of potential here, but unfortunately execution was lacking."
4,Wait was not that long. I got the egg white omlette which was pretty tasty. The toast came with some really nice strawberry jam. I really liked it. I also got a smoothie which was also pretty good. A good place for a quick sit down breakfast.
4,"I enjoyed my breakfast here at the Northern Liberties location! There was a ~20 minute wait for 2 which wasn&apos;t too bad since it had a rather small dining area. 

I ordered the kitchen sink skillet which was a heaping order of eggs and potatoes topped with sausage gravy and a biscuit. The biscuit and gravy were my fave part of the dish and my only complaint was that I wish there was more gravy. The biscuit was flaky and buttery and the sausage, peppers and onions scrambled with the eggs gave a it a lovely flavor. 

I am planning to return to try out their monstrous challah french toast dishes that seemed to have been very popular among my seated neighbors :)"
4,"I love this place, food is always good! There is always about a 20min wait. They&apos;re always busy, especially on the weekends. They give you so much food, so my mom and I always share."
4,"First time here, last time we tried to come the line was too long but we were seated right away today. My bf wasn&apos;t impressed with the menu but he&apos;s picky. Me on the other hand had a hard time deciding between four breakfast dishes. He likes more sweet breakfast, I like savory. I was looking for the crab cake Benny on the menu but I didn&apos;t see it so I went with the chicken and waffle with a side of fruit which so delish. The chicken was crispy, the waffle crispy then soft and the eggs were cooked perfectly on top. My bf ordered pecan pie French toast I think it&apos;s called which he really liked. He also got a side of scrapple- the fry on it was perfect. So crispy on the outside and soft on the inside however it had a bit of a weird taste. He didn&apos;t like it at all so I ended up eating most of it. Besides that the meal was great- oh yea I had fresh squeezed lemonade which was pretty good too."
5,"I definitely underestimated this place. I did not realize how HUGE portions were. I went with a group of friends, and we definitely over ordered. Like way over ordered. 

My favorite was the creme brulee french toast. Topped with so many fruits and a delicious chantilly cream. 

The pancakes were a lot bigger in real life compared to the pictures I saw on here. We ordered the red velvet pancakes, and that was a favorite of the table as well. 

Both the &quot;The Cure&quot; and &quot;The Kitchen Sink&quot; are definitely shareable by 2 or even 3 people. The portion is huge! Don&apos;t get these if you don&apos;t want to fall into a food coma. We weren&apos;t looking for anything healthy when we ordered these. Hahah. 

I&apos;d definitely come back here if I&apos;m ever back in town. Definitely hit the spot."
3,"Ehh waited years to try this place and was not as impressed as others. The pecan pie French toast was amazing less the pie filling. It is very sweet and decadent. The grits are really good as well.

The not so good:

The short rib eggs Benedict was not good to me like at all!! The short rib was not seasoned well. 

My vegetarian friend had the tofu scramble and the meatless sausage looked burnt. They brought out more but still burnt. Even the waiter was like oh I guess they do look the same"
1,"I was always hesitant to write a review because the food is sometimes (barely) okay, but my boyfriend and I are never going back to this location. We always order the same thing: chicken and waffles benedict, but there is no consistency. The chicken has been dry, thin, rubbery, or, in today&apos;s case, tiny &amp; rubbery. The rosemary and herb potatoes have been burnt or undercooked. We&apos;ve only been satisfied twice, which is why we always try it again. I do NOT recommend this location not only for takeout, but also dine in. We&apos;ve dined in a few times, and every time it has smelled like potent body odor. Their employees need to put on deodorant. I recommend the locust or Dickinson Green Eggs instead."
