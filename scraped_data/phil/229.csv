5,"Cómo se dice, &quot;no longer a whole in the wall?&quot; en español? El Purepecha upped their game with a BEAUTIFUL new, clean and bright space with a huge bar (they moved within the same general area). It as inviting (if not more) than some of their counterparts in the city except they actually make authentic Mexican cuisine. They opened their new digs on Oct 14, and all the waitresses had face paint to celebrate día de los muertos. Having worked in a Mexican restaurant for years, it makes me so happy to see others like us succeed.

You can still enjoy their awesome food even if you don&apos;t feel comfortable dining in. Get delivery or takeout. If you opt for take out, they have plexiglass between the hostess station, staff are wearing masks (even over their face paint) and hand sanitizer readily available. Please make your way here if you haven&apos;t!"
5,"I was inclined to order takeout from here by some great yelp reviews and particularly one about a designated burrito day with El Purepecha&apos;s shrimp burrito. Lets just say, I&apos;ll also be having designated burrito days from now on. Officially my go to - great food, reasonable prices and super fast service. 
I ordered a shrimp burrito and guacamole - both were excellent and authentic (enough for lunch and dinner) and I love that they give you a salsa choice in the burrito!"
5,"My love for El Purepecha runs deep. I discovered this place through a recommendation three weeks ago. I&apos;ve created a designated &quot;burrito day&quot; in my apartment, ordering the same massive shrimp burrito each week when the insatiable craving hits. 

I&apos;ve never seen the brick and mortar, but each time I&apos;ve ordered delivery through GrubHub, I&apos;ve had impeccable service, with the food arriving before the estimated delivery time. 

Before I found El Purepecha, my weekly GrubHub order was from a national burger and shake chain (I&apos;ll let you figure it out). It was always about $25 for a burger and fries after delivery, taxes, and tip. All fees included, my El Purepecha never costs more than $15 and it&apos;s easily enough for two meals (though I usually make it one).

I&apos;ve never wandered from the burrito menu, though I&apos;m keen to try if I can ever get past my cravings. The burrito is *chefs kisses* PERFECT. It weighs easily over a pound, packed with the perfect blend of protein, cheese, beans, rice, guac, sour cream, pico, etc. Everything you&apos;d want in a perfect burrito. I&apos;m never, ever left longing for more of anything. It is truly a masterpiece. I always opt for the shrimp burrito, and the shrimp amount is always generous. If you&apos;ve got any self control at all, you could split this burrito into two meals. If you&apos;re like me, you order one burrito at 2pm, scarf the whole thing, and you successfully knock out both lunch AND dinner. 

I&apos;m already looking forward to next week&apos;s burrito day. If you want a delicious, quick, and incredibly satiating meal at an insane value, El Purepecha is the spot. Did I mention delicious?"
3,"Ordered delivery last night. Maybe it&apos;s because of the high expectations of a restaurant with 4.5 stars, but my wife and I were extremely disappointed.  

The good:  Baha fish tacos.  If everything was this quality, I would go back.  Very tasty and well put together.

The bad:  The Shrimp burrito was decent but severely under-seasoned.  The &quot;side&quot; of guacamole was tiny - like half a ramekin.  The salsa that comes standard with this was forgotten in our order, which probably would have made it better.

The ugly: The squash blossom quesadilla.  I love squash blossoms, but the filling made with these was extremely bitter - like they had gone bad or not been cleaned well.  We honestly could not eat more than the first bite.  And the packaging for the quesadilla was very poor - looks like they just tossed everything into a box, so instead of wrapping it to stay crispy like most places, the slices were soggy.

If I walk by this place after COVID is over, I might try some of their items, but I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll be ordering delivery again.  It&apos;s a shame - the menu looks fantastic, but the execution was sub par."
4,"I came here after seeing pictures of burrito mojado where a big burrito covered with sauce. Looks very enticing.

This place is very clean, spacious, cozy, and bright from the sunlight. I arrived 10 minutes before it opened. I saw a staff cleaning the restaurant. 

The menu is available by scanning the QR code at the hostess station. I ordered burrito mojado rojo. She asked my preference on the spice level. Very courteous and friendly lady.

It&apos;s November 14 but the restaurant is nicely decorated with Christmas decorations. There&apos;s also a bowl of trick or treats candy near the door.

Unfortunately the sauce is leaking from the styrofoam container so by the time I got home, there&apos;s nothing left on top of the burrito. I was disappointed. However, the burrito was delicious, flavorful is on point. Al pastor meat is not dry.

I didn&apos;t realize that the restaurant hadn&apos;t returned my credit card. Fortunately the staff reached me through my Instagram to notify me. What a customer service.

My suggestion is to put the wet burrito in a sturdier and more sealed container or put the sauce separately in a sealed container. Maybe next time I will bring my own sealed container because I will definitely come back.

By the way, they are serving brunch too."
5,By far the best Mexican in Philly. I love everything here. The tamarind margaritas are also legit.
5,"Craving for Mexican, came across Wet Burritos from El Purepecha on Infatuation Philly&apos;s(IG) page. Search on Yelp and decided to give this place a try. El Purepecha is located on the corner of 10th and buttonwood street, and street parking is available. 

I placed a order on the phone. I order a steak and shrimp quesadilla, Steak and Shrimp Wet Burrito, and Steak Wet Burrito. In case you&apos;re wondering what is a Wet Burrito? Wet Burrito is a burrito on top of your choice of mild, medium, or spicy sauces. I had ordered my Steak and Shrimp Wet Burrito with mild sauce. And my Steak Wet Burrito in spicy sauce. I thought yelpers exaggerated at first when it comes to the size of these Wet Burrito. Well these Wet Burritos are huge, it took me three meals to finish one, like omg! Definitely worth the $10 price. Of course mine cost more bc one of the Wet Burrito got shrimps added. 

The Wet Burritos are definitely delicious, but our favorite was the Steak and shrimp quesadilla. It comes with salsa, sour cream, and guacamole on the side. Me and hub got the quesadilla as our appetizer, and wished we got more. We will definitely be back!

P.S. They accept cash as payment too."
3,"Monster Burritos!

Once you are able to find this restaurant which is no small feat, you&apos;ll be treated to a great feast.  Burritos here should be listed under a shareable meal given the size.  My &quot;wet&quot; carnitas burrito was an insane portion that was the first recommendation from the order taker.  It was also made rather quickly in the open kitchen right in front of the restaurant while I waited.  

Now while the burrito was supersized, the carnitas meat itself was a little dry and too salty even though it was &quot;wet&quot; or sauced.  Beans are normally included in the burrito but I&apos;m no fan of beans in general and asked for it to be made without.

On foot the neighborhood is kinda dark, with not much else going on, but the friendly service and food here is worth trying."
4,"Food: 4.25 Out of 5
Steak quesadilla and carnitas tacos had the right flavors. Carnitas had nice texture, but the steak had a little more gristle than I expected. Their red sauce had more chipotle flavor and the salsa verde was par.

Environment and Service: 4.25 Out of 5
Small hole in the wall joint. Seats no more than 20 people. Pretty slow when I came to order to go, my goodies were ready in about 10 minutes.

Overall: 4.25 Out of 5
No doubt I&apos;m coming back when I need a Mexican food fix"
5,"Came here during COVID because the craving for tacos were too strong. We got our food through a window, you call in and let them know you&apos;re here for pickup and the wait wasn&apos;t too long, just call ahead.

Now onto the main event of this review. The Baja taco might not look like much. Heck at first glance you might not even be able to tell what it is from the picture. Under that array of vegetables and avocado slices are three tacos containing crispy fish with chipotle sauce. Absolutely delicious and just made me want more! Only thing is that I wish there was more sauce on it. Absolutely great and would go back again."
5,"Excellent... The &quot;wet&quot; burrito is my favorite take out item...Try the carnitas version as it is amazing...We tried sopes, enchiladas and fajitas over the course of two orders... Subtle flavors, fresh ingredients and a focus on presentation... head and shoulders above other &quot;takeout spots&quot; .. top 10 spot"
5,I have order from El Purepecha and some items are a hit or miss for me. Today I got the pescado burrito (fish burrito) and the camarones quesadilla (shrimp quesadilla). They were both amazing. The fish taco was heavy and had a nice spicy kick to it! I&apos;ve tried the shrimp burrito. It&apos;s ok but not amazing. But the fish burrito is AMAZING. I could taste the chipotle/ancho favor and the the guacamole. The shrimp quesadilla was amazing as well. I&apos;ll stick to these as my go to as well as the chimichanga.
1,"The worst Mexican food I have ever tasted, and I&apos;m open to nearly anything. We had shrimp, steak, chicken and more. In each case soaked with an Indian tasting and smelling curry, across all orders. The salsa a mud colored cilantro-ridden soup. Maybe authentic to this region of Mexico, but I&apos;ve eaten Mexican food for decades, and our entire order has been  thrown away. It&apos;s that bad."
5,"I am impressed, El Purepecha was truly magnificent. Excellent location and service was terrific. The menu is really good, plenty of fantastic choices, I had to go with Al Pastor Burrito, and it was excellent. Service was excellent and everybody working here was extremely nice and helpful. Would totally come back again to El Purepecha."
5,Best chorizo tacos around. I order from there far too often :) The team is very nice too and I have referred tons of people to this restaurant and they all love it too!
5,"This has to be hands down top 3 Mexican spots in Philly. Their food is sooo good. They have a variety of options, food is fresh, colorful and well seasoned.

I am particular fond of their sopes but really you can&apos;t go wrong. Love you can pick which salsas  you want to go with your food.  However I&apos;m sure it doesn&apos;t matter - If you pick Tacos, burritos or any platter you won&apos;t be disappointed."
4,"I&apos;ve eaten here 3 times and always loved the food. The enchiladas are great, and today I had beef quesadillas, which were also outstanding. The food comes fast. The guys are nice. It&apos;s a cozy place with only 4-5 tables along a wall, with a counter behind which the food is prepared. Nice, colorful decor. Some things that are different than other Mexican places: 

* No chips and salsa, unless you order them for $5. 
* No rice &amp; beans with most dishes. (You can order them. $2.50 each)
* No lunch specials.
* Order at the counter and they bring it to you.

Not saying those things are good or bad, but now you know what to expect. The food, as I said, is delicious."
5,"This is before the quarantine, but the food here is amazing! I had their vegetarian smothered burrito and you definitely get your money&apos;s worth. The burrito itself was stuffed with a bunch of vegetables and not just beans, cheese and rice (which happens a lot for vegetarian mexican dishes) so that was a great. I think the best part is the fact that you can see them cook the food which gives me a lot of assurance that the food is probably being prepared very cleanly if they are willing to show that. The one and only tiny downside was the inside was small so you might have to take it to go if you can&apos;t find a seat (which during the current pandemic isn&apos;t an issue). Definitely a great place to go!"
5,Been coming here for a while now and personally they hit the spot everytime. Not sure why I go around trying to find a better spot when this business stays serving top tier grub
5,We had Nachos Grande and a salad with grilled chicken. Both were excellent and I can&apos;t wait for the bar to open!
