5,"Updated review:

I got a table for 2 people on Friday night. The reservation was super easy, and the lady on the phone was very nice. The staff is cautious to make sure the table is sanitized and there is a table between 2 tables to maintain the 6ft distance. 

I had a great experience there. My server, Tithy was extremely accommodating and helpful. He went above and beyond explaining the menu and making sure we had a great experience there. 

I ordered both hotpot and sushi. Here are my thoughts on the food. 

I highly recommend the tomato oxtail soup. The broth is rich in flavor and very delicious. 

They serve the best quality of meat here. It can be pricier than a lot of places, but you get what you pay for. I had the wagyu short rib w/egg and wagyu beef, which were really good. The meat just melted in my mouth... 

I also highly recommend you try the Uni Wagyu maki and Foie Gras Wagyu  maki. You won&apos;t be disappointed. 

Overall, this is a perfect place for a fancy hotpot date. Looking at the pictures makes me hungry already..."
5,"My favorite hotpot place by far.

I went to chubby cattle for lunch and was extremely happy that they were open for Dine-In since I wanted to try it for the past couple of months.

The staff was great in explaining the food selection and recommendation on cooking the food. The broth for the hotpot was amazing and by the time we were finished, it tasted even better after cooking all the vegies and meets in it. 

The waygu beef was just excellent along with the vegetables, seafood, and the waygu beef nigiri with uni. Our favorite item of the day was by far the soup dumplings, we couldn&apos;t stop ordering those. 

I will definitely be coming back!!"
5,Came here after when they recently reopened indoor dining. Had a great time at chubby cattle . The soup Broth was excellent. My fianc√© and I had the wagyu beef combo and the seafood combo - great deal ! All the food tasted fresh and we couldn&apos;t have expected better quality . TITHY took very good care of us . 10/10 would recommend this place to anyone . Also not our first time here . Never disappointed
5,"The chubby cattle was an amazing hot pot experience! It was our first time going, and we will definitely be coming back! The biggest reason why we will be coming back is because our server Tithy gave us OUTSTANDING SERVICE!!!! Tithy explained the hot pot process and suggestions on what to get. 

Since this was our first time here, we had no idea what to get. We ended up getting the Wagyu combo and the seafood combo and it fed the four of us perfectly. It&apos;s served family style, so we all shared. We added a few vegetables and we each had a broth. I cannot stress how melt in your mouth orgasmic experience the wagyu and the seas food were. 

Thanks to the great service and food, we will definitely coming back!!!!"
5,"I&apos;ve been here a few times now and every time is a great experience. The place is extremely clean and beautifully decorated. 

We came here recently and they only seat every other booth so wait times are pretty long so make sure you join the waitlist early. Our server, Quynh, was great - very informative and attentive! The oxtail soup base and wagyu were great as usual- I definitely recommend the slow cooked wagyu and new wagyu/wasabi skewers."
5,"Amazing hotpot place in Chinatown! 
Food: 8/10
Broth was a bit salty, but flavorful and the original had dates, tomatoes, and a small corn. 
Portion: 7/10
Noodle portion was disappointing for $12, only 3 small portions
Service: 10/10 waitress was really patient and nice, explaining a lot of the ingredients. 
Sauces were good and all ingredients were fresh."
4,You get your individual broth for hot pot and then order items for cooking family style. Nice that you can individualize the spice level. Ingredients are extremely fresh and they provide a nice variety. Only reason I went down one star is that they aren&apos;t necessarily careful that your broth is vegetarian
5,Came here after a hard workout and gosh it did satisfy our craving for protein. Their A5 Wagyu is off the charts amazing. Honestly the best we&apos;ve had at a Philly hot pot joint. The service was impeccable and our server Michelle was so attentive and sweet the entire night. We are definitely coming back here again. Thank you so much for staying open and such difficult times!
5,This place is amazing. AMAZING!!!! The service is great. The staff is so friendly. You leave so full and the experience is incredible.
4,"Atmosphere: Chubby Cattle was our first stop for food during our visit to Philly, which was pre-COVID lockdowns. The restaurant had a very young and vibrant environment. The seats had their own outlets, and there was a conveyor belt with a variety of small dishes/ingredients for your hotpot.

Service: We had made a reservation before arriving at Chubby Cattle. Since we arrived early, we had to wait about another 40 minutes. The staff was kind enough to give us a coupon for a free choice of meat. From the online reservation to being seated, it took a total of 1 hour and 40 minutes (on a Friday night). We definitely liked the online waitlist and would recommend signing up early as possible! The service was friendly and helped us explain their menu/portions. 

Food: We first ordered the House Original and House Hellist Spicy Pot (entry level spicy) as our soup bases. We loved that we could design our own hot pot sauce from a wide range of ingredients! From the conveyor belt, we got seaweed salad and rice cakes, and we also ordered udon noodles to enjoy with our soup. For our meats, we ordered the Beef Combo, which includes brisket, angus prime ribeye, and Australian Wagyu short rib, and got a pork belly from the coupon we got earlier. Overall the food was fantastic! However, we preferred the House Original over the Spicy because it paired better with the meats and udon noodles. While the conveyor belt has some nice selections, meat is definitely the way to go (we especially recommend the pork and ribeye, which was very soft!). 

Overall: Chubby Cattle has such a great balance of food and experience. Although a bit pricey, Chubby Cattle is definitely worth a visit for their delicious hot pot and amazing meats! Would undoubtedly come again!"
5,"Food and service are always great. But don&apos;t come earlier, because they will say tables are not ready yet. Even there are some empty tables there"
4,"During our short trip to Philly scouting for an apartment, we were looking for a spot that would let us dine in since we didn&apos;t have time to bring lunch back to the hotel. Chubby Cattle was the first place we stumbled across that allowed for dine in. 

Just by looking at their menu, we knew we had to get something with wagyu beef. It&apos;s a specialty here and honestly it would be the primary reason for me to come to a place like this. We decided to get hotpot and was surprised that they didn&apos;t let us share a soup broth. They require each person to order their own which was a major downside. A lot of other hotpot places don&apos;t charge for the broth since you&apos;re already paying for the meats and veggies that go with it. 

I got the tomato oxtail broth while the boyfriend got the house original broth. We each got a side of udon noodles and shared the wagyu beef combo. We also decided to try their wagyu uni nigiri. 

Hotpot broth was spectacular. Again, the only downside was that they make each person get their own. The wagyu beef combo was heaven. We loved how fresh the meat tasted. Really good quality wagyu. Meat only needed to be cooked a few seconds. Each piece melted in our mouths. We definitely didn&apos;t need to dip it in any sauce since the meat was so good by itself. Udon portions were very generous and rounded out our meal nicely. 

We expected our nigiri to come out first; kind of like a an appetizer, but it came at the end of our meal which seemed a bit weird. I also wasn&apos;t aware it was going to be infused with smoke since it didn&apos;t say that anywhere on the menu, but I was all up for it. It was presented in a wooden serving base covered with a glass cloche. Very fun and lavish presentation. With a single bite, we immediately tasted the smokiness. I personally didn&apos;t think a fine piece of wagyu needed that smoky flavor. It was almost a bit too smoky for my taste. However, the meat was incredibly tender and melted in my mouth. I couldn&apos;t even tell it was raw beef that I was eating. It was good stuff, but also expensive. 

You definitely pay for the quality here. This isn&apos;t a place I can see myself visiting a lot just cause I&apos;m not rolling in dough. This place is great for special occasions or even a &quot;treat yourself&quot; type of day, since things can add up quickly."
5,Came here on a late Thursday night and got a table for 4. Was seated quickly and promptly! Our server Quynh was very quick and friendly. The food was tasty and uniquely plated. I would definitely come back and totally recommend trying this place out!
4,"Quarantine Post

They have limited seating but hot pot is alive again! First impression, the food is extremely high quality and their fish balls are homemade as well as noodles. They are going for the niche and quality food. They also have a promotion of buy 1 get 1 for select meat orders, a la carte. Honest, the homemade colorful noodles are pretty but impossible to eat. Very chewy regardless of how long you cook it. The fish balls are a MUST try, very delicious, we got the combo first and then ordered separately. The food selection is plentiful and our party of 5 had a wonderful time. They also have multiple different soup bases with individual pots. They sent us a sauce tray, the options were very dry not very sauce like however, they have a homemade sauce thats delicious!

I would recommend this place but keep in mind its bougie and really going for quality and may not be comparable in price to an AYCE for example. Still, loved the experience, would recommend!"
4,"I came here on a whim for one of my coworker&apos;s birthday. First time here and honestly not bad. Our server, Quynh was so nice and accommodating to our needs. When one of our stoves was not working, they fixed it right away. The food was great and for a reasonable price. Totally recommend!"
5,Quynh was great. Service food quality and atmosphere makes it an intimate setting and wonderful experience.
4,"Happy anniversary! Enjoyed some covid dining with my bby, checked out this place that she raved about, &quot;the wagyu&quot; little did I kno it was not what I expected. (Thicker cuts of meat) but still exceeded my expectations in flavor. I didn&apos;t know it was a hot pot in my defense. But it was def delicious. 
Decor: comfortable and inviting, disappointed the conveyor belt wasn&apos;t working, but it&apos;s covid times people! 
Service: Fast, attentive, knowledgeable and professional! 
Food: I chose the House Hellish Spicy Pot, and damn... that was a gooood amount of heat! My girl got the Tomato Oxtail and it was super flavorful and balanced off my heat. The slivers of meat tossed in the brotha for merely a few seconds was just what I needed to indulge in the succulent fatty-ness of the wagyu, so delicious and melt-ish in your mouth decadence (maybe just in my head) but for real it had such a delicious distinct real meaty taste. And highly recommend the nigiri! Try some but forewarned you will want more."
2,"Overall: C
Food: C
Service: A
Price: F

Service was fantastic but could not make up for the lackluster food. The broth was mediocre. The watercress came wilted. It&apos;s good that they allowed me to send it back. The tofu skin was sour which meant it had been out for a while. The worst part is that the sesame oil did not taste like sesame oil at all - it was a low quality product that was heavily diluted with canola oil - I know this because the waiter was kind enough to show me the actual bottle it came from. Also the minced garlic wasn&apos;t fresh and was soaked in some sort of liquid. This meal cost over $50 for one person making it a poor value."
4,"This is a nice hotpot place, but the value to price ratio is a bit sad, especially with the meats. We got some pork belly, and it was literally so paper thin I could eat it all in one bite LOL even though it was $6.99. This place specializes in meats but I honestly can&apos;t really tell the difference between a nice wagyu and regular beef but that&apos;s probably my fault! Service was also a little disappointing as my soup base was never refilled, and I had to ask multiple times/different waiters for different items. Overall it was a good experience, just quite pricey! Tip is to definitely join the waitlist on Yelp!!"
5,"We came here last night and it did not disappoint! The food was outstanding and you get SO much. I had the original broth, scallops, spicy edamame(my favorite), the angus prime rib-eye , glass noodles, stir-fried bean curd roll, and tong ho for a vegetable, amazing! My boyfriend had the hellish spicy broth, shrimp, wag-yu beef skewers, udon noodles, wagyu brisket, fried todu, and baby bamboo shoots for his vegetable he enjoyed his as well. We also got wagyu nigiri, rainbow soup dumplings, a veggie combo and a mushroom basket everything was outstanding. They also give you a basket with different sauces and spices to add to your broth, so fun.Our waitress was very attentive and informative. It was my first time and I cant wait to go back. Such a fun date night"
