5,"I&apos;ve been remiss in not updating my review. I&apos;ve never been disappointed in my food. It&apos;s consistently delicious, especially the Caesar salad. Also, the milkshakes are amazing. They always treat their customers like they&apos;re family.
Eat here or order out during this pandemic. You will never be disappointed!"
5,"Ants Pants is one of my favorite lunch / brunch places in Philly. It&apos;s pretty small and simple but has a warm and cozy feel. The staff couldn&apos;t be friendlier and are always smiling even when things are hectic  (weekend brunch time is usually pretty packed and there is a 20 mins or so wait). My husband and I used to go at least once per month before the pandemic and they always remember our regular orders and occasionally give us a &quot;neighbors discount&quot;! The ingredients are fresh and the food never disappoints. My husband usually gets the BLT sandwich and I alternate between the Greek omelet, the grilled cheese sandwich or the special when it is still available. They also have a smoothie special every day (different flavors). I like them all but the mixed berry is my favorite. They also have a cute closed backyard that we prefer when not too hot or cold.  They also do pickup during the pandemic. We called to order and they have everything ready withing 15-20 mins or so. Highly recommended if you live in the neighborhood!!!"
5,"Cozy &quot;Australian-themed&quot; brunch spot, cash only and BYO. Love the indoor patio! 

Ants Pants comes up fairly frequently when you ask about famous brunch spots in Philly. Although it is an &quot;Aussie style&quot; restaurant, I&apos;m not sure what exactly makes it Aussie, as the menu seemed like American cuisine. That aside, it has a mix of healthy and not so healthy breakfast and lunch options. Portions are generous considering the relatively cheap prices, and I loved the beef hash with sweet potatoes. I also loved the enclosed, heated patIo in the back that allowed us to sit outside in the wintertime. I&apos;ll be back to try a sweeter dessert!"
4,"Currently takeout only but opening some indoor dining again soon. Great little brunch/lunch spot though!

I&apos;ve gotten the maple bacon sandwich twice now and it&apos;s the got the perfect amount of salty and sweet and the golden beets really tie the whole thing together. Have also tried the beef hash and enjoyed it. The ranch/sour cream like topping really makes it special. The grilled cheese was also very good and stacked with bacon and caramelized onions.

If you&apos;re unsure of what to get though I definitely recommend trying the maple bacon because I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll ever get tired of eating that sandwich."
3,"Average. Cute cafe overall but small so be prepared to be sitting on top of each other. 
I got the avocado toast (with a poached egg, feta arugula &amp; pickled onions) and a side of fruit. It was okay. Nothing over the top and I don&apos;t think it was worth $13. Kind of dry and lacked flavor. 
Don&apos;t think I would go back (id rather try something new)

Cash only!! (Which just annoys me in this day in age to be honest...)"
1,Hour long wait for eggs? As a chef myself this is just ridiculous. Food was cold and not very tasty fries were soggy. Highly disappointed. With all the good reviews i was expecting excellent and received mediocre at best. Complete waste of money and time
4,"We decided to come here for brunch on a Sunday because we realized that Little Spoons closed down. 

When we walked in it was packed but were were lucky because we just missed the brunch crowed that showed up when we left. The place isn&apos;t very big so if you don&apos;t get there in time you&apos;ll be waiting. 

The food was definitely fine. I ordered the pancakes and they were pretty big and delicious. I also ordered a side of eggs and turkey bacon.  We also got the sweet potato has with meat and eggs. Its a nice Aussi place but I guess I miss little spoon..."
5,"Great brunch spot!
Whatever you do, do it with a side of sweet potato tots! I&apos;m normally not a tot gal myself but these tots changed me - perfectly crunchy, hot and slightly sweet. 
We got the special which was a egg and sausag scramble with fennel and onion and that was very very tasty. The roll it came on was good but took up too much space away from the other delicious things in my tummy:)
The dirty chai was beautifully done as well"
4,"Solid little brunch spot! 

When I did some early moving in to an apartment nearby, I came with a friend to Ants Pants Cafe to grab some food afterwards. Since it was around 11am on a Tuesday, there were almost no other customers so it felt spacious even though it&apos;s a fairly small space.

The first thing that captured my attention after sitting down was their fun list of Aussie facts! It prompted me to do a lil googling of my own later (had no idea upon entering that this restaurant was related to Australia by any means) and found fascinating tid bits that are unique to this brunch spot. 

Here is some info from the Ants Pants website that was particularly delightful and may also be useful in shaping what you may want to order: &quot;Most of the items on the menu would easily be found in any Aussie cafe and the coffee from Australia&apos;s Tobys Estate adds to the authenticity (and some may suggest awesomeness)... The foundation of our menu items are uniquely borrowed from our experience working in several Sydney cafe&apos;s (a strong and competitive cafe environment). It&apos;s no secret that Aussies take their love of espresso drinks and their dining very seriously so we felt it was important to bring that love to the City of Brotherly Love, a city that at the time was still finding its feet in the culinary world. We like to think that we played a small part in building what we now consider to be a strong and vibrant dining scene.

Some typical Australian items that are worth checking out include vegemite, served on toast or as a sandwich. Make sure to try a flat white (like a short latte or a wet cappuccino), the Aussie iced coffee (a decadent ice cream and coffee blend) or just a brekkie platter which is a staple around most cafes around Australia.&quot; 

Since I only discovered these details on their website after my brunch, I didn&apos;t know about these recommendations while I was there. So I had picked the Brie stuffed french toast, which was yums but slightly misleading in its title, as the brie slices were just places between two pieces of french toast lol. 

I love discovering the why and hows an establishment came to be, and all these Aussie facts made me enjoy my Ants Pants experience in a particularly special way, as I have recently had a growing fascination with all things related to that country/continent :)"
5,"The cafe is homey and small. It&apos;s located on a cute street but not too much room for parking so you might have to walk over a bit. Also this place is CASH ONLY!! So be prepared.

Loved the food and ambiance here. Here&apos;s what I got:

Brie scramble ($12): a savory breakfast fun with a good crunch from the apple chunks, a bit of spice from the sweet chili sauce that is dabbled on the top. My favorite was the chip fries that were soft and thick. Although they said they&apos;re &quot;chip fries&quot;, they&apos;re not necessarily the crisp kind, although the fries meshed well with all the other flavors this dish was full of.

Also got the Aussie iced coffee: vanilla ice cream + milk+ 2 espresso shots + whipped cream. Would highly recommend!! Perfect for a hot summer day or anyone who loves a sweet caffeine kick.

Ambience was good for conversation and not too loud. Service was nice and it was a lovely experience."
5,"My best friend (and go-to brunch partner) has been trying to get me here for the last 18 months or so. Today she finally succeeded, and I can see why she was so persistent! 

You should know before you go:: it&apos;s cash-only, reallly tight, and you are most likely going to wait 20 minutes or so for a table for two. I did overhear the host tell a larger party that the wait would be closer to 45-60 minutes, so just keep that in mind if you&apos;re going with a group or the type to get hangry around the brunch hour. If you can jive with the wait, you will not be disappointed. 

Ants Pants is an Aussie cafe, so of course I ordered a flat-white. It was PERFECT. Perfect temp, perfect flavor, perfect size. I would wager that this is one of the best flat-whites on this side of the globe, at the very least, the best on this side of the country. My bestie got a mocha (choco-fans delight!) and we split a glass of fresh-squeezed OJ to make mimosas (BYO, hey ohhh!). She ordered her go-to, The Stack with a side of sweet potato fries - yumm! I tried their open-faced green apple &amp; brie sandwich with horseradish-ginger aioli - it was a delight and I&apos;m touch-&amp;-go on brie. I elected for a side salad and despite being a huge vinegar fan, their balsamic vinegarette was a bit much for me. 

This place is crazy narrow and crazy popular (the line out the door that was persistent through our meal), but the friendly, dedicated staff manage all the crazy in a calm, collected manner."
3,"Excellent food, VERY poor service. I&apos;ve been here a handful of times for Sunday brunch as it is my neighborhood go-to. I&apos;m either being rushed out since there&apos;s a long line, or neglected since... not sure why. Maybe because we were sitting outside and there&apos;s no line? Or our server forgot to put our order in and didn&apos;t realize it until we complained 45 minutes later? Ants Pants of course tries to compensate with giving us our drinks for free. 

The food is the only thing that&apos;s been consistently well. The pancakes are light and fluffy- this time the special is blueberry and dark chocolate ganache. Their hash is great as well- from the Italian sausage to the seasonal summer vegetable. The drinks- Aussie coffee, juices, and shakes are fresh and great for the summer heat. I recommend the Greek smoothie and Aussie iced coffee. In a hurry? I&apos;ve gotten their breakfast sandwiches on croissant and it didn&apos;t disappoint. The scrambled egg is mixed with cheese so let the server know if you prefer no cheese."
5,"Ants Pants Cafe has been on my bucket list since moving to Philly four months ago. Since then, I have made several attempts to go for brunch on Saturday and Sunday mornings, however, was never successful due to long wait times. Fortunately, I had last Friday off work and seized the opportunity to go to Ants Pants. There was no wait! I ordered the Italian Sausage Hash, which was absolutely delicious! It contained sweet potatoes, bacon, grilled fennel, sunny eggs, Italian sausage and garlic aioli. After having their delicious food, I completely understand why the wait times are so long. So yummy!"
4,"CASH ONLY ; ATM AVAILABLE NEARBY

Came here on a brunch date on a Friday afternoon! It had a great steady buzz of people and friendly faces! My cousin and I were greeted as soon as we walked in and we&apos;re allowed to sit in the front by the window at the high top! The two outside tables were taken and the backyard doesn&apos;t have an awning so sitting in the direct sun was not an option on a hot June day!

I learned that &quot;the ants pants&quot;, is way Australians say &quot;the bees knees &quot; 

We ordered our food and were able to customize as we liked!
I got a gluten-free bagel with the Maple turkey and arugula! Gosh this thing was delicious! And I always love when brunch is served with a side salad. I just think it&apos;s so refreshing! The Australian vibes were definitely coming through.

My cousin got the eggs Benedict and let me tell you, aI usuallydo not like the sauce on there but this one was delicious! And the eggs perfectly soaked the English muffins underneath. Hers was served with a side of a fruit salad! Which is also welcomed with brunch for me!

Unfortunately our food took over 25 minutes to cook. And people around us ordered and received their food within that time. So we were definitely disappointed about that and even had to go ask the host where our food was. 

Well worth the wait, though! This place was great! And fostered an atmosphere for my cousin and I to catch up, which I totally appreciated.

I don&apos;t know if I necessarily be back anytime soon but it&apos;s nice to know that it is a great brunch option!"
5,"FYI: THEY ARE CASH ONLY!!!

WHAT I GOT: Chicken ranch sandwich + Iced mocha

PROS: Y&apos;all the food here is nothing to sleep on. Everything in their menu sounds delicious so it was mad hard for ya girl to choose something but honestly, I feel like everything would&apos;ve tasted good. We came around 1ish so I decided to do a sandwich instead of a breakfast option and this did not disappoint. The components of the sandwich meshed together so well and the fries were also incredibly delicious. Portion sizes are large so you get your money&apos;s worth of food. Their iced mocha was also too good (yes I&apos;m one of those people who still drink cold drinks during the winter lol). I highly recommend grabbing a coffee on the side of your meal. The flavors complement each other nicely.

CONS: Well...for a place this popular, they don&apos;t got much waiting space up front. People are practically pushed up against each other and it gets kinda uncomfortable. Especially when you&apos;re squished against the window seating area where people might be eating. There&apos;s also minimum walking space in between the tables. Food wise, they put WAY too much red onion in my sandwich. I literally pulled out essentially half an onion from the buns. Once my tongue stopped burning and I fished out all the pieces, the sandwich was great but that first bite really took me by surprise."
4,"Finally made it here for brunch. I came here with my wife on Saturday at around 11 am. The place is really small but they use that little space quite effectively. There is an inside seating area with 7-10 tables and a back outdoor seating area with another 7-10 tables. There is also a few tables in the front of the restaurant. When we walked in, there was a line of people waiting to be seated. The place was packed. The cashier and kitchen are at the front of the restaurant so there is not much space to move when you walk in. We got in the line and someone came up to us fairly quickly and told us that a table for 2 will take about 25 minutes. We ordered coffee drinks from the cashier while we waited. I got a very delicious decaf latte. We were then seated in about 10 minutes, which was awesome. 

I ordered the egg, cheese and bacon stuffed french toast. My wife got the egg and cheese on the long roll with a side of fruit. Our food came out in about 20 minutes, but they kept our waters full. We really enjoyed our meals. The french toast was airy and delicious, and the eggs were cooked perfectly. My wife really enjoyed her sandwich, and the fruit was very fresh. 

The place was very noisy but that is typical for a packed brunch place. We didn&apos;t mind it at all. Note that this place is cash only, but they have an ATM in the restaurant. We will definitely be back."
4,"Ants Pants is part of our regular lunch rotation at work, and for good reason: it&apos;s a cute place with delicious food and friendly, prompt service. Not once has anyone in our group ever been unsatisfied with a meal here. 

I typically get the gruyere grilled cheese with light mustard (sometimes it can be a little too mustard-y) and chip fries. The grilled cheese is good but the chip fries. The chip fries! Single most delicious thing on the menu and definitely among the best fries I&apos;ve ever had. Eat it with the hot sauce they provide if you want to throw your taste buds a party. In any case, no matter what you order, the portions are generous.

My one disclaimer is that I&apos;ve only been here on Friday afternoons (around lunch hour), so I can&apos;t speak to the weekend brunch/lunch wait. But I&apos;ve never had to wait more than a few minutes to get seated when I come with my coworkers, and we&apos;re typically rolling with a fairly large group. And reminder, it is cash only, though there is an ATM on-site with a fee."
5,"A hidden GEM among philly brunch options. I can&apos;t say enough praise about this place. People rave about Honeys down the street but Ants Pants is the true winner of South Street brunch spots. 

The crowning achievement is the sausage sweet potato hash with garlic aioli; the best brunch in Philly and perhaps even beyond. It&apos;s impossible to not scarf down. 

The milkshakes and other drinks are fun too! And the little patio in the back with twinkling lights is adorable. It looks tiny from the outside, but once you step in you&apos;ll never want brunch elsewhere"
4,"Great microcosm of Australia as well as typical brunch stuff with a flair of stuff one can find in any Commonwealth country&apos;s grocery store.

Some of the things I personally loved:

a) The TimTam Milkshake: Growing up in Asia, the TimTam cookies were something that was super popular, and it was so so good to see a milkshake made out of the same here.

b) The french toast with marmalade: As the name suggests, gorgeous french toast with peach and marmalade. 

c) The omelettes are phenomenal too!!!


The Vegemite toast is something authentically Australian if you want to have the experience. But mind it, Vegemite tastes super earthy (I&apos;m not a fan of it at all) and you might find it nothing but plainly disgusting.

The only qualm I had about Ants Pants is that they were cash-only. But again, that&apos;s on me since I&apos;m not a big fan of a paper cash-based economy."
4,"4.2/5

I came here for Sunday brunch and enjoyed their Maple Bacon sandwich. It was a great combination of ingredients and flavors, and a nice level of crunch and juiciness (from the egg). The maple flavor was really nice, and while I&apos;m not a fan of fries in general, these were pretty decent."
