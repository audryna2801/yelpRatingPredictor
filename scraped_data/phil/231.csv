5,"First things first...this place has 40+ cocktails on the menu and even more off the menu. We had so much fun walking around and thought it looked cool and we decided to check it out. Best idea! The drinks were fantastic, our server (Kari) was very cool &amp; they help support other local restaurants in the area. This place has it all!"
5,"I&apos;m sitting across from my date and in march firefighters! I knew then that I was not going to keep her attention! A smoke alarm brought Philadelphia&apos;s bravest into Sassafras!

Anyways the bizarre alarm experience aside, this is a humble one bar. The cook in the back can still cook up a variety of dishes. To illustrate, I ordered up potato pierogis. It was accompanied by thick sour cream and the fried onions. Meanwhile my date had a side of six pack abs (not mine) and a bowl of Mac and cheese. 

On tap, they strangely did not have some tried and true Pennsylvania favorites, but instead offered more mainstream corporate names like Guinness. In my opinion, there is no better stout to make you strong, so this suited me fine.

The atmosphere is laid back. You can get in and out for 15 to 20 per person. Maybe not worth making a trip from the suburbs for, but if you happen to live in the area or happen to be close by, I would recommend a visit.

Expect to pay for parking."
3,"I stopped here for a late meal and the place was packed. I was lucky to get a seat at the bar. The bartender seemed to be the only one working, handling both the bar and the tables. This made service extremely slow, but the bartender was a whiz behind the bar. A true mixologist, making multiple drinks at once fast. Even tasting along the way to make sure he&apos;s getting them right. I could see he was doing the best he could. It&apos;s management&apos;s fault the place wasn&apos;t properly staffed to handle the crowd. 
I kept it simple, ordering a Jack &amp; Coke. It was perfect. For food they have both sirloin and bison burgers. I chose a sirloin cheeseburger with fries. It was smaller than expected, without the proper burger to bun ratio. There was too much bun. It was a properly cooked medium, but only a bit juicy. The fries were were well seasoned and tasty. 
There are other bars close by with better food. I&apos;d go back to Sassafras for drinks only."
4,They have pisco sour! Not a lot of places do. The ambience is amazing here and the drinks are wonderful too!
5,"Stopped in for a few drinks at the bar with a friend after having dinner.
At first we sat at a high top, but when two seats opened at the bar we quickly moved there as it was a bit more space and more comfortable.

Atmosphere is vintage, dark woods, intricate details, trophy hunter animal head on the wall.  I loved it.

Summer time I drink a lot of French 75s and the bar tender made them expertly.  Several of them went down nice and easy at an affordable price for a cocktail.  

I want to move in and live in the woman&apos;s bathroom.
I lingered a good 10 minutes in there."
5,Great bar with fantastic cocktails. I&apos;ve been here twice and have always had really great drinks. Got a gin drink the last time I went which had blood orange infused gin. Absolutely delicious and had a good balance between.p sweetness and alcohol. Second drink I had was a gin Negroni. Also delicious and light. Egg white is such a good mixer. Will definitely be back when I&apos;m in the area. The women&apos;s bathroom is also very spacious and has a nice couch to fix yourself up.
5,"The bartender is an absolute genius. Great drinks awesome food, perfect ambiance, amazing food!"
5,"A hidden gem in Old City! The atmosphere of the bar is exquisite; with a jazz band playing live music and a large selection of drinks, Sassafras amazed me. Great service, &amp; I even found my new favorite draft: the new Belgium beer!"
4,"This is a great spot to get fancy cocktails in Old City! I&apos;ve been here a few times for drinks and have always had a nice experience. The bar area is pretty small, so the challenge is coming at a time when you are able to get a seat since there isn&apos;t much standing room. I&apos;ve also tried to come here for summer a couple times, but there has always been a pretty long wait since the place is so small so I haven&apos;t had the chance to eat here.

Sassafras has a nice interior with a little bit of a speakeasy vibe. They have live jazz music here on certain days of the week, but it&apos;s usually packed during those nights. In terms of drinks, I&apos;ve tried a few of their cocktails and all have been delicious. They&apos;re definitely on the pricier side and they don&apos;t really have any good happy hour specials which is a bummer. Most recently I&apos;ve tried their Bee&apos;s Knees cocktail and the Sloe Gin Fizz. Both were awesome!

I think this is a great place to come for cocktails if you&apos;re in the Old City area, especially on a night when they have live music. However, don&apos;t expect to get a seat easily!"
4,"Sassafras is a real find. A &quot;locals-only&quot; place to say the least. Not much has changed in there- I swear you can still smell cigarette smoke on the walls sometimes.

You will find yourself a good drink at this bar. There&apos;s every spirit covered (seriously they have a deep and involved cocktail menu made up of classics, twists, new). 

You&apos;ll find bar food- no frills here but everything was good. Wings, Mac and cheese, truffle fries, perogies. 

In addition, you will find fantastic bartenders. They&apos;re witty, love what they do, make good recommendations, and are accommodating. This is the standout feature of Sassafras. 

There&apos;s a deer head above the bar and it&apos;s dimly lit. We&apos;re usually like flies to a light with places like this. It didn&apos;t disappoint."
4,"A friend told me about this spot so decided to give it a try. Its a small bar/restaurant and I arrived during HH. Thursday&apos;s are live music night and a gentleman with a cello was playing in the corner. 

I ordered the burger with fried onion, cheese, tomato, lettuce with a side salad. The burger was medium-well and was so juicy. 

We were sat by the bar along the wall where high tops are and it was nice way to see the entire bar and listen to the music while we ate. I was intrigued to try the pirogies but they were sold out. I&apos;ll have to come back to try them out as this place apparently is known for their great pirogies!"
4,"This place delivered what our trio we needed for the night. A cozy dimly lit restaurant with a variety of craft cocktails, tasty bites including Pierogis(which you don&apos;t often see as appetizers) live music, and a few TVs to keep an eye on Sunday Night Sports. 

What we ordered:
1) Pierogi of the day - &quot;taco&quot; style (This was crispy and tasty. But I wasn&apos;t quite taco-y enough to be called taco style) 3-stars 
2) Truffle Fries - crisp outside, tossed with Parmesan DELICIOUS 5- stars
3) Homemade Ketchup - 5-stars  little smoky and sweet 
4) Cocktails - 5 Stars (menu is diverse and grouped by choice of spirit you&apos;ll find something you&apos;ll enjoy) personal fave was the Barbados Redux 

Service was good, loved how the bartender does table side pours of your drink and felt welcomed. I&apos;d return next time in the Philly Area. Great spot for couples or small group of 4 IMO

4.5 stars!"
5,Fun bar to go to on a night out! The cocktails were well crafted by the bartender and delicious. She was able to help us pick exactly what we wanted. The atmosphere was very cool.
5,"Crowded bar, dark and super tight but the atmosphere is well worth it. The bartenders are respectful and very courteous -- you feel like you&apos;re in a bygone era. The most amazing thing is how they work. They are mixing drinks, strong ones, with skill and grace. 

A must visit. 

Get a cocktail."
5,"I&apos;ve been hanging out at Sassafras since the 1980s. If looking for a good drink served by top notch bar tenders (Neil, Carl, Fergus and Danny). This is the place. Sassafras is where the locals go the relax. 
There is a beautiful vintage bar, tin ceiling and often overlooked ceramic tiles that are part of the places history. 
The food is uncomplicated but very good."
5,"Really Really loved it here! I went out here for a first date over the weekend after a friend recommended it. Super cool old timey, speak easy vibe, with some really awesome cocktails. They have it all!

I had one of their special drinks the Saint or Sinner Sazerac and it was really good! I&apos;m normally not a sazerac guy, but if you&apos;re ever going to try one you should do it here! 

I also had a whiskey sour before I realized my date had blown me off and was skeptical because they follow the original recipe with egg whites, but I was very happy with it!

Best place I&apos;ve ever been stood up at and really awesome cocktails, will definitely go back!"
5,"Loooved this bar. It&apos;s around the corner from Silence Dogood&apos;s so when we got the hint to leave there if we weren&apos;t immediately buying more drinks, we hopped over to Sassafras instead. It has a great old-timey saloon type of charm to it and the staff is extremely friendly! They strike a good balance between checking up on you often to make sure you got drinks when you wanted them, and leaving you alone enough that you could carry on a decent conversation in the meantime. 

The cocktails themselves were all really enjoyable. We ordered several rounds and my favourite of them was the Moscow Mule with its interesting twist of vanilla vodka. Ladies, check out the bathroom upstairs too! It&apos;s probably the largest bar bathroom I&apos;ve ever seen and even has a couch inside, of all things. Totally over the top but so fun!"
5,"Oh Sassafras. If I could clone you and bring you home...... sigh......

I think it is often a haven - away from the crazy that is old city on the weekends. My favorite time though is during the week, in the evenings, when Frank Sinatra is playing the lights are dimmed and they have just made me the most perfect drink (an old fashion for my husband and a Dark and Stormy for me). The bartender who has a wonderful Irish accent just makes it more perfect! 

I look up and see that the deer head is always festive depending on the time of year. Halloween, Christmas, Valentine&apos;s Day and yes it will be dressed appropriately. 

They have a few tables. You can eat lunch or dinner. 

But for me it&apos;s sitting at the bar the doors opened and hearing old city streets come alive. 

Sassafras.....oh how I miss you."
4,"This is a very cute bar on that Second Street block (with Cuba Libre and Plough &amp; Stars) where I hung out as a kid (college kid). I was surprised to see so many old standards still in existence, and sad I hadn&apos;t stumbled on Sassafras back when. But it was a very fun stop on our First Friday, and definitely a place I&apos;d like to visit again!

My son was asleep in his stroller, so I popped my head in to ask if baby was allowed? The bartender graciously welcomed us in, and helped us to the best spot for the stroller. It was Happy Hour time, but their HH offers didn&apos;t apply to their craft cocktail menu, which I wanted, nor do they offer any HH food specials.

My husband had the Summer in Manhattan, I had the Whiskey Sour. I much preferred mine, and my husband wished he&apos;d chosen it. The WS was made with raw egg white, which put me off a little (I am a total food chicken these days), but when the bartender explained the lime would &quot;cook&quot; it, I got brave. It added so much to the drink. It gave it more substance without being heavy or changing the liquid&apos;s density. It was not a typical WS, but it was better than any I&apos;ve ever had. I don&apos;t think I can appreciate the cocktail in future venues now that I had the Sassafras version. Seriously.

The Summer in Manhattan was well done, but again, did not compare to the WS. I think if it&apos;d been compared to another drink it would stand out, but the clear champ was the WS.

My husband also had coffee, which was standard, good.

The bartender was very personable (sorry we did not get his name), and the few other patrons there in the late afternoon were friendly enough, enjoying themselves in a mellow way.

The old tile on the walls and floor is really neat to see conserved, although preserved is another story. For example Franklin Fountain has spared no expense in preserving/restoring all the Victorian features of its interior, and everything is fresh as the day it was new. Sassafras could stand to do some upkeep on the ceiling tile paint, the missing or chipped mosaic tiles, woodwork, etc. I get that this is a bar, which will see more clumsy drunk wear than a cutsie tourist ice cream joint, and it may not be worth the effort, but it&apos;s a shame nonetheless. The drinks are high end, and the food menu looked very now. The prices were reasonable for what you get, but when you&apos;re offering a fine standard for your fare, maybe put a little back into your historic ambiance? This would have added a lot for me. I think it would make more clear the intended purpose and mission of this place. I think the drinks and food deserve it.

Anyway, it was a nice stop, a cool spot to relax and hang before the galleries on First Friday, and I can imagine, a fun place on the weekend partying. Would definitely return!"
4,"My friend and I came here around 9:30 on a Friday night for a late dinner and drinks. The space is pretty dark but nicely decorated, giving it a speakeasy vibe. 

I got the French 95 (Buffalo Trace bourbon, lemon, simple syrup, champagne, angostura bitters, lemon twist) and my friend got the French 75 (New Amsterdam gin, simple syrup, champagne, orange bitters, lemon twist). Both drinks were so refreshing and delicious! 

I wasn&apos;t super hungry, so I just got the Baked Brie appetizer (triple creme Brie in phyllo dough served with house made prosecco strawberry jam). It was incredibly good, but pretty small. My friend got the Tavern Grilled Cheese Sandwich (boursin, gouda, sharp white cheddar, and tomato) which was also delicious. 

The only reason I&apos;m docking a star is because service was really slow; it looked like only one staff member was attending to all of the tables. However, I do plan to come back and try some of the other cocktails!"
