5,"For the past week, I have been coming here more often rather than a competitor&apos;s coffee chain.  I have found that I not only crave my freshly brewed Corsica, but that it actually tastes like good coffee!  It doesn&apos;t upset my stomach but it gives me the perk that I need to get going.  I had been frequently going to a competitor with bitter coffee, or the alternatives were other cheap coffee or way overpriced coffee at other places.  Corsica has become my sweet spot!  It&apos;s nice that I usually don&apos;t need more than a cup, if I do, I get a refill for .75, but just so you know, they have a $1 minimum.  As far as other beverages, I like the herbal Turmeric Iced Tea, which is really good.  I have friends who rave about the Black and Tan, and the Iced Chai.  

I also have found that I really enjoy the Chobani yogurt to start my day with, or if I want a pastry, these pastries are the bomb!  I am personally a fan of the scrumptious chocolate chip muffin, but it&apos;s big enough for 2 portions, fun to split with someone.

The ambiance here is relaxed and chill, friendly baristas, low volume music, which is very nice for a change compared to other coffee shops that seem like dance clubs with the loud music, lol!  The tables and chairs are nice to relax at, I often bring my paper or knitting.  They do have outdoor seating and they overlook Dilworth Park.  


I&apos;m a fan!  A lot of people love this spot because it often gets busy, with only one line sometimes, but it moves quickly.  Nice way to start the day!!!   Makes me rethink my morning cup of coffee..."
4,"I&apos;ve had their coffee plenty of times. I&apos;m always a fan. 

This last weekend I switched it up and tried the Oatmilk chai latte. I was surprised it was a cold drink as it seemed to be a fall special. But it was pretty tasty. 

I was in and out fairly quickly. No complaints."
4,"Coming from Florida, I always drink the store version of La Colombe Coffee. I am a huge fan, so being in Philly I wanted to visit one of their coffee shops for the first time. I am not sure what I was expecting, but I was pleasantly surprised! This location, conveniently located in the middle of the city, had super kind baristas that worked quickly to fulfill all orders. The place itself also felt very cozy inside. The coffee was delicious and you could tell it was a high quality roast."
3,"The coffee at this place is quite good, second in my opinion to Blue Bottle in quality (I know, it&apos;s a chain, but they have really good coffee). The barista at La Colombe offered me a sample of the draft latte in a cute little express cup, which tasted almost like bitter coffee ice cream - delicious. The regular latte I got had nice subtle flavor too. 

My complaint is that this place is not great for doing work. Most of the seating does not have backs, the tables are a bit too jumbled to feel peaceful and organized. Great for a place to catch up with someone, not so much to study. Nice view of City Hall across the street!"
4,"There&apos;s limited seating and the chairs aren&apos;t very comfortable so it may not be the best place to be doing work, but there&apos;s a great view of City hall across the street. The oat milk draft latte is delicious!! I came in the afternoon for a quick pick-me-up cup of coffee with some friends and it was a great place to just sit down and recharge."
4,"I like the atmosphere and energy of this La Columbe - it&apos;s usually never too barren nor too packed.  The baristas are usually pretty friendly and skilled.  It&apos;s a fabulous spot for people watching, what being near city hall, too.

What else is there to say?  It&apos;s a Philly favorite.  Try their unsweetened hot chocolate or an oat milk latte."
3,"I really enjoyed La Colombe draft lattes in the can so I had been wanting to come here for awhile to taste it for myself. I don&apos;t know what I was expecting before arriving but I certainly don&apos;t think it was the experience I had. First off the place isn&apos;t that big but the front counter area is massive. There&apos;s minimal seating and it&apos;s all very low and small - a table for 2 rather than larger tables. Most of the tables were taken so I&apos;m assuming it&apos;s a pretty popular spot. I didn&apos;t know what I wanted and I realized there was no menu on the wall. How do I order then? I&apos;ve never been here before. I finally see a black card about as big as a 5x7 notecard that had about 10 items listed on it and I was able to order that way. The staff than placed a spoon and a plate in front of me and I just waited not sure if I was supposed to wait there or move to the side ... then a plastic cup was placed in front of me. Why a plastic cup when I was sitting in? Why a plastic cup when I was given a regular plate and a regular spoon. Nonetheless I sat down I found one seat available. The coffee was good but different. I do love their draft lattes they&apos;re so smooth and delicious but I got mine with oat milk because I was excited for the option, but it definitely hindered the flavor I&apos;m used to. 
The staff, which there seemed to be a lot of, wasn&apos;t super friendly. They didn&apos;t talk to patrons, they seemed almost bothered or bored. One guest spilled his entire coffee and the one woman behind the counter just seemed pissed off. 
I also don&apos;t like the bathroom location because here really isn&apos;t anywhere to wait for it as it&apos;s so close to the counter and other tables and I had two people cut in front of me to use it. 
I think this space isn&apos;t efficiently designed and I was a little lost while there. I don&apos;t like going to places where I question every decision. Do I leave my cup and plate on the table? Do I bring it to the counter? Certain things weren&apos;t clear or obvious so I feel like they should be explained because not everyone inherently knows or is a regular that knows."
5,"By far my favorite coffee place in Philly! So many great coffee options to choose from, sometimes it&apos;s hard to decide. Their draft lattes are excellent, they have multiple drip coffees available to please everyone&apos;s palate, and they have a nice selection of retail options (from ground and whole bean coffees, to canned cold brews and draft lattes) as well. They also have a wide variety of pastries and breakfast options for those looking to grab a bite to eat, and it&apos;s always very fresh! They have some seating options in the store as well, which is nice when you need to complete some work while enjoying your coffee or just take a break from a busy day."
4,"Believe this is the first-ever location of La Colombe. Not as awesome as the Fishtown flagship, but still reliable. Chocolate chip cookie was decent and my boyfriend enjoyed his iced coffee. Lots of seating, and water on tap per usual."
3,"Three stars because this store isn&apos;t great. It&apos;s still a La Colombe and I love it but it&apos;s tiny and it was crowded and noisy at 2 p.m. Nowhere to sit and you could barely get in line. I much prefer the Rittenhouse location. This location is convenient but the setup is awful and combined with the crowds, it was hell. Staff was friendly despite the out-of-order espresso machine, which was impressive. I guess that&apos;s when the draft lattes truly come in handy. Great staff but I&apos;d skip this location in the future."
4,"This location serves up the tasty La Colombe coffee and drinks as expected, and with a great view!

Stopped in two mornings in a row since I was staying nearby and each day got my usual iced latte with a pastry.

La Colombe really makes one of my favorirte iced lattes and most of the time, each location is consistent!  For the pastries, went with a beignet &amp; chocolate croissant the first day, then a cinnamon danish.  Not sure where the pastries are from, but all are very good and make for great snack.  

Overall, great location, although the staff wasn&apos;t as friendly as other locations I&apos;ve been to."
5,"This is such a happy place to be in as a coffee snob. They serve two types of drip coffee, two types of espresso, and three different types of pour over everyday. I came here for morning coffee and ordered the Malawi espresso as an Americano. It  was smooth, refined, and pleasant to the taste buds. The coffee was so good that I came back again during lunch. I ordered the Lizzo espresso, which was also a solid, great tasting blend. 

If you drink at the store, they serve the coffee on a beautiful ceramic cup. You also get to sit on what looks like natural wooden stools with smooth surfaces. Or you can sit outside while marveling at the grandeur of the City Hall.

I think La Colombe definitely lives up to the reputation as one of the better national specialty coffee brands for how they present themselves."
5,"We stopped by here for a quick tea and coffee while walking about and exploring the area. This place has a beautiful view of City Hall, and some prime seating to enjoy people-watching while resting your feet. We were lucky to nab a table since it does get busy. I know it&apos;s known for coffee, but having already had a cappuccino that morning, I decided not to push it, and tried some jasmine oolong instead. It was fragrant and delicious. My friend enjoyed his Americano quite a bit, describing it as &quot;full-bodied.&quot; I appreciated the interior and vibe of the place, including the cool tables. Everyone working there was very nice. I would enjoy stopping by again when I&apos;m back in the area!"
5,"Can&apos;t beat this location. We had cappuccinos and got some work done while sitting by the window. We were lucky to be seated next to outlets, but outlets were definitely not easily accessible for everyone. The tables and decor were beautiful! I also like the water available in yellow glass glasses and the dove theme throughout the cafe."
5,"Despite there almost always being a line, the staff here have better management skills than most cafes I&apos;ve been to. I&apos;m always super impressed with how rich their coffee (especially espresso!) is and it&apos;s a stark comparison to the drivel I usually put in my body. I actually really love the pastries they have (and kind of wishing I knew where they get them from...). There&apos;s something for pretty much everyone and at any time of day. The cheese danish is my favorite but anything flakey and buttery does the job for me.

Oh, but if you&apos;re around during the fall, -definitely- snatch a Pumpkin Draft Latte (or a case if you&apos;re feeling hooked) from the refrigerator for probably the best packaged coffee drink you&apos;ll ever have."
5,"Makers of the best and smoothest lattes around. These folk truly respect the craft.

With all the dinge, grey, and scaffolds surrounding City Hall, La Colombe offers a nice, naturally lit, inviting space - such a sight for sore eyes. They have huge people-watching windows, are always well staffed, and move that line right along. Their system works and I&apos;m grateful I can get in and out quickly or just hang out if the day calls for it. 

I tend to go on off-peak/ late morning hours and my coffee is always consistent, has that great smooth taste, and guaranteed to bring me back. Never disappointed :)"
5,"I love this coffee spot, and wish there were more La Colombe spots versus just DD and Starbucks. The price of their coffee is incredibly reasonable and it is AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS. 

We have come here several times when in downtown, especially to warm up during Mummer&apos;s parades and Christmas Village shopping, and have never been disappointed. I also love that they serve you with real spoons (and real mugs) and explain to you the coffee if you are not familiar. The whole vibe in there is very chill and not rushing you out like a Dunkin or Starbucks. 

Overall I highly recommend this spot, especially if you are in the area and need to warm up with a delicious cup of coffee or hot chocolate."
5,"Every La Colombe is a special place. I visit every time I&apos;m back in Philly, and if it&apos;s available elsewhere I will seek it out, as I did on a trip to DC.

In Denver, all we have is the canned draft latte at Whole Foods, an occasional spendy indulgence that is worth the price.

This location has fewer seats and tables than other locations, but I always manage a place to sit and enjoy my drink. They make a good cortado, served in a glass--I won&apos;t order an espresso drink if I have to have it in paper. I&apos;m fussy that way.

The ceramic mugs for coffee are pretty and make the whole experience a bit more civilized, even elegant. I&apos;ve always loved that they give you a spoon and a saucer, even for a to-go drink, so that you can add sugar or cream and stir your drink without making a mess.

On my most recent trip, I had a drip coffee with a workshop blend from Mexico that was so delicious that I would shudder at the thought of adding cream or sugar.

It&apos;s a high-end coffee experience with less attitude than some third wave coffee outlets.

There are always good pastries too, like delicious canelés."
2,"Location is usually crowded durning peak hours going until 11am at times. There can be a line that circles around the entrance just like the rittenhouse location. It is usually extremely noisy with people having meetings there. 

Great coffee, unfortunately the majority of millennial coffee drinkers in the area agree. 

If you&apos;re looking for a cafe to do some work on laptop or read a book, I&apos;d recommend bluestone lane just a block east. Try their Aussie known flat white and any food served in a cute to-go gift box!"
4,"Came back here to get an iced mocha (cornerstone) and it wasn&apos;t nearly as sweet as I would&apos;ve hoped (but that&apos;s nothing a little sugar can&apos;t fix)! The reason I updated my review to 4 stars is because the customer service was a bit lacking. The barista was helpful in answering my questions but I couldn&apos;t sense her fatigue. I don&apos;t blame her for this but it did affect my mood as a customer. However, I understand that people have their off days and that no one really wants to work on a holiday (Memorial Day). Overall though, I enjoyed my experience."
