5,"Fresh seafood across the board. Their tower of raw seafood is an amazing assortment of sweet oysters, sumptuous scallop ceviche, shrimp, clams, topped with a lobster...a must and well worth it.
Fisherman&apos;s Stew is amazing, outstanding flavor mimicking a bouillabaisse! Lobster roll is good, although I prefer traditional steamed with butter.
Requested a cocktail not on the menu (Corpse Reviver2) and the bar willingly complied and it was great.
Dine-in experience is outstanding in the midst of this pandemic. I will be back!"
5,"The food here was delicious! This was one of the first outdoor fall dining experiences that I had since COVID and it did not disappoint. 

We had heaters to warm us and the seating distance was great as the middle of the street was blocked off. I felt very safe with masks worn by staff were worn properly.

Now let&apos;s get to the food! It was great! The fried oysters melted in our mouths and the mustard salad beyond delish! Their fries and aioli dipping sauce was great too. The others in our party said their food was very tasty as well. I&apos;d definitely visit the Oyster House again when I visit Philly. The seafood and food overall was very fresh! 

Great times, great food, and COVID safe! Win-win!"
5,"Oyster House is the best place to get shellfish in Center City! Whether it&apos;s in the middle of winter or during the summer, Oyster House is perfect for any occasion. Pre-pandemic, it was a great place to meet up with friends and hang out with good food and drinks. Long waits even after peak dinner time. With or without COVID-19, Oyster House is just as busy as ever. Since I still don&apos;t feel quite comfortable dining inside, we&apos;ve been ordering from Oyster House for pick-up. 

PARKING: Right in the middle of Sansom street, you&apos;re going to have a hard time. Either cough up for expensive garage parking or drive around to find metered parking and walk on over.

FOOD: I&apos;ve never ordered oysters to-go before and I will say Oyster House does pack all their food very securely. When we order a dozen oysters to go, they pack the oysters on sturdy-ish cardboard, on top of ice, and with a plastic cover to lock them in place. Oyster House also packs all the sauces in secure to-go containers to minimize possible spillage. I also highly recommend getting their calamari and fried oysters if you can. Sadly, because they are super busy pretty much all the time, a lot of things on their regular menu does run out. I&apos;d call a little earlier and actually ask what they have available because we&apos;ve been unlucky when ordering around evening time for some of our favorites, like the lobster roll. 

PRICE: If you come during happy hour, the price is a steal for the quality of the oysters. For quality seafood, you will be paying a little bit more than you would for a casual meal. Oyster House is definitely for special occasions.

Overall: If you&apos;re in Philly and you love seafood, you have to give Oyster House a try. One of the best raw bars I&apos;ve been to, and the vibes here are modern, yet not-too-fussy. You&apos;ll see a mix of people on a night out with friends to couples dressed to the nines on a dinner date."
5,"Got here just in time for happy hour on a bustling Saturday evening. While we waited for a table inside we enjoyed happy hour outdoors under covered heated seating. Great prices &amp; some warmth, really can&apos;t go wrong. We waited no more than 20 minutes and our table was ready. Inside tables were spread out and limited to a certain amount of people there were also dividers around the raw bar. I felt totally safe dining here and they did temp check us at the door.  Now on to the food- superb. The dishes are really thoughtful, beautiful &amp; fresh. 

After having one dollar oysters and beers during happy hour we started with some grilled oysters, seafood salad and lobster bisque for dinner. The lobster bisque was creamy rich and delicious. It had nice chunks of tender lobster in it. The seafood salad was a pleasant surprise being a special of the day, we didn&apos;t really know what to expect. The dressing was very light and citrusy while  being a tad bit creamy pairing very nicely with the fresh shrimp mussels and calamari. Another showstopper was the grilled oysters! They somehow get the Parmesan to remain in a liquid state melting together with the butter and oyster. Might need two orders of those! Also loved the sea bass and the fried seafood platter.Everything we ate was delicious."
3,"We popped in here for brunch! Heavy seafood options, which made it hard for my vegetarian wife to really digest the menu and find something she could eat.

On a positive note, they were more than willing to be accomodating and make her a special dish. But it wasn&apos;t advetersied and we had to ask, which is a less than a desirable situation. SOLID bloody Mary&apos;s - don&apos;t miss out on this."
1,"happy hour not happy! 
if you are Asian, you can&apos;t get seated until your whole party arrived.  but my next table is group of  Americans, and they can get seated for half hour  and later  join with more people!  shame! never come back again! I feel that Asian are not welcome here!"
4,"My husband and I were in the mood for something different over the weekend so we decided to treat ourselves to delivery from Oyster House. Two entrees, plus all the associated delivery fees, came close to $70, but we enjoyed our entrees and were happy to have a night off from cooking. 

I had the pan roasted flounder with broccoli, chickpeas and tahini. I wasn&apos;t crazy about the tahini and would likely ask for that on the side next time. The fish was cooked perfectly, however, and the dish was overall a nice, healthy meal. My husband had the fisherman&apos;s stew which had great flavor. 

I&apos;d love if Oyster House offered some healthy sides like roasted vegetables or baked potatoes. We weren&apos;t feeling fries or salads so we ended up making a side at home to complement our entrees. Solid experience overall, though, and we&apos;d definitely order from them again!"
5,"Crab cakes and oysters are SO worth the trip. Although there might be a slight wait, you&apos;ll understand why. 

Our waitress was such a doll. She was so kind, funny, and extremely pleasant personally. She never rushed us, gave great recommendations for food and good conversation skills."
4,"My husband and I came here in a cold Saturday morning. Fortunately they have outdoor heaters. Our waiter was nice and helpful.

Oysters are fresh. Tuna poke is served with black rice.  There&apos;s not much rice in it so it&apos;s not a heavy meal. Tuna is fresh. I ordered mustard green salad with grilled salmon. There are charred grill marks which creates bitter taste to my fish. Maybe next time I need to ask for medium rare. Salad is served with shaved cheddar cheese and pecans and not drenched with dressing. The size of the salad is small. Overall the salad itself blends well. 

My husband enjoyed his Bloody Mary"
5,"So good! Love their cocktails, killer oysters (although could use some more west coast ones) tuna poke bowl and scallops are delicious! Still thinking about that poke bowl a day later!"
3,The Shrimp Risotto was good but nothing out of this world. I tried grilled oysters for the first time and decided they are not for me. Will stick with raw/fried going forward. The restaurant is spacious and clean. Overall a fine dinner but have no specific reason to return
5,Omg this place tho!!!!!! The oysters are addicting and let me tell you coupled with dirty martini you&apos;re golden
5,Great oysters! But with a name such as Oyster House that&apos;s expected. I have had salads for lunch which were hefty and delicious as well. The often praised happy hour is so-so in my opinion. I wasnt too excited. Their oyster shooters are more like oyster shots.
3,"Happened upon this place walking around Philly. The staff was very welcoming and nice. No indoor dining, but sat outside under tent with properly spaced tables with heaters. Was pretty busy at 2:00. 

The fried oysters with chicken salad was delish - I thought the combo strange at first but was advised this is a &quot;very Philly thing&quot; so went for it. I was very happy with my fisherman&apos;s stew - nice flavor and good on a chilly day, spicy but also a tad sweet. My partner was not as satisfied with the lobster roll.

If I could give 3.5 stars, I would."
5,Can&apos;t say enough great things about the Oyster house. If I could give 100 stars I would! Anything in the menu is to die for.
4,"Overall, it was a good meal. But, some items weren&apos;t impressive. The calamari was on the bland side. The fries weren&apos;t crispy nor fluffy. The fish was just okay. The upside is that the items tasted fresh. The mussels weren&apos;t small either. The service was great."
4,This spot is on the map always expect it to be crowded so you may have a little wait. But it can be worth it. My favorite from which I have tried here has to be the lobster roll. A killer way better then any other that I have had in Philadelphia. And if your eating at the chefs table you get to see all the action going down like oysters being shucked and plated. Looking for fresh seafood this is one of the top spots in center city!
3,"Ordered the Fisherman Stew and Mixed Seafood Grill to go. The amount of positive reviews made me feel I would get a great meal at this price point. However I wasn&apos;t impressed. While the Fisherman Stew good (not great) the Mixed Seafood Grill at $33 was a complete fail. My dinner was a disappointment and left me unsatisfied. No flavor whatsoever in any aspect of the dish. Everything was simply grilled without seasonings, leaving a taste of char behind. Gave it 3 stars because the staff was very nice."
5,"We needed to get out yesterday so called upon and old favorite; The Oyster House. It did not let down; our waitress was great greeting us right away and very friendly grabbing our drink and apps order. Apps were simple but delicious; grilled Brussels sprouts, calamari and we shared soup. We each had a lobster roll which was fresh and tasty although I&apos;m not a fan of scallions!  In and out in less than 2 hours and reasonably priced we will be sure to be back!"
5,My business partner and I went for a long overdue meeting a fortnight ago. The cuisine was delectable and facilitated a productive Business and personal dinner. Our 36 oysters went down like water but tasted much better.  Highly recommend the kushhis and the Little Rock oysters. Definitely would recommend
