5,"FIRST OFF, the portions are HUGE! 

Like my omelette felt like it was 4 eggs and not 2 but I finished a little over half of it. The home fries were under-seasoned but the eggs made up for it. The turkey bacon was cooked perfectly. Oh, the omelette was veggie as well. 

My mom and sister had the rest of there food the next day because the eggs and home fries were too much and they also got pancakes which they loved. They kept asking me if I wanted to try it and I refused because I wanted to finish my own food. 

My brother loved the blueberries a little too much, like he had my mom go back the next day for more pancakes and bacon; ha. 

I don&apos;t have any pictures because it was take out but it&apos;s worth the visit."
5,"I am a big fan of Sabrina&apos;s and their friendly vegan environment (also great for meat eaters too).

However, despite how much I love Sabrina&apos;s, I love my sense of responsibility even more. I am very apprehensive to dine out during the peak of Covid. The only place in town so far that I feel somewhat at ease only when it&apos;s not busy during working hours is at Sabrina&apos;s.

Their menu is cool and they have plenty of variety of non-dairy creamers to go with your coffee.

Pluses to help minimize risk w Covid
- take out available of course, you order ahead of time and pick up (you can&apos;t go inside if you&apos;re picking up)
- you cannot just walk in. This is monitored based on how busy they are and on the size of your party. Use Yelp&apos;s get in line feature in advanced to see the current situation.
- servers wear masks AND face guards
- plexiglass separates the booths: a huge plus
- hand sanitizers at every table
- cool servers and very attentive

Unfortunately, no outdoor dining at this location, a negative... so therefore; I don&apos;t recommend staying here for longer than 1 hour. And they don&apos;t recommend you to stay longer than 75 minutes during the weekend.

Still not ideal for families or seniors to dine here during Covid as it is a small space. you are better off ordering take out and staying home! Be safe everyone!"
5,"Great food and service! I was visiting Philly, found this nice soot with outdoor seating."
4,"This review is about excellent customer service, it&apos;s rare nowadays but I received it today. I ordered breakfast from grubhub, everything looked great until I got to the star of breakfast which was the pancake for me. It looked extremely mangled and almost mix matched. I call and without question the lady asked how I would like the issue resolved. She spoke to the owner and again without question or hesitation they offer a new pancake. 

I ate the grits, eggs and bacon which were all delicious."
3,"A few people standing around outside for tables during the Saturday afternoon brunch rush. Surprisingly only a 15 minute wait for a table of two, and they text as soon as it becomes available.

Decided on the Chicken &amp; Waffle ($15) to go along with a cup of coffee ($3). The buttermilk waffle is split in two with a giant breaded chicken breast placed on top - served alongside maple syrup and herb butter. Waffle is your standard fare, going well with the syrup. Butter is a bit too hard to spread so wasn&apos;t able to use too much of it. Chicken itself juicy on the inside, however the breading lacked much flavor aside from the added salt. Had to use some hot sauce to give it the kick the dish needed.

Service here is up and down; they are efficient in getting people in and out but can lose you in the shuffle. Looks like this place is BYOB, so that&apos;s an option if trying to brunch hard."
4,"You just can&apos;t go wrong at Sabrinas. Looking for brunch? Look no further. 

They have multiple locations around the city.

Serve breakfast all day!

The portions are huge, and they a lot of options for eggs and different breakfast sandwiches. I have been here multiple times, and there is not one item on the menu you can go wrong with."
5,"This was the last place we went to for breakfast. Honestly this place was amazing and there&apos;s not too many complaints I have about this restaurant.
Cons
My one and only con about this restaurant is the boobs are way too tight. My stepfather who has a big belly wasn&apos;t able to properly sit in the move because it was pushing on his stomach. Other than that that&apos;s my only complaint.
Pros
Wow the food was amazing so I ordered the bagel and lox and it was outstanding. The salmon did not taste fishy whatsoever and it just felt so refreshing to eat this meal. 
I also had the other half of my brothers stuffed French toast and OMG this thing is amazing. It was a type of meal that I kept on taking bites and I felt bad that was eating it because it was that good. 
The service was excellent as well our waitress was on the ball and was really friendly. She was outstanding and I have nothing negative to say about her."
4,Went early this Sunday morning and were sat right away! There were only 2 of us but we got 4 meals because we wanted to try it all!  The omelettes are huge and come with home fries and toast.  The toast did not come buttered which is my favorite part. The home fries were great &amp; perfectly crispy on the outside.  The chocolate chip pancakes were nothing special just pretty normal pancakes &amp; also not buttered.  The huevos rancheros and stuffed  french toast with bananas were delicious.  The rancheros were piled very high with good flavor and awesome guac.  The french toast had thick bread with a sweet cream cheese filling that will satisfy all your sweet tooth cravings.  The food came out quickly and everything is reasonably priced!  Can&apos;t wait to go back for lunch!
4,"The chicken and waffles were good. The chicken wasn&apos;t dry (but could&apos;ve used more seasoning) waffle was average, but overall I wasn&apos;t dissatisfied. The portion was huge so you get your money&apos;s worth and it didn&apos;t taste terrible."
5,"Popular place! We got on the waitlist and got a text when our table was ready - it was about a 30 minute wait. The inside was spaced out to a point that we were comfortable dining in, and the decor was adorable! We had the cannoli French toast and the Mexican scramble, they were delicious. Very friendly staff."
5,One of my fav brunch spots sooooooo goood ughh! Even their salads are freaking delicious. Highly recommend their buff chicken salad.
2,"We ordered takeout from Sabrina&apos;s cafe because it it is by far one of my favorite brunch spots in Philadelphia. 

I&apos;m not sure if anyone else has had this issue before, but they literally threw a banana on top of my French toast. With the peel on. Is it clean? I guess we&apos;ll never know. Disappointing for sure."
5,The service and food was excellent! I&apos;ve gone to the one in Collingswood and the food has been perfectly made as well.
4,"When I came here it was FREEZING and we sat outside, but let me tell you, it was pretty worth it! I&apos;m not sure if you can tell the size of my french toast from the picture but it was like a whole loaf of bread on my plate and every bite was amazing! Even still good reheated since I couldn&apos;t finish the whole thing. I got the pumpkin French toast special and it was sooo good! I decided to double down on pumpkin and also got the pumpkin pie latte! It was also a hefty size latte! The portions were great and the waitress was very nice! Great brunch place overall!"
4,"I came here for brunch on a Saturday. It was super popular and crowded. We put our names on the list and waited about 30 mins for a table of 3. I ordered cold brew and one of the day specials. I can&apos;t remember the exact name of it, but it was a short rib sandwich. I love the salad. It was fresh and the dressing was so good. The sandwich was delicious! In my opinion, it needed more sauce but when you get it, it is really good. I ended up ordering another for takeout."
3,"Let me preface by saying: WE ARE IN GLOBAL PANDEMIC AND I WILL COME BACK AGAIN!

While I am extremely thankful that Sabrina&apos;s Cafe was open and available to feed me in a time of need. I gotta keep it real. While the dine in experience may be significantly better the take out experience was not that impressive. 

Let&apos;s start with the ordering process,  very smooth and simple. I&apos;d recommend you have your form of payment handy and available. Once ordered the food was done in 15mins.  

Now here is my issue. The transportation of the food from the restaurant to home was problematic. I&apos;m assuming due to the packaging and the temperature of the food. By the time I got home, the waffles and chicken became soggy. 

I know this isn&apos;t 100% their fault but when you are charging $15.00 for breakfast, I need the packaging to be right for take out and not lose out on the experience. Again, I will be back when things return to &quot;normal&quot; to provide an update. Hopefully this is can help others as well. In the meantime, thank you to the staff at Sabrina&apos;s Cafe for providing great customer service."
4,"We ordered Sabrina&apos;s delivery for breakfast during Covid stay-at-home. when the driver arrived to Sabrina&apos;s to pick up our order, they were notified that the restaurant was out of avocado toast, and scrapple. So the delivery person called me, and I replaced that order with stuffed challah French toast. I was bummed that I waited 30 mins to even find out the avocado toast was missing; the restaurant should have called me or made a note in the electronic delivery app, so the driver wasn&apos;t sitting there waiting for a new meal to be cooked for me. But, nonetheless, our food arrived an hour later and was still amazingly delicious... which is the most important thing! And the delivery company refunded us the money for the mix-up, so that was very generous! Bonus: the scrapple was in our order, even after they told us it was out! And it was delicious also. 

My husband got the huevos rancheros, it was pretty good, and I got stuffed challah French toast which was amazing. The restaurant packed it up with everything on the side for delivery, a whole banana which I cut up myself, syrup on the side, and I added my own powdered sugar and blueberries from my kitchen. It was nice that it wasn&apos;t soggy by the time it was delivered to me, but annoying that I had to build it all myself. But hey, small price to pay for an amazing breakfast and I&apos;m most thankful that Sabrina&apos;s is still open during these rough times when no one can dine-in. 

My several dine-in experiences at this restaurant from the past few years have also been great, so I&apos;ll always come back to Sabrina&apos;s! Deeee-licious!"
5,"BRUNCH!!! Best place for brunch in the Art Museum area - Especially because its BYOB! Tip - add yourself to the Yelp waitlist ahead of time if you&apos;re going on a Saturday or Sunday. They have fresh squeezed OJ for your mimosa, and any other mixies you want for your champagne. We truly didn&apos;t know what we wanted so we went with what our waitress suggested! I got the Chicken &amp; Waffles, perfectly sweet and savory! The best cure for a hangover ... or just a greasy breakfast (; My friends who I went with got the Short Stack with Bananas which were yummy and a good price. Other friend got the Stuffed Pumpkin French Toast (a Fall special) which was new, different and worth the risk!"
5,"Amazing BYOB brunch spot! I can see why this is such a popular brunch spot, the food is insanely good, comes in large portions, and comes in large selection! We got a range of dishes, from loaded tater tots to chicken and waffles, huevos rancheros and french toast!

Highly recommend!"
4,"Sabrina&apos;s is a great brunch spot near the art Museum! Visited on a Sunday morning around 10:45 and waited about 45 minutes for a table for 3. This place is always very busy in the mornings so be sure to utilize the Yelp &quot;waitlist&quot; feature so you can wait from home! Food was delicious- two of us had avocado toast with poached eggs and one had huevos rancheros. Huge portions! Service was a bit slow, but not holding that against them as serving and dining in this COVID-19 environment is a bit tricky. Also BYOB so be sure to bring champagne and they will supply the OJ! Will definitely be back"
