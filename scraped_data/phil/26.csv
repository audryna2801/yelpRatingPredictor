5,"Butcher and Singer is by far the best restaurant I ever been too! The best meal I had in my life. lol 
My date had made reservations for us however we decided to sit at the bar. The bartender service was excellent, the meal was immaculate! I am a lover of salmon which I have never tried skin up before. It was the most flavorful salmon I ever had! He had the chicken, which appeared to be good of course I had to have a bite! anddd boy was I correct... LOL it was the most Juiciest piece of meat I ever consumed! and I can&apos;t forget the bread! SO GOOD! 
We went a while ago! I am just getting around to updating my yelp experience because I tried to go again but due to COVID-19 the restaurant has been closed. I cannot wait to visit again! I am sure I will get the same thing... stay tuned! 
Also Philadelphia is one of my favorite cities to visit! :)"
5,I had never had bone-in filet mignon before... Until a friend of mine told me to try this place! I ordered to go (because of COVID) and it was STILL easily one of the best steaks I&apos;ve ever had in my life even after taking it out of a plastic container. I CANNOT wait to sit down and eat here when the pandemic is over. I dream about that steak!
5,Went here for the first time and loved it. Our waiter Bryant was awesome. The meat was cooked to perfection and great social distancing practices. The oyster and seafood tower were really fresh as well. No complaints.
5,I&apos;m obsessed with steak and I was impressed. Didn&apos;t like the potatoe side dish but the rest was great. The logos are cute
5,"My favorite steakhouse in Philly!!!!! Delicious and perfectly made steaks. 100% recommend the Oscar sauce (jumbo lump crab, asparagus and bearnaise sauce) - very yummy on the steaks.
The service is very professional and the staff is very friendly and courteous."
5,Celebrated my anniversary here tonight. Everything was perfect and Stacey took great care of us. Everything came out perfect. I would definitely return!
1,Was looking forward to coming to the establishment. Had the first reservation from open table. Was told to sit outside. When I asked for accommodation the manager had a nasty attitude. took my night to Fogo De Chao.
5,"I went to Butcher and Singer during my bachelor party weekend because I wanted one of the best steaks in the city. I had done my research and it led me here.
I&apos;ll start with the appetizers and sides. My friends and I all shared the steak tartare which was incredibly fresh and flavorful. For sides we ordered the mashed potatoes and green beans amandine. The potatoes were very smooth and the green beans were especially crisp, just how I like them. All of this could&apos;ve been a meal by itself. But this wasn&apos;t why I was here.
Onto the steak. After some careful deliberation, my brother and I agreed to share the 28-day dry aged porterhouse for two. The first bite told me everything. It was juicy and incredibly well seasoned. It was really one of the best I&apos;ve had, if not the top. I&apos;ve been craving it ever since. I don&apos;t want to go back, I NEED to go back."
5,Atmosphere is something you won&apos;t find anywhere else in Philly. 1920s-30s moody charm. The baked Alaska and Mac and cheese are to die for.
4,Fiancé made reservations here during my birthday weekend celebration in Philly. The food and service was fantastic. We ordered the Steak Tartare as an appetizer followed by 28-Day Dry Aged Aged Porterhouse for 2 ($105) as main course with a side of stuffed hash and Creme Brûlée for dessert. All the dishes were delicious and we were completely stuffed by the end of the night.  The only thing I would say is that the wine pour was really small compared to typical restaurants and the cocktail menu can use a refresher. We only ordered one round of drinks as a result.
5,"So happy to have been able to dine inside! Beautiful dining room with two magnificent chandeliers, cool dim lighting, creating a relaxed mood. We were seated in a booth with comfy high leather backs. Great service experience. The team of folks working to take care of our table were friendly, welcoming and knowledgeable.
After selecting a few drinks from the bar, we ordered a selection of appetizers including the crab cake, king crab cocktail and fried calamari. Each was prepared and presented beautifully. The steaks and salmon our group ordered for entrees were succulent and delicious. Each of the side dishes turned out fantastic. I would recommend trying the hash brown potato for something a bit different. Lastly the desserts that we sampled, inclusive of the chocolate cake and the baked Alaska were decadent. Baked Alaska was a great combination of sponge cake, banana ice cream and brûlée&apos;d merengue peaks. Quite the treat!"
5,"My boyfriend and I came to Butcher and Singer for restaurant week. We had reservations for 5pm, so right when they open for dinner. We were seated quickly and the hostess took our coats. 

Everything about this experience was great. We started off with one of the white wine specials that our waitress told us about, which ran about $11/glass. For our meal, we started with delicious warm biscuits. My boyfriend had the cesar salad and I had the mushroom soup. Both were amazing. For our main course, we both ordered the steak. For an upcharge I got blue cheese on mine and he got truffle butter. As for our sides we got mashed potatoes and creamed spinach. I liked the creamed spinach, but I would definitely just get the mashed potatoes instead next time. 

By the time dessert came around, we were both so full but we made it through. I got the chocolate pot de crème and my boyfriend got the blood orange sorbet. The sorbet was light and delicious, which was perfect after such a filling meal. The chocolate dessert was also really good but was just hard to finish! 

I loved the atmosphere here, the lighting was dim and you felt like you were in the 1940s. Luckily we were seated up in the top area, so we did not have anyone next to us really. The two person tables in the main area seemed like it might be difficult to have a conversation without the other table hearing you. The entire staff was attentive and friendly. Overall, it was such a great experience and we will definitely be back."
3,"Butcher and Singer was next up on my Stephen Starr list and steakhouse in Philadelphia. A late Valentine&apos;s Day celebration was the perfect time to check it out. 

When we arrived for our 5:30 reservation, we were promptly sat and asked if we would like our jackets hung - politely declined. The server was very attentive and gave his recommendations right off the bat. Tip from the server: the kitchen cooks their steaks a bit on the lower side, so a medium is generally a medium-rare anywhere else. Very happy about the service! 

We put in our order - crab dip for an appetizer and the 28-Day Dry Aged Porterhouse for two with the stuffed hash browns and macaroni &amp; cheese for the main dish. While we waited, we were given warm biscuits and butter. The biscuits were delicious - flaky and moist, albeit a little on the saltier side - with the creamy butter enhancing them. They were quickly finished and the server said he&apos;d get us more...never trust anyone who says no to more!

While we waited for more biscuits, the crab dip came out. Definitely a highlight of the meal for me. If you like heaps of crab and gooey, baked cheese, you&apos;re in for a treat. My only qualm was the shortage of crispy bread for dipping. Do not fret, however, because those extra biscuits came in for the save. Recommend as an appetizer!

The main course was where I make my assessment of Butcher and Singer - it&apos;s a steakhouse! When the steak arrived, we were asked to ensure it was to our requested temperature, which was a perfect medium-rare (aka a MEDIUM in their books). The Porterhouse cut consists of two cuts on the bone: the tenderloin and the top loin (aka New York Strip). The New York Strip side was dominated by a smokey-charred taste - big let down. The tenderloin portion was less charred, but still lacked a good seasoning to compliment the perfect, moist meat. We ordered au poivre which definitely came in handy to mask the charred and allow the meat to shine a bit. Still disappointing. 

Sides were okay but plentiful. The stuffed hash browns definitely needed help from the au poivre to enhance the flavor otherwise lacked flavor. I did really like the mac &amp; cheese, however. It was creamy and noodles were cooked perfectly - really good for leftovers consistency. If you don&apos;t like breadcrumbs on your mac &amp; cheese: beware. 


For dessert, we ordered the Baked Alaska and the Key Lime Pie. Again, our server made a clutch recommendation: if you don&apos;t finish, take home the key lime and freeze - it&apos;s better! It was my first time having Baked Alaska so I don&apos;t have a baseline, but a let down in my books - would not order again. The key lime pie - better at-home, frozen - was dense and yummy, especially if you like a strong lime flavor like me.  

Overall, Butcher and Singer does not live up to Starr&apos;s Barclay Prime or Del Friscos. Service was great though! Might give it another try in the future."
1,"The customer service my boyfriend and I received from the manager Jonathan Lavoie was horrible!! We made a reservation for when the restaurant first opened and expected to sit inside because it&apos;s 36 degrees outside, he said we made a web reservation which is for outdoor only. We asked if he could accommodate us and put us inside. He refused and the restaurant was completely EMPTY!! We were the first guests there. He then proceeded to speak to us in a nasty tone and said &quot;he wasn&apos;t the one who made the reservation.&quot; I will NEVER come back to this establishment to eat, drink, nor be merry. Jonathan Lavoie needs more management experience and a better attitude when serving his guests."
5,"Staff, meal, atmosphere, were all excellent. Best steak house in Philly. 

Soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo deeeeeelllliiiiiicccccccccccciiioooooouuuuuuuuusssssssssssdddd"
4,"I was really happy to write Butcher &amp; Singer off of my Philly Eats list, since it&apos;s been there for quite a while.  The unassuming building is one I&apos;ve walked past often growing up here, so I was pretty amused by the chance to finally head inside. 

The ambiance is said to be 1940s old Hollywood.  It definitely reminds me of one of the restaurants in the movie, The Irishman.  The movie was hard to finish but this meal was not.

For a drink, I ordered Fool&apos;s Gold.  I always gravitate towards the sweetest drink on the menu.  The flowers in the glass made me assume I chose right.  It tasted pretty similar to orange jello.  I enjoyed it, but there wasn&apos;t anything unique about.  It appeared that their speciality cocktails were a list of tried and true classics.  

For an appetizer, we ordered the oysters rockefeller.  Really good.  
For dinner, I got the 8oz filet, mashed potatoes, and mushroom and onions.  All were really good.  What&apos;s interesting though, is that the waiter mentioned that the cook on the steaks is one grade lighter than you&apos;d typically expect: their medium is more like a medium rare and so on.  I typically order medium rare, so I ordered medium and this rang true.  With so much red in the middle, how dare they call it medium?  Kinda odd.  But either way, I was happy with how the meal turned out.

I was pretty stuffed, but that didn&apos;t stop me from ordering dessert.  I had to try the baked alaska.  It was everything I&apos;d hope for and more.  I really liked the blend of banana ice cream, peaches, and toasted meringue.  Although I&apos;d never had it, other places I&apos;d seen it presented flambeed.  The waiter explained that a flambeed baked alaska has a burnt taste that the head chef was not cool with.  Good to know!

As if I hadn&apos;t had enough, I ended the meal with a macchiato.  Tasty.  Which is why I&apos;m up writing a yelp review at 5:30 am.  Coffee at 10pm hits a little different..."
4,"Check with the restaurant if you were looking to order a specific dish. Because of COVID they do not have everything in stock, even if they&apos;re advertising it on their instagram... (I&apos;m looking at you scallops). Otherwise, the food is great, service is great. They have outdoor dining."
5,"Amazing meal from start to finish!  We called to change our reservation time and the hostess was more then gracious and accommodating.  We arrived to two friendly hostesses who greeted us and promptly seated us at what we considered one of the best booths in the restaurants.  We had a small view of the kitchen and could see most of the restaurant.  Elegant jazz music playing in the background and very soft lighting.  We were promptly greeted by several servers who arrived with water, took drink orders and explained the menu.

We were celebrating my birthday and the staff could not have been more attentive, welcoming and classy.  One of our friends has a gluten allergy and the waiter went out of his way to make sure she was accommodated.    We started with oysters from the raw bar and a jumbo lump crab cocktail.  Both were amazing.  For dinner we had fried shrimp, lollipop lamb chops, and two of ordered filet mignon.  Everything was exceptional.  Top notch service from start to finish.  Thank you for making my birthday extra special!"
5,"I&apos;m not sure how I haven&apos;t written a review of my, dare I say it.... FAVORITE steakhouse!!! I have been lucky enough to dine at Butcher &amp; Singer a few times now and it is an amazing experience each time.

My first experience was for restaurant week (which is coming up, make reservations!) and I must say I think Butcher &amp; Singer is the BEST value of any restaurant week menu. Crab cake + filet + dessert for $35?! insane. The filet itself is worth more than $35. 

The other times I have been here have been just for regular old dinner but they never disappoint. We have sampled a few raw bar items and other appetizers. The steak tartare is divine. I usually order a filet which is always cooked to perfection. Now, I know this sounds weird... but, their creamed spinach is the STAR (or should i say &apos;STARR&apos;). Don&apos;t get me wrong, the steak is always the real star, but considering I am not typically a fan of the traditional steakhouse sides (creamed spinach, corn, mashed potato) and I LOVEEE their creamed spinach, that means something. I don&apos;t know what they do to it and I probably don&apos;t want to know... but it is heavenly. 

Other notes: drinks are always good- I like a good dirty martini with my appetizers and a glass of red for dessert which Butcher &amp; Singer always delivers on. The waitstaff is amazing... truly, they have top-notch service here. No stone left unturned. And the decor is cozy, dim and intimate- you feel like you&apos;re in a steakhouse from another era in here. I love it."
5,"Despite the trendy-sounding name, this is a traditional steakhouse and definitely a top 5 Philly restaurant for me. My visit was during Restaurant Week, which can ruin any good restaurant, so I&apos;m very confident this is a 5 star restaurant.

I&apos;m still dreaming about the complimentary buttered biscuits. Before bringing us another round, our waiter jokingly warned us that we might be ruining our dinner by gorging on biscuits before the main course. It was so worth it, and I would have been perfectly content eating these biscuits as my entire meal. The caeser salad starter was also very good. The steak was a straight forward filet mignon with a side of mashed potatoes. Both really good.

Our waiter was super charming and fun, the restaurant is gorgeous, and the seating is super comfortable. Excellent food and excellent dining experience!"
