5,"[This review was made in 1/2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic]

In my four years living in Philadelphia back in college, Suraya had always been the spot that so many of my friends would mention when I asked them about their favorite restaurants. While I may be an alum, I&apos;m still in the Philly area and was able to enjoy a meal at Suraya with my friends for the first time and tldr it was just amazing.

While we were in the middle of the pandemic and seating was outdoors, it did not stop us from enjoying the evening. Outdoor heaters were abundant not only for heat but as sources for light -- not to mention we were given a pretty warm welcome.

I will confess, I&apos;ve never had Lebanese food before, but after my experience at Suraya, I will be on the lookout for more Lebanese food -- that or I can just come back to Suraya for seconds. For tonight we enjoyed the hummous, fatteh, kafta kebab, shish taouk, and kawarma. For the three of us, all of this was more than enough to fill us up.

The food was delicious, the staff was extremely attentive, and the design of the place was beautiful especially at night time. There really wasn&apos;t too much more I could ask from a restaurant. Will see you soon, Suraya!"
5,"I am so embarrassed that I haven&apos;t written a review for Suraya yet. I would easily argue that this restaurant is one of the absolute crown jewels of Philly, and I luckily have been here once in person before COVID and then recently got takeout from here. I couldn&apos;t find my pictures from my in person experience so I&apos;m taking advantage of my recent takeout experience to just sing my praises. Both times I ordered the tasting menu, and this time I ordered the tasting menu for two for delivery. The tasting menu comes with hummus, baba ganoush, and labneh with two huge pitas. For dessert, there&apos;s a blueberry ashta (milk pudding) and a ma&apos;amoul, and chocolate and almond financier (both are soft crumbly delicious cookies). I also added on the kanafeh.

The main dishes I selected for the dinner for two was the lamb kebab (halabi) and the branzino (samke harra). Every single item was cooked and spiced to perfection and it really held up in the drive to my apartment. The heating instructions for the kanafeh were easy to follow and tasted great at home too, almost as good as being served it right at the restaurant. Suraya puts in extra love to their takeout experience by not only labeling everything, but also putting on small description stickers of what&apos;s in the dish you&apos;re having.

I absolutely love this restaurant, please do show them some love during these hard times and trust you&apos;ll have a great experience. And absolutely you must come in person once the pandemic is over, the interior of the restaurant is gorgeous. Suraya&apos;s menu is delicious from top to bottom, can&apos;t go wrong with a single dish."
5,"Suraya is one of the few places that 100% lives up to the hype. From start to finish, this is a solid dining experience, and one of the places we highly recommend for anyone visiting the city. Be sure to plan ahead though - it can be tough sometimes to get a reservation.

Their service was amazing, friendly, and informative. Really helpful for food pairings and plate suggestions! 

Cool atmosphere - the restaurant itself is large, but each seating has a more  exclusive feeling. They have a courtyard as well that is really intimate and a nice feature for being in the city. Smaller menu though (pre-covid) whee they usually only have mezze options, desserts, cocktails. 

When you walk in, you are greeted by a beautiful cafe and gift store with cook books, kitchen tools, food/ingredients all representative of the restaurant and the Lebanese culture. 

The entire menu is authentic Lebanese cuisine - I would suggest trying 2 to 3 plates per individual. There is just so much you don&apos;t want to pass up on. The one thing that really stood out to me was their Kanafeh. This is their dessert of crispy fried cheese with rose syrup. Seriously, one of the more memorable dishes in my entire life - perfect balance of sweet and savory, and the rose syrup is just out of this world. Brings fresh floral notes, making what would otherwise be a heavy dish, feel light and refreshing."
5,"If you like to try middle eastern food, this is the place you have to visit. 
The food is very delicious, the menu has a lot of choices including vegetarian options. 
Also the food is freshly cooked and the pita bread freshly baked. 
Tip when you go there: Try to leave place for dessert because you don&apos;t wanna miss that."
4,"Fresh off of dinner last night, I wanted to get this review out there, amidst all the positively unshakeable 5 star reviews. 

Listen, Suraya is GOOOOOOOOD. The food was delicious, we were absolutely full, and the staff is suspiciously nice. The restaurant itself is beautiful, both inside and out, and service was impeccable. So why not 5 stars? 

Well, first and foremost, it is EXPENSIVE. This is a common theme you have no doubt, or will no doubt read in other reviews, but I think it bears repeating. This place does not play around with the prices. And although the food IS good, it&apos;s also basically a bunch of dips. 

Oh, which also reminds me; another reason for the not 5 stars, is that you are FORCED to eat the $65 tasting menu on Fridays and Saturdays. You ALSO don&apos;t get to pick dessert, which was weird. It was like a big, kind of sweet, but not really sweet, mozzarella stick type dish. And listen, I love fried cheese as much as the next red blooded American, but it&apos;s not something I think of when it comes to dessert. It definitely left me a little perplexed, as I couldn&apos;t decide if I liked it or hated it, so I just stopped eating it all together. Looked nice though. *shoulder shrug emoji*

Back to the cost thing; a glass of wine is $12. That&apos;s what a bottle costs in the stores. A BOTTLE of wine is like $70, which is what a CASE of wine costs in stores. A CUP OF HOT TEA, was FOUR DOLLARS!! That&apos;s hot water and a tea bag. That&apos;s like a 2000% markup. I can buy TWO BOXES; about 200 tea bags, for $4. Don&apos;t misconstrue; the food IS awesome, which is the only reason I didn&apos;t flip a table on the way out, but for what was essentially 5 dips, some middle eastern fries (the batata harra, my hands down favorite dish!), 4 little kibbeh (too minty), a piece of roasted lamb, and some chicken thigh pieces, we dropped almost $200. They don&apos;t even refill your drink. You want another orange blossom iced tea, that&apos;ll be another $4 please.

Another thing that I didn&apos;t like was that the only reservation that was available for us was 4:30, but when we got there at 4:25, we were told that they &quot;weren&apos;t quite ready yet,&quot; and we had to stand around and wait until about 4:40ish before we were sat. Not a BIG deal, but you&apos;d think if your first reservation was 4:30, you wouldn&apos;t wait until 4:29 to get everything started. 

I don&apos;t want this review to come off negative though. Almost everything was done right, and they hit a lot of high notes too.

As I mentioned, the staff was perfect. Everyone was super nice, knowledgeable and helpful. They wore all PPE and took things seriously. I even really liked the ordering through QR code thing. I hope that sticks around after Covid!

Bottom line, I would absolutely come back to Suraya, or recommend it as a place to try, with the caveat that it&apos;s ONLY for &quot;special occasions.&quot; Unless you just got it like that, and can afford to drop $250 every time you get a hankering for some baba ganoush."
4,Service was nice and friendly. Social distance was pretty spaced out. Food was pretty good. I enjoyed 90% of my food. I did think one or two items were extremely salty on the dish but overall an A- experience.
5,"I&apos;ve eaten at many different restaurants in Philly, at many different price points and none can compare to Suraya. The food is absolutely incredible, well thought out, and always leaves you wanting more. I recommend getting the tasting menu, especially if it&apos;s your first time. It&apos;s a great value for the quantity and quality of food you&apos;re getting. So much so, that I end up ordering it almost every time I&apos;m here! 

It&apos;s not only the food that is amazing, the ambiance of the restaurant adds to the overall experience. Pre COVID the patio was only for drinks and bar snacks since it&apos;s a beautiful space to enjoy some cocktails especially on warmer days. Since the pandemic however, guests can now enjoy their meals in the patio which is a huge plus. The interior of the restaurant is just as nice with a great view of the kitchen which reassures you your food is cooked on site and of freshest quality. 

If you&apos;re there for brunch I definitely recommend trying out some of their pastries from award winning chef. I&apos;ve had one of each, but the cruller is my personal favorite!"
5,"Suraya is perfection. There is no other word that can quite capture the experience of dining at this fabulous Lebanese establishment than &quot;perfect&quot;. 

Suraya is the finest representation of Lebanese food I&apos;ve had anywhere, and the atmosphere of the beautiful outdoor garden space is head and shoulders above any COVID era outdoor dining setup I&apos;ve come across. With plenty of seating that offers intimacy, and social distancing for groups but still lets you feel like you&apos;re back in time when you could feel a certain energy from being out and about among the cool set. 

The ambiance at Suraya is amazing, but setting alone can only keep you interested for so long. The food is truly what sold me on giving this place 5 stars. From the fresh bread and the amazing selection of spreads and dips to the delicious meats, and the sublime date cake dessert...I can honestly say every bite and every morsel was amazing. There was such an abundance of food and dining in a group of four, I got to try quite a variety from the menu. The portions are generous and you will be absolutely stuffed at the end of the meal so please pace yourself and enjoy the experience.

There&apos;s an old Persian proverb that says &quot;it is better to be in chains with friends than in a garden with strangers&quot; which I will respectfully disagree with and say that at Suraya,  you can be in a garden with friends and strangers and you will have an amazing dining experience. Even on a frigid January evening during a pandemic, Suraya delivered an A+ experience through and through!"
5,"Celebrated my birthday this year with brunch at Suraya! I have lived in Philadelphia for 3.5 years now and can say, without a doubt, that this is the best restaurant in the city. The hype is real and I would give it more than 5 stars if it was possible. 

Service is 5/5. We had a reservation and they seated us very promptly. I saw that the staff did a great job cleaning and sanitizing tables in between customers. Our waitress was very friendly and offered us great recommendations. 

Food is 5/5. I don&apos;t even know where to begin. I don&apos;t think my taste buds has had food this good in a long time. We did the tasting menu which gave us a platter of dips with pita. The platter included Hummus, baba Ganoush, labneh, Muhammara, and taboule. Our waitress was able to give us more pita without any extra charges. For the entree we had ordered the Fatar Meshwi and Turkish eggs. Both were very aesthetically pleasing to look at and tasted even better. Next time, I would like to try the pastries and the Lebanese chai latte. I ate and was so full by the end of the meal that I couldn&apos;t eat for the rest of the day. $35 is totally worth it and try to go as a group so you could try the whole menu. I only wished there were more vegetarian options to choose from as we felt limited. 

Ambience is 5/5. Given it is winter, I don&apos;t expect the garden to be lush with plants. It was kind of bleak, but it&apos;s also winter. I really liked that we were given our own private booth with a personal heater. It made eating outdoors much more feasible and enjoyable. 

Some things to keep in mind:
Parking is free in the lot next door
You can only enter through the entrance next to the parking lot. Do not go to the front entrance as that is not open. 
Make reservations!!"
5,"Wow! As a disclaimer I&apos;ll say that I am Lebanese and am VERY critical of &quot;Mediterranean&quot; restaurants, I have been disappointed in the past by other places (such a zahav ) so I was skeptical... that being said, I was very impressed and satisfied by Suraya! 

We have been meaning to try this place for a while, we made reservations for a Thursday evening. The ambience and garden is simply delightful the decor 
Is super cute( I wish I could see it in the daylight). Very Covid friendly - they check your temperature, all staff was wearing masking. There are heaters all around the outside space , We were very comfortable even though it was a chilly January evening. Our waiter and all staff were very kind and helpful.

For starters we tried the labne and the Muhammara , They were great portions &amp; absolutely delicious. Both were flavorful and tasty! But the star of the show had to be the freshly baked pita bread. Reminded me of the restaurants in Lebanon  (nostalgic) it&apos;s amazing. 

For entrées I had the Samke harra which was seasoned to perfection! It was on the spicy side but still fantastic. It came with a side of turmeric rice which we took to go- I was stuffed the portions were perfect! My fiancé had the Kawarma (lamb) which he said was tender and well cooked with great flavor. 

We also had a side of fries with toum. My ONLY complaint was about the toum. I&apos;m used to toum being STRONG. It was lacking flavor &amp; needed more garlic - it tasted more like mayonnaise. Anyway we still ate it all! 

All in all this is great place for a taste of Lebanon, still not better than my moms home-cooking but it definitely comes close!"
3,"With the Covid #&apos;s still going in the wrong direction, we still have not gone out to dinner, either inside or out.  We got takeout from Suraya and would have felt comfortable eating in their outdoor setting, where it seemed that the tables were spaced more like 10 feet apart or more.

But I&apos;m afraid there&apos;s a &quot;but&quot;.  Everything we had was good but didn&apos;t get to that Wow factor for us.

We got the 2 person tasting menu which included the two hits of the night: the delicious Hummus and the equally delicious Labneh (strained yogurt with tomatoes, cucumber, olives and mint).  The Cabbage was just OK but we thought it may have been romaine lettuce in place of the cabbage.  Our Entrees were the Grilled Branzino and the Lamb Kebabs, with the lamb being the better of the two.  The fish was lost in the spicy sauce and for us, the kebabs were just &quot;good&quot;.

We had added to our meal the Fattouch salad which was completely underwhelming.  Another item we tried was the Fried Beef &amp; Bulgar Dumplings that, other than being &quot;different&quot;, were also disappointing.

The two included desserts were good.

As you can see from other reviewers we are in the minority but for around $110, sorry to say, we were disappointed."
5,"We tried the Taste of Suraya menu and found all the food to be delicious. Among the four of us, we were able to try all the cold and hot mezze and the Kafka kebab, Halabi kebab, and Kawarma for mains. 

I highly recommend the muhammara and baba ganoush for cold mezze, the fatteh and batata harra for hot mezze, and the Kawarma for the main."
5,Visited this place many times and always loved the food but wanted to share specially my experience during covid. Excellent set up and ordering process and payment process..everything digital. Only time you have server come to you is to drop the food. We had such a wonderful time and everything was so spaced out that felt comfortable being there. I love the food!!!! Miss going there more frequently specially their brunch
5,"BOOM five stars 


Parking still available around back!!!! 
Covid wise- one of the best infection control conscious and heat conscious environments around! They take your temperature on your wrist- and all of the servers are protected. Tables are very very spaced apart! 

Menu - ALL orders are placed via ONLINE WEBSITE! But you will still have a server- Karellia is phenomenal. 

Heaters are by each table- you will not be cold!!!


Food here? DELICIOUS DECADENT DELICIOUS 
nothing further to report. It&apos;s hands down the best in the city. Both my NYC AND KIWI friends agree. 

Amazing ambiance, music is techno and hip. 


Will be BACK. And you should too."
5,"The tasting menu at Suraya has been on my list for awhile, and it seemed like the perfect Valentine&apos;s Day dinner treat! The wait was well worth it. Arrive hungry and leave full and happy. Because every dish was truly delicious, I&apos;ll highlight my favorites - the labneh was creamy and cool. The za&apos;atar seasoning sprinkled on top added a pop of flavor (this was the table favorite!). The baba ganoush had a lovely smoky flavor that highlights the natural notes of the eggplant. The shish taouk was incredibly tender and juicy with a tasty crunch on the outside. The kanafeh is a dessert that I&apos;ve been wanting to try - I&apos;m a cheese lover so cheese for dessert is right up my alley! The sweet rose syrup accented the dish wonderfully - this one might not be for everyone, as it is not a traditionally sweet dessert. 

We chose to sit outside in the garden - all food was ordered through a QR code on the table. The staff was attentive and the setup had multiple heat lamps per table, which made the cold weather an after thought while consuming this amazing meal! 

Pro tips: set an alarm on your phone for this one - you will need a resy and spots fill up quick! Openings are posted a month in advance. 
Filling up on the piping hot pita and cold mezze is incredibly tempting (and hard to resist!) - it&apos;s easy to forget you have 3 more courses coming. Be prepared to leave full and to have a take-home lunch to make your coworkers envious! 
Finally - don&apos;t forget to sign up for their rewards system! It is easy to rack up a bill, but you will quickly earn $$ off your next meal!"
4,"Everyone has been raving about this restaurant so I just had to try it! I will say, I WAS a little disappointed, but with it being COVID and take out I&apos;m hoping that was why. Here&apos;s what we ordered:
- Fried Kibbeh - these dumplings were reallyyy dry. There wasn&apos;t enough of the mint-cucumber yogurt sauce with it to help combat that
- Halabi kebab - lamb kebab...good but nothing crazy to write home about. This came with a babyyyy amount of hummus which was a little disappointing. Hummus was average and the pita with it, I could have bought it from the grocery store. Nothing set it apart. 
- Samke Harra - the branzino was expected, but the sauce, holy moly load me more of that. It was amazing. Came with turmeric rice which was meh. 
- Sumac French fries with toum - HOLY COW. These babies stole the show. You&apos;re thinking, getting fries at a Levantine restaurant..really? YES REALLY. They were amazing - big, crispy, flavorful. I would go back just for these

Overall it was a decent meal but not the wow I expected. Will go back in hopes the COVID takeout is what did them in."
5,"I came here to celebrate a special occasion and was completely delighted by the experience! During the COVID-era, they provide both garden and patio dining. The patio dining is a number of small private pods with heating either from below or above. It keeps you pretty warm even on the coldest of days. I&apos;d recommend making a res because they&apos;re quite busy!

For the food, you can either do the &quot;taste of suraya&quot; ($65/person) or a la carte on weekdays. We opted for the tasting menu which seemed to have a little bit of everything. To start, you are given a number of different mediterranean spreads. My favorites were probably the baba ganoush (eggplant) and the muhammara (red pepper&amp;walnut) dips. They are served with a crispy, warm pita. For the appetizer, you can choose from any of the mezze. The standout here was the fatteh which was warm chickpeas paired with crispy eggplant and crispy pita. So good! For the entree, each guest can choose from the list of mashawi options. We opted for the steak kebab and the kawarma. I thought both were perfectly cooked and well spiced. I was suprised by the presentation of the kawarma which is basically a cube of lamb meat but it was very tender and delectable. Lastly, for dessert, the kanefeh was a very interesting fried cheese plate which mixed both sweet and savory elements. 

We also tried a few of the drinks - I would recommend the wanderer. Vodka, poblano, grapefruit, bell pepper, and lava salt. It&apos;s excellent!

Lastly, the service was pretty good. There was a significant gap between the entrees and dessert but otherwise they did a great job and I&apos;m sure they were busy. Overall, thought the food was very interesting and delicious, I was pleased with the variety, and really enjoyed the ambience. Can&apos;t wait to come back!"
5,Perfect place in every way. You must get the tasting menu. Drinks and food are all delicious and perfect. Gorgeous inside too
5,"One of my favorite restaurant experiences to date was at Suraya. If you do not already love Lebanese food, you definitely will after trying Suraya. I tried the hummus, labneh, fatteh, sumac french fries, kawarma, and fried kibbeh. All were excellent but my favorites were the fatteh and the kawarma. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the fatteh because it is a seemingly simple dish but it was bursting with flavor and I loved all the different textures in the dish. The kawarma was so incredibly tender and the sweetness of the pomegranate and the creamy tart yogurt complimented it so well. My only complaint is that there should be a location closer to me! 

Should also note that the ambiance was top-notch as well."
5,"I&apos;ve been to Suraya countless times and it&apos;s always in a weekend so I always get the tasting menu. The starters take the cake and are so filling. You get an assortment of hummus, baba ganoush, muhammara- my ultimate favorite and labneh. With that I always get the potatoes- batata harra. The fatteh is also very good with chickpeas. All this comes with a pita bread. 

Tried the hot chocolate this time and it was amazing. They unfortunately did not have the chai latte. 

For the main course, their steak is very well cooked. I would recommend that. 

Their dessert is the most underwhelming part of the meal and I have almost always just left it untouched. If you&apos;re into kennafa, you&apos;re in luck but it&apos;s not for me. They have this sesame pita which lack flavour and is not good. 

Suraya remains one of my favorite restaurants to date."
