5,I&apos;m so glad they had not 1 but 2 of the Pliny beers on tap. Burger was amazing and perfectly cooked. Plenty of indoor and outdoor seating and abided by all the restrictions perfectly. Can&apos;t wait to return.
5,Super cute small place. Even the food is delicious coupled with the delicious beer selection. I&apos;m always impressed.
3,"I came here in fall, and was happy that it was still open with some outdoor seating. They did a good job at quarantining, with the seats about 6-8 feet apart. Unfortunately, there is some construction nearby which makes the area a little dirty, but you can make do. The wait is anywhere from 5 minutes to 30 minutes depending on when you get there. 

We got the mussels and fries, which honestly were not amazing. The sauce is not a creamy sauce, and I did not feel like the mussels tasted like the sauce - it was difficult to truly get the flavor from the sauce into the mussel. I didn&apos;t think the mussels lived up to the hype of the place, but it was fun to sit outside during the pandemic. 

They also have a great selection of beer to choose from, one that&apos;s constantly changing. I&apos;d categorize the place as a better happy hour location rather than a dinner place. I&apos;ll probably just stick to my local bar instead next time"
4,"The beer selection is incomparable - for beer snobs and pleebs (like me.) I love trying new things and the staff are incredibly knowledgeable when it comes to what&apos;s on top and up in bottles. There is always something to learn and experience when it comes to drinks at Monk&apos;s.

I will also say one of my fondest Monk&apos;s memories was getting mussels with my client, who took my team out as a holiday time celebration. That was an epic night, where I felt like we ate and drank the night away, no concept of time, and the staff made it special and fun because right away, they treat you like family. 

The mussels ARE amazing, and it&apos;s easy to get lost in the menu and specials.

I have had some meals since, mostly all &quot;hit,&quot; but a few &quot;misses,&quot; but I will say the place does a great job overall, especially for having incredible volume for the small space and limited staff. They make it look good!"
4,Bar almost has a speakeasy bar feel. I came here for drinks. Not a large wine selection but better on beer and whiskey. Easy and calm vibe which was appreciated.
5,"It&apos;s not like you need another review from a random Yelp user to let ya know Monk&apos;s is fantastic, it should be a widely accepted fact that it is fantastic and has been consistently for years. 

A friend and I came here for a late lunch after he popped by my office for a visit and we were not disappointed. The beer selection always shines; we were both delighted with our unique and delicious choices. 

We split the trout dip for an appetizer and it was so yummy - smoked fish fans, this is your JAM! We also decided to share a seitan cheesesteak with mushrooms, gruyere, fried onions, and the bartender suggested we allow a little bit of broccoli rabe to be mixed in. That man is like a snack guardian because he knew his advice was gold - the broccoli rabe made it so dang savory, it was such a freaking good sandwich! The sandwich also came with a lightly dressed side salad, which is perfect for those who like some green on their plate. Des pommes frites should not be missed - super thin and flavorful. 

Hats off to the super cool bartender up front - such a friendly guy who offered us nothing but excellent service. Cheers to the weekend!"
4,"The beer menu is out of this world, our thumbs got tired from scrolling on our phones to view it. We ordered the fries that came with &quot;world famous&quot; bourbon mayo. They were fantastic and we ate every last crumb! Highly recommend:)"
4,"Monk&apos;s Cafe has been on my list for years and I finally visited this month. My boyfriend and I waited about 20 mins for an outdoor table on a Thursday night. Duck salad sandwich was my favorite. The Ghent mussels were not as amazing as I expected, but still great, and the pommes frites were perfect. Finally, loved the apricot almond galette for dessert. My boyfriend also liked his beer a lot (house sour). Service was wonderful/waiter Gabriela was very friendly. 4.5 stars."
5,Stopped in here years ago and loved it. Bit of a wait to get in but has a small intimate setting so it&apos;s worth the wait. Also one of the only places that had Pliny on tap. Pliny + mussels = good time.
5,"Fantastic experience! Delicious food, great drinks, and a friendly staff. I even found a starfish in my steamers!"
5,"There are few places in the US that can find a beer list as extensive with good sampling of some hard to find Belgian ales.   This coupled with a nice variety of mussel pots with frites makes the Monk&apos;s Cafe a top choice for me when visiting Philly.   In this case my son and I were in town to see a football game and as luck would have it, the Monk&apos;s Caf√© was open till 2 AM and still serving food at a little after midnight (fortunately till 1 AM) when we arrive from the airport. 

The waiter gave us their menu that has at least 20 beers on tap and over 200 bottles.  I went with the Major Tom and we put in an order for their Spanish Flies an advertised super hot wings which we confidently figured, what the heck it&apos;s after midnight and we were splitting them, surely that can be that hot.  I had to go with the mussels and ordered them Ghent style with bacon and blue cheese (figuring anything with bacon has to be good).  My son order the Brussels burger with cheese and bacon (like father like son...).  We also ordered water just in case the beer could not quench the wings (not that dumb..).  

The wings arrived as four doubles that meant four apiece and they were bathed in their hot sauce.  We dug in and made thru the first two no problem thinking these weren&apos;t to bad when the heat kicked in.  We did persevere and finish them and decided it was a good thing we shared them....  Also definitely happy we ordered water and it was time for another beer and I ordered the Alagash/DuPont Heartfelt ale to go with my mussels which arrived shortly after.  The mussels came in a nice sized pot with the portion being a good size with lotsa of bacon and blue cheese and onions!  So good!!!  My son enjoyed his Brussels burger and another beer as well before we called it a night.  

Food 5 Great mussels and beer selection.  Burger was good as well, so very hard to beat for pub food. They are recognized as one of the top 150 bars/pubs in the US and I can see why.
Service 4 It did not matter that we were there after midnight as our waiter kept track of us and the loud crowd around us.  
Atmosphere 4 It&apos;s a little dark but that is to be expected at the time of night we were there.  It has a nice pub feel and is comfortable.
Price 4.5 I think their prices are very good for the food and quality of the beer you can get here.
OA 4.5  I really like this place, it has the food and beers of my choice that compete with what I&apos;ve had in Europe."
4,"Now I know why the monks choose to go into isolation. Sometimes you have something so good, you just need time to yourself lol. I&apos;m actually writing this from a cave in the mountains. Ok, maybe I&apos;m on my couch, in my comfortably air conditioned home...but the sandwich is that good! 

I&apos;m sure there are other great items on the menu but this is all about the duck salad sandwich, a sandwich unlike any I&apos;ve ever come across. Monk cafe has combined greens, walnuts, craisins, goat cheese, and an absolute gorgeous medium rare duck breast, all inside of an Italian roll. It&apos;s creative, it&apos;s bold, it&apos;s actually quite crazy! Why this work....I don&apos;t exactly know, but there aren&apos;t many sandwiches I have enjoyed more than this. 

Ok so this being a pub, I hear they have tons of beer on tap, and the mussels are to die for. I did also have the frites(award winning) and can confirm they are as good as advertised, especially that homemade mayo for dipping. All that&apos;s nice....but that sandwich though 

Note: if you&apos;re not going to go medium rare, just keep in moving. This ain&apos;t for you...."
3,"There is a huge variety of beers here so I had bookmarked this spot for my boyfriend and I to go to when visiting Philly. I ordered a cider and my boyfriend ordered pliny the elder beer. It was very refreshing to drink outside as the weather was perfect for the evening. We both enjoyed our drinks. When we got seated, we ordered the monks mussels. It was hot and fresh but not as amazing as I expected since I read many reviews raving about them. It came with a side of crispy fries. The ambiance is your typical bar setting, but outdoors. I found that the seating outside could have been better, but I know it&apos;s hard with covid and there&apos;s no reason to be that picky. We had to wait about half an hour or so before a table opened up, which isn&apos;t terrible on a late friday night. Overall, we had a good time and I&apos;m glad I came just to check it off my list but nothing spectacular stood out to me."
4,"I like Monk&apos;s a lot, but I honestly have not had an opportunity to try their food after many visits.

I&apos;ve gone various times of day to always find it packed (a testament to its popularity) and the wait time for a table has always been longer than I preferred to wait. So that&apos;s been a little discouraging. I just went again this past weekend earlier in the evening thinking I&apos;d get in before the dinner crowd and the drinking...only to find it yet again packed shoulder to shoulder, table wait was 45 minutes.

BUT, I decided to not let that get to me. I stopped in for a beer, and a beer I had. I love their beer list, they always have a great rotating list of good craft brews that never disappoints. And there&apos;s always good conversation with the bartenders there - that&apos;s my favorite part. I don&apos;t know anyone who works there by name, or even recognition. But every time I go, I end up talking with whoever is working, and it&apos;s always a good time.

Go for the beer, and the atmosphere, the good music and the conversation. Perhaps go for the food too, but I have yet to be able to weigh in on that. I can&apos;t wait to update my review when/if I get a chance to have a bite."
5,So glad that Monk&apos;s has an outdoor area during current times. We went for beers &amp; snacks and had great service and obviously exceptional beers! Best variety of great beers to be found in Philadelphia
5,"Excellent beer choices--4 Russian River options including Pliny and Blind Pig, Belgium choices were beyond the standards that you could get at any store, and other unique options.  Come for the beer!

Food was fine.  The caesar salad was fine, mussels and frites were better than average.  I would not come for the food but they have an extensive menu if you are hungry."
5,"cellar aged orval?
veal cheeks?
wings?
some of the best beers available in the world are right here

every time im in philly i tap in"
5,"I like beer.  Do you like beer?  If so, Monk&apos;s is the place for you.  

After walking all around Philly during the Memorial Day Holiday, we had worked up quite a thirst.  We knew that Monk&apos;s was a craft beer Mecca and we were not disappointed.  They&apos;ve got a fantastic tap list, including four from Russian River Brewing, and maybe a hundred or so bottles to choose from.  We needed little time for deliberations-round of Pliny to get us started.  Hoppy DIPA bliss, and at 8% a sweet buzz.  

Now we wanted some food.  Monk&apos;s has a Belgian focus, so we&apos;d be getting mussels.  They&apos;ve got a few different varieties, all cooked in beer.  We had the traditional and the spicier red version, which I preferred.  The frites they came with were outstanding as well.  They know what they are doing with the mussels and they were also quick to rid our tables of accumulated shell pots as we worked our way through the three pounds of mussels we devoured.  More Russian River pints followed-the delicious Saison for me and Blind Pig for my little lady.  It was a perfect boozy lunch for us.  

We enjoyed our time at Monk&apos;s so much that we returned the next day for more pints at the bar.  Staff was friendly and chatty with us discussing their sweet connections for all those prized kegs from RR.  Loved our time at Monk&apos;s.  You had us at Pliny."
3,"My friends and I stumbled in late one evening and wanted something quick. The kitchen was closing in 30mins but they were accommodating although we definitely felt judgment because you could feel the staff not wanting to stay too late.

The male employee at the front was rude to one of my friends as he was checking our ID&apos;s. The servers/hostesses were a lot kinder and food came up fast. 

Food-wise, nothing was memorable. The fries were definitely a good late night snack. Maybe I&apos;m just unimpressed because we felt negative energy the moment we walked in the door."
4,"Monk&apos;s is a Philly staple! I love coming here for just a beer or for some delicious Belgian noms. 

The draft list is constantly changing, with a great balance of local brews and Belgian brews. Even though I always go for something on draft, the number and diversity of bottles they have in stock is absolutely incredible.

I&apos;ve had the Seitan Cheese Steak, which is always solid. On my most recent trip, I had the Veggie Burger Antwerp style (with sottocenare truffle cheese and shiitake mushrooms). While the burger itself was just okay, the truffle cheese was absolutely delicious. The frites and bourbon mayonnaise dipping sauce are always on point.

Docking a star because the service during my last visit wasn&apos;t quite up to par - despite it being a non-peak time (early on a Sunday evening), my friend and I waited quite a while for our food. But don&apos;t worry, I&apos;ll be back. I always am."
