5,"Reading Terminal Market is one of the original markets in the US.  I&apos;ve lived in  Baltimore and worked in Baltimore for most of my adult life and have been to similar markets in the Baltimore MD region (Lexington, North East, Cross Street, Fells Point, etc)  The Reading Terminal Market is comparable and larger to most of the ones I&apos;ve listed.  I go to Philly at least twice a year and this is a must stop for me.  The boy likes to go to Di&apos;Nick&apos;s to get his beef and pork sandwiches, I love to go to Sang Kee to get the duck wonton noodle soup.  The coffee shop has 2 different stalls (once in the front across from Sang Kee and the second one by the Philadelphia General store in the back).  We typically go on Sundays and the Dutch/Amish Market area is almost always closed sadly.  The general store makes awesome cookies and their chocolate chip oatmeal cookie is one of my must buys when we come here.  The ice cream is also a frequent stop and the Guatemalan Fudge ripple is one of my favorites.  They also have seasonal flavors such as pumpkin and eggnog.  

During covid, they have closed most of the indoor eating areas and they did have some tables set up outside for eating.  They do require face coverings but I did find that when we went I felt that there was more people than what I was comfortable hanging out with as we were wandering about."
5,"Oh RTM, how do I love thee!


My wife and I have been here multiple times!  We love strolling through the aisles, looking at everything that is for sale. Seeing if they have anything new!

On our most recent trip (during covid), it was sadly very depressing...  We went on the Friday after Thanksgiving.  About 20% of the shops were closed...  There was no indoor seating...  If you did manage to find a chair that wasnt removed, security came along fast to move you along...  My wife is 8 months pregnant, so they let her be for the most part.

So since the last trip was a little dismal, I will post what we have come to love about this place.  We LOVE the cookies from the PA General Store.  OMG soooooooo amazing!  Soft and chewy.... such a delight.  After the first time we only bought 2 cookies, now we know to get 2-3 dozen! hahahaha!

I am a huge fan of Corned Beef and Pastrami, but as a NYer, we know Jewish style is the best!  Places by us are $30-40 per lb, or 20+ a sandwich, but good ol Hershels is a normal price!  $10 per sandwich, and $14 per lb!  Its worth it to drive down lol!

Since we arent locals, the produce isnt that big for us, but we love getting spices and seasonings from the Head Nut and the Herbiary.

We also love getting unique items from Amys place!  Highly recommend!

They also have several butchers that you can get fresh meats from.  We really love getting sausages and so many other items like steaks and sometimes fish.  Dont forget a cooler!

They also have about 10 stores that are direct from Lancaster Amish country!    Fresh butter, fresh eggs, fresh produce!  Make sure that you stop at Beilers for a donut and cake!  Millers also does amazing pretzels!  Make sure that you like butter.

If there is something that you are looking for, and do not know where to get it, 99% of the time, you can find everything that you need here!"
5,"Welp...
I made it home sweet home for the weekend and I am neva, eva, eva disappointed by the magnificent Reading Terminal. Did I mention never? You walk in and you still get that quaint, old fashion charm of the Terminal with new and trendy foods to satisfy the pickiest of eaters and those with food restrictions. I can&apos;t even begin to tell you, but I will, how elated I was to find an All vegan foodery in the Terminal!!!!! LUVH Vegan Deli was e.ver.y.tang!!!!!!! Oh my gosh!!!! I was able to have an Italian Hoagie that made my taste buds sing, and then the vegan Rueben....what?!!!!! The Pineapple Bundt Cake....smh....you all need to stop....the delicousness...well...I&apos;m here for it alllllll!!!!! If you make it to Philly and you want a plethora of choices take yourself to the Reading Terminal and enjoy a little bit of evrything."
4,"This place has A little something for everyone. My fav places were : 

Amish markets, homemade hot jerky sticks, homemade chips, fresh jams... 

farm fresh meats, thick bacon, stuff pork chops, huge turkey wings

Philly cheese steaks@spataros"
5,"Foodies heaven. Must visit for all Yelpers.

This place was recommended by so many people including Uber drivers. It is unfortunate they close early. I wish they stay open for dinner.

Don&apos;t make the same mistake as I did and be sure to come hungry.

Amish soft pretzels looked really good. I know they are good as I had one in Lancaster earlier. I walked around, up and down and everywhere to check out each one of them.

This market alone is a destination and must visit in Philadelphia."
1,"In the age of Covid 19 the scene at the market is pretty pathetic. Empty booths and no-show vendors make the place feel dead. Parking is stupid expensive. To get into the market you have to run a gauntlet of street beggars, winos and homeless. We definitely will not be back."
5,"This is a must-see if you&apos;re ever in Philly!
The market is huuuuge and has a ton of amazing food options - and such a variety! From the most delicious-looking sweets to the most savory-looking sandwiches, sides, and more. I truly wanted to try EVERYTHING.

It was really hard to choose what I wanted, but I ended up going with the lobster mac &amp; cheese from one spot that I can&apos;t remember the name...but seriously you can&apos;t go wrong with whatever you end up choosing. But this lobster mac was fulllllll of cheese and lobster. So amazing.

100% recommend coming here!!"
5,"(I&apos;m finally posting this draft from before the pandemic) Now this is what a market should be!  It has a little bit of everything for everyone. All of the staff were friendly and the choices weee abundant.  I will review each of the stall separately, but just coming here is an amazing food experience.  I actually liked the little gift shop they had next to the bathrooms for touristy gifts. Also, I would reccomend not trying to park to get here - it&apos;s really difficult even on the worst rather days!"
5,"Awesome place before and after COVID!!!!
There are so many different places to eat and so many cool little shops. Great for breakfast lunch and dinner and outings with family, friends or on a date!"
5,"I always enjoy stopping by Reading Terminal Market. Whether you&apos;re in the mood for ice cream, authentic chinese, donuts, diner food, and more. You&apos;ll find it here.

I love getting the peking duck rolls. It&apos;s my Go-To whenever I&apos;m here. I also love the little kitchen shop they have towards the back. I have yet to try the donuts because there&apos;s always a long line, but I really want to!

The ice cream is absoutely delicious as well. As unfortunate as it sounds, I kind of prefer visiting now during the pandemic because it&apos;s not as crazy packed as it usually is. Prior to the pandemic, you&apos;d basically be shoulder to shoulder with guests. Nowadays you actually have some room to walk. Definitely stop by but wear your mask &amp; bring hand sanitizer!"
5,"I had a whole Saturday afternoon in Philly alone for my first time and Reading Terminal Market was on my list!

I carefully planned out my visit, and after a bit of a struggle finding parking, I made it inside! I was here the first weekend after Philly had begun to reopen so things were a little weird, lots of random open space but this is the set up they deemed necessary for the Covid world. 

My biggest disappointment was the fact that I was only in town for a short while and staying at a hotel so I couldn&apos;t buy any of the amazing meats and veggies that I passed as I strolled through. I did pick up a few donuts from Beiler&apos;s to split with my boyfriend and a really good pretzel-wrapped hot dog from Miller&apos;s Twist. Everything was delicious! 

I wish I would have ordered a sandwich from one of the vendors but I felt like I&apos;d already eaten enough. I was slightly overwhelmed and everywhere I turned there something that looked or smelled utterly delicious. This spot will forever be on my list of places to visit when I&apos;m in the area!"
5,"What you&apos;re doing here is asking me to write a review about one of my favorite places in the country?

Look. Let me cut to the chase. 

Reading Terminal Market is a magical place. The type of institution you would brag to much younger people about visiting.

I frequently drive from Staten Island to Philly just to go here.

The selections are perfect, and there really is something for everyone. Come to think of it, there is something here for any mood you happen to be in.

If you haven&apos;t been here, then you haven&apos;t truly been to Philly."
5,"Who doesn&apos;t love this place? Such a huge building with plenty of food and shopping choices; perhaps too many choices? Here, You can get literally every type of cuisine you could possibly imagine. And it&apos;s all good! 
I&apos;ve only been here a few times recently when in town and it&apos;s usually a cheesesteak, but last time it was Hershel&apos;s for corned beef and pastrami. (Separate
Review coming later). 
Parking can be a problem near here if driving, so finding a meter or affordable garage is difficult at lunchtime. We were lucky to find a mater spot after circling the block a few times. 
No indoor dining with Covid restrictions in place, but hopefully it&apos;ll get back to normal soon. 
If you&apos;ve never been here, you must visit and enjoy the overwhelming vastness of the building and the plethora of cuisines. Definitely a must-visit while in Philly."
5,"Great selection, amazing vendors, and amazing food. Always a great place to take friends or family."
5,"I LOVE this place! It&apos;s so fun to visit during a stroll in the city. This place is the best because it&apos;s like a giant food court. There&apos;s such a variety of foods you can choose from, and they&apos;re all delicious! I could truly spend a whole day here sampling from every kiosk!

The best part is, a lot of the food is affordable and reasonably priced!

An additional perk is that it&apos;s next to the convention center, city hall, love park, etc! If you&apos;re ever in Philly, this is a must-go!"
4,"It was a great and exciting visit! Tons of food vendors from meats to sweets. There are a few art vendors too. I wish there was more of that!

Definitely come hungry there is so much to try! I loved the Buckeyes I got. The Macaroons were ok but a little tough. I just wish there was a map or better signage inside."
5,"If you&apos;re in Philadelphia and you love food, then you must make a trip here.  It&apos;s a food lover&apos;s paradise.  Whether you&apos;re looking for meats, seafood and produce to take home or sample some of the local cuisine, there&apos;s something for everyone who loves to eat.  Even if you don&apos;t love to eat, then you should go (but why are you reading Yelp reviews if you don&apos;t love to eat?).

They have donuts, a vegan deli, cheese steaks, mushrooms, distilled spirits, pretzels, more donuts, pies, cakes, pies baked inside cakes, Asian, pork sandwiches, pizza, hot dogs, gyros, deli counters, oysters, ribs, and even a buffet!  What???

Some places have counters to sit and eat at and some do not, so you may or may not find a place to sit and eat.  It can get crowded so be aware.  

There&apos;s not much else you can say other than go here.  I would definitely go back next time I&apos;m in town."
4,"So many great places to choose from, its tough to choose what to eat! Haven&apos;t been here in a few years, so some new vendors to try."
5,Forget the diet and go in and indulge so much to choose from pork sandwiches to the best ice cream!!!
5,"Great place for food, and groceries. There&apos;s so much variety and everything is hot and ready for you.  They got desserts, juices, all kinds of foods, meats, and small kitchen materials."
