5,"This place is a must to see how perfect and well stream-lined their outdoor seating / service is during COVID-19. They have created such a warm and inviting outdoor space. The tables are spaced apart and they have created little pods almost that house the tables. Taking it a step further they have added additional plastic coverings that locked the outside draft out while you sit under heated lamps. I couldn&apos;t be more impressed with how the owner how truly taken this hard time and made a unique and inviting dining experience!

Side note: do yourself a favor and make reservations and dine during Happy Hour. Their menu is a phenomenal Happy Hour Menu!!"
5,Went there for a quick dinner. I ordered the kimchi fried rice and Korean beef app. They were both very delicious. They have outdoor seating during Covid and it&apos;s sectioned off and they have built in heat vents that blow on you. On really cold nights I&apos;m not sure it will be very helpful though. But as usual the food is delicious.
5,"I&apos;ve been to Sampan numerous times. With friends, for my birthday, an intimate setting, etc. This restaurant is one of my favorite places to eat in Philly! The atmosphere is dimmed and chill on the inside and outdoor seating is on the sidewalk. All about preference!

I loveeee being able to choose flavorful foods from Sampan&apos;s different categories on their menu -- as well as sharing those items with others. Sampan has a great happy hour too! Also, you&apos;re able to easily make reservations on Resy.

This particular night, I did not go for the chef tasting menu (7 selections for $45 per person). I tried their edamame dumpling (one of my favs, broth so good and it has a smoky sort of flavor), crab wonton taco (first time trying and it was so good; wasn&apos;t expecting it to be cold but still delicious), scallops (another one of my favs; cooked to perfection), and shrimp pad Thai (requested no tofu; amazingly tasty and a big portion). Lastly, ordered their Thai Punch. You can definitely taste the alcohol and overall a good a** drink!

Staff was cool. The servers brought the food out FRESH and would describe what the dish was before walking off. Another thing, I LOVE that the staff brings the food right out after it&apos;s been cooked! 

I love this place! No complaints!"
5,"I come for HH here once or twice a month and never can get enough of this place. One of the best spots in town for HH. The menu is well priced and very extensive. HH portions are big enough. 
I am a vegan and can always find few items for myself. They usually are willing to customize some of their items for my needs, as well. The staff here is very polite and well-trained! Very nice and professional floor management, as well. 
For some reason every time my friends and I try to pick a place for a HH, we always land here. 
FYI Reservation is made through resy and HH is outside, but the place has covered booths and heaters."
4,"Love going to graffiti bar happy hour pre-COVID. Was excited to try out their regular menu. We got the edamame dumplings and brussel sprouts. 

The edamame dumplings were fantastic! Super creamy on the inside, and filling. The brussel sprouts were slightly oily and not as crisp as I would have liked. However, I could imagine that had I dined in, this problem would have been resolved."
4,"Won a bet with a friend and came for happy hour apps at 3pm. It was a doable brisk Friday, and we settled into our heated, partially-enclosed &quot;outdoor&quot; seating stall. Per our friends&apos; and the waitress&apos;s suggestions, we ordered: Korean BBQ Beef Satay ($4), Crispy Brussel Sprouts ($5), Pork Bao Buns ($5), and the Spicy Tuna Roll ($5) from next-door neighbor Double Knot. Our small dishes arrived in quick succession -- barely a wait.

Brussel sprouts are hands-down top 3 veg, and Sampan makes a mean variation that&apos;s spiced with chili oil, fish sauce, and little flecks of crispy rice. It&apos;s a satisfying bowl of seared green that I would recreate every other day in my kitchen if I could. The Pork Bao Buns take the cake for freshest dish. They&apos;re strangely sweet -- not a traditional Asian flavor -- but they&apos;re delicious. Between the pure white bao buns are fermented radish slices and a square of crispy pork belly patty. Would eat again.

The Korean BBQ Beef Satay is a bit less exciting: three mini rectangles of meat topped with kimchi slaw. They&apos;re tasty, but very sweet. They&apos;re also not very large, so idk if you get the bang for your buck. The Spicy Tuna Rolls are solid, but nothing crazy. Overall a cute excursion! Happy hour at Sampan is good vibes."
4,"Sampan is currently open for indoor/outdoor dining, takeout, and delivery. Happy hour is only for outdoor dining between 3pm-5pm. The seats are tables of 4 separated by plastic covers. Be sure to make reservations online beforehand! I came with a friend at 3pm right when it opened and the tables get filled up quickly. 

Our waitress was really sweet and made a bunch of recommendations. We got the Crispy Brussel Sprout ($5), Pork Bao Bun ($5), Spicy Tuna Roll ($5), and Korean BBQ Beef Satay ($4). I&apos;m usually a skeptic when it comes to Asian fusion, but Sampan gets it right. My favorites were the Brussels Sprout and Pork Bao Bun. The Brussel Sprouts were cooked and seasoned perfectly and the Pork Bao Bun was really unique combination of sweet and salty flavors that melted in your mouth. I wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the Satay and thought the meat was too sweet. 

TLDR: Sampan&apos;s a good option for outdoor dining! Its happy hour is very worth it and there&apos;s a bunch of unique Asian fusion dishes to choose from."
5,"Great Happy Hour spot (everyday 3-5pm)!!

Dishes: crab rangoon, pork buns, spicy tuna rolls ($5 each)
Drinks: skip the $5 speciality cocktail unless it is super interesting. Go for the $9 cocktail list instead (old fashioned, thai punch)"
5,"Super yummy. Had the chef tasting menu and left very full. Total of 7 dishes, and it had a bit of everything. Would come again. 
Had the edamame dumplings, rock shrimp, tuna crackers, kimchi fried rice, skewered wagyu, short rib Lo mien, and the fish."
4,"Returning to sampan after not being back for a while, it&apos;s one of the few places with happy hour during COVID times (M-F 3-5pm)

Their drinks are still solid, but some of their food is a little too salty for my taste, esp the lo mein, bbq beef satay, and pork bao. But the edamame dumplings are still creamy and delicious, probably my favorite order here.

I&apos;d come back here again, but not with as much enthusiasm as previous. Oh and btw they have wooden areas set up for dining, which can be especially nice for the winter months"
3,"small sampler plates that are a great price especially during happy hour!
-Edamame Dumpling: made up of truffle, pea shoots, and sake broth, this was definitely surprisingly really good. The inside has mushy pea shoots and a distinct truffle flavor, wrapped in delicate dumpling wrapper and soaked in an aromatic broth
-Pork Bao: definitely the best small plate. I personally love pork belly and the shallot and mint added such a distinct flavor. The bun was also extremely fluffy and the flavor of the pork was oh so delicious
-Kim Chee Fried Rice: Can never go wrong with this! The poached egg was really amazing and mixed in well with the rice and I LOVE those baby shrimps. Perfect tempura crunch things on the top as well
-Crispy Brussel Sprout: the puffed rice was good and I love Brussel sprouts, but they over did it on the sauce and it was a bit too salty
-Kobe Sliders: were a bit disappointing; the best part was honestly the toasted-to-perfection buns
-Wagyu Beef Satay: also a bit disappointing; wasn&apos;t bad, but I expected some higher quality wagyu and the portion was also wayyy too small. It is what it is though"
3,"I came here recently after not having visited for years and I just remember the food being so much better. We tried the dan dan dumplings which were hard on the outside and just didn&apos;t taste fully cooked. The sauce was also pretty strange to be called dan dan. The drinks were also super sweet and hard to finish. The edamame dumplings used to be my favorite thing on the menu, but also didn&apos;t taste creamy like they used to. Not sure if the chef/recipes changed or whether it was an off night, but I think it&apos;ll be a while before I try this place again. 

As far as COVID protocols, they do temperature checks and have indoor, outdoor and takeout/delivery. All servers were wearing masks, but they didn&apos;t ask patrons to wear masks when entering."
3,"The food has gone downhill since when I visited before Covid. I was never blown away, but flavors and textures were considerable off this time. I ordered a bunch of things as usual, but the only things that I enjoyed were the Kung Pao Chicken Wings, Chicken Bao, and Lo Mein. The prices were cheap per usual.

Edamame Dumpling - Filling was too gritty
Kim Chee Fried Rice - Lacking in Kimchee
Crab Rangoon - Too greasy
Korean BBQ Satay - Mushy
Spring Roll - Nothing special
Duck Samosa - Idk what I was thinking, this is not an Indian restaurant 
Calamari Salad - Chewy Calamari
Crispy Rock Shrimp - Inconsistent flavor profile
Pork Belly Bao - Pork was tough

I won&apos;t be returning anytime soon, hopefully Doubleknot doesn&apos;t fall victim to the same fate"
5,"Where do I start?! First of all, the seafood dumplings were my FAVORITE. They melted in my mouth and were soooooooo good. I would&apos;ve been satisfied just eating the dumplings for dinner. I also ordered the crunchy shrimp and really enjoyed it. Their sushi tasted fresh and was enjoyable as well. My boyfriend ordered the Korean beef and he could not stop talking about how tender, juicy, and tasty it was! 

PLEASE NOTE: you MUST make a reservation in order to dine here. I made the mistake of trying to walk in my first night out in Philly and was turned down. I was able to able a reservation through Resy For 2 nights later at 10pm! 

My bf and I were able to get indoor seating and the ambience was warm and romantic. Our waiter was really funny and attentive! A++ for service! 

I wish my stay was longer so I could come back and try more entrees!"
5,If you come here you must do the chefs tasting and you must order edamame dumplings they are Dangerously delicious you will become addicted I promise you
5,"I cannot think of any negatives about this special place to balance out my review. Simply stellar. They&apos;ve really figured out a way to make enjoyable dining possible during covid. They have pods that are really quite warm -- I was even debating taking my winter jacket off. It&apos;s nice to be sitting out on the streets too, as there&apos;s some solid people watching available in center city. The wait staff is also incredibly attentive. Obviously the food is tapas style, and we didn&apos;t regret ordering any of our plates. As a pescatarian, I especially recommend the salmon skewers (so very flavorful) and shrimp pad Thai! The Brussel sprouts are consistently the star of the show, too. Thanks Sampan for all that you do!

UPDATE (visited again for happy hour):

Sampan&apos;s happy hour absolutely broke the 5-star scale for me. Can I give it at least 6 stars?? I was blown away by how much high quality food &amp; drink we got for such a reasonable price. A huge bowl of fried rice for only $5?  You must be pulling my leg! The scorpion bowls are phenomenal and the right amount alcoholic for a lil evening fun! 
Our waitress was super kind and made sure we were able to place orders before the 5 o&apos;clock happy hour deadline/ the cheaper plates expired! 
I have never been so anxious to return to a restaurant in my life!"
5,"Sampan is always fire . Rock shrimp, crab tacos , and Brussels sprouts are a must. And they have good covid distancing . My fav restaurant in Philly ."
4,"Stellar spot for happy hour. When we went the roads were blocked off, allowing restaurants in the area to set up outdoor seating. You&apos;ll be able to enjoy a nice meal without the disturbance of cars and traffic. 

Happy hour is down right cheap ($5 plates and selected drinks). It&apos;s also a plus that their happy hour menu is pretty extensive. There are a lot of good options to choose from. We ended up trying the mushroom lo mein, kim chee fried rice, kung pao chicken wing, crab rangoon, chicken katsu bao, and edamame dumpling.

Our favorite dishes were the mushroom lo mein, kung pao chicken wing, and edamame dumpling. These dishes had the best flavor. The portions were especially generous for the lo mein, fried rice, and wings. They honestly could pass for an entree sized dish. Last but not least, we had the nicest server. She was super attentive and supportive of us over ordering! We would love to come back when we are in the area!"
5,"Came back to Sampan for a double date night and tried a lot of new dishes, which I highly recommend! Bao bun was everyone&apos;s favorite. We weren&apos;t crazy about the seafood shumai, but all the side dishes were still great and it was fun to order a few just to share with the table. The decor inside is very beautiful. This is a restaurant you have to add to your list! It&apos;s a fun and popular spot!"
3,"Let&apos;s start with the negatives-
We had a reservation for 7:45 and got there exactly then. (We made the reservation 5 days prior for the individual covid friendly covered patio seats). The hostess said they were running behind on reservations and we would have to wait 15-20 minutes- for a reservation we made in such advance. We got seated 35 minutes later than our reservation was for, at the worst table in the joint. Mind you, it was RAINING and our table was not even slightly covered. We then asked to be seated at the place we requested on the reservation and they said it would be another half hour. After seeing a table get up and leave from the patio, I went back to the hostess and explained how we waited 30+minutes to sit in the rain- she finally moved us. The three female hostesses were not accommodating and not friendly at ALL

The server we had was Kathy- she was super enthusiastic and friendly. However, we asked multiple times for things such as menus and napkins. It was definitely busy, so we understood the waiting times.We did wait a while for drinks, too, but that isn&apos;t her fault. 

Positives-
The covid friendly patio huts are super secluded, warm, and safe. I would 100% recommend sitting here if you are going to Sampan. Ambience was great, here. 

The food came quickly and was super tasty. I ordered the shrimp pad Thai for main meal, which is categorized under the &quot;sides&quot;. The bowl was so big that I could barely finish half of it! Definitely go for it for your entree and not as a side :) We also ordered the AMAZING crispy Brussels, rock shrimp (which is better at other places) and crispy duck (which comes with steamed bao buns) the drinks were really refreshing and strong. I would definitely go back to this restaurant - but wouldn&apos;t RUSH back. There are other places in Philly I would want to try before returning."
