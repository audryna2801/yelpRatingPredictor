5,"So glad my friend was craving Indian food and Thai restaurant had an open reservation that fit our schedule. The food was really really really good and the service was top notch from beginning to end...so obviously 5 stars. Let me give you the run down:

 - the outdoor seating is covid friendly and they have heater in each of the little sections. 
- when our table wasn&apos;t quite ready because the previous group was still dining...our server came out and took our drink order some could at least have a cocktail while we waited.
- our server Bennet was actually really incredible! He offered great suggestions for everyone...described all of the food so perfectly and was very attentive (but not annoying). 
- the food was amazing! We had an assortment of dishes and the only thing i didn&apos;t care for was the malai kofta Khulna (a paneer and apricot dish)...but everything else was bomb. If you&apos;re a vegetarian, I would recommend the paneer saag, the samosas, the Sphinach chaat and / or the channa masala. My friend had the chicken poutine dish as his main course and he loved it. He also had the lamb lollipops and devoured those.
- they bought out some champs for my friend&apos;s birthday 
- and they manager came and checked on us a few time.

Overall...it was such a nice experience. We were able to get out and enjoy a nice meal and still feel relatively safe considering we&apos;re still in a pandemic."
5,"Four of us came here for dinner, drink, and dessert and were quite impressed. I will break my review down into Service, Ambiance, Dinner, Dessert, and finally Drinks.

As we arrive at Indeblue I&apos;m on the verge of tears as I&apos;m certain we won&apos;t get a decent table as there is a reservation mix-up. But we do; relief washes over me in an awesome wave.

Service
Bennet was our server and was amazing, on point, super friendly, and efficient. We could not have asked for a better experience. The food was brought out in a meaningful succession, with the appropriate timing to enjoy each dish. Bennet&apos;s attention to detail on every aspect was much appreciated. For instance, we ordered the Lollipop Lamb Chops (which usually comes with 3 pieces), but since our table was for 4, Bennet added an additional piece so each person could have their own. His drink suggestions were perfect for each member of our party. We were also afforded complimentary chai tea, which was a nice touch. 

Ambiance
We sat at a beautiful large table, with an ornate chandelier and a direct view of a large eclectic art piece. I did expect more traditional music to be played, but although this was not the case, it did not take away from the experience. I have to assume what was being played was a Spotify playlist of contemporary cover songs by Bossa Nova-style singers. 

Dinner
We ordered Drums of Heaven (4/5), Vegetable Samosa Chaat (5/5), Paneer Toast (3/5), Lollipop Lamp Chops (4/5), Chicken Tikka (3/5), Moilee (5/5), and Madras (4/5). The star of the show was the Moilee. Distinct and flavor-filled sauce, with a large amount of shrimp along with a delectable Lemon Cashew Rice that was simply divine. 

Dessert
The table all ordered the Banana Nirvana and were not disappointed. The artful presentation of the dish, which was a deserving conclusion of a fantastic experience and meal. 

Drink
The table ordered 
Indebluetini (4/5) - tasted like a Mango Lassi, which was topped with Cardamom pods

There is a moment of sheer panic when I realize that our Indebluetini is much less filled than other patrons.  I take a first sip, enamored with the whirlpool effect of cardamom pods.  I calm myself and sink into the powerful, yet quaint subtleties of this Indian inspired imbibement. 

Mumbai Mirch (4/5) - Made to the specific spiciness of each person, complete with red and green pepper garnish.
Om Shanti Om (5/5) - Fragrant and delicate bourbon drink with sprigs of lavender, which heightened the drink&apos;s enjoyment.
Maharani (4/5) - An exotic and inviting bourbon-based drink, which was surprisingly floral, with a subtle sweetness that I have to assume emanated from the Gulab."
5,During covid I would not have expected such great and accommodating indoor dining experience. By far our server Laurie was the most welcoming person and essentially made our brunch so memorable. She recommended the best appetizers and entrees which exceeded our expectations. Each item was beyond delicious and did not disappoint. We can&apos;t wait to come back and would recommend this restaurant to anyone who is looking for a fun ambiance and welcoming brunch.
5,"Made a reservation for two people on a late Saturday night for dinner. Tables are safely spaced out inside and we are immediately given menus/water when sitting down.

We started off with the Crispy Cauliflower ($10) to share - a nice balance on tangy sauce on the hearty cauliflower pieces.  This paired well with a couple of the draft beers ($7) they had on tap. For the main course, decided on the Laal Maas ($23) - multiple large chunks of boneless lamb in a chili/yogurt sauce, served with two fluffy pieces of paratha. Loved the combination of the curry and paratha - simple and needing nothing extra. Also, had a bit of the Dilruba ($18) - a densely packed dish of potato and eggplant.

Service here is fantastic and the menu is straightforward. One of the best options for Indian food in the city."
4,"It was my first time here.I came in as a party of 2 on a weekday night. Although we did not make the reservation, the waiter was able to sit us immediately, and he was very friendly and accommodating.  I would recommend everyone to call or make a reservation online since this place seems very popular for dinner. Our table was seated in the middle of the room, it was hard for me to hear the other person talking. So yes, if you come here for a big day, make sure you make a reservation.

The restaurant is beautiful and spacious, and the interior design is elegant and fancy, but it still has a cozy ambiance. Perfect for a date or a family/ friend gathering party. 

Thoughts for food

We ordered 2 cocktails, the mumbai mirch and the anjeer. The mumbai mirch is so delicious, which I stole from my bf after the first taste lol. The anjeer is okay, nothing unique. Highly recommend the mumbai mirch!

Chicken Makhani poutine is awesome. It has a crunchy texture but still soft inside. The fried aged cheddar is delicious, interesting to have with the chicken. 

The  toast is alright, delicious but I wish it could be crunchier. 

I heard so many good reviews for the paneer tikka masala, and decided to order it. Oh wow, the portion is huge, we got so full after 2 appetizers and this dish. If you are a light dinner eater like me, you will have leftover if you order 2 entrees. The dish is delicious and flavourful. The paneer cheese looked like tofu, so it surprised me when I had the first bite. 

Overall, it&apos;s a great restaurant with a twist of modern Indian cuisine. If you are looking for authentic Indian food, this is not a place for you. I am not into too spicy food and heavy flavor, so I prefer modern Indian food. If you love Indian food and open to enjoy the lighter flavor, look no further, this is the place!"
5,"Went here for my fianc√©es birthday diner.  She use to love their place in Collingswood.  We eat Indian food A LOT.  This place is one of the best.
It is beautiful inside.  The wait staff is amazing.  I am actually sad I cannot remember our servers name, he was awesome!  One of the other servers even listened to us order and brought us over a special chutney.
We did the tasting menu for two, and added on some things.  I cannot remember everything we ordered but I am adding photos so you can see the awesome presentation!  The names did come up as I typed it.  The food was even better than it looked.  I cannot wait to go here again!  Had so many leftovers!"
4,This place was amazing for brunch. The food selections were spot on and the bottle of champagne for mimosas was a good choice. I only wish the indian food brunch selections came with more meat and rice. The portion size was pretty small considering the price($16).
4,"I had a great dining experience here! Given the pandemic situation we ate outside on a chilly day. The service was very accomodating for taking us 30min prior to kitchen closing on a late sunday afternoon. They were also very courteous in accommodating heating to make our dining experience as nice as possible. We really appreciated the extra care taken to fuel those extra heaters around us! 

We all enjoyed the lunch special which basically came w/ a samosa, choice of naan/roti bread, one vegetable entree, dal makhni, raita, basmati rice, and dessert! We were able to swap out the kheer dessert for a lovely dark chocolate mousse and  they allowed for minor substitutions which was much appreciated. Our party of five was rather picky but our server did a great job accommodating/remembering everyone&apos;s order.

I personally enjoyed my malai kofta and traditionally we would order several veggie entrees and eat family style but with covid/wintertime outdoor dining this personalized meal was delicious. It was served piping hot and the roti was cooked beautiful in a tandoori style. I&apos;m looking forward to dining her again and would highly recommend it!"
5,"A gem! this place is a fancy, sexy and desirable gem that decorates Philly in a very epicurean way. It&apos;s a beautiful place inside, with sophisticated decor. Then, Laurie, who made this a memorable and welcoming first time, a.k.a the second gem int his place. Service, in general, was better than amazing. We went there for brunch and had the mimosa trio: lovely lavender-infused orange juice, mango-cardamon, and rose petal that accompanied by a very decent California sparkling wine. Drums of heaven, literally, no, seriously, truly from heaven!!!! came together with the crispy spinach chaat, which was crispy and sweet and savory, and so refreshing for the start of a perfect brunch... (can you tell I loved this place?).
Then, we parted from heaven to a higher place with the most delicious chicken and waffles ever created. Don&apos;t believe me? Go there yourself and see. I&apos;m not a fan of chicken and waffles, but this was truly a magical adventure: the chicken was perfectly cooked, with a sweet/spice/tangy breading, waffles had a lovely savory/sweet batter, and the spicy mayo was creamy and feisty, and finally a chicken makhani with a succulent tomato sauce and perfect biryani rice. The chocolate pot de creme and the gulab jamun arrived lusciously and completed this heavenly experience. For an annoying New Yorker who is a devout fanatic of Indian cuisine, this was rewarding and epic. Am I going back? Are you kidding???? I&apos;ll drive an hour and a half or six to come back to this piece of heaven in Philadelphia."
4,"*Note: We ordered takeout on a cold night and had to reheat the food once we got home so the taste and experience was different that dining in.

On a cold, windy night in Philly, my roommate and I were looking to get some comfort food to warm us up and try out a new restaurant, which is how we stumbled upon IndeBlue! It was super easy to order online and pickup was also a breeze. The food did cool by the time we got home (~40 min) so we reheated everything in the oven.

Crispy Spinach Chaat: For my takeout buddies, the light brown sauce goes with the spinach!! I didn&apos;t realize this and thought the disk was &quot;just okay&quot; until I realized I had been missing the sauce the entire time. After I put in on, the dish got so much better, the sweetness of the sauce perfectly complemented the crunchiness of the spinach and shallots. People rave about this dish, and I understand why. 

Drums of Heaven: This dish was solid. Do note that you don&apos;t get that many pieces total (I think around 4 or 5?). However, I think if I were to order again, I would skip on this dish and get something more unique.

Crispy Cauliflower: My personal favorite! You feel like you&apos;re eating popcorn chicken and the softness of the cauliflower pairs perfectly with the crunchiness of the shell and spicy dipping sauce.

Shrimp Moilee &amp; Rice: Really enjoyed this dish, it was perfectly creamy and spiced and we had a couple good-sized pieces of shrimp. The rice was also nice and fragrant, I would just warn you not to make the mistake I did and ingest an entire chili and then have to chug a glass of milk.

Chicken Poutine: Okay I was very excited to eat this but it kinda fell flat for me. However, I think this was more of a result of our reheating process than the food itself, so if you are ordering in person, it will probably taste better. We weren&apos;t really able to get the cheese to melt on the fries right, the chicken felt a little dry, and the cheese curds felt kinda removed from the rest of the dish.

Across all the dishes, I feel like the spicy profile was just right. There was enough to give some flavor and a little kick, but not too much spiciness to make everything burn. Overall, we enjoyed the food we ordered from IndeBlue and we&apos;ll have plenty of leftovers to roll over to tomorrow!"
4,"I came for Restaurant Week brunch and enjoyed the slightly upscale hipster take on Indian favorites. I enjoyed the crispy spinach chaat, paneer tikka masala, saffron kheer, and garlic naan. All of the dishes were great with lots of flavor.

My only issue was the service: it was extremely slow, including waiting 30 minutes for someone to clean an open table so we could get seated when we arrived."
5,"YO - if you are looking for Indian cuisine, seriously do not look any further.

It was an upscale menu, with a big twist on modern and traditional. HUGE menu - lots of options, I would find it hard pressed to find something you like here. 

On a quick note, their cheese board is probably one of our favorites in the city (which is ironic for their focus of cuisine) but if you are going to start with anything, start with this.

Their portions are fair, compared to the price. The service was spectacular. 

Everything we ate was just a punch of flavor, and the combinations of spicy, sweet, fresh, and creamy were represented in every dish one way or another. 

Super sheek inside as well, perfect place to go for a date night."
2,"This place completely ruined our dinner, and there&apos;s no way I&apos;d recommend it to anyone. 

We planned to be in Philly for my birthday, so after doing some research I decided to make reservations at IndeBlue to celebrate. When we walked in, there was no one inside to instruct us where to sit. After waiting a few minutes, we were met with the coldest &quot;Can I help you?&quot; from the hostess. We were led to our table, which was awkwardly positioned in the middle of the main dining room indoors. They do get credit for spacing out tables during the pandemic, we just happened to get what seemed to be the worst table in the restaurant. 

20 minutes went by from the moment we sat down to the moment our waiter came over. When he did, we asked if there was outdoor seating, and he said he was going to go check. Right after, I saw him walk to the bar of the restaurant and make drinks for 15 mins, before coming back and saying there weren&apos;t tables outside. By that time, it had been over 30 mins of us sitting around, without even having the water we had asked for earlier. 

While all of this is happening, random staff were walking around (nose completely uncovered) giving out an insanely small cup of soup, part of the dining experience on the weekends. No description of what it was - they just placed it on our table. 

Important to note that on the weekends you can only dine with a fixed menu for $35/per person. 

45 mins into dinner and we still didn&apos;t have the bottle of wine we ordered. When our waiter brought it, it turned out to be the wrong bottle in terms of the year. No big deal, it was still good. But by that time the dinner had almost been ruined. With the loud atmosphere and one of the worst services I&apos;ve ever received (or services I never received, should I say)  I was regretting my reservation at IndeBlue.

Onto the food... The entrees and appetizers were good, although the dessert was bland and the soup tasted like canned soup. The chicken poutine was delicious and the lamb entree was really good, too. Unfortunately they weren&apos;t good enough to fix the rest of the night. By the end, they had even brought out the wrong desserts. 

I communicated these issues to the manager earlier into the night, who said he&apos;d make sure we were taken care of, whatever that meant. Although he was really nice and charismatic, service didn&apos;t become drastically better after our conversation with him. I think one of the the issues at hand is that they are extremely understaffed during the weekends. 

If you&apos;re looking for an intimate, nice dinner, this is not the place."
5,"My husband and I have been craving Indian food and came across Indeblue through a friend&apos;s recommendation. The outdoor dining space is a little cramped, but that didn&apos;t really bother us too much. We fell in love with the place instantly! We went for the $45 pp tasting menu, which is a great deal! The tasting menu was definitely worth it for us because we wanted to try as much of the menu as possible. 

We ordered:
- Crispy Spinach Chaat (so crispy, flavorful, and light)
- Crispy Cauliflower 
- Lollipop Lamb Chops (so tender but a little small)
- Shrimp Moilee (our favorite curry!!!)
- Lamb Laal Maas
- Dessert Assortment: Kheer, Chocolate Pot de Creme, Gulab Jamun

All of the food was so delicious and filling! The Shrimp Moilee was both of our favorite dish, but everything was wonderful. They also have a nice assortment of naans to accompany the curries. The garlic naan is probably my favorite!

The service was impeccable! We can&apos;t wait to come back to try more foods on the menu!

I hear they have a fabulous happy hour from 4-5 PM, but I&apos;m sad I&apos;m always working during those times. Maybe one day, I&apos;ll be lucky enough to check it out!"
5,"Amazing hipster indian food.  Definitely the best i&apos;ve had anywhere.  Absolutely worth the money, and takeout here is really hard to beat.

Got the spinach chaat and it was super crunch.  It literally just tasted perfect- the pils and spices complimented it perfectly.  GET THIS if nothing else.

Also got the drums of heaven.  They live up to the name- they taste awesome with the sauce.  Way easier to eat, and way crunchier, than comparable fried chicken.  Without the sauce they were pretty good but not as great as some of the other spots around Philly.

Would definitely return if I was in the area."
5,"I&apos;ve heard rave reviews about IndeBlue and I&apos;m so glad I had the opportunity to try it. Delicious cocktails, food, and excellent service. The woman who was our server was very kind and attentive. She helped us navigate the menu since we aren&apos;t super familiar with Indian food. The dishes were all super flavorful and delicious. We enjoyed the crispy spinach chaat as our appetizer as recommended by our server! My boyfriend and I shared the chicken tikka and the chicken catani both were amazing. The garlic naan (lasooni naan) was also delicious we will have to order 2 next time. Will definitely be back!!"
5,"Forever a favorite Indian food restaurant. The American Indian fusion options are constantly changing while always keeping a few finger licking staples constant. Happy hour is a hit or miss with food but dinner has never disappointed. The restaurant has a Bollywood gold royal vibe with its menu resembling the same. For food I highly recommend: crispy spinach chaat, paneer toast, lamb chops, pork egg rolls, shrimp tacos if it&apos;s an option, lamb poutine, drums of heaven and the lunch time thali special. For cocktails I recommend: ginger Jadoor, Mumbai Mirchi, indeblutini . If you&apos;re ever in Philly, you must give this place a try. You won&apos;t be disappointed!"
5,"This place is quite unique, the perfect modern Indian fusion recipes with super friendly staff and great ambiance. We ordered several appetizers and we were not disappointed by a single one. If dining here you must try the butter chicken poutine and the crispy spinach chaat, we ordered two servings because we couldn&apos;t get enough. Their drinks are also delicious and exotic. Dining here definitely made my trip to Phi"
5,"I really enjoyed my time here. I felt the dishes carried their own unique flavor profile and were able to stand on their own as strong menu items. Powerful flavors and very good. 

The interior is beautiful. Tables are spread apart to practice social distancing. During COVID, they extended their happy hour to 7 pm.

We went during happy hour and ordered some drinks and a bunch of apps that were half off. The Indebluetini drink was delicious, a balance of sweet and savory. Skip the chai sangria. We ordered the crispy spinach chaat, chicken makhani poutine, crispy cauliflower and drums of heaven. My favorites were the chaat and poutine. The spinach chaat looked disappointing as it was served because it looked like boring baked crisp spinach. When I took a bite of it, all I could think of was omg. How was this so good?? The sauce and everything about it was delicious and extremely flavorful. 
I was excited about the chicken poutine because of my poutine experiences in Canada. This dish had only a couple cheese curds and melted cheddar cheese. But I enjoyed this dish nonetheless. The fries were crispy, cheese perfectly melted and everything complimented each other.
The crispy cauliflower and drums of heaven had similar flavor profiles and were pretty hearty dishes. The drums of heaven were decent sizes of chicken wings. The crispy cauliflower was good but not that crispy. I liked the sauces that came with it but I understand why other reviewers compare it to marinara sauce. 

We then got the tandoori chicken tikka chipotle and garlic naan (lasooni). I thought these dishes were okay. The naan could&apos;ve been taken to the next level if it had some salt. The tandoori chicken was tender but I wish it had more spices and flavor. I didn&apos;t particularly think the chipotle flavor complimented the dish well.

Overall great restaurant with great service. Their happy hour is an amazing deal and worth it. I will definitely be coming back here to try more of their dishes!"
5,"My husband and I are on a mission to support some of our favorite local businesses during this very trying time, while also finding a balance with cooking at home and keeping our diets relatively healthy. Weekends are when we&apos;ve been treating ourselves to time off from cooking and cleaning, and we chose to end our weekend with a massive takeout order from IndeBlue. 

We saw on social media that IndeBlue was offering 25% off for takeout orders placed directly with them over the phone. I called and spoke with the nicest employee who gave feedback on our choices and even threw in some complimentary rice pudding! 

My husband swung by on his bike for the pick up, and I was very impressed by how nice everything looked when he got home. We ordered: crispy cauliflower, vegetable samosas, crispy spinach chaat (a longtime favorite!), sea bass entree, shrimp moilee, paneer tikka masala, and a double order of naan. Our intention was to have enough for at least two meals and we definitely accomplished that. 

Everything was delicious, as always. I can&apos;t wait to enjoy our leftovers (and another night off from cooking and cleaning!) for dinner tonight. Definitely think of IndeBlue if you&apos;re craving really fantastic Indian food!"
