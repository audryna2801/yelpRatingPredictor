5,"One of the better if not best Lobster Rolls I have ever had. It combines both mayo and butter to give you the best of both worlds. Good fresh Lobster is not cheap but I still feel this was worth the price. 

I would definitely recommend. Order online and pickup."
5,"Takeout only for right now (November 2020) with 1 table outside, but the park is right around the corner if you want somewhere to sit and eat it.

Food:
Lobster roll - 5/5 stars - Absolutely delicious roll loaded with lobster. The lobster meat was all claws and was super fresh. Nice, juicy, sweet and refreshing. Bun was buttery, soft and perfectly toasted on the outside. Can&apos;t beat their quality and taste. 

Poppyseed Slaw - Not a slaw person but decided to give it a try. Pleasantly surprised by how much I liked this. It was tangy, crunchy and refreshing. 

Hands down the best lobster rolls you can get in the area. Excited to try their other items!"
5,"Best lobster roll I&apos;ve had in a while! Buttery and so good. Initially was disappointed by the size but ended up being quite filling! If you are starving they have a Jumbo size of every roll. There are 4 seating spots, 3 inside really far part, one out door seating. Will definitely be back"
5,"I have been all over Maine eating lobster rolls and they don&apos;t touch Luke&apos;s. 
If you are going to pick a time to tell me bad news please do it while I&apos;m eating a lobster roll from here. 
I look forward to going here every Friday. It is a pricey sandwich but worth every penny. 
Their lobster rolls have made me forget that cheesesteaks exists.
Love this place"
3,"Okay it was fresh, it was good, but I was hungry an hour later. These portions leave something to be desired, but man was it fresh! 

I ordered the trio with a cup of lobster bisque. The bisque was wonderfully creamy and delicious, the crab and lobster both sweet and full-flavored! You can&apos;t go wrong here!"
4,"Great spot for lobster rolls. The lobster was so fresh and the portion was pretty big. 
Service was fast even though there was a long line. There aren&apos;t many places to eat around the area so you have to either walk to the Rittenhouse Square, Park or just take it out and eat at home."
2,"Short and simple won&apos;t waste your time 

Looking for a great lobster roll ..:this isn&apos;t the place
Regardless of which meat you choose ..the best being the crab in my opinion. This place isn&apos;t a place for lush flavored rolls it&apos;s pretty simple and pretty bland. I&apos;ve had lobster rolls here that tasted like flimsy inedible rubber. I&apos;ve had the Mac and cheese with hope it would be some what decent and just simply let down. But to each is own. Down the street is a much more worthy lobster roll at the oyster house!

 Thank me later"
5,"I&apos;ve had two lobster rolls this summer 2020 (Lobster Roll aka LUNCH located in The Hamptons and Luke&apos;s Lobster in Rittenhouse). I can say that Luke&apos;s was my favorite! I&apos;m not the biggest fan of lobster all the time but it&apos;s something about it fixed nicely inside the right roll with fixings that does something for me!

Dropped in and ordered the lobster roll to-go, with a bag of chips and Mexican cola. Did not wait a long time. The lobster was in a cute roll and just so tasty! Mmmm!

The cashier/cook was really cool and down to earth!

I&apos;m curious about their other rolls and will possibly try another one next time or just order the same lobster roll lol!"
4,"My mother woke up and decided it was a lobster roll kind of day. The Luke&apos;s Lobster we ate at before on 11th Street has since closed so we chose the remaining location in Rittenhouse Square versus Salty&apos;s Seafood because they were only offering a 35.00 pri fixe menu as far as we could tell from the online menu.

As far as dine in, there is only one table outside the storefront. We were offered seats inside at the counter because there were no other customers at the time. 

If you read my review for the other Luke&apos;s Lobster I stand by that 100 percent and could have copied and pasted that review here. It&apos;s just terribly overpriced. BUT, these rolls were packed with delicious, tender, buttery lobster on the most perfectly toasted roll. We could have used a fork and more napkins but sitting outside on a perfect autumn day eating that was pure bliss."
5,I&apos;m obsessed with you. I remember one time I wrote that my name was queen Deborah and you guys actually wrote it on my food box and drew a crown. That was the cutest thing. Love y&apos;all
4,"The food was very delicious. It was very expensive, but I expect that with a seafood place. The service was great, and the cashier was very professional and suggestive about the menu. The portions were smaller than I expected, but I know seafood is very expensive. Definitely a must try if you&apos;ve never been here"
5,"Best. Food. Ever. You MUST stop here if visiting PHL!! Try the Truffle Lobster Roll. Yum! My son ordered the Trio and he was so happy! We are only in town for 3 days, but we plan to return at least once more before we fly home. Excellent service and staff!"
4,"If you&apos;re confused between the lobster roll and the truffle lobster roll, definitely go with the original lobster roll. It is so much better since I found the truffle overpowered the lobster roll. The poppyseed slaw was average, nothing outstanding but was fresh nonetheless."
3,"Food was good but overalll I dont think its worth the money. I underatand seafood is expensive to begin but the portions are very small. I am someone who typically chose the seafood option when out so i know the cost invlolved. Overly the food flavor was good. I got the trio which is half crab, half shrimp &amp; half lobster. All 3 sandwiches put together maybe equal the size of 1 normal hot dog roll. In their defense they do pile on alot of meat so that kind of helps alittle."
4,"I came here in February and ordered a lobster roll , a side of lobster  Mac and cheese with a side of white truffle oil ! The white truffle oil which is a seasonal item is a MUST !!! It really served to enhance both items  which is rare . I think truffle oil  tends to mask other flavors in lieu of serving to be complimentary however again it went well ( enhancing the subtle brininess of the lobster claw meat in both the roll and the thick rich creamy decadent Mac and cheese ).  The total for both was close to $30 I believe which is the most I&apos;ve ever spent on li he in Philadelphia ...but hey it&apos;s lobster !!! What do you expect ?

Parking is quite a hassle  as other reviews have mentioned which is a common  issue in center city .  But I&apos;d still recommend . I&apos;d recommend  visiting here  if you are already on foot to to pick up some items to have maybe a mini picnic with someone special at the park which is close by !"
4,Visiting from out of town and the locals were adamant about checking out Luke&apos;s - I know why now! Never had a lobster roll before but this roll is definitely a great bench mark. The roll has chunks of claws which make for a tasty bite every time. The Mac and cheese also had large chunks of lobster serenaded by lava cheese. Enjoyed it and will be back next time I&apos;m in town!
3,"Honestly, the food here is good - we ordered a jumbo gluten free lobster roll without mayo, a set of trio rolls without mayo, and a large lobster bisque. Everything tasted incredible, but almost seemed like it was out of &apos;Honey, I shrunk My Kids!&apos;

While I understand that lobster in Pennsylvania is difficult to come by, I did expect to have at least slightly larger portion sizes.. especially for the $26 jumbo lobster roll which they claim to contain 50% more meat on the same bun. I expected the meat to be slightly heaping off the side of the bun, but in reality, it barely filled the ~6inch bun. Similarly, the $12 large lobster bisque was about the size I would expect for a small container, and the small container looked like it could be used as a sample/tasting cup. Additionally, while the roll for the lobster roll was warm buttery and delicious, the lobster meat was cold, maybe lukewarm at best - might have just been a point of clarification I forgot to ask about, but I prefer the meat on my lobster rolls to be warm along with the bun. 

We also ordered ahead and arrived at the exact time the website told us to (it specifically says not to arrive more than 10 minutes late or else they&apos;ll have to remake your order), yet our order wasn&apos;t ready for about 15 minutes after we arrived, and several orders were ready before ours that were placed while we were sitting in the restaurant.

Inside, the place has a very cool ambiance but there is admittedly limited seating, with only a few tables and spots at a wooden bar. The tables are also very close together, so it&apos;s difficult to have a private conversation. 

TLDR: good quality lobster meat, but as a seafood enthusiast who has had well over 100 lobster rolls in my lifetime.. I definitely didn&apos;t feel like I got what I paid for."
4,"I have ALWAYS wanted to go to Luke&apos;s Lobster here in Philly and tonight I finally got the chance! This cozy little place is hidden on Sansom right outside Rittenhouse Square and if you&apos;re going too fast you might just pass by it without noticing!

My partner and I split the Jumbo Lobster roll and the Crab roll Combo with Lobster Bisque as a side soup and we thoroughly enjoyed everything! The lobster was definitely better than the crab because of how much of a lobster taste it had but either both, you can taste the freshness of them. The lobster bisque was also a nice add on with our combo but definitely not the star.

With that said, we were not thrilled with the size of the Jumbo Lobster because it was nearly the size/quantity of our crab roll which absolutely made no sense given that the jumbo was $6 more than the normal lobster roll.

In the end, when you split everything down the middle like we did it ended up being nearly $26 per person which is a little pricey for lunch/dinner for the quantity but the quality was amazing.

If you&apos;re looking to treat yourself for some NE style lobster/crab rolls you&apos;re looking at the right place, however, I&apos;ll be coming back when the wallet allows haha!"
5,"I finally tried the lobster roll and shrimp roll at Luke&apos;s Lobster Rittenhouse. Two words: absolutely awesome!  The chilled lobster meat was on a perfectly toasted, buttered bun with mayonnaise, lemon butter and seasoning.  Very fresh and a very generous serving of lobster meat. Same with the shrimp roll. Employees very friendly. I will be back soon!"
5,"Amazing food, fresh seafood, and amazing service!!! You definitely pay for quality over quantity here but it is totally worth every dollar. The portions look small but it is surprisingly filling."
