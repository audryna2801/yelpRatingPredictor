5,"This is one of the top restaurants in the city - HANDS DOWN!

From the moment you walk in, you can tell it is going to be a different experience. The decor is a mix of modern and medieval - new age lighting and sharp wood paneling, coupled with exposed concrete and melting candles. Just a really cool place to hang out at, grab a drink, and eat.

We tried their tasting menu, which was a great option because it allowed us to try 10 different style dishes. They also were super accommodating, as my wife is a vegetarian. Normally you have to share the 10 dishes, but they were open to her having her own dishes. So if you have a dietary restriction, make sure to mention it, because they will do their best to accommodate. 

We sat downstairs at the sushi bar. It was this really unique experience, almost like eating in a dungeon, but in the best way possible. It was so cool watching the chefs work with all the fish and make the sushi rolls. Yet, it still had an intimate feel - excellent spot for a date night.

Any of their seafood really stood out to me! The cod with rice probably was my favorite. Don&apos;t forget to grab some mochi for dessert."
5,"Hometown favorite. The brussels sprouts are the bomb dot com. Only knock I can give is if you don&apos;t go early for happy hour, you&apos;re going to be waiting. Not sure what the COVID restrictions are now but if you can order in, DO IT!  Can&apos;t wait to go back."
5,"Double Knot has been one of my favorite restaurants for happy hour or just an evening meal. I came here a couple months ago before the pandemic with a friend - even with a reservation, we waited a bit, but I thought it was well worth it. We were eventually seated at the bar downstairs. 

Each time I come, I always order a large amount due to the smaller portion sizes - I&apos;ve tried the Pork Gyoza, Edamame Dumplings, Wagyu Beef, Beef Short Rib (for 2), Pork Bao, and more! My favorite of them all happens to be the Edamame Dumplings - it has a light taste with a unique flavor, something that you need to try to really understand. I also really enjoyed the Beef Short Rib - even for two people, I found the portion to be quite large. The tender meat fell right off the bone, and it was definitely a step away from the smaller dishes. If you&apos;re not sure what to order, ask someone on the team for recommendations! There&apos;s a wide variety of options, and I definitely had some trouble balancing ordering too much versus too little.

The service was great here, and the food came out at a reasonable pace. I personally recommend coming for happy hour since it&apos;s more bang for your buck, but be sure to come early since everyone wants the $5 deal. Double Knot definitely gets packed quickly with long wait times if you don&apos;t plan ahead."
5,"Looking for a place to fulfill a sushi craving? Or how about  just an overall incredible Asian fusion experience? Double knot is EXACTLY where you need to go. 

The food is amazing from the appetizers to the entrees. There is a special chef tasting option which I highly recommend. You can either pick the dishes that will be served, or the chef will do all the work and choose the dishes that come out for you. (Dessert is included for all those with a sweet tooth like me)

PLEASE do yourself a favor and treat yourself to double knot!"
4,"*RECOMMEND*

If you want a nice, upscale place with good quality Japanese, Asian fusion food, this place is for you. This two story restaurant consists of a cafe seating area upstairs and a dining room/bar seating area downstair. Unfortunately bar seating is unavailable during this time, however, the dining room experience is just as pleasant. The decoration, layout, and vibe of the restaurant is comparable to an izayaka, but a bit more upscale. The dimly lit dining room ambiance is definitely great for a date or a cool hangout place to grab a drink and eat. The menu is quite extensive with lots of options. There is a chef&apos;s choice option where you get one dish from each of the 10 categories for $60 per person. However, we decided to get a la carte so we are not limited to just one dish per category. They have many premier meat and fish selection that you would not see often at a standard Japanese restaurant such as Kobe and Wagyu beef and hirame. They also have fresh wasabi!!! The quality of the food was definitely there. Highly recommend making a reservation in advance and let them know any dietary restrictions because not all of the items on the menu have descriptions underneath them.

*DINNER*

- fresh wasabi - first time trying it and it was good, a bit sweet and not too pungent 

 - Tuna Tartar: tuna was very fresh, the chili oil was flavorful but a bit too salty
- Japanese Fried Chicken: lightly crispy and has a good chew. I like the mayo 
it came with, a bit tart. A bit lacking in seasoning, prefer a bit more

- Unagi Donburi - the eel and the sauce on it was done really well, I really like the light but not too overwhelming umami and sweetness. It came with a good amount of rice, maybe a bit too much

- Robatayaki - Kobe Beef -  tender and soft, not too chewy and has a good char

- Robatayaki - Scallop - soft and fresh, taste like any other scallops I&apos;ve had

- A-5 kobe Sashimi - *GET THIS* Literally melted in my mouth

- Yellowtail Specialty Sashimi - fresh yellowtail works so well in the citrusy ponzu sauce

- Double Knot Big Eye Tuna Roll - Shrimp tempura on the inside and tuna on top. Pretty standard sushi roll

- Mochi ice cream (matcha, lychee, vanilla chocolate chip) - Vanilla chocolate chip one was my favorite followed by matcha and lychee. Good dessert to end with 

*VERDICT*
Overall it was a really nice experience and the food was pretty good. I would go back again"
5,"We were a table of four and everything on this recipe is Very, Very good. Our first time at this restaurant and it was much more than I expected. From the ambience to the downstairs seating area and our waiter....enough hospitality that will make you go back and we definitely will return."
5,Top 3 fav restaurants. Absolutely gorgeous inside and I love the ambiance. I love going on dates here with my boyfriend. We always do the chefs tasting it&apos;s our go to! Highly recommend
5,"Phenomenal. Made a early weekend reservation ~ 5:30 for the downstairs dining and was already packed! Definitely recommend a reservation. Beautiful dark, candlelight ambiance - very romantic. Menu is tapas style and they want you to order every plate all at once. Not a problem, though. Was told about the menu&apos;s most popular and we went with each of those - wow! Each plate was beautiful, delicious, and filling. Highly recommend the tuna rice crackers, edamame dumplings, duck bao. We were regretting have a late brunch so we could have enjoyed more. All dishes well worth the price. Can&apos;t wait to return to this spot for another dinner / happy hour."
5,"I made a reservation on a Saturday night at 7:30PM for my boyfriend and I when we visited Philly for the weekend. When we arrived, we got seated right away with no wait for outside dining. Unsure of what foods to order since it was our first time, we opted for the chef&apos;s tasting, priced at $60 per person. We get to choose a total of 10 dishes, one from each certain category and there&apos;s mochi for dessert. Some foods we chose were the tuna tartare, shrimp taco, duck scrapple bao, lamb chop and wagyu beef robatayaki, broiled seabass, toro+soy+wasabi, A-5 Kobe + Wasabi, kimchi fried rice, and lo mein noodles with beef. 

To be honest, this place exceeded my expectations. When I first saw the option of chef&apos;s tasting, I was scared it would be small portions and not worth the price. However, we were extremely full from all the food that we had to take some to-go. I also want to note that the service was pleasant and our waitress was very patient with us. 

The highlights for me were the wagyu beef robatayaki, shrimp tacos, and the mochi. My favorite was the salted caramel mochi at the end of the meal. It was THE BEST mochi I ever ate in my life! I seriously went to food heaven from the first bite I took. It was such a unique flavor that I never had before and was the perfect consistency. I&apos;m craving it again as I&apos;m writing this review. 

I highly recommend coming here at least once and getting the chef&apos;s tasting. I also hear great things about the happy hour and can see why this place is such a hit! I&apos;m more than satisfied with my experience here and would definitely come back and recommend to others."
5,"Came in on a Monday afternoon around 5pm.  Already had a 45 minute wait, that says something about this place.

Ended up getting seated early.  Started with the Double Knot cocktail- their version of a smoked old fashioned.  Presentation was excellent, including a wood plank, wood chips and a torch.  The drink was just as good.

Ordered a number of small plates, including the seafood dumpling, blue crab sushi, General Tso Soup dumplings, tuna tartare, and Wagyu beef.  Everything was excellent, but I especially liked the flavor of the beef.  Service was fast and pleasant.  If I lived in Philadelphia, this place would be a staple."
4,"Came here for happy hour 4-7. 
We ordered the bees knees, chicken thighs, bun mi, Kobe beef sliders, Vietnamese spring rolls and sailors blend. 
The Kobe beef sliders and Vietnamese spring rolls are hands down the best things we ordered. The Kobe beef sliders were delicious with the buttery fluffy bun. What a win and a must get! 
The chicken thighs and bun mi were a miss for us. - 1"
4,"Double knot delivers a solid happy hour experience in a very inviting space with excellent service and great drink and food specials. 

The happy hour food items are all priced at about five dollars. We ordered the pork banh mi sandwich, Spicy tuna roll, shrimp tempura roll, and the roasted broccoli.  The portion sizes were not pared down for happy hour. The sandwich was quite large and filling; the rolls were really good; the broccoli, well was broccoli, nothing special. 

The place appears to get very packed for happy hour we were lucky to snag the last available table near the door. Many people that came after us waited around and some even left. So keep that in mind if you have your heart set on happy hour at Double Knot - there may be a wait."
5,"Don&apos;t judge a book by its cover! The restaurant opens up to a lower level with seating arrangements that can accommodate 2 or even larger groups of 8 or more. I&apos;ve enjoyed the bar/restaurant setting both as a date night and also as a professional dinner with coworkers. The ambiance is super moody, low lighting with candles. In fact, it can be a little difficult reading the menu. I&apos;ve enjoyed many bites and drinks off the menu. Highly recommend."
5,"There&apos;s a lot of hype around this place it seems -- we made a reservation a few weeks in advance. For a Friday-Saturday booking, I&apos;d say that they book up 1-2 months in advance, so be sure to plan ahead! Once you get there, there is a check in area towards the back -- they will direct you downstairs to the restaurant area (upstairs is where they do happy hour). 

We had counter seating which was fine. Our server was fantastic. He made a lot of great suggestions for food and drinks -- I got the Monkey&apos;s Fist and my guy got the Pocket Coil. Both were amazing! 

For food, we got the tempura cheese curds, miso eggplant, avocado roll, mushroom roll, crispy tofu with mizzuna pesto, and mushroom gyoza. Literally everything was amazing. One thing I will note is that they recommend 4-6 dishes per person -- we ordered 6 altogether for 2 hungry (but not starving) people and we were stuffed by the end. So just something to be aware of. 

Overall, I&apos;m sure we&apos;ll definitely be back!"
5,"Stumbled upon this place my first weekend in Philly... Have been 8 times since August... Had a rude hostess my first time there - everyone in my party was shocked - but ever since I have had NO complaints. Staff is super amazing. 

I am a major foodie so it means a lot when I say... Double Knot is THE BEST - no lie my favorite restaurant of ALL TIME. 

Get the brussel sprouts, broccoli and shishito peppers! The sushi rolls, bao buns, raw fish and pork kabobs are also amazing.

Gluten-free and/or dairy-free? No problem either. The staff will help you through and help accommodate your order accordingly."
5,"We were in town for one night and we&apos;re directed to Double Knot by our hotel.  We arrived without reservations and they were able to seat the two of us.  We were sat in the bar area and Hazel provided our service.  

The tables were well spaced out for COVID.  We didn&apos;t feel like anyone was on top of us. 

I can honestly say this has been one of my favorite dining experiences to date.  As it was our first time here we ordered appetizers with drinks. They prefer you to order all of your food at the same time and plates roll out. 

Drinks. The Southeast Side was awesome.  I&apos;m a gin head and was pleasantly surprised by the citrus basil cocktail.  I actually had three and would highly suggest.  We also tried the New Lover&apos;s Knot. This drink was good, but fairly sweet. Buyer beware. 

The 5-star review comes because the Chef&apos;s Selection was over the top.  While pricey, we had more food than we could handle.   Our favorites of the 10+ courses was the tuna tar tar, the duck bao buns and the Kobe Beef. 

We were finished off with a pumpkin cookie mochi.  The best mochi I&apos;ve had in my life. 

Again, one of my favorite dining experiences.  I would love to come back to Double Knot, it will forever stay on my list.  

Thanks Hazel and staff.  Quite the adventure.  Not only was the food phenomenal, the portions and atmosphere were equally as excellent."
5,"The daily happy hour they have here is incredible value AND the selection is more than adequate. We arrived 30 minutes after they opened for the evening and even the bar had no seats left. Everything we got was delicious. We ended up fighting to finish the last bite on the brussels sprouts ($5), and even considered just getting another order of it, but we wanted to be reasonable people and save some space in our bellies for dinner. The short rib skewer ($3) was incredibly juicy and tender. If I lived in this city I would be here every week for happy hour. That is all.
 
1. Crispy Brussels Sprout (puffed rice, fish sauce, chili)
2. Edamame Dumpling (truffle, pea shoot, sake broth)
3. Swordfish Meatball Robatayaki
4. Short Rib Robatayaki"
5,"Ok so... this place is amazing. 
While in town for work my coworker found this place and my first order was the sushi daily specials. Rainbow roll and the kind salmon roll were both delicious. Then I decided two days later to go back... I got the duck bao, the chicken katsu bao, and again the king salmon roll. The bao were both amazing and I loved the duck bao especially. They&apos;re so cute and the buns are so soft and fluffy. Then the day after I went again... as you can see I was really loving the place. This time I got the duck bao, the king salmon roll (again....), and the short rib robotayaki. The rib was again amazing and there hadn&apos;t been anything from there that I did not love. 
Then, I went again with my best friend and we got their cocktails this time which I have to say were amazing! we tried four of them but I don&apos;t remember which ones. We had the chicken stir fry and i also don&apos;t remember how that tasted. We have the king salmon roll lol.. and of course the duck bao. She was visiting so I had to introduce her to this yummy place. 
Finally, the fourth day of going I order the robotayaki short rib and it was not great. I think I got a bad cut sadly.. I also ordered the crispy Brussels sprouts and was not a fan, they were a bit too salty for my taste but my coworker liked them so I&apos;m sure it was just my personal preference. I also ordered the Eel avocado roll and it was a good roll, nothing special. 


All in all I love this place and the only reason I havnt gone in the couple days since I last went was because my coworker was teasing me for only going to eat there... however I feel like it shouldn&apos;t really matter since there are so many things to choose from, it&apos;s like going somewhere new each day. 

Ill probably go again tonight."
5,As usual their service was great. We came here for dinner during the Covid pandemic. All of the servers wore masks and gloves. There are plenty of outdoor seats available. They combined Sampan and double knot menu it seems. If not they are serving only Double Knot items. I really enjoyed everything except for the rock shrimp. It was a bit salty for my liking. If you do the chef tasting you won&apos;t be able to eat everything. They are still very generous with the food. It&apos;s a great experience as always.
4,"Time: 

Aug. 28 2020, Late night around 10:30 PM

Right now during COVID Sampan &amp; Double Knot are doing a joint outdoor dining menu, so it&apos;s a great time if you were like me and wanted to try out both restaurants.

Atmosphere:

The outdoor seating was great. Large Kirin Ichiban umbrellas cover each table and the entire street was blocked off from cars due to all the outdoor dining in that part of town. I thought that the chairs and tables provided were good enough.

Service:

Excellent service! Everyone was friendly and respected personal space. Everyone had face masks on and there was minimal contact with the employees. They were even kind enough to let me use their hand sanitizer since I forgot my own. The hostesses answered my questions professionally and were knowledgeable about the menu.

Food:

So for food, I&apos;ll try to separate the reviews for the food to their respective restaurants.

Crispy Rock Shrimp - 5/5
This was the best part of the whole order. The flavor of the sauce, the crispiness of the shrimp, and the pickled raddish all make this dish shine. The chili aioli in the sauce adds a kick of flavor without making the dish too spicy, if you can&apos;t handle spice I wouldn&apos;t worry about this dish, it&apos;s definitely tolerable. I would order this again if I came back to Double Knot.

Duck Scrapple Bao - 3/5

The bao was nice a fluffy, which I personally like. The duck tasted okay. It was fried pretty nicely though. Was a pretty average dish, I would opt to order one of their other bao&apos;s if I chose to come back here again.

Final Verdict:

Double Knot is making some good food. I definitely want to come back to try their other bao&apos;s. Their happy hour menu looks appetizing, so expect another visit from me!"
