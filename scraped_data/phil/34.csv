5,"Located in the Rittenhouse area, this little restaurant was in walking distance to our hotel. It can be hard to find because it is tucked away on the corner of a building, but worth a visit. My husband and I stopped in for some appetizers and enjoyed the charcuterie board with a nice assortment of salamis, parma ham, and prosciutto. We also enjoyed the Ewephoria cheese plate that was descibed as a butterscotchy Gouda.

They do offer beer, but this is more of a wine bar. It is a great place for a date night."
5,"I&apos;ve always been a fan of Tria but my delivery experience this past weekend was especially great. I&apos;ve had my eye on Tria&apos;s to-go menu for a while and we finally decided to try their &quot;Cheesy Package for 2&quot; which costs $50 before tax and tip. The package includes: a three cheese board (you select the cheeses from a list), burrata and tomato conserva toast, fennel-roasted almonds, marinated olives, two choices of salad or sandwich (there are six options to choose from), and a dessert to share (two options to choose from). 

We opted for cheddar, blue and goat cheeses for our board. They were packaged so nicely and labeled, along with the spreads or jams that accompanied each cheese. In fact, everything was packaged perfectly, arriving just like it would had it been served in the restaurant. I was extremely impressed. We chose the artichoke and asparagus salad and spanish white tuna sandwich for the mains, and the flourless chocolate cake for dessert (so rich and simply perfect!). 

The food was all fresh and delicious and I felt like this was one of our better delivery experiences since the pandemic shut down dining-in at restaurants. I have a feeling it won&apos;t be long before we order this package again. It would also be perfect for a picnic!"
5,"Took advantage of a beautiful fall day and a quiet work from home schedule to sneak downtown for a nice lunch with the family. Since no review in 2020 is complete without mentioning covid precautions- let me say that we dined outside and were able to order and pay fully online. Our cheeseboard, sandwiches and wine were all on point. An extra star for our server, who ran 1/2 a city block to bring me the leftovers I had forgotten."
5,"Tria is my favorite spot in Philadelphia and I make it a point to try and go at least once every single time I&apos;m in town. 

I found this gem a couple years ago while staying at the Sofitel hotel which is at the other end of the block from Tria. I must have gone three times the week I was there because me and my colleague couldn&apos;t get enough.

This last time I was visiting Philly with my husband and I took him on a date night to Tria. He was as impressed as I was of course.

There is a great selection of wines and the staff is always happy to help you choose one that suits your taste buds. The food is reasonably priced and the portions are generous for sharing. My absolute favorite thing on their menu was the white bean dip served with paprika toast. It is by far one of the best dishes and so incredibly flavorful. Their crostini&apos;s are also delicious. There is one with ricotta, lavender and honey that you cannot pass up. What I found interesting about Tria is that they are putting out these great dishes without a full kitchen. So there are many salads and sandwiches to choose from as well as their light bites for sharing.

There are two Tria locations although I have only been to the Tria Cafe Rittenhouse. I&apos;m sure the other is great as well. The Rittenhouse location is perfect if you work downtown and want a place to go for happy hour or if you are planning on seeing a show and want a nice spot to grab some wine and light bites beforehand. I highly recommend this place and can&apos;t wait to get back myself!"
2,"I am the biggest red wine lover of all time and was dying to visit Tria since I moved to Rittenhouse recently. 

My friend took me for my 24th birthday and although the wine was good, (I&apos;ve never met a Cab Sav I didn&apos;t like), the service had me wishing I would&apos;ve stayed back home! 

I love connecting with the wait staff especially to learn more about the wine I&apos;m drinking but our waiter and the food runners could not be bothered - even to take a picture for the occasion! 

I have seen the great reviews for this beautiful spot so I would like to hope it was just bad timing for my first go around at Tria and maybe it was an unusually stressful Thursday night. Want to go back and give them the benefit of the doubt because I have heard such fantastic things!!!!"
4,"If you are looking for light food options with great drinks, this is the spot. Absolutely obsessed with their Ricotta cheese honey toast and mozzarella sandwich. Great wine and cocktail options as well."
5,Me and one of my gf&apos;s consistently go here for our girl dates. I always start with a Prosecco then switch to wine. I&apos;m obsessed with your turkey paninoooo!
5,"I go crazy for their mushroom fontina bruschetta! If you like truffle mushrooms, this is an absolute must have. All their bruschetta are great (goat cheese with lavender honey and pistachio), but this one is my favorite. I live in UC now, but when I lived in downtown, I&apos;d frequent Tria just for the mushroom bruschetta."
4,"This would likely be my go to date night location if I lived in philly. Sadly I&apos;m here for work and came on the recommendation of a client. She was spot on!

It&apos;s a cosy, warm setting with a super interesting menu. I splurged a bit because I didn&apos;t have time for lunch.  I opted for the figs with Gorgonzola and prosciutto. I could have had more cheese but a good about of prosciutto was welcomed. I also got the cauliflower with cream and cheese and all the good stuff. Their wine list I included some I wasn&apos;t familiar with, which I appreciate.

Dessert was the pistachio-ricotta cheesecake with cherry compote.

I sat at the bar and the staff was mostly attentive, but maybe a bit too lax? I will definitely return next time I&apos;m in Philadelphia."
4,"Delicious wine selection and cheese board is on point!  Love their bruschettas.  Everything tastes fresh and simplistically flavorful!  Havent tried much else from their menu, but if you&apos;re looking for a nice bottle of wine with some perfect pairings, tria is my go to!"
4,"I like Tria. I&apos;ve been coming for a long time. Great wine list, really good boards and decent bites. Tonight I had the smoked salmon salad. It was delicious. This place is consistent. Beautiful wines and boards. If you want an elegant evening, good wine and a vibrant spot try Tria."
5,"Tria Cafe Rittenhouse you are really awesome, I had an incredible experience here today. The vibe is great. Every single thing here has amazing flavor and taste. The customer service is always wonderful. We will definitely be going back here."
4,"Out of towner whose been to Tria twice now and always a treat. A really cute spot to have a quick bite with a date or catch up with some friends. Service is always excellent and the food is always tasty. My only knock is that the food isn&apos;t very filling and the bill adds up quickly, which is to be expected of a place like this. Will always come back."
5,"This place is first come first serve, no reservations. I didn&apos;t have to wait at all when I went. Overall, I think this place is really good, and definitely worth your money!!

Warm poached black mission figs with Gorgonzola and prosciutto di Parma ($7) - was good, but not mind blowing. I love love love fresh figs, and don&apos;t care for any sort of change to the fresh version though, but regardless this was good!

Lump crab stuffed peppers ($8.50) - more of a solid dish and one that I would recommend more. 

Pistachio bruschetta ($6) - HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!! It&apos;s delicious. And it is sweet, so I recommend eating some of the more savory dishes before this one. But it was so good. 

Shrimp toast ($9.50) - also very good!!!! Had a very creamy delicious flavor to it, and the shrimp was cooked perfectly. Also I don&apos;t like radishes, but the radish on top was NOT overpowering at all! 

Truffled egg toast ($8) - also super super good. I highly recommend this too, particularly if you like truffles! 

Meyer lemon ricotta cheesecake ($7.50) - also amazing. Loved every aspect of it!! And you could taste every ingredient of this cheesecake!"
4,"Came here at the lead and recommendation of my local colleagues for a dinner after a long flight. The place is in a cool area and rather intimate which I liked and gave me a great local vibe as soon as I walked in. 

The menu had a great selection of wines and beers. I didn&apos;t look at any other drinks so I couldn&apos;t speak to those but their selection of beers was deep and tasteful, and the others commented on the great wine also. 

The food menu was a selection of smaller plates and bites with portions that were perfect. After the holidays, a nice refreshing light meal that still hits the spot is so welcome. The Mains are salads or sandwiches. My table all had salads so I couldn&apos;t speak to the sandwiches. But before that, the chicken liver mouse and the figs are an absolute must! The figs are stuffed and baked with cheese and are just delightful. The chicken liver mouse with the toasted bread was also just awesome. For the Main, I selected the duck salad, which had a great mix of fresh greens and nicely cooked duck. The slices were thin and delectable. 

Obviously this saved room for dessert, and we selected all 3! The flourless chocolate cake, pistachio cheesecake and the bread pudding. The favorite was surely the bread pudding but each one was amazing. I&apos;d definitely go back and likely will, hoping to try something else."
4,"Really love the ambiance and the food here, but get ready to drop some cash if you want to eat enough AND have a few glasses of wine...

My favorite dishes:

1. Truffled egg toast - SO satisfying and can taste the truffle throughout

2. Pistachio herbed ricotta bruchetta - the honey and ricotta combination is absolutely fantastic

3. Tuscan white bean spread - surprisingly very flavorful, though very small portion size 

4. Grilled asparagus salad - super refreshing with a variety of different vegetables and actually a very large portion size compared to other options

Definitely worth checking this place out for a date night or a girls night!"
5,"Came here for Sunday School  for the first time yesterday. There was tons of seating at 9 pm which was awesome because they don&apos;t take reservations - and walking in always makes me a tad bit nervous. 

LOVE the concept. As an aspiring wine and cheese connoisseur (far from it but girl can dream), I like being introduced to different wines and having a blurb to read about it too. Best part is that you can be classy in a budget! One wine, cheese and beer on the menu every Sunday from noon - closing at 2/3 Tria locations sold at a discounted price!!  We also ordered some apps from the regular menu - truffles eggs and truffle bruschetta. 

Add this to your philly bucket list if it isn&apos;t already on it!"
5,"I went to Tria for outdoor dining with a few friends this weekend. They had QR codes on the tables so that we could view the menus online instead of having physical copies. There was an option to order on our phones, but we placed our orders with the waiter. We ordered wines by the glass and a few small plates for the table to share.. Of what we tried, the ricotta bruschetta was my favorite. I thought the prices were reasonable as well. We enjoyed our wine, but we all agreed that it would be great if they offered a wine flight."
4,"We came here on a Saturday for a late lunch/mid afternoon snack. It was the first warm Saturday of the spring, so the place was hopping. We sat at a &quot;window seat&quot; which is a small bar that faces the side windows. It felt a bit cramped, but it was fine since we were just snacking. 

We each ordered a glass of red wine. They were good. We started with the marinated olives and the rosemary chips with truffle aioli. Both were tasty, but not outstanding. We also ordered a goat cheese and pesto bruschetta. It came with two, and it was easily the best thing we ate. We each savored our bruschetta throughout the meal because we didn&apos;t want it to be gone. I highly recommend ordering this. 

We also ordered 3 cheeses, which came nicely plated with sliced bread and accoutrements of cherry, pickled onions (maybe?), and fig jam. The cheeses were all good, but nothing outstanding. It&apos;s a fun meal though, mixing and matching the spreads and cheeses. Everything was a fairly small portion, so I felt a little hungry when we left. The sandwiches looked like they were a decent portion size though. The service was fine. Nothing to write home about. The place is pretty small and nondescript decor-wise. I would probably come back. Cheese is one of my favorite foods, so I&apos;d love to try some more of their varieties."
4,"Good service , wine is extremely overpriced... I would recommend this place only if you want to grab a few appetizers and not to have a full meal ( it was our mistake) . Food was simple but good, I enjoyed a salad with duck. it was delicious. 
At first we were seated at the table with umbrella but it was way to dark to sit under it so we asked to move to a high top table. 
I was debating whether to give this place 3 or 4 stars but overall impression was positive so 4 it is"
