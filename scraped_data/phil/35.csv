5,"This bar has ample outdoor seating, super friendly staff, outdoor heating, and amazing ingredients. 
Such a friendly staff that got the dog some water as well as helped with the menu item, was knowledgeable about the beer menu, and brought the food out timely. They checked up on us a lot, Found a great table that suited us and fed us nicely, and didn&apos;t rush us on the way out. Will definitely be coming here again, great experience"
5,"My boyfriend and I went to Bud &amp; Marilyn&apos;s last night for a date night. I live in Philadelphia but I had never been. We loved everything about our experience - the service, the food, the atmosphere. Our waitress was so kind and checked up on us frequently. Our food was quick to arrive and the food was delicious! We both ordered fried chicken dishes and shared a plate of crab fries. The restaurant is cozy and intimate but still COVID friendly at the same time. 

My only complaint (and I&apos;m being very picky!)- I wished they had more options on their cocktail menu. We always drink wine at home but when I go to restaurants I love a good handcrafted cocktail. Their drink pouches and cocktail menu were a little disappointing. 

Nevertheless, the restaurant is fantastic. We will be back!"
5,"I&apos;m very happy that we were able to get a table to get a table at Bud &amp; Marilyn&apos;s for brunch. We were celebrating for our friends bday during COVID without a reservation and they got us seated within 20 minutes. 

The sat out party of 4 at two tables of 4 close together which was nice. The waitress was very nice and the food was pretty good. Their warm apple cider is good and was nice while seating outdoors. The one thing that would have made this experience really nice would have been outdoor heating lamps. The sun went down and it was pretty cold."
5,"Gave Bud and Marilyns a 2nd chance last night but steered clear of the chicken. We ordered the pierogis and brussels sprout toast - my dining partner got there first and reviewed the menu so I just went with his choices. 

Both were fantastic! The pierogis came with a fantastic horseradish creme and grained mustard on top - what a combination! The toast was excellent (comes in three pieces so a little hard to share that 3rd piece) but the tart apples along with the balsamic and charred sprouts... *chefs kiss*.

Service was fantastic - they were attentive and friendly and they didn&apos;t rush us at all. We were seated far away from other diners which made me feel more comfortable dining in at this time. 

I&apos;ll definitely be back for that toast - wow."
4,"Wanted to check this place out because it has been looking extremely popular. My friend from out if state has come to town and I wanted something cool in center city for our brunch. I loved the service and ambiance but taking one star off for the menu. 
I just didn&apos;t think it was that great food-wise. It was alright in my personal opinion. 
I will say that this place has vegetarian items and that&apos;s great. I am a vegan and those vegetarian items could and were modified for me, however by doing that it took out the whole point of a dish. 
For example, a beyond burger comes on a bun that is not suitable for vegans, but the restaurant has no other bread option at all; or, I was offered an egg dish with an option of taking out egg and cheese, which would only leave vegetables. My personal wish and what would make sense, is that if you have vegetarian items, be ready for vegans to come to your place and order those with modifications. Your menu ultimately attracts this type if customers by having vegetarian options on the menu. Maybe have a second option for bread or at least tofu. 
The menu didn&apos;t do it for me personally. 
I appreciated moderate prices and great service, as well as the location. While it is not my favorite place I might come back with friends for all other positive qualities the place has, apart from the menu."
3,"Stopped by for a late lunch with a friend. We didn&apos;t have a reservation and they were able to seat us fairly quickly. We sat outside, the server was really nice and gave out solid recommendations on drinks. I got the real housewife pouch i.e. the adult Capri Sun. The drink is light but can be dangerous on an empty stomach. My friend got the mulled wine as they were out of cider. I was really craving a burger and they have the impossible on their menu. This was my first time trying one and we also got a plate of the cheese curds to share. I did a summer in Wisconsin so I&apos;ve had my share of curds , the batter was light but there was this missing spongy springy texture to the curd. The ranch and salsa were okay. The scallion was too light to taste in my opinion so i stuck to the salsa.  

Burger wise the plates had a fantastic presentation. The fries were lightly salted and the perfect thickness. I ate the burger but it felt like the meat substitute was just a transportation system for the lettuce, pickle and tomato. Like I know it was there because I can see it but its not there if that makes sense. My friend had the double patty and simply stated it was meaty so not a lot of context there. The drinks are awesome and I would be willing to try it again."
5,"Treated myself to a Sunday dinner from Bud &amp; Marilyn via DoorDash. I was pretty surprised by the deliciousness of the food. Not sure what I was expecting. This was my first time ordering and eating from this restaurant. 

For my appetizer, I tried their cheese curds that was really good! This is one of my favorite types of foods and glad I found another place I can get them from. The cheese curds was a bit oily but not too bad (I reheated them in my air fryer). I had the butternut squash lumache pasta. The pasta meal had chunks of squash and toasted hazelnuts (I requested no mushrooms). The taste of the pasta was different and tasty! Now to the dessert! I ordered their funfetti cake. Oh...em...gee! This HUGE slice of cake is literally fun in every bite! If you have a sweet tooth like me -- it&apos;s a must try!

There&apos;s some other items on their menu that I would like to try!"
5,"Amazing!! 5 stars off Rip! This was a place that I will come back too every time I&apos;m in town! There is a lot on the menu to eat! And DRINK!! 

The drinks were delightful and STRONG! Super cool pouches with cool names in them! Definitely a cool spot! Can&apos;t say enough about the quality of food! It was delicious and the cheese curds were the most popular item for my table! So I definitely recommend if it&apos;s more than 2 in your party get a second order (thank me later) 


Side note- the Nashville hot chicken is not boneless , confirm with your server but it&apos;s delicious  so order it lol"
5,"Did I just find one of the best spots for brunch in Philly? The answer to that question is a resounding yes! I visited Bud &amp; Marilyn two months ago now and I haven&apos;t stopped thinking about my visit since.  

We made a reservation via Open Table and arrived at 10am on a Saturday. This place definitely has an old school vibe - like if you were to visit your distant Aunt and Uncle&apos;s house from the 70s.

I couldn&apos;t let my Aunt Marilyn down so I ordered her Old Fashioned - brandy, Sprite, orange, and bitters. I am a big fan of the OF. I really enjoyed this one and highly recommend it. But the fun didn&apos;t stop there...

We ordered the warm pecan cinnamon roll as an appetizer and split bites of the shrimp po boy benedict and chicken n waffles. All of the food was hot, fresh, and flavorful. Although I enjoyed everything, the star of the show was the cinnamon roll. It was piping hot, not too dry or doughy and got more delicious with each bite. 

Come hungry, leave happy with breakfast the next day. Looking forward to seeing Aunt Marilyn and Uncle Bud again real soon."
4,"I was super full from a pretty non stop foodie tour of the city, that it was almost tough to order come dinner. I wasn&apos;t sure what to order and asked the server who mentioned the staple being the fried chicken. I took her advice and ordered it on the spot zero hesitation although I&apos;d just told her I didn&apos;t want any more meat. 

It came out super quick and was really yummy. Presentation was great, skin was so tasty. The biscuit was also yummy and a side of pickles is just the right touch. I drenched my chicken in the accompanied hot sauce. 

Now... onto the funfetti cake 

Who hyped this cake up? Seriously?!?! It&apos;s actively, not good. It&apos;s something a diabetic senior would turn down. I took a few bites hoping to find a good part but it&apos;s all no bueno. It&apos;s beyond bland, I told myself I could probably find more flavor in the cloth napkin on my lap (that&apos;s prob at least washed with detergent). 

Skip the funfetti, there&apos;s absolutely nothing fun about it. Trust me. It&apos;s tall, yes but it&apos;s not good. It&apos;s like the girls going for guys that are over 6ft with zero personality. Just don&apos;t do it, I mean unless you&apos;re stuck at home with the rona and your taste buds have gone and you&apos;re looking for a big hunk of filler that looks celebratory, which it barely even checks that box. It&apos;s dry, it&apos;s really just downright b a d.  I tried sampling at least 3-4 bites from different areas hoping to find a silver lining. None. 

With most places during an outdoor only seating situation, they aren&apos;t riding on aesthetics and the food has to be good because really you&apos;re outside with tiny mice running around at your feet in the dark, searching for a crumb. 

I&apos;d say order dinner, but def skip the cake. The warm cider was really satisfying but pretty sweet so only had a few sips.

Service was very prompt at first, then totally fell off. 

I&apos;m sure a lot of these best places to dine at are really a combo of inside combined with food and service which is tough to experience from a seat in the street."
5,Bud and marilyns is so good. I love the fried chicken. I am a fried chicken phanatic. I go for the little slider buns and eat with the crab fries. They&apos;re my favorite. Such good cheese sauce. Today I tried the funfetti birthday cake and it was also very good. HUGE piece. Like 3 real pieces. For $10 - not too bad. Everything here always tastes really good and is relaxed. But the POUCHES are the best part of this place. I love the fun bags of alcoholic drinks. I&apos;ve gotten them with fun stickers on them too. The service here is always good and I love the vibe of the interior. All round perfect place for a fun time.
3,"We ordered brunch from here and honestly, I was not impressed. I got the brisket hash and it was basically beef stew with an egg on top. Not exactly  brunch food. We also got the shrimp po boy Benedict which was just okay. Maybe take out is not the way to go here, as I&apos;ve had a better experience dining in for dinner. Not sure I would recommend brunch though."
5,"Bud &amp; Marylin&apos;s was FIRE. We went without even knowing that there were happy hour deals and the shrimp po boy hot bun and tofu hot buns were on the happy hour menu! Both were delicious and perfectly small portions.

The falafel crusted cauliflower was great to share and the cauliflower was well prepared. For the main course, I thoroughly enjoyed the salmon. The skin was crippled to perfection and it was some of the best salmon I have had in Philly.

The squash pasta was all great, but I would order the salmon over the pasta if you are deciding on what to order.

Our waiter was absolutely lovely and checked in/was so on top of it. (I am forgetting your name, but you were a true gem!!!) The outdoor dining also has separation throughout the vicinity so they are taking the right precautions as well."
4,"This place was really fun! I came here with a few friends. The four of us sat in a cute little warm and cozy personal tent. The apps? So good. We got the cheese curds which were basically mini mozzarella sticks and the crab fries. I got the shortrib stroganoff for dinner. It was good and super filling, I just wish it came with a little more sauce so that the noodles on top weren&apos;t dry. Got the confetti cake for dessert and it was spectacular! The slice is so big and the icing tasted divine! We also got the cheesecake and it was just not for me. It was sour and so were the cherries that came with it. If you like sweet dessert, definitely steer clear of the cheesecake. Overall, everything was pretty good!"
4,Very nice set up outside with heaters being shared between two tables.  For a very cold night I&apos;d want a heater to each table but for last night&apos;s weather it did the job.  The Carol Baskins sweet tea adult juice box sounds scary but actually tasted amazing and had a sour apple taste.  The waitress said that it was the equivalent of a long island iced tea.  The shrimp po boys were delicious but very tiny where we had to order more food.  They are not a dinner portion.  The fried chicken sandwich was very good.   The slaw was more vinegar based vs mayo.  My fries were seasoned okay they just were a little undercooked.  The mac &amp; cheese was amazing.  We both finished our meals and thought something was missing but we just couldn&apos;t figure out what.  Overall good &amp; lively spot!
5,"Great service, delicious food &amp; fun drinks! I will definitely be returning!

Parking was easy and the wait was not long at all. Our food came out hot and fresh each time. 

I love that they&apos;ve added the heaters so you don&apos;t feel cold eating outside!"
4,"Came here and ordered the Pinot Noir, the cheese curds, Mac &amp; cheese, and split the beef and broccoli with a friend. The wine was tasty and the cheese curds were delicious, a total highlight of the meal. The Mac and cheese was not up to our standards and we would not recommend it. It really lacked flavor. The beef and broccoli was okay, but unexpectedly quite spicy! Overall a solid spot, but we would probably try a few different menu items the next time."
5,"I liked the way that they enforce social distancing if you&apos;re dining inside. There are about two to three empty tables to ensure that there&apos;s enough space between you and the next person eating. 

The ambiance was really nice, the inside gave me modern diner vibes. To start I got the cheese curds bc I seen other ppl rave about them - however they were really just mini mozzarella sticks lol with a lighter batter. (They were ok) moving onto the entrees I got the brunch fried chicken sandwich and my fried ordered the chicken and waffles. The chicken sandwich was great. The chicken breast was super moist and fried perfectly. I thought all the flavors complimented each other really nice especially the slaw they used on the sand which. My friend raved about their chicken and waffles so maybe I&apos;ll try that on my next visit to philly."
5,"I only ordered a drink pouch to go so that&apos;s what I&apos;m basing my five stars on! 
We stopped in bud &amp; marilyn&apos;s on a lively Friday evening in the city hoping to turn the fun up a notch! We saw many other people carrying these fun pouches so we had to track the distributor down! There wasn&apos;t much going on in there and I don&apos;t believe they have an outdoor seating option. Alas, they were eager to take our order and our adult juice boxes were ready in no time. We all got the gritty margarita! It was excellent! They&apos;re refreshing and it&apos;s a nostalgic/ fun experience to sip them! They were $13 which isn&apos;t too terrible, especially considering there&apos;s a hefty amount of liquid in there! 
I&apos;m looking forward to trying BOTH their food and drinks next time!"
3,"Was hoping for a few more gluten-free, dairy-free brunch options but hey, beggars can&apos;t be choosers. 

If this was solely based on ambiance and vibe - there wouldn&apos;t be enough stars to rate this as high as it deserves! 

Super cute place with an amazing variety of seating!!! 

As for the drinks and food - it was just &quot;meh&quot; to my friend and I. 

Service was good, nothing super memorable which is perfectly fine. Any drinks were way too sugary sweet and my friend agreed but her bloody mary was too strong she couldn&apos;t even drink it!! I had a difficult time ordering a filling brunch with my food allergies but my friend did like her food!

Will have to give this place another try. Beautiful nonetheless and seems like a fun place to get drinks as long as you enjoy southern food and sweet cocktails!!"
