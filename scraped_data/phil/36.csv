5,"All the waiters were amazing and extremely friendly. They all have the masks and face shields on, really take the precautions.
All the dishes tasted amazing and second floor was very spacious with great ambiance.

I would love to come back!"
5,"Okay- first of all, the man serving the gelato was so sweet!! I&apos;ve never been here before so I asked him what he recommended and he was super helpful! Always nice to go somewhere with pleasant service. With his help I selected a medium size pistachio and some sort of hazelnut flavor. This place is set up really cute with outdoor seating and Covid precautions in place as well."
5,"I&apos;ve been here a couple times pre-COVID and was craving the gnocchi and their mixed berry tiramisu, so I placed an order on GrubHub. They were unfortunately out of the mixed berry tiramisu. GrubHub is not the most back-end friendly apparently because all it could do was cancel the dessert without offering any sort of alternative. I called the restaurant directly and spoke to a gentleman named Tyler who was able to help rectify the matter and arranged to put a different dessert in altogether to accommodate for the inconvenience. It&apos;s been hard to have good customer service experiences at a distance during this pandemic, but Tyler was awesome and deserves a raise and full health benefits and a ton of hazard pay."
5,"Good food. (Got a pasta dish, bruschetta, and salad) 
Great service. 
Wonderful espresso. (Got a cappuccino)
Absolutely amazing gelato. (Got pistachio, Nutella, and tiramisu) 

Def coming again."
5,"I came by here because I wanted some dessert. I heard there was really good gelato here so I had to try it out. I definitely recommend!! They have all sorts of flavors they can cater to anyone&apos;s taste buds. I like the bacio, which has a creamy chocolate base with hazelnuts, and the pescamango, a sorbet of peach and mango. 1 pint is only $12, which is a great deal. They also have three sizes of scoops, with the small one being five dollars and the large one being almost nine dollars. I definitely want to come here to try the actual food, like their pastas. 

They also have different Italian cookies and other items in their Italian market. There&apos;s so much stuff to look at! I&apos;ve never seen that many pastas in my life. They have tiramisu, cannolis, and other desserts if you&apos;re not feeling gelato. The staff is super sweet and will accommodate you!"
3,Not much better then last time. Frito Misto not hot or crispy. The bruschetta was good. We also shared a panini with spec. It was the best item. Service was very good. Real Italian. Soccer on TV and excellent coffee.
4,"This restaurant did a great job adhering to COVID restrictions.  It actually seemed like they removed tables to adhere to the 6ft distance rule with all employees wearing masks and face masks.  The restaurant is very Italian authentic.  To start we got bruschette and arancini and loved both.  The bruschette was very fresh with lots of tomatoes.  The chitarra pasta dish as an entree was very flavorful and had a good bite to it.  The pappardelle meat was very tender, fall of the bone, and the homemade noodles were perfectly cooked but there wasn&apos;t much flavor to the dish.  Portions are on the smaller side so if you are starving would recommend some appetizers.  You can&apos;t come here without getting gelato so of course we got some for dessert!! The gelato is to die for &amp; is a must have."
5,"Just picked up deliver for lunch and was extremely happy with my order (rigatoni). The flavor of the sauce was incredible and the homemade rigatoni was absolutely delicious. I am still thinking about my order and looking forward to trying more pasta dishes from here. I highly suggest trying this restaurant, the food is worth it."
4,Ordered takeout from here while in town for work. Ordered the Paccheri pasta and it was really solid. Would definitely return here again.
5,"I recently moved to Philadelphia but am already in love with Gran Caffe L&apos;Aquila! I&apos;ve been struggling to find a good dessert place until I came here! The tiramisu is one of the best I&apos;ve ever had, and the gelatos were so creamy, smooth, and tasty! I didn&apos;t know which flavors to get, so I asked the staff, who were all so incredibly friendly and kind. My favorite flavors were the Desire, Bacio di Noce, and Pistacchio, which all happen to be the most popular flavors at the store. The ricotta cheesecake didn&apos;t quite fit my taste, but maybe it&apos;s because I&apos;m not as familiar with ricotta-based cheesecakes. 

I had a pretty decent meal here during restaurant week, but I&apos;m looking forward to trying out the regular menu. I love Italian food in general, so I&apos;ll definitely check out the rest of the market as well the next time I visit!"
3,"For all of the reviews and high remarks, I was rather disappointed. The inside was beautifully filled with wines, gelato, pastas, etc. and the service was friendly and prompt. 

I decided to go with their restaurant week special - $35/person, 4 course. 
The burrata was my favorite course. Creamy and soft, topped with a drizzle of olive oil and fresh basil. 
The octopus was slightly over cooked and needed a pinch of salt. 
The pasta didn&apos;t taste house made/homemade. Overall, the dish fell flat for me."
5,"Gran Caffe L&apos;Aquila is an all time favorite of mine. From the ambiance, the decadent dishes, and the Italian accents the serves have makes you feel like you are in Italy. My typical go to pasta dish is the Tagliatelle Alla Panna - a simple creamy pasta with excellent flavors that is light and rich. Zuppa de Pesce, another favorite, comes in a tomato red sauce and is loaded with seafood - very rich in flavor as well. The Gnocci is also delicious, however, I thought that this a was little heavy. The spaghetti alla vongole was another great dish, just needed a little bit more seasoning, as it tasted a little bit bland, but nothing that a little salt couldn&apos;t do. The grilled octopus is also delicious - both soft and bold in flavors in every bite. Don&apos;t forget to get their gelato! My go to is the baccio and the Stracciatella. The Kinderino is also another favorite .

Will be back for more!"
3,"Tonight I ordered delivery from Gran Caffe L&apos; Aquila and got the Tagliatelle Alla Panna, Burrata Roast Pepper Camponata, and Ricotta Cheesecake. The Burrata Roast Pepper was refreshing and paired well with the fresh mozzarella and pesto sauce. The Ricotta Cheesecake had fresh vanilla beans in it, a unique chocolate crust, and was not overly sweet. Unfortunately, the Tagliatelle Alla Panna was too heavy and I was not able to eat it. The pasta sauce was composed of a cream base, but the sauce was very oily/greasy."
4,Still dreaming about their melt-in-your-mouth croissant sandwich. The waiters are super laid back and friendly too. Great place for a Saturday brunch.
5,Beautiful Italian restaurant/coffee shop in the heart of downtown Philadelphia. They made one of the best latte I&apos;ve ever tasted! I&apos;ll definitely come back to try their food soon
4,"Gran Caffe L&apos;Aquila is a gorgeous place to come and have dinner or celebrate a special occasion. The interior is beautifully decorated and the restaurant is quiet enough that you can have a conversation with those around you but not stuffy where you feel like you need to be whispering all the time. However, this place is really pricy. Dinner for four cost us well over $200 total (before tip). And as gorgeous as it was and as delicious as the food it, I do thin a lot of people will have trouble justifying the cost of a dinner here when there are now so many other amazing restaurants with just as nice an atmosphere and food just as delicious (and let&apos;s be honest, sometimes better food) as this one but for a much lower price range popping up, though those do tend to be harder to get into and we had no trouble getting a last-minute table at Gran Caffe L&apos;Aquila.

Overall it&apos;s a very nice place. I don&apos;t think I need to make any specific menu recommendations or reviews because all the food and drinks we ordered were delicious so you can&apos;t go wrong there. I just do not think I&apos;ll make a habit of coming here, even on special occasions, when Philly has so many other hidden (and not so hidden) gems."
4,"5/5 stars if staff hadn&apos;t been so stuck up. We had no idea what the seating policy was like. They acted like we were stupid for not knowing where to go. Gelato was incredible!!! Tiramisu was rich, but delicious. Medium gelato was 2 scoops. We had two orders of gelato, and a piece of tiramisu and it was around $23. I would 599% comeback to try all their gelato."
5,"Exceptional food and service from this delicious, authentic Italian restaurant. All of the kitchen and wait staff are Italian. 
I cannot say enough good things about our dinner experience at Gran Caffe L&apos;Aquila. We tried so many appetizers and pastas and EVERYTHING WAS PERFECT. 
Do yourself a favor when you want a European style culinary experience with cozy insanely delicious food, and eat here when in Philly."
5,"I had to look at my last review and wonder why it was not a 5-star experience. Many meals and my own maturity later, I&apos;m giving Gran Caffe L&apos;Aquila the rightful ratings boost it deserves.

I love sitting upstairs. It&apos;s a pleasant, cozy place to dine with plenty of natural light. 

They have plenty of fantastic Italian dishes but my favorites are the savory gelato and pasta combos. I love the Carbonara and the agnolotti al tartufo. Truly unique and equally delicious.

Service is always charming and professional. I love ordering Italian wines I don&apos;t know much about and relying on their accurate descriptions.

Their gelato brings out the closeted dessert appreciate in me. Today&apos;s pick was tiramisu and caffe. They hit the spot without being overly filling.

Gran Caffe has become one of my Philly favorites and a place I&apos;d proudly recommend for anyone in Philly looking for a great Italian meal."
5,"Food: Pollo Al Pattone (chicken), salmone, broccoli rabe and fries!
The potatoes that came with the chicken were over cooked/hard and pretty salty. The chicken itself was tender and juicy.
The salmone is surprisingly very refreshing. I can&apos;t imagine just eating that as an entree so it complimented the chicken entree very well. FYI, the avocado is spread on top of the salmone, not on the side.
The fries were basic skinny fries, but the sauce that came with it was worth it.

Service: Hostess waited until I took my jacket off before handing us the menus. Maybe this is normal, but to me, this was some exceptional service that I have ever experienced at a restaurant. The entire staff is very polite and attentive as well!

Interior: The artwork, design and furniture is all very adorable and gorgeous!"
