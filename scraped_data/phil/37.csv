5,"I was craving breakfast for dinner and my friend and I drove to Honey&apos;s Sit-N-Eat (where breakfast and dinner options are served all day!). Honey&apos;s is on the corner of North 4th and Brown Street. There&apos;s limited street parking available. You can&apos;t enter the store but you can place an order for takeout at the pickup window or order for delivery. If you want to dine-in, seating is really limited; there&apos;s three tables of four there with heaters and curtains separating them. 

Our server was very friendly and made sure our table was all warmed up before we sat down. He came to check on our table multiple times too. In terms of food, Honey&apos;s Sit-N-Eat specializes in &quot;Southern Jewish&quot; food and offers a unique twist on brunch. The prices, in my opinion, are pretty standard for brunch. I got Jeb&apos;s Biscuit Sandwich ($12) and I loved the texture of the biscuit and how the gravy ties everything together. I&apos;d recommend choosing the latke for a side! 

TLDR: Honey&apos;s Sit-N-Eat offers a unique &quot;Southern Jewish&quot; take on brunch, and it offers breakfast all day!"
5,"Corner cafe with that is currently offering take out, delivery and outdoor seating -if you can score a table. On a Sunday afternoon Honey&apos;s is swarmed with buzzing customers looking to grab biscuits, brisket &amp; bacon. They also make a mean chicken and waffle. Best part about it,  aside from the affordable prices, is the BYOB policy. If you do happen to snag 1 of 3 tables, you are welcome to bring your beverage of choice if your over 21 of course. Food was so good I didn&apos;t get a chance to take a picture. If you get there earlier in the morning some combos come with coffee. Do get coffee even if it doesn&apos;t."
5,"Grabbed breakfast here on the way to IKEA. Breakfast burrito was huge and delicious. Juevos rancheros were filling, fresh, and yummy. Ordered at the pickup window- fast, friendly service."
4,"We waited around 10 mins for outdoor seating. It was not a bad wait. We were seated and served promptly. We got biscuits and gravy and eggs Benedict. The food was very good, and it came out very quickly. A nice corner spot for Sunday brunch"
5,"One of the most iconic brunch places in Philadelphia. We opted for the honey Christo with the two sunny side eggs on top of the challah French bread. We were able to substitute the meat with veggie sausage as recommended by the server and it was still amazing. We also opted for Philly&apos;s pride - bottomless La Colombe of course!

They also serve the local Lancaster bassets ice cream. I added a side of green avocado salad for something nutritious however the entire meal was pretty guilt free despite the portions being so large. The prices are reasonable as always but the service blew everything out of the water! Our second dish was the famous hueveos rancheros- with tofu. Like I mentioned above a Philly classic, can&apos;t go wrong with it."
4,"Well, I&apos;ve been to this restaurant plenty of times over the last 3 years.  Usually on a weekend and maybe one time during the week for a brunch.  I would suggest going before you get hungry because the wait during brunch hours are significant.  Don&apos;t be surprised if you told between a 1-2 hour wait.

The food: I&apos;ve always appreciated how creative they have been with the brunch meals.  From the flavorful sweet dessert like pancakes and French toast.  And the savory dishes that leave your taste buds smiling.  I&apos;ve always had way more food left than I can actually eat.  More recently I&apos;ve noticed the dishes have become more routine and less creative.  The good part about that is that you can always rely on having a good meal but this made honey sit and eat stand out from other brunch spots.  I really hope they go back to their old creative menu ways.

The prices are decent but be prepared to pay in cash since they are cash only.  They are also a BYOB."
5,"In the four years I lived in Philly, I never managed to make it to Honey&apos;s for brunch. Such a mistake! I was visiting the city for a weekend, staying in the area, so I ordered some take out brunch. I got an open faced biscuit sandwich with tofu scramble and gravy. There was vegan sausage on it as well so it was very substantial. Overall, the flavor was delicious and the price was very affordable for the amount of food you get. And it was ready really quickly so I didn&apos;t have to wait long. When I went to pick it up, there weren&apos;t any long lines or anything, so it&apos;s good to know even during peak brunch hours you could still get a table or takeout in a reasonable amount of time."
4,"Honey&apos;s Sit n Eat is a quaint brunch spot with a very cozy atmosphere. There is limited seating and it is a bit small inside but you can still go with a group of people and be fine. I got an item from their special menu which was the pumpkin pancakes. The pancakes were a good size and were very filling. I really enjoyed the food and the service was great. Our server was very friendly and welcoming. 

If you&apos;re looking for a new brunch spot in Philly I think this place is definitely worth checking out. Just an FYI, it is cash only!"
5,"Oh my goodness. People weren&apos;t kidding when they said this was such an incredible brunch place. I was so so impressed by the food here. Move over Green Eggs, this place definitely deserves the brunch award of Philly! We got here on a Sunday morning and the wait was about an hour...luckily one of us had gotten there at that time and let us know so we went somewhere else and came back. We actually got seated around the half hour mark. 

Everything here is delicious and unique. My husband got the Country Fried Steak and Gravy with Two Eggs and I got the Breakfast Bomb. His was AMAZINGGGGG -- thank goodness we have husbands and can steal some (all) of their food if they make the better choice. The steak was really fried super flavorfully and well (just got too excited that pretty sure what I just wrote was not English). The gravy was amazing. You could pick the potatoes that came with it -- we picked the latke. SO SO good. The Breakfast Bomb was pretty yummy as well -- jam packed with meats and eggs and lots of flavor. A little too much pancake, but we took it home and finished it later on. 

The atmosphere was cute -- not too packed, cozy and warm. If only they had multiple locations...:) Overall, I was really satisfied with Honey&apos;s and am super excited to come back and try some of their other things!"
5,"Rating 5 stars mainly because I love Honey&apos;s on 4th street. In the past I&apos;ve always enjoyed starting my weekends here, and even stopping in for a bite before work. Now, we are limited to takeout so I understand the issues with pick-up etc. It would be nice to be able to choose the time of pickup to prevent food from being cold (cold eggs = no fun) but again, I understand we are all trying the best we can! I will say this was the only place around serving up creamy grits with your choice of cheese, and that really satisfied my craving. Also, even though they were cold-on-arrival, the latkes never dissapoint!"
5,"My favorite brunch spot in Philly!! I love this place!!!

Okay, where to begin? I&apos;ve waited close to an hour for not the best table in the medium sized restaurant and still left with a smile on my face! Haha! Its not that bright in there and more than likely you will sit super close to strangers but it doesn&apos;t matter because the food is great! It seems that the staff at Honey&apos;s Sit-N-Eat love their job because they&apos;re super nice and I see most of the same faces when I dine here.

Now to the fun part. It&apos;s a BYOB!!!!! Last time we ordered a small cup of orange juice and splashed it into our Prosecco. Super delish! I get the same breakfast all the time! Mac &amp; cheese pancakes!!! OH-MY-GOSH! If you love Mac &amp; cheese and pancakes like me...you&apos;ll love this special creation! Also, I ordered scrambled eggs with caramelized onions, homemade fries w/ peppers and onions, and cannot forget the Lancaster county BACON -- sooo tasty!   

Typing this makes me want to go again next weekend!"
5,I&apos;ve been going to restaurants all my life. I expect the food to be good. I am not surprised when it is. But Honeys is sooo delicious. It is worth waiting in line. I wish I was there right now.
4,"Went here for a brunch date on a Sunday. Was able to get  a table in almost no time!  We were greeted and attended to by several people- all cool vibes. Brunch menu is pretty vast and the food is so reasonably priced! I ordered simple eggs, fries, and toast. My date got an omelette. As you can expect, nothing over the top but still good! I was disappointed that they didn&apos;t bring me jam and butter, but brought it out as soon as I asked. Loved the homemade mixed berry jam, going to try the peach next time! 

Cash only! Or bring a debit card to withdraw money (they have an atm inside)."
5,"Love this place! It&apos;s very casual for brunch and there is a decent amount of space for larger groups. It was Pretty packed for 9am on a Saturday

I&apos;ve tried the Jeb&apos;s open face biscuit sandwich which is my favorite (warm, buttery, and savory). Their morning Breakfast egg special is okay but the other menu items are well worth the few extra dollars.

They have large portions of comfort food and is great for the value. Fast service gets customers in and out, but just remember that it is cash only!"
4,"5 words or less: comfort food, gravy, cash only

Went in on a Saturday morning around 9:30am, and luckily got a table for two before the brunch rush.
The servers were extremely kind and didn&apos;t rush us to order / pay the bill. 
I went with the country fried steak w/ 2 eggs; sides were a choice of bread (went with a flaky, buttery biscuit) and home fries, latkes, or grits. 
My friend had Jeb&apos;s open faced biscuit sandwich (biscuits, fried eggs, choice of vegetarian or regular sausage, gravy, and potatoes), and said it was &quot;bangin&apos;&quot;.

Overall great experience; we were able to get seated within 30 seconds of walking in the door, have ample time to browse the menu, and enjoy a great meal!"
4,"I&apos;ve been going here infrequently for a few years. 

The food is awesome and this spot would be permanently in my top choices every weekend if it weren&apos;t for....

The wait. It&apos;s impossible to get in here on the weekend. Even when you do get in its so packed other people&apos;s elbows are on your table. 

If you haven&apos;t been you need to be at least once. The food is so goddamn good it&apos;ll knock your socks off. 
Next super slow weekend I have where brunch is literally all that is on my agenda I&apos;ll be back. Probably will go to the South Street location."
3,"If you&apos;re able to tell what I ordered without the description then lunch is on me...but not here.

The vegan cheesesteak looked gross and it tasted gross.

Now I&apos;m fully aware I went to a southern comfort restaurant and got a vegan dish so maybe this is on me but at the same time, I&apos;d rather they remove this from the menu then have it as a choice.

I&apos;ve heard really good things about this place from friends so I wanted to try it but the execution of it was very poorly done."
5,"We were greeted and sat right away. The door was opened to let in some air, but as soon as our waitress saw that I was cold, she closed it. She was attentive and patient (I just flew in from the west coast and was exhausted so had some trouble making a decision). 

I had grits with fried chicken put in, with an extra side of the veggies that already came with my meal too (I always crave veggies after a long flight). I was super excited that the mix of veggies included fiddlehead ferns (I haven&apos;t been able to find any for almost 20 years, and we used to pick and eat them all the time in Russia). My veggies lacked a little flavor, and I ended up putting salt and melted butter on them.

My boyfriend had the chicken-fried steak with hash browns and cornbread. The steak was good (I tried it too), and the hash browns were more like spiced wedges with onion and pepper strips, and he loved them because he said it&apos;s more of a balanced meal as it not only has a bunch of potatoes but some veggies in there too. He also said the corn bread got even better since he last visited years ago (he grew up in the area), but missed the blueberry jam that used to be on each table before. 

We would come back again."
5,"I can&apos;t say enough good things about this restaurant and seriously cannot wait to go again!  I have been to the South St location before but never to the Northern Liberties location.  My friend and I came in yesterday around 1 pm and the wait wasn&apos;t that long, which was great as we were both starving.  I can definitely see the wait being a little longer if you come at a busy time as it&apos;s a small location. 

I ordered my go to dish, the biscuits and gravy with two scrambled eggs and added on a potato latke.  YUM.  The biscuit is so sweet and goes well with the gravy, like a sweet and savory dish.  The potato latke is amazing and I have to make sure I have one every time I come.  I tried the mocha coffee and it was just ok.  My friend tried the cappuccino which she said was really good.  The restaurant is a little dim and I wish they had more lighting, but it is what it is and won&apos;t stop me from coming back!  It is cash only, so be sure to bring cash or use the ATM onsite."
5,"Definitely one of the best breakfasts I&apos;ve had in a long time!! We came here on a Saturday morning and somehow lucked out with no wait at all for the group of 5 of us. We were greeted immediately by our server and served fresh coffee right away. All of the staff seemed to be helping each other out and were working together by topping off coffees, checking in on each other&apos;s tables, etc., so the service was excellent. 

There were so many delicious options on the menu, it was a tough call on what to order. We decided to order the orange ricotta pancakes (one of the specials) for the table to share as an appetizer. These were so tasty and enjoyed by everyone. For my main dish, I went with Jeb&apos;s open faced biscuit sandwich. It absolutely hit the spot! Two fried eggs &amp; veggie sausage on fluffy, buttery biscuits topped with gravy. Savory, filling, home cooked goodness!! I can&apos;t tell you how nice it was to be able to order something like this as a vegetarian. I had the latke as my potato side, and that did not disappoint either. My 5 year old ordered a chocolate chip pancake and a side of bacon, both of which he devoured and thoroughly enjoyed. 

Hands down... the best meal I had while visiting Philly! Can&apos;t wait to come back!"
