5,"Another great take out spot by the Zahav Team. This place only serves hummus bowls so you know they have to be done right.  They usually have three different types of hummus, and they always provide at least one meat and one vegetarian option. The hummus itself is super flavorful but they add great flavor combinations to go with it. The toppings are just as thoughtful and inventive as the Zahav menu. I recommend adding extra pita to your order. Definitely try if you are in the center city area looking for a quick Mediterranean meal."
5,"While I await getting a coveted Zahav reservation, Dizengoff will definitely fulfill my hummus craving. 

We got the eggplant walnut hummus and another hummus with chicken.  It comes with small but SUPER thick and fluffy pita (pro tip, get an extra on the side) and pickled cabbage/slaw. Would also recommend asking for the harissa on the side. Overall, it makes for a fantastic meal. The hummus is creamy and the toppings are flavorful and pack a punch. The pita is the best and fluffiest I&apos;ve ever had. One hummus bowl could probably feed two people, especially if you get extra pita - which means that the price is unbeatable. My only complaint it their tables outside are often used by the neighboring restaurant so you have to take out. 

Stop reading this and go now!"
5,can&apos;t get any better hummus in the US than this one. A modern twist on classical Israeli hummus that only chef Solomonov can do. and very affordable prices! great to take out and eat at nearby Rittenhouse park
5,"We decided to give Dizengoff a try after a 2nd failed attempt to try the Octopus Falafel truck for lunch (if anyone knows of his current whereabouts - hmu!) and my expectations were completely exceeded.

Ordering was easy and the simplicity of the menu was nice given that it was our first time here. I asked the guy taking our order his thoughts on the chicken skin vs eggplant and almond hummus and he immediately recommended the eggplant - love the confidence!!

We ordered the eggplant and almond with an egg and extra pita. Sooo delicious. I don&apos;t even like hummus, but I could not get enough of this creamy goodness. One order was plenty for two hungry people. Definitely needed the 2nd pita, but the egg while delicious, I could do without next time."
4,"I came to this place off a recommendation from my boyfriend. He suggested the hummus that comes with chicken. I didn&apos;t expect to see the chicken as big pieces within the hummus! It also came with a side of warm pita and a small thing of beets. 

I was skeptical that this would fill me, im so used to having hummus as just a side to supplement a dish. But boy, I was wrong. The hummus was so rich and heavy (in a good way) that I didn&apos;t find myself needing more. It was a nice quick, healthy lunch!"
5,"Absolutely love the hummus at Dizengoff. I&apos;ve never had hummus that is as creamy and satisfying. I thought I&apos;d had good hummus but I was wrong. 

Their hummus toppings change so what you tried once doesn&apos;t mean that they&apos;ll have it the next time you go. On the flip side, it means that you&apos;ll get to try even more of their amazing flavor combinations. 

I just had the potato platter. Absolutely delicious. Potatoes with crispy bits and there is a subtle kick of spice. It was the best flavor I&apos;ve had so far."
4,"The hummus with egg and two extra pitas. Super simple but very delicious. The hummus is so creamy and thick. Super smooth. Lots of great flavors going on. Paired with the pita and the beets, perfect combo. To be honest, I didn&apos;t really care for the egg much. I also wish the pita was warm."
4,"Have been hearing about this place for years and finally found my way there and it definitely lived up to the name! So yummy!! My only complaint is that there wasn&apos;t that much chicken. That said, there was SO much hummus that I would definitely recommend paying the $1 to add an extra piece of pita. The flavors were fabulous, service was quick and portion (besides chicken) was great! Would definitely go back"
5,"EXCELLENT. HUMMUS. 

If there was ever a fast casual/bowls place that blows me away, it is Dizengoff. I am a hummus lover and there are few places (if any) that I have had better hummus. 

This is an awesome lunch or lighter meal option (okay..not that light)! The flavors of the hummus are outstanding as are the breads and other additions. It&apos;s a lot of food so bring a friend or two or three and get some damn good hummus. 

Do not miss this if you&apos;re in Philly!."
5,"What isn&apos;t there to love about this place. 
I ordered the radicchio pine nut hummus. Absolutely incredible. The hummus is velvety smooth and not acidic. The staff is great. The space is cozy and chic. Thoroughly enjoyed my time spent at Dizengoff."
5,"The menu here is pretty simple, but the hummus is the incredible! Dizengoff is part of the CookNSolo restaurant group that also runs Zahav, which serves the best hummus, among other creations. Dizengoff hummus is basically almost just as good as Zahav&apos;s hummus, and The hummus platters are always spot-on. The hummus is incredibly smooth and creamy and flavorful, and the platters vary from a Classic Hummus Tehina Platter to vegetarian (ex: Eggplant &amp; Almond) to meat (ex: Chicken &amp; Kale). The menu actually changes constantly based on whatever fresh ingredients they have available, so I&apos;d recommend following their Instagram page for the latest updates. The platters all come with a nice, warm, toasted pita bread to complete a hearty meal. Their drinks also sound delicious, but I haven&apos;t tried those yet. Next time!"
5,Unbelievable hummus and pita. Friendly staff too. Best hummus/pita in the City. Cannot recommend this place enough!
5,"Came here around 12PM on a Thursday afternoon with my two coworker friends - surprisingly when we arrived, we dodged the lunch wave and there were actually seats to sit down! The crowd slowly amped up as we started eating later on.

I got the eggplant walnut hummus with an egg. My friends ordered the fried chickpea hummus and the sweet potato pinenut hummus. Our orders came out very quickly with the pita bread warm and a dish of beets and a pickle as a side. We sat down and they served us. 

The hummus is so so creamy - I was super impressed and everything paired so nicely. My egg was poached to perfection with just the right amount of ooze. I&apos;m an eggplant lover so the eggplant walnut and cilantro was delectable! I&apos;m also a big fan of beets so the tartness and sour taste from the beets and pickles were gobbled completely. My coworkers enjoyed theirs as well. 

If you&apos;re in the Philly area and love Mediterranean with a lower budget, I&apos;d recommend this (though Zahav is pretty amazing too) for a nice lunch or even dinner - super filling lasted me all day without a snack. Next time, I&apos;d like to try the Brussels sprouts or lamb hummus."
5,"Had to try this place after learning that they serve the same hummus as Zahav&apos;s. What an amazing modern take of Israeli hummus, the toppings are innovative and texture silky smooth! We got the green bean and chicken hummus and both flavors were extraordinarily complimentary. The pita bread is also heavenly fluffy. Hands down the best hummus of all time; this dish has me daydreaming of the next time I return to Philly."
5,"This was my first time here and my friend insisted we go early to avoid the line, and good thing we did! I&apos;ve passed this place a few times and I&apos;m always thinking &quot;what&apos;s the hype....it&apos;s just hummus&quot;. And while on line I&apos;m still thinking this, and complaining to my friend that she&apos;s making me eat hummus for lunch. 

I&apos;m converted. GUYS. This place is so good. I don&apos;t know what it is. It&apos;s just hummus, right! NO. IT&apos;S SO GOOD. I found myself craving this place every day for the whole next week. I purchased store hummus and couldn&apos;t eat it because I was so spoiled from this place. I can&apos;t explain that flavor or why it&apos;s so good, but this is now a go to lunch spot. I will wait in that line. 

I got the pickled veggies and decided to mix everything directly in the hummus (not sure how you&apos;re supposed to do it) and I loved it. That pita is something else. It puts Cava pita (which is trash...I love Cava, but the pita is awful) and Naf Naf pita (which isn&apos;t bad when fresh) to shame. They change the options every day which is kind of exciting. You never know what you&apos;ll get. 

Go here."
5,"This place is a must try. Was visiting the area and looking for a quick spot to grab lunch and absolutely love Israeli food so figured I&apos;d give a try

The place inside was small with little seating so at first hesitated to stay, but the line went very quick and we were able to find a table outside. 

The menu seems to rotate so when I looked online it did not match what was available for the day. I took a shot and went with the pepper walnut and it was delicious! The chicken almond was good, but preferred the pepper walnut! Great hummus and one of the best fluffy pitas that I&apos;ve had!"
5,"The hummus is unlike any hummus you&apos;ll ever have (Zahav). And once you have it, you won&apos;t like any other hummus, so it&apos;s a problem. No hummus pics here. Have it, and have it again.

I also attended a popup where there was a special item called Jerusalem Mixed Grill - turkey breast, chicken hearts, and a ton of other stuff. I&apos;d give it 4 stars, simply because I felt it was a tad over salted (and the accompanying chips were extra salty as well). 

But, have the hummus."
2,Th hummus is good. But I always have been made to feel like I&apos;m rushing the service staff (maybe I&apos;ve been unlucky...). Food is good though. Wish there was more variety and staff spent time to talk to you
5,"Tomato walnut hummus is really good. Staff is super friendly and helpful.

They always gave special toppings so you want to keep in coming back to check out new menu.

Service is fast. You get a number for your order"
5,"Wow. Why can&apos;t all Mediterranean and Middle Eastern restaurants be this good? Dizengoff is an Israeli restaurant with *the* best hummus I&apos;ve had to date, anywhere, and probably the best pita too. This place is simply outstanding. Stop reading and go. Now. (After writing over 3,400 Yelp reviews over the past 11+ years, I&apos;ve never written that before.)

This is a small fast-casual restaurant that opened in Center City in 2014. A second location opened inside the Whole Foods behind the Rodin Museum in 2016. It&apos;s named after Dizengoff Street, a major street in Tel Aviv (the street, in turn, is named after the first mayor of Tel Aviv).

We showed up on a Saturday around 12:45pm. All seats inside were taken. Then again, there are only about 15-20 seats inside. We got lucky and scored some seats at the communal table shortly after placing our order. The line to order was short, but there was a steady stream of customers the entire time we were there (we left by 1:30pm). Staff keeps the line moving. This place is popular and does good business. It&apos;s a well-oiled machine. There are four small umbrella-covered tables outside on the sidewalk, but the weather was so hot that no one was sitting at them.

This is a trendy spot with a sort of hipstery vibe. Dizengoff&apos;s logo is bright pink and the front door frame and patio furniture are a bold orange color. The storefront has a retractable door that presumably cranks open when the weather is nice. Inside, there&apos;s an open kitchen featuring a Wood Stove brand oven where all the fresh, scratch-made pitas are baked.

The menu is short and simple. They serve hummus in five different varieties/toppings -- tehina, chicken, pepper, cucumber, and cauliflower -- priced at $10-13 each. All menu prices include tax. I think the food is affordable especially when you consider its quality and deliciousness. Each order of hummus includes fresh-baked pita and two sides, one of which is a Jerusalem salad with pickle, and the other a surprise (well, to us they were). Most Mediterranean and Middle Eastern restaurants serve hummus as an appetizer or side, but here it&apos;s an entree and it&apos;s good.

You can make small additions to any hummus order such as extra pita ($1), egg ($1), and pita chips ($3) and you can add any topping on the side. In addition, they offer Za&apos;atar roasted chicken dinners to-go ($36) and shakshuka, a North African dish made with eggs poached in a tomato-chili pepper sauce, on Sundays. Alcoholic beverages (beer, white wine, rose) are available for $4-8 each and they sell a frozen lemonana synonymous to, I think, the Middle Eastern limonana drink which is a frozen mint lemonade ($4 without booze, $8 with). Happy hour runs daily, 6-8pm.

We ordered one hummus with tehina and egg ($10 + $1 = $11) and one hummus with chicken ($13). Both orders were phenomenal. Along with the pita and Jerusalem salads with pickles mentioned above, the hummus with tehina and egg came with a marinated cucumber side salad and the hummus with chicken came with a roasted red pepper side salad. We noticed these sides were the same as the &quot;cucumber&quot; and &quot;pepper&quot; hummus toppings listed on the menu. I&apos;m not sure how they decided which ones we&apos;d get (they didn&apos;t ask us), but we liked the variety and enjoyed them both. They were flavorful and delicious.

Each order was served on its on tray. The arrangement of the dishes and the presentation of each individual dish was colorful and beautiful. The food tasted as good as it looked: excellent all around. Everything tasted incredibly fresh and high quality. The hummus was super smooth, creamy, and delectable. It had an extra bit of tehina (same as tahini or toasted ground sesame seeds) flavor. Both the hummus with tehina and egg and the hummus with chicken were nicely seasoned and packed with mouthwatering flavor. The jammy soft-boiled egg was cooked perfectly. The chicken was tasty; it didn&apos;t overpower the hummus and complemented it well. The pita was served hot/warm, each serving in its own paper sleeve. The pita had exited the oven just minutes (seconds?) before being served to us. They were soft and pillowy and were appetizingly charred/toasted on the outside. So good.

I also had a frozen lemonana ($4). It was tart and refreshing. I think it&apos;s worth getting and perfect for hot summer days. It&apos;s like a minty lemonade slushy.

Not only was the food great, but the service was too. We didn&apos;t get his name, but the cashier who served us was very friendly and helpful. White guy, curly hair, glasses, pink Dizengoff shirt. The young blonde girl busing tables was nice and sweet too.

When it comes to taste, price, and service, Dizengoff is a must-try restaurant in Philly, in my opinion."
