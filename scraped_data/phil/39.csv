5,"Not every pricey Latin food restaurant is worth it. Alma de Cuba is. It was the first restaurant I went to when I first was looking to move to Philly and was interviewing for jobs... back in the spring of 2001! It&apos;s still amazing, and I can&apos;t wait to go back after this pandemic is over with!"
5,"My husband took me here the night we got engaged. He knew I was a huge foodie and he knocked out of the park with this choice. So many ceviche selections, the cheese bread, the mojito taste tests--everything was delicious and the environment was cozy. We were just about to book for our anniversary and we&apos;re sad to see it is temporarily closed. We sincerely hope Alma de Cuba reopens so that we can celebrate and enjoy their food for years to come."
5,"Alma de Cuba walks the line between elegance and fustiness with aplomb. Both beautiful and welcoming this five star treat hits you right in the pleasure center delivering on all fronts -  effortless service, inventive cocktails and a menu that restores your faith in anything that doesn&apos;t have to coast on their reputation.

I could go on for days about their Royal Date appetizer and Seafood Rice entree but why bother, go discover them for yourself as you indulge in a dining experience that is both rare and worth every shekel."
5,It&apos;s a little too dark inside but it&apos;s a delicious restaurant nonetheless. Perfect date spot for delicious food. Always have had an amazing time here
5,"Really good place to visit with friends for a nice dinner time. The restaurant has a really nice and classy atmosphere. 

The bread here is also amazing, unlike most other breads I have eaten. It is chewy and quite gelatinous, almost like a mochi! The prices are a little on the pricey side but it is definitely worth it for the atmosphere and bread!

The taco appetizer is really small. They were the size of my fingers, so it takes about two bites to eat each taco. However, they were really delicious!"
5,"Best place for happy hour. Seriously, you get the bang for your buck. It&apos;s crazy how much cheaper the appetizers for happy hour are compared to regular dining hours. And you get around the same serving size. 

I&apos;ve been to Alma before during restaurant week and liked what I had but it wasn&apos;t anything special. However, I have been back many times for happy hour. Here&apos;s what I usually get:

- For drinks, I just go with a Mojito or Red Sangria. If you&apos;re here to drink, getting a pitcher is totally worth it because it has about 4-5 full glasses. 

- Empanadas de Verde: These are godsend. I mean the sauce they come with is so delicious that I dip my other food in it. They come with four empanadas and they&apos;re small but delicious. 

- Carnitas Empanadas: Not as good as empanadas de verde because they tend to be too dry on the inside. But still very good if you want meat. 

- Chicken croquettas: Oh the cheese inside is amazing and I can keep on popping these in my mouth all day. 

- Shrimp Cerviche: This is my favorite cerviche here. It&apos;s green and a bit spicy. The crunchy sweet potato pieces on top add nice texture. 

- Flan: Amazing. You have it get it and it&apos;s only $3. The pomegranate seeds around the flan really makes the dish. 

TLDR: Come for happy hour and eat everything!"
5,"Not exactly sure why it took me so long to try out this gem?! Maybe because of its location... anyway from the outside you would not guess that it is ginormous on the inside, ground floor is more like a bar/lounge area with 3 floors of dining area. We had reservations so we were seated on the second floor, our server was extremely pleasant and made some solid suggestions! 
The interiors has Cuban nuances, slightly dimly lit, but its super cozy, perfect for a date. 
We ordered the guacamole twitch a couple of cocktails. The guacamole came with plantain chips and was delectably fresh! 
We also ordered smoked chicken croquettes and cubanas (beef empanadas). Good portion size and the sauces complimented the flavors. We were too full to order the entrees, but definitely next time. 
We were told that the Ceviche Tasting is totally worth it as well!"
4,"Alma de Cuba is a nice change of pace on Walnut Street. Very dimly lit trendy spot with a uniquely decorated interior consisting of stationary projections of candid photos of Cuban life filling the walls of the main dining area. Comfortable seating with leather couches to relax your body on.

We came here for Restaurant Week as all the other places were reserved on Friday, I was happy to find reservations were still available here. So with that said, I can&apos;t comment on pricing since we ordered off the fixed menu. 

Overall, we both enjoyed most of the food. For starters we split empanada de verde and mojito shrimp ceviche. So let me tell you, the ceviche was so fresh I felt like we were sitting on Bubba Gump Shrimp Co boat. The mojito ingredients in the sauce gave it so much flavor, excellent appetizer. The presentation of the empanada is unlike any that I&apos;ve experienced before. You would think it was a a filet mignon with all the accents and garnishings. It was very creamy and not as crisp as it first appeared. Still fulfilling nonetheless. For the entrees, I felt the salmon was undercooked and lacked flavor. However, the pork chops were some of the best I&apos;ve had and the rice and beans were nice and juicy. Honestly we aren&apos;t big dessert people but the chocolate flourless cake was incredible. The coconut pudding was not good to me, very watery. 

Service was relatively good. I think it slowed down towards the end but the server honestly had his hands full. Noise level was a bit louder than I expected but not too bad. My experience was nice. It makes for a romantic date."
4,"We stumbled upon this place randomly, so it was fancier and pricier than we thought, but honestly worth it. The empanadas were legit the best empanadas I&apos;ve ever had, granted I haven&apos;t eaten a ton of empanadas. Perfectly salted with a balance of texture and flavor. I also got sweet plantains which were decent but not incredible. I&apos;d definitely recommend the beef empanadas! 

Ambiance seems very classy, mood lighting, etc. Service is quick and professional and we enjoyed our time here. I usually don&apos;t come to nicer establishments like this place, but it&apos;s definitely worth a visit here."
4,"Came in at 6:30PM Tuesday with a reservation for two - we got there early and they sat us down. It&apos;s a big place for dinners and team events with extremely dim lighting. 

We ordered the Alma sampler to share. They offered us free signature bread and chimchurri dip - the bread was chewy but also crispy on top similar to pineapple buns in HK cuisine. The sauce is tangy garlicy and pairs well with the bread which is also warm!!! The sampler was good too: crab empanadas were hearty and piping hot, the wahoo tacos were tangy and slightly cold but the taco shell provided a nice crunch and the royal palm dates were the most interesting of them all.

I got the sugar cane tuna which was a crazy palette blend of flavors: savory tuna, spicy peppers, sweet warm plantains, and sugar canes. The tuna comes nicely charred and rare. I enjoyed every bite! My friend ordered the short rib which comes in a big skillet and she had leftovers to take home - the short rib was so so tender and yummy, she spared me a piece.

Though full, we ordered desserts to satisfy our sweet tooth: chocolate cigar and tres leches cake. The chocolate cigar is almond cake and chocolate mousse with a side of sugar shaped like matches to be burned for an aesthetic effect. There&apos;s also a side of dulce de leche ice cream. It&apos;s great aesthetic, but the taste gets heavy and overwhelming with the chocolate after a good amount of bites. I loved the tres leches cake because it&apos;s light and you can taste the milk seeping through the vanilla cake and the coconut marshmallows on the side were delightful. The Mexican chocolate ice cream on the side had some crispy bits inside and the caramelized banana was warm on top of the cake - I finished almost all of it. 

Overall, the meal was great and they let us take our time...but our dinner was on the longer side. I&apos;m not sure if they&apos;re all busy and understaffed, but we did wait more than 15 minutes for our bill to arrive. Otherwise, I&apos;d highly recommend this place for dinner, happy hour or a work event!"
5,"My friend and I had 6:30 reservations for Friday night, but we lucked out when we got there and found seats at the bar, which meant at could take advantage of their Happy Hour!

We started with drinks.  I hit the Alma Libre and she got the Mojito.  My drink was too sweet and they graciously switched it out for the mojito, which was delicious. 

We then ordered most of the Happy Hour apps: Wahoo Tacos, Fried Yuca, Carnitas Empanadas, Rainbow Ceviche, and Shrimp Ceviche.  They were all good, but the Shrimp Ceviche was the standout!  The kalamansi and mint sauce was a refreshing explosion of flavor. The dashi added a nice smokey flavor and the crisp sweet potato added the perfect crunch.  I also really enjoyed the Wahoo Tacos and felt the flavors were well balanced, yet each one stood out. 

After happy hour, we ordered the Oxtail Bone Marrow Croquetas, which were we my friend said, &quot;the bomb.com&quot;. The bone marrow added a richness that was quite delectable. Plus the bone it was served on had some bonus marrow!

All of that plus another mojito each came to $72, which is very reaI&apos;m looking forward to returning again soon!!"
4,"Alma de Cuba is an upscale and trendy date-night restaurant for the typical classy adult couple. It definitely held up to the Stephen Starr standards. Personally didn&apos;t have lots of experience with Cuban cuisine but the menu is extensive and there&apos;s an entree for you no matter what your cravings are. 

Started off with the carnitas empanadas as an appetizer (comes in an order of 4 for $16). Pretty average empanadas, to be honest, would rather have paid $4 for a homemade authentic empanada from a grandma&apos;s shop in South Philly. I chose the seafood rice since I was craving something with rice (but unable to order the Vaca Frita since I don&apos;t eat beef) despite the waiter&apos;s recommendation against the seafood rice. It was a large plate of seafood risotto which I was totally OK with. My friends raved about the Vaca Frita ($32) and the portion was truly commendable. Drinks were appropriate for dinner, not too strong, not too light. I would recommend the maestra mule for those who enjoy a sweet, bubbly cocktail. 

This was my first time coming for dinner (company dinner, might I add). Overall, I really like Alma de Cuba&apos;s ambiance and drink quality. They use high quality ingredients, have very experienced bartenders and a large variety of cocktails, mojitos, wines, beers and other beverages to choose from. The prices on the food is comparable to most Stephen Starr restaurant ($40-50 pp after food/drink) so just be prepared for that, then you won&apos;t be disappointed!"
4,"Alma de Cuba is pricey, but the food is amazing and the experience is great if you&apos;re looking for a fancy meal out.

The restaurant is nestled in along Walnut Street, and it can be easy to miss if you&apos;re not looking. Inside, it rises up three entire floors, each one with a different ambiance: the bar floor is darker with lots of red lighting, whereas the dinner floor is a bit brighter and more welcoming. The staff were all very professional and friendly - not to mention well-dressed.

The food itself was superb. I highly recommend the Lechon Asado (big portion of pork which is crispy on the outside and tender on the inside) and the Vaca Frita (tender steak served with beans and tomato escabeche). Everything was super flavorful, well prepared, and quite filling.

On the whole, I couldn&apos;t afford to make this a regular activity (prices are around $30 for an entree). But for a special occasion, Alma de Cuba&apos;s an excellent choice."
5,"One of my favorite restaurants in Philly! As a disclaimer - I&apos;m cuban and have a high bar for cuban food, and often a particular distaste for &quot;elevated&quot; cuban food but this place nails it.

We arrived for our 1 year anniversary and ordered mojitos. Our waiter brought out two glasses of prosseco to celebrate - a nice touch. The mojitos are amazing - not too sweet and with real sugar cane!

For appetizers we had the chicken croquetas and the shrimp ceviche. The ceviche was balanced and perfectly acidic, and the chicken croquetas were great! 

For dinner we split a vaca frita. I LOVE that they can split entrees. It comes with black beans and rice that were good and some red tomato thing I&apos;ve never seen - didn&apos;t care for that. We got tostones on the side and the mojo was UNREAL.


We did after dinner drinks and the key lime flan which is amazing. I&apos;ve never had anything like it and the texture of the flan is on point. Our server went out of her way and brought us some mango Chile sorbet that said &quot;happy anniversary&quot; to end our night.

Thank you alma de Cuba for an amazing experience - we&apos;ll be back!"
3,"Pretty solid place with astronomical prices.  Be prepared to leave here hungry after dropping a hundred.  

Got the ceviche to start- worst thing we had.  Avoid it, the fish isn&apos;t fresh.

Then we had some empanadas.  Very ok.  Nothing spectacular, and absolutely not worth the price tag.

Somewhere along the way we got some cheesy bread.  Amazing stuff!  Wish they brought it out without us having to ask.  One small ball is not enough, they should let you load up a plate with them!

Then we got the tuna, cooked rare. DAMNED good food!  Best tuna I&apos;ve ever had.  Wish the rest of the meal was like this!

Overall, not a great value and half of the dishes we got were either not good or mediocre.  Not worth the sticker price, and definitely wouldn&apos;t come back.  Wouldn&apos;t refuse their tuna though- maybe we just ordered wrong?"
5,"Great food and plenty of seating space for big groups. I like Cuban food and they definitely do it well (and really fancy everything up). The bread is wonderful, soft, moist and oh-so-buttery! I had fish tacos for appetizer which were tasty but also the smallest tacos I&apos;ve ever seen. For entree, I had a taste of the salmon, roast beef, and grilled chicken, all taste great. My favorite is definitely the beef, which was tender and well-seasoned.
Dessert was flan with bits of fruits and whipped cream on top. The flan had the right amount of sweetness and so soft that it melted in your mouth! An awesome way to end the meal.

Overall highly recommended if you are in the mood for fancy Cuban food."
5,"I have been to Alma de Cuba on several occasions, for both happy hour and dinner. I am always impressed by the service here and the attention to detail. The food is always great and comes out super fast (sometimes a little too fast). 

Highly recommend the Smoked Wahoo Tacos, Guacamole, Traditional Flan, Chicken Imperial and Vaca Frita. For drinks, their daily mojitos are also always amazing! If you have not been to this place yet, I would definitely suggest you to try out their happy hour first (great deals on appetizer and drinks)."
5,"I am very pleased with this restaurant. It is perfect for special occasions (if you&apos;re looking for that up-scale vibe.) I found the prices to be reasonable; given the type of restaurant it was. The service was great and very attentive, from making reservations to waiting on our table. The music was on point and stuck to the Latin vibes. The food was delicious! The table had an array of dishes: goat, chicken, seafood, steak and empanadas, and no one had anything negative to say! I would definitely recommend Alma de Cuba and would love to return."
4,"Found this place randomly while searching for a Friday night dinner spot! The whole restaurant is definitely very posh and sophisticated, and would be great for special occasions.

The menu is slightly pricey  around $20-30 per main entrée. I ordered the verde empanadas with a side of tostones. The tostones were pretty crispy and the acid in the garlic mojo added a nice kick, and the empanadas were the perfect balance of creamy on the inside and crispy on the outside.

Overall the staff was really nice and courteous, and they have a interesting looking très lèches cake on thé menu for dessert, which I&apos;ll have to try if I ever return."
2,"I dined here last night with another couple and we were highly disappointed in the food.  My husband and I are big into the Philadelphia food scene and love to explore various cuisine. This was on our list and unfortunately it turned out to miss the mark for us.

The wahoo tacos were extremely small and bland, but the worst was the mojito cerviche. We were picturing a light, energizing and zesty dish, but out came a plate of shrimp drowned in overpowering cilantro sludge that looked like green baby food. (See photo.)  It was not edible so we sent it back (something we NEVER do!) 

Our waitress was kind enough to switch it out, but the Thai Coconut Cerviche was also a let down. Edible, but rubbery and soaked in coconut water.  I had high hopes for the cerviche here. The crab empanadas were fine and had a nice crunch, but were sub par at best.

I&apos;ll end with the highlights, because not everything was unenjoyable.  The bacon wrapped dates were the best dish by far, bursting with sweetness, grounded in the savoryness of the bacon all while  accompanied by the creaminess of the blue cheese.  Those I devoured. The small balls of bread were also very moist and had a similar taste of cornbread to me.  For dinner I got the Vaca Frita which was good - the steak was a little over cooked and crispy but it was enjoyable overall. That being said, I wouldn&apos;t come back just to seek out that dish specifically.

The ambiance I did love - it was cozy and romantic for a double date. Service was excellent and the food came out super quick! They seem very organized here.  Sad to say that we won&apos;t be returning, as the food did not live up to the hype."
