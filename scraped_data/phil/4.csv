5,"Came here for outdoor dining this week. Have been meaning to come here forever and it did not disappoint! 

Lots of nice outdoor seating options. They&apos;re basically made small apartments outside. Only problem was that their heating system was a bit iffy and half way through was just blowing out cold air. Regardless, the weather was decent enough that it wasn&apos;t a huge deal. They also check your temperature on your wrist. Nice reassurance I suppose although unclear what that is actually worth. 

Had a cheeseboard for appetizer which was delicious as expected. A nice variety of cheeses with crackers and bread to eat them as well as jam and fruits. Had the pan fried bronzino for entre. Just perfectly crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. Best cooked fish I&apos;ve had in a long time. Came with spinach which was also just bitter enough to go with the fish well. Also had the fig pizza and tuna tartar as appetizers and again both excellent. Honestly, the pizza crust dough was perfect. Not too thin, not too thick, fluffy at the edges and crispy on the bottom. And the toppings were excellent! My cocktail and the cornbread weren&apos;t anything to write home about, but they were solid. Also had the lava cake and bread pudding for desert. The bread pudding was incredible with hazelnut whipped cream on the side. Lava cake with home made peanut butter was delicious too but outdone by bread pudding. 

Downsides? Seemed like it might have been challenging if you were vegetarian? You have to book a decent bit in advance? It is expensive but you get what you pay for. Table was a bit small for what we ordered, but I guess that just means we&apos;re gluttons. 

Come here for your next special occasion! It was delicious!"
5,"We felt lucky to snag a meal from Talula&apos;s for Valentine&apos;s Day dinner. I was worried we were going to miss out and have to &quot;settle&quot; for pizza. But thank goodness for a Foobooz article, which led us to this 5-course spread. 

The purchase process was over email with the manager, and felt personal. The staff once we went in to pick up were also exceptionally kind and nice. 

The food was packaged neatly into containers, and a print-out gave us step by step instructions and tips on how to heat things up, and even in what order, and how far apart. 

We started with goat cheese curds with rosemary and hot honey, eaten out of the good china (why wait?!) while sitting on the couch. They were perfect, and the herbs, spices and sweetness provided the perfect companion to the soft cheese and crisp breading. 

We shared the next course--tuna crudo--in the kitchen. The flavor combination was, again, incredible. The tangerine slices and harissa sent it over the top for me, and it had been soooo long since we&apos;d had something this delicious and delicate. 

The main course was made up of two dishes. The first was a lobster risotto with herbed salad and a sea salt reduction. My husband chose to just do the risotto (he&apos;s a purest), but I was all about those herbs. They punched and bit where the risotto was soft and comforting, and the lobster was hearty and fresh enough to hang on for the whole ride. 

On our plates, beside the risotto, was short rib with winter salsa verde and a thick slice of polenta with mushrooms, which all warmed in the oven together (snuck in at the last minute onto the tray were the mini cheddar bay biscuits, the other risotto companion). Our plates (and palates) were happy that night. 

We ate at our dining room table, while listening to Alexa blast tunes, from Little John to Elvis Presley. We lit tea lights around the table to create a version of the ambiance of Talula&apos;s (not quite the same). But the food certainly transported us to a different time, when dining out didn&apos;t mean eating out of a plastic container or box, or sitting watching Netflix. 

We ended the night with Talula&apos;s final course - a trio of cookies, a dollop of fresh whipped cream, cookie butter, and berries. It was perfect, sweet, small enough not to overfill but large enough to feel like we got to feast. (Loved the millionaire&apos;s shortbread most of all!)

Thank you Talula&apos;s for making our night a great one. We can&apos;t wait to be back in the world, dining out. Until then, keep it safe, mask up, and eat local!"
5,"Talula&apos;s Garden never lets me down!
Covid-19 precautions are taken with temperature scans before seating and sufficient space between tables.

I went with a group of friends for brunch. Two of us got the brisket. The meat was divine. I&apos;m not too sure everything that was in the bowl but the flavors just worked. The pancakes were fluffy (but I wouldn&apos;t get those). The chicken and waffles were above expectation - chicken was perfectly tender and moist.

You can&apos;t go wrong with anything!"
5,"Wow wow wow 
This is crazy place the dessert it&apos;s so delicious every one must to try this place it&apos;s so good and the service the best service definitely recommend 
High recommend!
You must to try people"
4,"It has been a while since I have been here, but it has been on my mind lately. 

I have only been for brunch, but their dinner menu looks amazing as well. The menu itself changes monthly, which is nice to always get some variety and ensure you are eating the freshest ingredients. Every single thing they offer is BEYOND delicious.

Beautiful outside seating - great service - awesome brunch cocktails!"
4,"Ooo la la Talula! 

Came here for a Saturday brunch and this place knows how to do it! 

Located on the edge of Washington Square West, the spot definitely has street presence. The signage is apparent making it easy to find. We had made a reservation for 10AM on OpenTable (as all on site dining is nowadays during COVID - reservations are required), and upon our arrival we were quickly seated in our outdoor spot. As is the name, the motif is outdoorsy filled with greenery and whimsy. The space has definitely transformed in COVID times with a lot of outdoor structures built to accommodate the crowds and still abide by guidelines. 

We were seated in the inner outdoor structure which was covered with plexiglass and had plenty of heaters going on allowing us to take our coats off and feel comfortable. We peered over the menu and our waitress got our water and coffee. She was nice in getting us comfortable and kept her mask on and socially distanced (as best as possible) throughout her entire engagement with us.

We started the morning with the apple and butternut squash soup - topped with harissa whipped goat cheese and roasted quinoa. What a great palate starter! Spicy, hearty, warm - and very necessary while outside. 

For our mains we ordered the farm fresh omelette (filled brie and leeks that came with a side salad and potato fritters) and the winter grain bowl (quinoa, brussel sprouts, squash, kale, walnut purée, with an apple cider vinaigrette.) Both dishes were ample portion wise and the flavors were spot on and hit those savory notes. 

They do have a pretty decent drinks menu but we opted out so can&apos;t comment on that - but definitely worth trying out next time. Also, they do not have their coffee menu listed but they&apos;re able to provide simple espresso and coffee drinks if you ask. 

Of note, it was definitely a treat for us as this is more of a well known/premium spot, the prices were reflective. 

COVID review: all the workers were wearing masks. The social distancing was decently in place between tables, they took wrist temps at check-in and hand sanitizer is also available at this time. 

Overall happy with the experience! The food was solid, the facade was well done, and great service! Enjoy your time!"
5,"We went here for an amazing brunch last weekend. The seating is outdoors but toasty with heaters and coverings to block out the wind. In addition, the garden theme provides a summery/spring feel in the middle of winter. We ordered a soup, two entrees, and two coffees. Portions were big and we didn&apos;t have room for dessert but it&apos;s on my list to try next time! 

The service was friendly and patient. We weren&apos;t rushed at all, despite there being a bit of a wait for tables. Can&apos;t wait for our next visit to this little brunch paradise."
5,"Wow! I can see how this would be one of the best brunch spots in the area. I visited while I was in town and outdoor dining was allowed, and while I overslept my rezzie and showed up and hour or so later when I wandered in since it wasn&apos;t super far from where I was staying and I was going to check out the beautiful park beside them they were able to still honor my rezzie. I waited a few minutes to be seated in the garden area inside the gate instead of outside because I was hoping to peep some of the &quot;scene&quot;.

The outdoor garden area was nice, a wee bit chilly for a CA girl but nice. When I stepped inside to use the restroom I was blown away. This place is gorgeous inside! I&apos;m all for the appeal of the al fresco dining but wow wow wow, I&apos;d definitely want to be seated inside here. 

I had a french press coffee, and the chicken and waffle dish with a side of the grits. I make some pretty darn good grits so these fell flat in my opinion and can be skipped. The fried chicken and waffle dish was really yummy.

I&apos;d definitely recommend this place and will return in the future when dining is back to normal. 

The food + service + decor easily make this a 5 star experience. I doubt highly you&apos;ll be disappointed."
5,"This place doesn&apos;t need another 5 star review, but I&apos;m going to give it one anyways. One of the best meals in Philadelphia. All the ingredients are fresh and the meals managed to be light and feel like summer but still have a winter twist to them.  The most impressive thing about the food here is just the flavor combinations and profiles. The Branzino with blood oranges and a verde sauce is so creative and so delicious. One of the best dishes I&apos;ve had this winter. 

Will definitely come back in the summer and explore whatever is in season then."
4,"This was one of the few places that we found offering outdoor dining back in December. We made sure to make reservations ahead of time. They took our temperature before showing us to our seats. The ambience was really enchanting and the food was pretty good. We got the seared scallops, pan fried branzino, and the cheddar chive biscuits. We enjoyed everything from the service to food. Overall, a cute little spot for date night."
3,I appreciate the hospitality of this place but they didn&apos;t handle their brunch rush very well today. I had a reservation but wasn&apos;t seated until 50 mins later. They need to tell people beforehand that they have a hour and a half time restraint to eat. The food was really good though and everyone was very nice.
4,"Our anniversary was a few days ago, so we decided to splurge and order from Talula&apos;s Garden since they are on Caviar. 

My husband and I both got the short ribs with polenta and it was divine. The sauce and polenta made the dish. I&apos;m not a huge polenta fan, but I could eat this for days! My husband got the cornbread, which he said was a bit dry. 

For dessert, I got the apple/cranberry crumble with chai ice cream. While it was good, there were too many flavors going on. I would have preferred vanilla ice cream here. 

Overall, we enjoyed our dinner and look forward to visiting the actual garden once COVID is over!"
2,"Such a disappointing experience, the only keeping it from a one-star is the COVID factor.

We called Talula&apos;s for a special night in and requested a 6:15 pick up.  We arrived and I noticed a 5:30 on the slip, but didn&apos;t pay much attention.  Unfortunately, every bite reflected that it had been sitting out for too long.

We got the Talula&apos;s Fall Fig &quot;Pizza&quot; and noticed only one side had cheese.  While unusual, not a big deal until we lifted it up to find the cheese clumped on the bottom of the box.  It was clear they had dropped it while setting it in the box and either didn&apos;t notice or didn&apos;t bother to correct.  I expect a lot more from a premium location such as Talula&apos;s.  I will give the pizze credit, even cold it had a decent flavor profile, however, it was also soggy.

The Line Caught Tuna Crudo might have been the only portion of the meal completely worth enjoying.  The mix of jalapeño, radishes, basil, and the syrup (black garlic) came together well.  The sizing was appropriate for the price as well.

Our mains were both letdowns.  The Seared Sea Scallops came with 4 nice sized scallops which is a fair portion. They weren&apos;t very good lukewarm and seemed to be a bit over seared. The Tuscan Sangiovese Glazed Beef Short Rib, also lukewarm at best at this point, was not at all tender.  The flavor profile was there, but being chewy just isn&apos;t what I was expecting.

Yes, it is COIVD times.  Yes, it is take out. Still, keep in mind this restaurant is high end and we paid a premium for what we felt would be a stellar dining experience. I&apos;ve been inside on one or two other occasions and cannot believe the night and day change in experience."
5,"The ambience at night created an excellent dining experience under the stars! Tatula&apos;s Garden at night during the summer is a great place for an intimate setting with a few close friend(s) or date night.

The customer service was exceptional and the food was fresh! We ordered a cheese plate (interesting to taste the different cheeses and nuts) and cornbread (was on point; especially with the maple butter)! For my entree, I ate the house-made ricotta ravioli. The flavors of the pasta were interesting (in a good way) and the portion was just enough. I also enjoyed their Prosecco as well!

Tatula&apos;a Garden went over and beyond with taking precautions during the pandemic: before entering the restaurant-- employees check your temperature on a face kiosk, of course the guests have to wear their mask coming into the restaurant, all the servers had mask and face shield, on the table they have information explaining how to be safe for everyone during this time. I was highly impressed at all the effort the restaurant has done for their staff as well as the guests."
5,"This brunch was everything  We started with a couple of mimosas and the brioche French toast sticks which were amazing. We described them as elevated french toast sticks from our childhood (who didn&apos;t love those?). Next we both got the local brunch with bacon, home fries, eggs and English muffins. It came with a homemade maple butter which was honestly to die for. Amazing brunch!"
5,"COVID UPDATED REVIEW:
Still friggin amazing. I just bumped them up a star because I&apos;m certain this is the best restaurant in Philly. Came here for dinner. Love that they are on Open Table. I love that - their reservations open a week out. 

Upon arrival they&apos;ll take your temp, non contact. Tables are all socially distant. The garden aesthetic is amazing. So cute. 

You have 1.5 hours at your table, which is a good amount of time and all staff wear masks. If you leave your table, masks required. 

Also: the Hustler cocktail is amazing. Highly recommend."
5,"Came here for a Saturday brunch and was really impressed by the gorgeous patio garden that is Talula&apos;s! During Covid times, they check your temperature at the front and then you are either taken to the garden or seated out front along the street. It was a sweet, rustic, and cozy space, perfect for a small group of friends or a date.

For drinks, I tried both the butcher bloody mary and the froze. The bloody mary had the perfect amount of spice and kick, and the froze was a perfect strawberry icee on a hot day. Would recommend getting either/both. For the entrees, my friends ordered the farm fresh omelet and the local brunch. I had the chicken and waffles which were delicious and served with an excellent hot honey. I wish there was a better ratio of chicken:waffles but that&apos;s my only complaint. The entrees are a sizeable portion but we still managed to clean the plates! 

In addition, service was very prompt and the drinks were brought quickly without us feeling rushed. Overall, we had a really great experience - the ambience, food and drinks were highlights and made for a great brunch. Would highly recommend!"
4,"Birthday brunch at Talula&apos;s was amazing. We had  a reservation for 10am as soon they opened on a Sunday. By the time we placed our food order, the place was packed...still observing COVID safety measures. We sat in the garden area and it was really pretty. 
Fiancé ordered the hot honey drizzle fried chicken and waffle while I ordered the steak and egg bowl. The steak and egg bowl contained short rib, grits, crispy mushrooms, poached egg with miso chili jam. It was tasty. Each dish was about $24 - a bit pricey for Philly. Overall loved the food and atmosphere."
4,"My fellow helpers have already and the well deserved praises of this restaurant already and I gotta thank all of them! I&apos;ve been trying to get a reservation here for ages, lol and it took a pandemic of all things to be able to snag a dinner reservation! Philly is still just outdoor dining but the weather was gorgeous and we thoroughly enjoyed it. We didn&apos;t get to sit in the very pretty garden but we were on the sidewalk which seemed less crowded to me (which I prefer). Waiter was great, all staff wore masks. There was a thermal scanner of some sort. You had a time limit for reservation, 2 people were given 1 hr 40 min or so but they didn&apos;t rush us out and we ended up staying a little over 2 hours. They were polite In just letting us know the next reservation would be here in 30 min. 

Food was excellent, well presented with unique flavor combinations. Who would have thought ahi tuna and watermelon could go so well together? The cheese
Plates was tasty but for $25 could have used a bit more accompaniments. The salmon entree was one of my faves of the night and the carrot cake! A light and airy carrot cake exists and I found it at talula&apos;s! The drinks offered were fun and different, throughly enjoyed them as well! 

So yes def give this place a try! Now I need to try to get a brunch reservation here...."
4,"Quick COVID time review -
they have a gorgeous garden area but it was raining so we were happy with our indoor table. They have enclosures around tables that made us feel comfortable dining like this. Our waiter was training but very good and knowledgable about the menu. All people who came to our table were wearing masks +/- eye protection which was all reassuring.

The food and drink was good and it was nice to get a chance to spend some time with a few friends."
