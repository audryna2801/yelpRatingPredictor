5,"I&apos;ve dreamed of ordering and eating a philly cheesesteak in Philadelphia, and it came true tonight! I loooved how tender and well seasoned the meat was. The sandwich was so juicy and extremely tasty. I got the cheese on the side because I didn&apos;t want to be overwhelmed with its flavor and I recommend it for first timers. The onion rings were giant! We really didnt need the order of fries with the onion rings. I&apos;m so glad we split the sandwich. I almost couldn&apos;t even finish my half. The drinks we had were the perfect touch to wash it all down during happy hour.

Our waitress/bartender was so sweet and wore a faceshield and mask the entire time. Everyone was really spaced out inside while we ate. It felt really safe compared to some places.

I wish I could give an extra star because I forgot my purse inside and they pulled it aside for me and waited till I came back to get it. They told me they tried to find me once they realized it but I was too far down the street. Not a lot of places would do that. Tha n you Cleavers!"
5,"What is wrong with me? How have I POSSIBLY not rated Cleavers yet? Cleavers is a few blocks from where I work in Philadelphia, and... let&apos;s put it this way: I&apos;ve moved to Memphis for a while temporarily because of COVID, and there&apos;s only one restaurant that I&apos;m waking up wishing I could just walk to and it&apos;s this one. And as we all know Memphis has done great food so that&apos;s saying something.

I always get the chicken Parm of barbecue chicken sandwiches. They are so amazing alone, but if you add a black and white shake onto it -- absolutely amazing. If you&apos;re going to cleavers you should always call ahead (COVID Szn or not) because they do take about 15 minutes to make the food and they also have other customers start to line up around lunch, but it&apos;s worth it."
5,"Came here while visiting because it came up as one of the best Phillys in Philly (LOL) 

Let me tell you.. I was NOT disappointed
We walked in, took a seat by the tables, you must wear your mask at all times unless you are eating &amp; for drinking (this review is from late Oct. rules could be different) 

The menu was paper &amp; scannable for the drinks, they had such great options! 

Cheesesteak - 5/5 - $10.95 - we kept it basic just to try a Philly, we added Cheese Whiz &amp; it was just amazing 

Fried Pickles - $7.50 - delicious 

Waffle-Cut Sweet Potato Fries - added white cheddar sauce - $6.50 - so good!"
5,"This is hands-down the best Philly cheesesteak I&apos;ve ever had. This was their last restaurant we went to before we left Philly. thank God we did this restaurant last because  it left a lasting impression.
Philly cheesesteak 
Of course I had their Philly cheesesteak and it was absolutely amazing. It was everything you wanted in a Philly cheesesteak and more. Words cannot describe how good the sandwich was. I have a tendency to save half of the sandwich for the next day and I couldn&apos;t I had to have the whole thing all in one sitting.
Fries
We also ordered a side of fries and it was excellent as well. I made a comment to my brother that they taste like high quality checker fries. Because they had that excellent seasoning but it was so crispy.
Cheesecake 
We got the cheesecake to go and it was excellent as well the only thing I wish I would&apos;ve done was Heat it up a little bit because it was cold. 
Service
The service was pretty good the problem was we are eating in the bar area so the bartender was in charge of everything. She did an excellent job getting to us but I can tell she was overwhelmed with all the customers and all the different things that were going on.
Overall 
Overall I would have to say this was an amazing experience and I highly recommend this place to anyone coming to Philadelphia"
4,"We arrived at Cleaver&apos;s around close to noon and was able to be seated right away at the bar area which I believe is the only open dine in option at the moment? 

We ordered the Pizzaz cheesesteak quickly regretting our choice at our first bite...we came here to get in one of the city&apos;s pick on cheesesteak favorites among many others and was not pleased with the Pizzaz; cheese moons were over fired there for leading to a dried up mozz stick and overall dry and flavorless sandwich. We did like the bread and the finely chopped steak so we are looking forward on returning again someday to try the OG Philly cheesesteak.

The loaded waffle fries were so yummy!! As well as the cleavers Horchata boozy shake with an extra shot and its was also delicious.

Great vibe and music on 2/13/21 we will be back soon to try the OG cheesesteak with another round of loaded waffle fries and a boozy shake!"
4,"I can summarize it by saying &quot;Not bad&quot;

The Philly cheesesteaks are pretty good, definitely in my top 3! Good portions, fair prices, good taste. 

For indoor dining, the area is functional but nothing to write home about. The silver tables were a bit small for no good reason, but otherwise I&apos;m always up to eat there!"
5,"Great cheese to steak ratio, family can&apos;t eat that much meat in one sitting so if you have some hoagie extra sandwiches can be made."
4,"Now this place is crazy good! Holy cow! I could eat here err day! 

I got not one complaint form my family! They enjoyed every bite of these cheesesteaks! They&apos;ve got more than that on on the menu ! I wanted to try more but damn I was full! Definitely gotta come back and check out more stuff! They&apos;ve got alcohol too so ThTs always a plus!"
5,"Listen, I&apos;m not knocking on any of the old-school staples that have been in Philly for ages. This place, and I&apos;m only guessing, must of said, &quot;this is Philly! We need to show up and make a cheesesteak that will shut-out any out-of-Philly competition.&quot; They absolutely showed up. I swear. I could not believe the portion, the selection of meat and the toppings of choice. You don&apos;t feel pressured ordering, you get meat that could have been served alone as an entr√©. So without needing to give you a run-on on what else makes this place sooo good,... I challenge you. And bring your friends, because you might need a witnesses."
5,"Alright there&apos;s Philly cheesesteaks then there&apos;s Philly cheesesteaks that place over there does it wrong then there&apos;s place like Cleavers that are doing it right in many different ways you decide what ones for you!

Coming here was kinda an adventure but very much worth it as the building was boarded up leaving only the sign on the roof and an arrow pointing to the door handle as this location is downtown and due to current situations that&apos;s why it&apos;s like this.

Once inside they have a small little area to eat next to the bar area again they have limited seating because of the world right now either way it was still awesome to eat inside and get this delicious Philly hot right in front of me on this cold rainy day!

Of the delicious choices I totally went with the Effin Hot Steak as I love hot peppers and onions on my steak as that&apos;s just what&apos;s totally good and this cheesesteak was just that a pile of cheesy steak pepper and onion goodness that was huge on a delicious fresh baked bun that just was perfect in soo many ways!

Could this be the best of the cheesesteaks I&apos;ve ever had I totally think yes as it was just super awesome from start to finish as you really couldn&apos;t go wrong in anyway!

Our server/bartender was awesome she was in top of it and very particular about distancing and the way she went about it which was totally what&apos;s good!

Overall there really wasn&apos;t anything that went down here that wasn&apos;t just awesome as my effin hot steak was beyond perfect so much so that I really hope to make it back here again because it&apos;s totally just what&apos;s good in soo many cheesy ways!"
4,"While visiting Philly with my fiance, we were naturally on the search for a real good Philly Cheesesteak. We had heard good things about Cleavers so we decided to check it out!

We were eyeing the chicken rolls on the menu, but figured we should try the steak since we were in Philly. We went with The Block and also the pizza fries to share.

The pizza fries were undoubtedly the star of the show. SO MUCH CHEESE and so much yum. I don&apos;t know why I&apos;ve never thought about topping fries with marinara and cheese before. As for the cheesesteak, unfortunately, we weren&apos;t crazy about The Block...maybe we were expecting more sauce b/c we&apos;re sauce people? Plus we do like our chicken, so if we come back, we&apos;ll have to try one of the chicken rolls. 

Overall, good experience, but we&apos;ll have to get a different sandwich next time. Still recommend this spot though b/c they have a great menu!"
4,"If you love a good philly cheesesteak you must go check out this place ,its very good .I was visiting Philly from NYC for my bday weekend. I knew I couldn&apos;t leave without getting a cheesesteak. One of my local friends recommended this place.

I messed up and forgot to get the cheese wiz but I did go back and order a side of it....a philly cheese steak is not complete without the cheese wiz in my opinion. 
The place was nice inside  although due to covid we had to wait for our food outside took about 5/10 minute . We also eat outside they had a few tables on the sidewalk . It was a rainy windy day but well worth it. The sandwich was huge perfect to split between two people. I gave it a 4 star because it didn&apos;t have alot of cheese and could of used more flavor maybe some garlic and onion powder .they also charge almost $2 for a small thing of cheese wiz ."
5,"I was visiting Philly from NYC and Cleavers was on my list of places to try. My girlfriend and I decided to stop by the location instead of ordering in. We ordered the CBR Grilled &amp; Caesar Grilled and we had absolutely no regrets. 

The sandwiches were hugeeee and absolutely delicious.  The bread was soft, the chicken was juicy with a light charred taste from the grill and they added just the right amount of sauce. Due to Covid, we had to wait for our food outside. Outside the restaurant were a few table and chairs but since it was raining we decided to checkout a store nearby. We waited about 10-15 mins for our sandwiches. 

We&apos;re big fans of grilled chicken sandwiches and these are on the top of our list. The Caesar Grilled reminds me of a Chicken Caesar slice which I love. I&apos;d definitely return and highly recommend this spot if you&apos;re ever visiting Philly."
4,"It was so satisfying to unwrap a Cleaver sandwich and have the steam rise up and carry the savory smell of the rib eye and whiz. The rib eye is tender, the cheese adds a creamy texture and more richness, and the bread is there to keep it all together and for that carb hit. Cleavers was great. 

Some additional advice to keep in mind is that the 1lb sandwich may be split to serve two, and that you should grab extra napkins, because as pleasurable as the Cleavers experience is, it won&apos;t be clean. Finally, don&apos;t skip out on this place; it handily beats out the two &quot;big&quot; cheesesteak joints.. you know the ones."
5,Omg your spicy sandwich..... IS SO SPICY. I ended up not being able to eat it bc it was so hot and unbearable. However - everything else is delicious!
5,"I&apos;m late to the Cleavers game. Eagles opening game of 2020 amidst a pandemic seemed like the perfect time to start. 

Everywhere in Philly has cheesesteaks. I needed a cheesesteak from a place that specializes in cheesesteaks. 

Ordering through Grubhub was extremely easy. I was also really impressed by all of the steak options and combinations. Their chicken sandwich selection was impressive as well. 

I went with a MYO: American Cheese, rib eye, fried onions and banana peppers. I added my own hot sauces at home. 

The sandwich was solid in proportion and was eaten in two installments. I liked that It came pre-cut in half. The roll was fresh but sturdy and smooth. I liked the chopped pieces of steak. The meat to topping ratio was also legit. Not the least bit greasy either. 

Better late than never. Cleavers is my new cheesesteak delivery go-to. 

This was easily a 4.5 delivery experience. It&apos;s hard to rate without actually visiting the restaurant. In light of these crazy times, I&apos;m supporting this restaurant and rounding up."
3,"3.5 stars.  One does not visit and leave Philly without trying a Philly cheesesteak!  I&apos;ve always found myself making my rounds visiting different cheesesteak spots and happened to stumble upon Cleavers given its proximity to Rittenhouse Square.

Between two people, we ordered takeout for:

- The Cleaver to-go, which is 1lb ribeye steak with American and cheese whiz
- Waffle-cut fries

Overall, the cheesesteak was good and ribeye was cooked to perfection.  My only gripe was that they were super generous with the whiz (probably a bit too much for my liking).  A thick layer was lathered under the meat which made the bread a bit soggy.  The waffle cut fries were okay...they tasted a bit stale. 

The staff was friendly and the bathroom was clean.  When I visited, the indoor seating area was closed off for COVID, but it seemed like a cool spot to hang out.

I would recommend coming here at least once to try it if you&apos;re near the area."
3,"First meal when I got to Philly was Cleaver&apos;s. The first bite of the hot fries was amazing (probably because I was starving). However, each bite just got worse and worse. The fries were doused in so much hot sauce that I felt like I was drinking hot sauce in every bite. The fries were soggy and lost their crisp because of the hot sauce. That was definitely a disappointment.

I also ordered The Block, which was pretty average. There was barely any cheese, which I was sad about. I even added extra cheese to my cheesesteak. The bread was like french bread, so it was more tough. The meat was plentiful, and the pepper and onions added to the flavor. However, nothing about it was outstanding. I am not sure if I had a bad batch, but Cleaver&apos;s may not be my go-to for cheesesteaks."
4,"Milkshake: 4.25 Out of 5
Had the strawberry milkshake and it was the pick me up that I needed. I think it came in one size and the quality of it was great -- creamy and it didn&apos;t taste like it came out of a cheap mix. 

Service: 4 Out 5
Meh, not slow but not fast either. 

Overall: 4.25 Out of 5
The fact that I am lactose intolerant and gulped this drink says a ton. I&apos;m willing to sacrifice a lot of flatulence later for a delicious shake now. Nevertheless refreshing on a warm day!"
5,"When in Philly, gotta try a cheesesteak at least once! I&apos;ve tried a few other spots in the past, but I&apos;ve only heard of Cleavers recently, and I can&apos;t believe what I&apos;ve been missing! 

Among three people, we got a few things off the menu:
- The Block
- Beef Italiano
- Effin&apos; Hot Steak 
- Waffle Fries

We called to place our order, and our food was ready for pick-up in 15 minutes! We absolutely loved the Beef Italiano, which tasted just like the Italian beef sandwiches we love! The Effin&apos; Hot Steak was super spicy, so definitely be prepared if you want to order that. Still super delicious though! My friend ordered The Block, but added all the vegetable options on top of it, so it was definitely a packed cheesesteak! The customizable options are definitely a huge, added bonus to make your cheesesteak a little more flavorful/veggie-ful. 

We&apos;ll definitely be coming back for more!"
