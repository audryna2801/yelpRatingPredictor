5,"Came here for my boyfriends birthday and we were not disappointed! Literally one of my favorites restaurants for an elegant night out. We came here very pre-COVID, so I&apos;m not sure how things are running now, but here was my experience.

Staff: Every one of them was so extremely nice! Our waiter was seriously one of the nicest and funniest people I&apos;ve met! He went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable and happy! I even spoke to him secretly that it was my boyfriend&apos;s birthday and he set up a small surprise for us!! The men who brought the meat around were also all super kind!

Food: Some of the best food I&apos;ve had in awhile! Their salad bar has such a huge selection of foods. As someone who isn&apos;t a huge fan of meat, I had plenty of choices. There were salad selections, some pasta dishes, a meat and cheese portion, and much more! All of the meat was cooked perfectly and, even as someone who doesn&apos;t love steak, I still loved everything I tried!!

Atmosphere: A very beautiful place you can join your friends or loved ones with to have a good time. The tables next to us had bigger parties so they were a bit loud, but it was still romantic for my boyfriend and I.

Dessert: We got the chocolate cake (a birthday surprise!) and it was THE BEST chocolate cake I&apos;ve ever consumed. This is no exaggeration. My boyfriend and I always split a chocolate cake for dessert every place we go, and this was our absolutely favorite. I would go back for the cake itself!!

Overall I love this place and can not wait to go back for his birthday this year (hopefully!) So glad we found this place to make an awesome tradition!"
5,"Fogo has been one of my top restaurants for just a nice night out or for restaurant week, where you get a steal at the $35 price. 

Pre-COVID, the restaurant was always busy - they offer a wide assortment of beef, chicken, lamb and more! My favorite cuts are the fraldinha and the picanha cooked at medium. The market table has an assortment of different vegetables and fruits; I personally only get white rice to net out the flavor of the meat with some cantaloupe for the end. Since the start of the pandemic, Fogo now has a delivery and take-out service, which I&apos;ve grown fond of - there used to be a $50 minimum delivery through the website, which has increased to $75 over the last couple of months. But, the restaurant is now on Ubereats at a relatively reasonable price. They offer specific cooked meat combinations (1 or 2 meats + sides); you&apos;re not able to get that slicing experience, but it tastes just as good!

Service at Fogo has always been top notch - the individuals serving the meat come quickly here, especially compared to those at Chima. I also happen to be a big fan of the caramelized banana, and one of the servers always brings my table extra when I come. I would definitely recommend this place for any meat lovers!"
5,"Went for a date night and was really happy with the service. Despite being outside because of COVID restrictions, the staff was accommodating and efficient. Chef Michael was magnificent and served the best grilled cheese cubes! He was a doll. Would 100% go back."
4,"First time dining in this place. The meat was ok, I was not impressed, the &quot;market&quot;  had interesting plate to try and very tasty. I had the churrasco experience, it was good but it will be better if they keep stoping by your table even though you already try all the meats offered. 

What I mean is, that after you seat down they start coming pretty fast to your table offering meats like for 20min meat after meat and after that time they stop going to your table, and then you have to start calling them and requesting the meats if you want to repeat. 
Which for me I found I little bit uncomfortable. 

Drinks I try the bloody orange Manhattan it was ok, the caparina was better. For dessert , the tres leche was awesome I loved it. 

Overall it was good not all the meat were good, I can say only 3 meats weren&apos;t that good but it was ok. I&apos;m sorry I forgot the names of the meats, with the mask is hard to hear them when they pronounce the name of the meat cut. The ones wrapped in bacon were tooo salty ! There were one with Parmesan that one was the bomb. 

COVID, wearing mask and glove when in the market table, no mask at your table when eating, tables were apart from each other, all the waiters had mask and face covers. 

The place look very nice, elegant. 

Diner for two, the churrasco experience ,four drinks, 3 alcoholics and one soft, dessert for one 225$ with tip included."
3,"Honestly wasn&apos;t even bad, I just reviewed it lower because of how expensive it was for what I got. I tried just about every meat there and here is the ranking: 

Picanha
Beef rib 
Lamb
Bacon steak
Garlic steak
Ribeye
Bottom sirloin 
Tenderloin
Pork parm
Top sirloin 
Ny

I think overall a lot of them are not that flavorful. The bacon steak was a great way to add some umami to the beef, but it was salty so I took off the bacon. Lamb is gamey so make sure you like that taste before you get it. Chocolate lava cake was good, creme brûlée was a bit too saccharine, guava cream was refreshing, and cheesecakes were very average. Overall wasn&apos;t a life changing experience, just a decent meal with a huge price tag."
4,"First experience at this restaurant. Beautiful building with high ceilings and chandeliers. Was greeted immediately by a server. Received drinks after about 10 minutes after ordering and had an attentive serve despite busy lunchtime. I liked the ginger martini, but the Manhattan cocktail is very very good. Get the lamb, it&apos;s delicious and seasoned to perfection. The garlic steak was yummy as well. After an hour and half, it was noticeable that we were not being offered meats, I think other tables nearby as well, due to the table time limits. Greta dessert though!"
3,"I visited Fogo for indoor dining and have mixed feelings about it. The waiters all wore masks and face shields. It was really hard to hear some of the them due to that so I wish they spoke up. 

Due to covid, the salad bar isn&apos;t self serve which makes sense. Instead, there&apos;s a worker who will walk with you around the table and will put the food on your plate. I was probably disappointed the most at the salad bar because the waiter had her mask under her nose the entire time. She also didn&apos;t seem to talk and would point to the food as we went around the salad bar to see if that&apos;s what I wanted. I had to speak really loud for her to understand me and it was a little bit frustrating that she kept pointing to the food instead of asking what I wanted. 

I decided to order an entree instead of doing the full experience because I wasn&apos;t that hungry. I got the Pan-Seared Salmon with asparagus and it was good but nothing memorable. 

Lastly, the interior is beautiful, clean and elegant. It was much bigger than I thought and all the tables were 6 feet apart. However, the restroom didn&apos;t match that elegant feel. 

I definitely want to visit Fogo again and try the full meat experience but I think I&apos;ll wait until COVID is behind us."
5,"We like a lot hanging out. From the first time we visited here while we were hanging out, now its our one of favorite spots to visit once in a week at least, a good place to enjoy and have fun with friends and also have some good foods, the staff the atmosphere, and everything else was really great and makes us to feel much better and enjoy more than enough. 

Totally recommended"
1,"Ok this isn&apos;t a revenge review and this is based on one DoorDash delivered dinner. It was expensive and terrible. I ordered my meat rare it wasn&apos;t even close. The meat (sirloin by the pound) was poor quality maybe because it was overcooked? I ordered two vegetables with it and they were both freezing cold, there is no excuse for that. The packaging was okay. I hope my experience was exceptional. I doubt it."
1,"This restaurant is not social distancing at all!!!! tables are super close together!!!! I swear if I get COVID, I&apos;m blaming this restaurant....i&apos;m pisssed an uncomfortable"
1,"If you are willing to give indoor dining a try, this is NOT the place! Valentine&apos;s Day and making money seemed to be the only priority. Maybe the restaurant is better if you&apos;re not going on a holiday because you will be in a room with 100 people unmasked. I do not understand Philly, from an out-of-state perspective because there are many good restaurants in the area that are doing no indoor dining whatsoever. Fogo de Chao seems to be breaking some rules here. Be careful, I&apos;m sure this restaurant is great if you are going on a regular day."
3,"I made a reservation during restaurant week for a birthday and was told WHEN WE ARRIVED that they were not participating in restaurant week. Bummer.

Still, we sat down and planned to enjoy dinner. Before we could order drinks, we are bombarded with different cuts of meats and some selections from the salad bar. (Due to COVID, you are not able to go to the salad bar on your own.) We felt extremely rushed to consume our food.

Tables were 6 ft apart and servers were all wearing masks and face shields - felt safe to dine during COVID however, we could not hear a word they were saying. 

A manager walked by to ask how we were doing, so we placed our order for drinks with her. A Coke, a glass of wine and a cocktail took about 15 minutes to arrive. By this time we are already stuffed with salty meat and we were ready for our drinks. 

The ribeye, lamb and pichana were the freshest and tastiest meat they offered. The chicken, pork, and filet were pretty dry and salty. We had the new york cheesecake for dessert -- it had a creamy texture, great taste (definitely recommend). 

Our server was nice, however it seemed he was new and inexperienced. 

Overall, the service took too long for the drinks/dessert and the meats weren&apos;t great... The bill did arrive quickly though (although we didn&apos;t ask for it yet). This is not our first time here and we remember the quality of meats to be better. 

Wouldn&apos;t recommend if you&apos;re going for date night or want to catch up with friends... There is someone coming by every 30 seconds interrupting your conversations! Also wouldn&apos;t recommend if they&apos;re not participating in restaurant week."
5,First time dining at this restaurant and we really had a great experience. Chef Michael was actually the one who made sure we were well take care of. Saying he was great would be a understatement! The food was great! Chef Michael set the bar very high with his great customer service! Hope to come back soon and enjoy the food and service!!!!
5,The food and service were fantastic. Chef Michael brought us various specials. Our favorite was the Parmesan pork. Sitting outside on the street was actually very nice if you don&apos;t mind the noise from the city. It was good to see people going by having a good time on the pub crawl bikes.
4,"Food &amp; Drinks: 4.5 Out of 5
Beautiful cuts of meat cooked well. Although some cuts were perfectly seasoned and others were overly seasoned(ie overpowering garlic). Fogo has a fantastic selection for their salad bar. Also their Brazilian cocktails are amazing! All three flavors (passion fruit, strawberry, &amp; coconut) are perfectly balanced with the Brazilian rum. 

Environment: 4 Out of 5
Came here for an educational dinner. The rooms are a bit tight when you have a moderate size group. However, when you leave the room into the general dining area it has a great set up and ambiance.

Service: 4.25 Out of 5
Our servers were on point with drinks and bread. I would only comment on the gauchos&apos; frequency to our room. I asked for the beef tenderloin twice but they never came even though I was promised it would come. 

Overall: 4.25 Out of 5
I&apos;ve been to this location twice for an informational dinner. Both times I had great experience overall. A restaurant you have to try once in your"
3,"I&apos;ve been to this location twice and the first time was last year during the holidays and everything was great! My last visit wasn&apos;t as pleasant as the first because we felt rushed out after being there for about an hour but the food didn&apos;t even hit our table until we were there for over 20 minutes. Drinks stopped coming, the staff carrying the meats stopped coming to our table and we were asked continuously if we were finished and ready to leave. 

I would have been more understanding if the place was busy but we got there as soon as dinner services opened and we counted 6 tables being occupied in the dining room."
5,"Thank you, thank you, thank you!!! We came into Fogo for a birthday celebration, but little did we know we would be given one of the most amazing experiences of our lives. Our server, Any (yes, with an N!), was the best! She was so sweet and happy, and gave us the care and attention a guest deserves. Chef Michael was exquisite and made us feel like old friends over for dinner. Chef, you filled our stomachs with the most delicious food and we cannot wait to come back. Thank you staff, for allowing us to come in as your last table and enjoy your wonderful atmosphere. And thank you for working through these hard times!! We appreciate your high spirits and warm hospitality. We will see you next time :D"
5,"Came here tonight with my husband for our anniversary and we were absolutely delighted with both the food and service. It was my husband&apos;s first time here, and he loves meat, so he was extremely pleased with the variety, quality, and flavor of everything presented to us. For me, the highlight of the night surprisingly were the ribs. They were seasoned perfectly and super juicy. Also, the cheese that was grilled and served with malagueta honey was a revelation -- OMG. My caipirinha was so excellent that I ordered another. It was perfectly tart and just the right amount of sweet. 

My biggest advice would be that even if you&apos;re starving, start slow -- I always make the mistake of saying yes to everything in the beginning and by 20 minutes in I&apos;m so full that I can&apos;t enjoy much else, lol. The meat will always be there, but it&apos;s more pleasurable to eat slower.

Our waitress was very attentive and sweet (I thought we might be forgotten about since we were seated at a table way in the back), and she even gifted us a flan for our anniversary. Such a lovely touch. 

Thank you, Fogo team! You made our night such a wonderful experience."
5,"This place is great! They have a few less options than Chima does, but the food here is remarkable. The Gauchos are actually all Brazilian, which is wonderful and authentic! The staff is extremely friendly and attentive. 
My favorite time to come here is during Restaurant Week, in particular, because you can get soooo much food for half the price! Even without the discount, however, the food is well worth it! The meat is always perfectly cooked, and the salad bar is always fresh! What&apos;s not to like?"
5,"Came here for restaurant week last night and was not disappointed!! We tried every type of meat and everything was exquisite. The chefs serving meat came around quickly (maybe too quickly) and I had 4 different slices on my plate within 10 minutes. I definitely recommend asking for medium rare. They also have a large cold bar serving tons of different sides from salad to soup to deli meats and cheeses, but we didn&apos;t take too much from there since we wanted to save room for the main course. 
All of our servers were very attentive and friendly. They made sure the guy serving the fried cheese came over to our table since it&apos;s usually hard to snag otherwise. 

Would definitely recommend this place for a different dining experience!!"
