4,"Delicious spot right on south street. I think I&apos;m going to make it a goal of mine to try every cheese steak in Philadelphia. I&apos;m not sure what was ordered but it was good. Would I say it&apos;s the best? Personally no, but it&apos;s high up there on the list. 

Came here during covid times and ordering was socially distanced, which is great. However, they should go cashless! Dealing with less money means dealing with less bacteria!"
4,"Gotta have Philly cheese in Philadelphia right?

I googled (not sure why I didn&apos;t search on Yelp) Philly cheese near me and this place came up on my search as most reviewed place in the area.

They currently offer take out only.

I asked them to give me whoever everyone orders the most. They asked me if I wanted onions or mushrooms, I asked them add if that&apos;s how most people eat. 

Staff there was friendly with great smile.

Since I didn&apos;t know where I can go to eat, I ended up walking back to the independence national park area where I knew they had plenty of benches to sit down.

It was a bit of walk, by the time I got to the park and ready to eat, bread was very soggy and I didn&apos;t have enough napkins to keep my hands clean. 

Sandwich itself was a full of flavor. A half was enough was it was very filling.  I needed to walk around more to help me settle my stomach.

I would like to come back when indoor dining opens and enjoy their food right after they prepare it."
4,"Ooooh, don&apos;t mind me. I&apos;ve been drankin&apos;. It&apos;s Friday night. During quarantine. And I&apos;m writing this review while tipsy. During quarantine. And guess what?! I&apos;m STILL gonna write it. During quarantine. Because... it&apos;s Friday night. During quarantine. So THERE. Ha!

Tonight I was craving for a steak. Unfortunately, many of the steak spots in my area aren&apos;t open for sit down, and the waits for takeout are just too long for me to bare right now. So for a split second... I thought about getting a cheesesteak. And then I thought about Jim&apos;s, and I just had to quickly change my mind. You see, I live in the great state of Cali. The problem with this is that the cheesesteaks here are nowhere near as delicious as the one that I had at Jim&apos;s. Nowhere NEAR it. I wasn&apos;t about to disappoint myself by getting a below second rate cheesesteak from a chain that isn&apos;t even all that great. 

The saying is true; once you&apos;ve had a Philly cheesesteak from PHILLY bay-baaaaay... you will never look at a cheesesteak the same way ever again. Had my first real Philly cheesesteak at Jim&apos;s South Street and hunty; they did not disappoint. Didn&apos;t receive the warmest welcome from the staff when I stepped into that joint, but you gotta realize the sitch&apos; right quick. It was late night, and most of the peeps who creep here in the late hours are probably drunk as hell. You gotta have thick skin to deal with the drunkards, so I understand. 

It&apos;s pretty simple; You walk in, look at the menu board (if you have to), choose what you want and tell them at the counter. Then, walk down and pay at the register. You&apos;ll wait for your food and then you can take it upstairs to eat it if you wanna dine in. Since it was my first time getting a real Philly cheesesteak, I had to go with the original. Yuuup. Ya girl got that good ol&apos; Philly Phil sammich! Sh*t was the f*ck GOODT. Sorry to be so vulgar but it truly was. 

Just imagine this beautifully soft roll of bread, filled with most tender, juicy thin slices of steak, sandwiched between cheese so melted that it practically turns into strings when you pull the sandwich halves apart. And all of that tasty juice and oil dripping in pure glory. So, normally I wouldn&apos;t be a fan of the messy mess. I&apos;m light weight bougie wit it (don&apos;t you dare judge). I just hate gettin&apos; sh*t all over my mouth, hands, and clothes, especially grease. BUT... I just couldn&apos;t get enough of it here. Couldn&apos;t get ENOUGH. Gimme da grease puh-lease! Give it TO me. 

Not only was this cheesesteak juicy as all hell, but it was meatier than life itself. Flavored for the GAWDS. Givin&apos; me all of this extra life that I didn&apos;t even know that I needed. Yes, I loved it. And yes, I want some more... damnit. Heavenly is what I&apos;ll call it. How I&apos;ll describe it. Yeah... that part. 

If you eat upstairs, they have this &quot;guard&quot; who just sits there and watches you while you eat. A little annoying, slightly creepy, and down right uncomf, but I understand why they do it. Some of these damn peeps be actin&apos; REAL cray cray. You&apos;ll have a nice little view of South street if you choose to sit by the window. The &quot;guard&quot; also cleans the tables once people leave. I guess homeboy ain&apos;t so bad after all.

More than the cheesesteak though, I&apos;ve gotta say, I truly enjoyed chatting it up with the staff. There was one older gentleman, didn&apos;t get his name. He was so hospitable. He heard my &quot;accent&quot; (I guess us Californians really do stand out, huh?!) and asked me where I was from. We instantly struck up a convo after that and he was so warm and welcoming toward me. That really made my night, especially since it was my first time there. 

Lawd. What I would give to have another one of dem cheesesteaks right about now. So damn good. If you&apos;re there right now, just make like Nike and DO IT. Have yourself a merry little cheesesteak and take full advantage of the drip. The grease drip that is. It&apos;s truly sensational. And you will love it. I can&apos;t wait for the day that I&apos;ll return to be reunited with that Philly cheesesteak again."

3,"I have mixed reviews for Jim&apos;s. 

I feel like the hoagie was soooo darn tasty but the cheesesteak needed more flavor. 

The Italian special with prosciutto was delicious. The lunch meat was fresh, condiments evenly distributed, and veggies crisp. Each bite was a delight. 

The cheesesteaks(we ordered 3)  were a bit over dry and needed more juice and flavor. You shouldn&apos;t neeeeed ketchup or condiments but these were crying for it. 

Maybe I caught them a bad batch on the cheesesteak grill. Regardless, I&apos;m full and it&apos;s all good."
5,"Sex in the mouth.  Worth every cent.

Being from Arlington/DC, you really do need to drive a considerable distance to find a decent cheesesteak.  This place was absolutely worth the weekend trip.

If you find yourself in Philly, come here and grab a sandwich.  Bring cash and your appetite."
1,Dry as hell. Bland.  No seasoning on the meat. No juice.  No melted cheese.  Just terrible.  From a south Philly Italian this place is a joke and should stop coasting on their old rep and actually give a shit and make a good sandwich.  Trash.
5,"Officially my top three cheesesteak in Philly. Jim&apos;s is one of the bigger steaks in the city and it&apos;s definitely one of, if not the best.

The line nearly always runs around the corner of the restaurant, but we were lucky and caught a slow hour. 

The steak is a bit expensive as it runs a little over $12 including tax, but entirely worth it. I split half of it with my mom and it was completely filling. Also if you&apos;re feeling frisky, you can get a Lorenzo&apos;s slice of pizza and make it a Philly sandwich."
3,"I&apos;ve had this on my &quot;cheesesteaks to try&quot; list for a while, I&apos;m sad to say I was disappointed! It came to me as a highly recommended place for cheesesteaks.

It was really cool to watch the cook create the sandwich - he layered the bread with cheese (we got both American and whizz) then slapped it on top of some steak meat. For me, the steak was too finely chopped - it didn&apos;t give enough bite, kind of felt like I was eating ground beef. The meat was also not seasoned much - we had to add salt, which they loaded us up on like crazyyy. Also do people put ketchup on Philly&apos;s?! They gave us a months supply of that too! 

We got both a pepper cheesesteak with onions and whizz, which was just ok. Then also a pizza steak - which was also just ok. I&apos;ve previously really loved Abner&apos;s (University City) pizza steak, it comes with pepperoni which I really like. So overall, this place gets a 5/10 from me"
5,This place is a Hidden gem for tourists. We have tried other places for cheese steak but Jim is number one. The only thing is make sure you bring cash. We drove around looking for atms and it was so worth it!
4,Good ole Jim&apos;s. Have been coming here for years but have never actually left a review. Bottom line - it&apos;s a Top 3 cheesesteak in Philly. Wiz wit all day. Usually a pretty decent wait but they keep it moving. Anyone on a Philly cheesesteak tour needs to hit up Jim&apos;s real early!
4,"This is a great spot for cheese steaks while we were staying downtown. It was quick, professional, with Covid protocols. The steak was delicious and juicy. The roll was soft chewy and full of steak juices! The cheese I think personally could be more zesty. Overall it&apos;s a great sandwich."
4,"Came here based on a recommendation of a friend, and I&apos;ve gotta say it&apos;s pretty decent. A little bit better than your average philly cheese steak, but not mind blowing either. We ordered the cheese steak with provolone and a second with wiz. (The wiz was way better!!!)"
4,"As a new Philly resident, of course I had to try and find the eponymous cheesesteak that the city is known for. I came by Jim&apos;s as a friend was giving me a South St tour, and while I couldn&apos;t stop in, the smell of onions and bell peppers was enough for me to remind myself to come back the next weekend.

I&apos;m so glad I tried this place!! The line was long (it was a Saturday night), but took about ~30 min total to move through at a socially-distant pace. Once you were inside, ordering was super fast; I loved watching everyone hustling about behind the counter making everything (they are SO efficient)! I ordered a cheesesteak with Whiz cheese, and am totally glad I did. It works, in a weird but delicious way. The bread was soft, there was SO much meat, and the cheese got absorbed into it so it was delicious cheesy perfection. *chef&apos;s kiss* The only thing I&apos;d add is that it could have used some more seasoning? The saltiness was primarily from the cheese, but otherwise, I think the onions and beef were relatively unseasoned. 

If you&apos;re craving something sinfully delicious, this is the place to go for a solid cheesesteak!"
4,"Came to Jim&apos;s the other day to get a cheesesteak since Ishkabibble&apos;s was closed due to the current pandemic. 

To my surprise this place is pretty good! I&apos;m usually pretty close minded when it comes to what cheesteak places I go to. But I&apos;m glad I tried. 

The steak was seasoned well and they were very generous with the fried onions &amp; peppers. However, they were a lil stingy with the cheese whiz:/

And the customer service was not all that. Probably won&apos;t come"
5,"Best steak in Philly. I ate dozens of steaks in a few days and I found Jim&apos;s to be the best. The bread of the steak was fresh, meat was seasoned to perfection, and the peppers had good flavor. I&apos;ll be making many more trips to this restaurant. Top tier eats here!"
1,"While in town, I stopped by to grab a bite to eat. There was a long line and I assumed &quot;Well it&apos;s Philly, this must be where the good steak sandwiches are.&quot; I did a quick search on google and yelp and saw that they had an overwhelming amount of reviews. Combined with both websites over 9K reviews. Google reviewers had rated the establishment a 4.4, yelp reviewers had given it a 3 1/2 stars.  I should&apos;ve trusted my instincts when I saw the yelp score. :( 
But decided to give the place a try. Anyways, onto the real review of the food &amp; restaurant environment. 

I ordered a steak sandwich with provolone cheese  and American cheese, bell peppers, and mushrooms. 

As I watched the sandwich be prepared, all I could notice was how dirty the kitchen was. 

The meat in the sandwich was okay, however, the mushrooms taste as if they were from a can. It was so disappointing. I didn&apos;t finish the sandwich because the flavor was not there. 

Well, I learned my lesson. Always trust Yelp Reviews v Google Reviews. :&apos;)"
5,"Best Cheesesteaks by far.. I tried tourist friendly Pat&apos;s and Geno&apos;s and more local Ishkabibble&apos;s and this one.. and yes.. Tony Luke&apos;s was closed too early and also on the next day as well on Sunday as we were leaving to go back to Seattle..

this place&apos;s cheesesteak had premium, thinly sliced beef on a tender, soft hoagie and the cheese.. it had a queso feel to it.. indeed, this sandwich was very comforting and good!

good staff, great service

shout out to Mikey Chen for highlighting this on his video.. indeed a good one"
4,"Was in the Philly for the day and got a Jim&apos;s cheesesteaks for lunch. I had appointments at Penn all day and my boyfriend picked up cheesesteak. Got hot and whiz. I didn&apos;t think the hots were hot. Even a couple hours later it was still tender, juicy without being overly greasy. The bun was a little soggy in some parts and hard on others. I think it was because it sat for a while. My boyfriend got the same but with onions. He said it was amazing. Onion wasn&apos;t too over powering. I&apos;d want to try it again fresh but my boyfriend says that is now our cheesesteak spot so I&apos;m sure we will be back when in Philly."
2,"As a new resident to Philly I decided to finally try an authentic Philly cheesesteak. Unfortunately, it didn&apos;t wow me AT ALL. I had half a cheesesteak w/provolone and the other half with cheese whiz and American cheese. THANK GOD I added the whiz and cheese because without it the cheesesteak was so bland. I definitely have to go somewhere else and have another experience because this cheesesteak fell flat. I gave Jim&apos;s two stars for their COVID social distance capacity inside. I felt comfortable. Food...meh."
