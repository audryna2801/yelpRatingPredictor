5,"Let&apos;s get COVID out of the way...limited capacity seating indoors and heated outdoor seating. Staff are wearing masks. There was one pump bottle of sanitizer by the take-out pick-up table. My partner and I sat on the side of the space closest to the bar/kitchen area. I felt very distanced from the tables closest to us. Also, when you put your name down for a table you are given a head&apos;s up via text that you can only be at a table for 90 mins. QRC code menus.

Food time. Yes to all of it, LOL. I had their huevos rancheros dish, which came with perfectly cooked over easy eggs, chorizo (ground not in sausage form), refried black beans on top of crispy fried tortilla (if you think they look overdone in the pic, I&apos;d argue it was perfect because no pieces ever got soggy) and avocado.The entire thing is topped with a delicious chipotle style sauce and an additional sauce was on the side that I think is their hot sauce. ID DRINK IT--super flavorful. The dish comes with cotija cheese, which I didn&apos;t get because of dietary restrictions. I highly recommend this dish. It&apos;s filling and flavorful. You also get a side of well-seasoned breakfast potatoes. 

My partner got the Jersey sammy, which he was excited to try because he has never had pork roll. He said it tasted like seasoned fried bologna. He loved the entire dish, but at 6&apos;8 he wished he had more food. I think they skimped on his potatoes a bit. I shared.

We&apos;re eaters, so we split the nutty monkey crespelle, which was excellently composed. It&apos;s a hazelnut crepe with bananas and berries. It comes topped with homemade whipped cream, which I forgot to tell them to leave off. It&apos;s worth noting that I have a mild-severe dairy allergy (I won&apos;t die), so we scooped it off. I share this because even though I only ate the ends to be on the safe side, when we scooped it off it easily came up--it wasn&apos;t melting into the crepe. Seemed like very thick high quality whipped cream.

We had oat milk lattes that were also yummy. The staff including our server were polite and efficient.

Love the venue and the neighborhood vibe. I would definitely go back and try other dishes, but I would even get the huevos again because it was just that good."
5,"How have I never been here before after 4 years of living in center city?? I came back to Philly to visit my friend a few weeks ago and she suggested Cafe Lift for brunch since it was just a few blocks away. We came around 9-10 in a Sunday morning and it was absolutely wonderful! They had heated covered and in covered outdoor seating and absolutely no wait when we arrived. Both the mushroom toast and the breakfast burrito were delicious - rich and flavorful. If I had to pick though - the mushroom toast wins. 

Very covid friendly, 4.5+++ yelps! Can&apos;t wait to go back!"
5,"I love cafe lift! This is my first time at the city location, I used to go to the bar with location.  The food, coffee, and prices were amazing. The only downside of this location given the covid situation is that since the seating is outdoors, the traffic gets pretty noisy. 

I got the cannoli French toast. Amazing. It&apos;s crispy on the edges and soft in the center. It&apos;s not suuuuper sweet in my opinion, I thought it was balanced perfectly. Would definitely go here again!"
4,"This place. Whoa!

In the heart of downtown philly, location is very much in the cut, so you kinda have to look for it. 

The ambience isn&apos;t that ascetically pleasing, nor is the customer service, but what they lack in service they make up for in food. 

Everything that I ate this morning just was full of savory flavors that would make your mouth water. 

I ordered the huevos rancheros, a blueberry pancake, a side of pork bacon.

Excellent breakfast and brunch spot. Had it it not been for the food, I&apos;m not sure I would have returned to this establishment, but if you&apos;re ever in philly, and staying near by....go here! You won&apos;t be disappointed with the food!"
4,"Found this gem and I&apos;m so glad I decided to check them out . They do have indoor seating and have social distancing in place as well as sanitizer upon entering. The food is absolutely delicious, super fresh and full of flavor. Ordered the huevos rancheros ( with no meat) a side order of the blueberry pancake, side of bacon , and iced chai latte and a cappuccino. Portions are generous and filling , our server was friendly and attentive. If I&apos;m ever back in town I&apos;ll be back !"
5,"Cafe Lift is a very cozy and friendly restaurant. I love the staff and the atmosphere. They have plenty of seating and is perfectly located near the rail line park and parking lots. Sitting near the underpass with brown stone walls will make your morning or afternoon a delightful one. Now the food!! Made very well and to me I feel like I didn&apos;t wait long. I have French toast, which was amazing. I didn&apos;t need syrup or whipped cream. The home made whipped cream was just an added bonus! Also tried the eggs Benedict on an English muffin with potatoes!! Wow, thank you for the great experience! Follow me @sebbybelly local guide on Instagram."
5,"Love love love 
Great food, great service
They have tons of tables outside with heatera"
5,"Coffee and food was great and our server was awesome. Typically, I would get something off of the breakfast menu, but today I went with the Cubano sandwhich, and it did not disappoint."
4,"Enjoyed delivery from cafe lift on a Sunday morning. Got pancakes which were fantastic, great texture. Breakfast burrito which was average, it&apos;s pretty much an omelet wrapped up in a tortilla and kinda gets soggy probably as a result of take out. The French toast was very heavy which if you want thick cut French toast it&apos;ll be great, but you&apos;ll probably need a coffee with it. Overall a nice place to grab brunch."
4,"This is one of my go to spots for brunch in Philly. I went on a Saturday morning before 11 am and we were seated right away. I usually get the cannoli French toast which I decided to get again. I also got a side of the turkey bacon. The French toast was cooked perfectly and had crispy edges with a soft interior, but it did not taste as good as how I remembered it. Yet I still enjoyed all the flavors. The presentation wasn&apos;t the best. The side of turkey bacon was not good, it tasted like store bought lunch meat.
My friend got the pumpkin French toast special with a side of the fennel sausage. She enjoyed her meal. The fennel sausage was very good too, packed full of flavor."
4,"Very cute place, great food, however, 4 stars because staff were not wearing masks at all times and we sat next to a window with a cord running through it - it was open and it was 20 degrees outside - chilly! Coffee was lukewarm. Food was good though, I wouldn&apos;t be against trying it again someday, maybe in the summer next time!"
5,"First time trying Cafe Lift now that Philly is allowing indoor dining! The way they take their safety measures is very thorough, no one sat next to each other and the way the restaurant seating was arranged was so that no one is directly behind another party. They utilized QR scanning for the virtual menu.

As for my dining experience, I was excited to see that the place was BYOB-  noted for next time! I went with a friend and I ordered the Lemon Pancakes with a side of sausage(4). She ended up getting the Huevos Rancheros(HR)  with a side of fruit (one cut banana, bluerberries, and strawberry).  We ended up sharing our dishes and here is my take:

The Huevos Rancheros tortilla on the bottom was nice and CRISPY!! which added an element of texture to the dish which I thought was awesome! The HR held up and was not soggy even after 15 minutes of switching back and forth from fruit to sausage. The HR came with a side of their home made spicy sauce which was predominantly pepper and honey which tasted great with their home fries as part of the HR dish.

The lemon pancakes were nice and fluffy! It comes with 3 pancakes, powdered sugar, cut strawberry for garnish, home made whip cream and honey. Personally, I thought the  honey took away from the lemon flavor. The strawberry, piece of lemon pancake and whip cream was *chefs kiss*. 

The portion sizes are perfect for one person. I would&apos;ve easily crushed the three pancakes though I went ham on the sausages (4). 

Would go here again :)"
4,"So fast tracking all the boring stuff, like place was covid safe, everyone had masks on, and service was fantastic. So the breakfast here was amazing!!! The quantity of the dishes were huge! The Challah French Toast was fantastic. The dish had Challah bread that was dredged in like  cinnamon vanilla and topped with fresh seasonal fruit, served with homemade whipped cream and maple syrup.
You get four huge healthy pieces with whipped cream and seasonal fruits! The mixed combination was very delightful. Along with the french toast, we had a side of home potatoes that were crisp on the outside and soft on the inside! Next, we had a side of Philadelphia sausage that was cooked to perfection. Last, i had the coconut ginger matcha latte. This drink was just okay... the matcha totally overpowered the ginger and the coconut, which made the drink taste very dry. I couldn&apos;t taste the ginger, honey, or the candies ginger. Not saying that the drink was bad, just saying the drink was nit necessary my cup of tea. But, overall, the vibe is very trendy chic and laid back perfect place to spend a morning enjoying great food."
5,"Can&apos;t believe it&apos;s been a year and we&apos;ve just found this place! Fast service with great food options. The pictures don&apos;t do justice for the mouth watering flavors available for each dish. This is by far one of the best brunch spots I&apos;ve ever been to! I would recommend it in a heart beat to anyone looking for delectable and diverse brunch flavors and options, great ambience, all with the flexibility of time and fast service (literally 5-7min to make all dishes!)."
4,"I came to this place because my friend made a good recommendation to me. All staff was wearing masks and seating was outside. We were seated partially on the street, which is not the most ideal, but for a nice brunch, it was okay.
I noticed that the menu was extremely small. With my recent wheat and sesame allergies, I was limited. The waitress was good to note my allergies. I got the egg Florentine without any breads. The egg was poached to perfection! And they added veggies to my dish, which were delicious. The food overall was well cooked and I would come here again for the food. 
As for drinks, I was disappointed by my dirty chai. It was my first time having dirty chai and thought it would taste sweeter. I could not pin point exactly what the flavor was, but I did not enjoy it.
Overall, this is a small place with delicious food, but drinks not so much. If anyone had a better experience with drinks here please give me suggestions."
4,Omgns!!! My daughter just tipped my tastebuds with this amazing Lift Burger. DELICIOUS!!!! Everything was super tasty. She  also raved about her brunch there today. See you all sooner than later.
4,In Philly this truly was the best breakfast! We had it every morning we were in town. The lavender London fog was so delish! It&apos;s something I try and recreate now at home often. If you&apos;re into cannoli and french toast the cannoli French toast is a MUST! I loved the outdoor set up because of covid. We never had to step inside the restaurant.
1,"We are from out of town, walked in just two of us wanting to eat and was told they were not taking anymore names.  The place doesn&apos;t close until 3 and we arrived at 12.  I am confused of what that really means, there were tables inside and outside and for a place that doesnt take reservations I am sure they could have taken my husband and I in.  If they were at capacity due to COVID okay, say that, because whatever she said was rude and out of pocket.  I&apos;m not sure why she even felt she could say that to anyone, this is Philadelphia not Beverly Hills."
5,"We have been ordering brunch like crazy during COVID (because I just can&apos;t face making breakfast 7 days a week!), and I have no idea why it took us so long to order from Lift! I was craving huevos rancheros, and my partner was hooked on the idea of an eggs benedict with kraut and kielbasa... and neither of us was disappointed. Both of our breakfasts were delicious &amp; unusual, and there were more things on the menu that looked amazing!"
5,"This spot was absolutely unreal. I went with two friends and it was the perfect weekend brunch spot. Unfortunately cafe lift does not take reservations but the 90 min wait was well worth it. The food was amazing (i recommend the eggs Benedict and potatoes) and the BYOB was awesome for mimosas. In terms of covid, they&apos;ve done a great job with outdoor seating (in an old container with heaters) , although it was still pretty chilly. All in all a fantastic spot, will be back again soon (:"
