5,"We had the BEST here a few weeks ago, and Abe Fisher is now officially one of our favorite restaurants in Philly. I didn&apos;t really know what to expect of a Jewish-American cuisine, but I absolutely loved every bite of my dinner! I came to the restaurant to enjoy outdoor dining, but the restaurant offers take-out too. Service is impeccable, as you would expect in a restaurant like this. 

I took my husband to this restaurant to celebrate his last day of work and was so excited for our meal! What better way to begin our meal than to receive complimentary drinks (non-alcoholic) from the restaurant to toast to a successful career and a new chapter?! The drinks were so refreshing! By the way, sparkling water is complimentary, so we enjoyed that with the rest of our dinner.

The restaurant offers a $42 pp prix fixe menu (choose among 3 entree options) or a $50 pp special prix fixe menu. We got the $50 pp prix fixe menu that included the following:

- Breads &amp; Spreads (The toasted rye bread and the Borscht Tartare were especially delicious)
- Appetizers: Potato Latke and Charred Zucchini
- Montreal Smoked Short Ribs (SO juicy, smoky, and tender)
- Dessert: Blueberry Quark Cake and Vanilla Custard 

You really can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu here. No matter how much we ate, we still ended up with a ton of leftovers to take home. Reheating the short ribs at home tasted just as good! We can&apos;t wait to return very, very soon!"
5,"Amazing Jewish foods and services! The waiter overheard us debating between Borscht tartare or Matzoh ball soup for appetizer so brought both out for us (one on the house). Been such a long time we haven&apos;t been able to go out for date night due to covid, and Abe Fisher reminded us why we miss it so much. Latke fries was must have. My husband got Montreal smoked short ribs and it was worth writing home to mom. Four seasons cocktail was my favorite drink here and the bar was able to dial back on the sweetness, which I appreciate. Would recommend and will come back soon."
5,Got the &quot;Dinner at Home&quot; for a special meal -- amazing food and far exceeded expectations! Wish that pick up food from other restaurants could be as good.
5,"One of the best meals I&apos;ve had in Philly! They currently have a prix fixe menu which is well worth the price. We got the Lamb Tzimmes and short ribs, along with matzo soup and chicken liver mousse as appetizers. Our waitress also threw in a full order of complimentary latke fries. Between all this food and the challah rolls, I was beyond stuffed by the end of the meal. The short ribs were a good portion size and came with bread, pickles, and sauces for constructing into a sandwich. The lamb was in the form of a thick stew and the prunes added a really nice flavor.

Overall, very impressed. Good food, good service, and nice, strong heat lamps for outdoor dining!"
5,"Hands down the best dining experience I have ever had. 

I walk past Abe Fisher from my apartment daily and I had no idea what it was all about. 

When I let a friend visiting make our reservations, I was excited to finally try it.

First impressions of the fixed, preset October menu were: 1) &quot;I&apos;m f***ed for options ordering, being gluten and dairy-free at this restaurant&quot; and 2) &quot;This is gonna be pricey...&quot;

Both judgements were completely and utterly wrong. 

1) The wait staff initially asked if there were any allergies at the table and totally blew me away with their allergen-friendly options!!!!!! My friend sampled all my dishes and ended up LOVING the gf and df options even more than the regular. They were amazing. 

2) The preset, fixed price did not do our meal justice. It was worth every penny and way more. The food was so high quality but the service could not have been beat. 

The entire staff from the host to the food runners, the waiter, etc. were so genuine, nice and helpful. My friend and I could not have had a better time or imagined a better dining experience. Seriously. It was such a treat and I will be back for more!"
5,"The Montreal Short Rib is top notch.  However the other food is just as tasty.  The Challah bread and spread was very good, the spread had a nice dill flavor.  I had the lacinato kale  salad and it was great, my girlfriend had the chicken liver mousse which was really good as well.

The desserts were outstanding both the custard and the cake.  Abe Fisher is a must if you&apos;re in Philadelphia."
5,"Abe Fisher is offering $42pp or $60pp prix fixe menus where you can choose an app, entree, and dessert, along with rolls &amp; spreads. It&apos;s honestly a steal for the food quality and experience.

All of the dishes were hits. I loved the brisket, squash dumplings, and chocolate chip coffee cake. My favorite though was the Montreal smoked short ribs - the marbled meat was simultaneously juicy and fatty, melted in your mouth, and will make you wanting more. Definitely has made it to my top favorite restaurants in Philly and would highly recommend!"
5,"The best Salmon I&apos;ve ever had! 
The Matzoh ball soup is delicious and the latke fries was amazing!"
4,"Was excited to try this spin on modern Jewish cuisine in Philly. It&apos;s a creative idea that has rarely been done. I came during restaurant week so took advantage of the great $35 pre-fixe option available. There was also a pricier $60 option for the montreal smoked short ribs. Tables were spaced out appropriately during COVID times although we ended up being seated quite far away and I would have liked being closer to the actual restaurant. 

For the food, we started with the breads &amp; spreads. This was awesome! the challah was fantastic and each spread was so unique and clever. It actually might have been the biggest highlight of the meal. For apps we tried the potato latke and the salmon crudo. The latke was great!! Wonderfully crispy with yummy peach jam. The salmon crudo was less impressive - perhaps because it was restaurant week, but it was served as teeny tiny cubes of cured salmon with apple that left me wanting. As for the main, we both tried the salt-baked brisket. Now I really wanted to love this, but we each got one piece that was overcooked and one piece that was very good and fatty. I just wish it was more even quality. Finally, we tried the Mike&apos;s coffee cake and the smoked maple custard. Now both of these were great. I especially thought the custard had an interesting and distinctive flavor. 

Overall, I thought Abe Fisher had a very special take on Jewish cuisine and did a good job Americanizing it will keeping the most unique elements and staple dishes. There&apos;s room for improvement but a fun experience overall."
5,"A wonderful restaurant experience through and through :)

I had been wanting to come here for a long time given the positive reviews from friends and online sources alike. I can confirm that it exceeded all my high expectations and I had a lovely evening.

The service was phenomenal all around. They offered complimentary champagne for celebratory occasions, and were always wonderfully attentive and friendly. We ordered the duck tasting menu, which was delicious and filling. I generally really enjoy the design of menus at places like Abe Fisher, where we&apos;re meant to share multiple small dishes together so that we can try a lot of options. I particularly loved the more unique elements of the meal, like the chicken liver mousse and pumpernickel croutons. The ambiance was upscale and intimate, and perfect for great conversation.

Thanks Abe Fisher for one of my best eating out experiences - I was very impressed!"
5,"Wow! What a fantastic meal. One of my favorites in Philly. Abe Fisher serves elevated jewish cuisine and I was excited to see what they had to offer. They recently opened for outdoor dining and the seats were perfectly spaced on a fairly quiet street.

They are offering their prix fixe menu, one with Short ribs for two and another where you choose your entrees. 

Starters: First they offer complimentary sparkling or still. Right off of the bat I&apos;m impressed, I love sparkling water. I also partake in a cocktail, the &quot;Singles Going Steady&quot; which was strong and delicious. We are then given the Breads and Spreads dish. This comes with The butteriest Challah, Thick Marble Rye, and Crisps. All of the bread was warm and phenomenal, it&apos;s hard not to fill up on it. It came with Salmon Mousse, Chicken Liver Mousse, Pickled Veggies, and White Beet Dish. All were fantastic. This was my first time having salmon mousse and it was perfection. I&apos;ve also had many chicken liver pate&apos;s and terrines and this one truly takes the cake. I usually don&apos;t prefer beets, but they made me a believer.

First Course: We chose the Potato Latkes with House Gravlax and the Tomato Caesar. I am still dreaming about that Latke, and the House Gravlax was thick and not too salty which is my usual gripe with smoked salmon. Let&apos;s not forget the Tomato Caesar, it had a bit of Frisee, but the fresh tomatoes were the star. That mushroom Caesar was to die for. Here they go again with more bread, those warm croutons were delicious.

At this point I&apos;m pretty full, but I wasn&apos;t going down without a fight. 

Entrees: I didn&apos;t realize both parties had to get ribs or no one could, and since my wife is a pescatarian I went with the next best thing, Brisket. Well, I didn&apos;t miss a beat because that was some of the best brisket I&apos;ve had in my life. A slight crisp to the outer layer, just the right amount of fat and meat, it was so tender and the sauce was outstanding. This is a must! My wife got the Chicken under a brick, and this was cooked perfectly and was large. Both the white and dark meat were juicy and well seasoned. A light sauce would have been nice, but that&apos;s just nitpicking.

Desserts: The offered both the Blueberry Quark Cake and the Vanilla Custard. This was my first time having Quark cake and it reminded me of pound cake. Delicious! The Custard was creamy and paired well with the tart cherries, but didn&apos;t stand a chance next to that cake.

Overall: Every dish was fantastic! I would take anyone here in a heartbeat. And the price is so cheap for the quality and quantity! 42 or 50 per person, are you kidding?!?! 

Breads and Spreads (Salmon Mousse, Chicken Liver) 5/5
Tomato Caesar 5/5
Potato Latke with House Gravlax 5/5
Chicken 5/5
Brisket 5/5
Blueberry Cake 5/5
Vanilla Custard 4/5"
5,"Spectacular culinary experience.  We sat down for dinner on our first night in Philly.  Quiet street proximate to the City Hall, alfresco dining that felt European despite C19 overhang.  We ordered the short rib (pictured), which turned out exquisite.  Proper portion (my husband and I couldn&apos;t finish), accompanied by a bread basket and pickled cucumbers.   I enjoyed the plum cake for dessert: deep in flavor, buttery, and topped off with non-sweet whipped cream.  Yum!  Our waitress offered witty commentary in addition to prompt service.  Beautiful night."
5,"Truly amazing!  We do love short rib everywhere we order it but the one here is exceptional.  It melted in our mouths and was perfectly seasoned.  Trust the short rib connoisseurs!!!  The spreads were great, appetizers fine (only okay!), and well we ate too much of the main courses to try the desserts (we took them to go).  Cocktails were nice and balanced.

Insider&apos;s Tip: The waitress indicated the whole table doesn&apos;t need to order the short rib.  Go ahead and mix &apos;n match!   We stuck with the short rib tho!"
5,"Just left less than an hour ago and I&apos;m already thinking about the next time I will make the journey to Philly to dine here. You will leave extremely satisfied and full. From the get-go you will immediately understand why Solomonov is the celebrated restaurateur that he is.

The meal was terrific. To begin, the breads, spreads, and all the starters were delightful. A standout was definitely the house baked breads. Simply divine. I also loved the timing of the starters. They were spread apart with a few minutes in between so that you could really enjoy each dish.

Moving on to the entrees, I think the Montreal style short ribs is top three best dishes I&apos;ve had this year. The rye bread was expertly baked and all three sauces were incredible. The duck three ways was great and I loved the &quot;Chinese&quot; inspiration along with the pretzel bao buns. (Definitely go with the large format tasting menu - either the duck or the short ribs. We were lucky enough to try both. If you&apos;re only getting one, go with the short ribs.)

The cocktails were amazing and perfectly strong. The waiting room was as beautiful as it was delicious. Also, for an additional $30, definitely get the wine pairing with your meal. It&apos;s a fantastic opportunity to try exotic wines you wouldn&apos;t ordinarily order.

Since we were a party of four, we were fortunate enough to try all four desserts. The egg cream was incredible and extremely memorable. The specks of bacon were so good that even sweet and salty haters would enjoy it. My favorite was the quark pana cotta by a small margin. All the desserts were terrific, and it&apos;s evident the pastry chef is a true talent.

Thank you to the amazing waitstaff at Abe Fisher for their patience and passion. I can&apos;t wait to come back again. It was a wonderful way to celebrate the end of a year."
4,"Perfect outdoor seating, very clean, great for social distancing.  Excellent customer service.  I love the menu &amp; the dining experience, very similar to Zahav its sister restaurant.  But I must say, it does not compare to Zahav which I found to be excellent.  But would come again."
5,"Absolutely delicious food and great service. Definitely worth the money.  the challah bread is amazing by the way. If we could have brought one home, we would have."
5,"There are times when you really wish that there was a sixth star, and this is it. When I compare Abe Fisher to my other five star reviews, they just don&apos;t compare to the quality of the food at Abe Fisher. I was excited to try it out, after my friend had told me that she liked Abe Fisher more than Zehav. It lived up to expectations and more. 

We went for happy hour ($7 selected apps and cocktails) on a Friday and had no trouble getting two seats at the bar just a little after 5:00. 

First, we ordered the chicken liver mousse. It was rich and creamy, yet not too heavy.  It was served over a sweet and savory pastrami onion jam, which paired perfectly.  The small portion was to be expected for the price and quality, but left us wanting more!

Next, we ordered the sweet potato, which was served in a bowl with boursin cheese, smoked walnuts, and pickled long hots. You know when you have that perfect bite?  This was it!  The sweetness of the potatoes was complimented perfectly by the savoriness of the cheese, smokiness and crunch of the walnuts, and sourness and heat of the pickled long hots. It was perfection in every sense. 

Wanting more, but something lighter, we ordered the borscht tartare. It was very good, but didn&apos;t wow us like the first two dishes.   The server then came over with a gift from the kitchen, the latkes.  My friend said they were her favorite dish from her previous visit, so we were excited that&apos;s what they gave us for free. They were good, but not my style of latke. I like mine to have shredded potatoes which adds a lightness to this fried dish. These were dense and not my favorite, but still good. 

My friend and I already have plans to return for their duck tasting menu later this month. I can&apos;t wait!"
4,"Innovative dishes, decor, and attentive service impressed.  To the point, as many folks have detailed reviews:
-Didn&apos;t really &quot;get&quot; the yapchik
-Hummus was ok, slightly too sour for me
-One order of short ribs fed two-maybe even for three
-Best to top it off with bacon and egg cream-you won&apos;t reviews it"
4,"Abe Fisher has been on my list for a bit, so when I saw them on the restaurant week list, it was the perfect opportunity. We preordered a &quot;Dinner at Home&quot; to pick up, which was a great option. For $70, Abe Fisher offered their challah+spreads, 2 appetizers, 2 entrees, and a generous dessert split. Quite a good deal! We just popped by the restaurant to pick up all the goodies, and then we heated up once we arrived home. A very simple process, although the challah was missing from our pack at first (had all the spreads, but no bread to pair). We called when we arrived home and noticed, and luckily the manager offered to let us pick up some challah the following day, so we just held off our dinner one day - no big. Appreciate their flexibility!

In terms of the actual eats...the bread+spreads were the perfect starter. There were so many different yet complimentary spreads to pair with the bread - we were definitely not fans of the liver mousse (VERY strong flavor, odd texture), but we loved the eggplant and borscht spreads. For apps, we started with the kale salad, which featured grapes, sunflower seeds, and a homemade blue cheese - unique pairings, but they all worked together nicely. We also shared the latke, which came with peach jam and herbed sour cream - definitely a stand out! We haven&apos;t really had much latke experience, but this one was divine, and we loved the sweet pairing with the jam. Nicely done! For mains, I went with the salmon - it was actually a very meaty and decently sized piece, paired with lemon and broccolini. Simple, but very well done. My fiancé went for the brisket - so excellent! It appeared to be small piece, but it was chockful of flavor and meat. Definitely the highlight of our entrees! Even though we were pretty stuffed already, we pushed through to dessert. We got a maple custard with blueberries and pecans on top and a cinnamon coffee cake with a homemade whipped cream. The custard was so creamy and featured a very unique blend of flavors, but delish nonetheless. The coffee cake was a creation of M. Solmonov, our fave, so we new it would be good, and it did not disappoint! We loved the cinnamon crumblies and appreciated it&apos;s appropriate moist-level. 

While we certainly wish we could have been in person for our first Abe Fisher experience, we enjoyed our at home meal. The quality of food here is second to none, and you will certainly &quot;leave&quot; feeling so stuffed. Another great addition to the Solmonov family - excited to continue trying all the sister restaurants!"
4,"4.5/5

Tried to get a reservation at Zahav and was offered the option to eat here instead, and it was a great meal. Abe Fisher&apos;s food is best described ass upscale/elevated/modern Jewish food. The server recommended that each person chose one dish from each category on the menu, making it a total of 3 dishes per person, which was the right amount of food for us. You can choose to share everything or just enjoy your own dishes. 

The 9 dishes we ordered each were delicious, especially the veal schnitzel tacos. I definitely could have eaten a lot more than just the two that came with the order. Other favorites were the chicken liver mousse, borscht tartare, smoked salmon crudo. We ordered the quark panna cotta to share at the end. It was good, but not memorable like most of the savory dishes.

Service was friendly and the decor of the restaurant is polished yet comfy. All in all, a wonderful meal. I&apos;d definitely come back the next time I visit Philadelphia."
