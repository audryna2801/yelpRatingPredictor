5,Bought some as a gift for a friend. I enjoyed my free drink with my purchase. It was delicious. My friend said that she loved the coffee beans and wants to get more!  The customer service was great and timely. It looked like a cute place to hang out when it&apos;s open after covid too.
5,"I travel A LOT! That&apos;s literally my job! and I have such a hard time finding good coffee that&apos;s even close to how good it is on the west coast! 

But this! This coffee revived me and just gave me life. Has to be one of the best coffees I&apos;ve had on the East coast. They don&apos;t even have much syrup flavors, that honestly says A LOT! Because it&apos;s still amazing!"
4,"This is one of those places where you can tell the beans are just another level. 

I got a basic iced coffee here. The boldness of the coffee flavor came through without overwhelming me. It just hit me right. 

I got one of the cinnamon sugar donuts too. It was good but not must have. The coffee is the star here."
4,"Elixr Coffee Roasters is tucked away on S. Sydenham Street (between 15th and 16th Street) and Walnut Street. I love the decor of the store and it gives off very moody vibes. But unfortunately it&apos;s only open for takeout. There are a few tables set up outside. You can either order online or place an order and pay on a tablet they have set up near the door. You pick up your order on a table inside and there&apos;s plenty of hand sanitizer available. They&apos;re currently only accepting credit/debit cards!

Elixr has two seasonal drinks available for the holidays: Butterscotch Pink Peppercorn Latte and Minty Mocha. I ordered a regular Latte ($4.25) and the taste of the espresso wasn&apos;t as strong as I wanted it to be, but I liked the amount of milk it had. The only milk alternative they have is oat milk. The prices are on the higher side but fair considering it&apos;s in the city. 

TLDR: Very aesthetic cafe that&apos;s perfect for any coffee snob-- although they&apos;re only open for takeout right now."
5,Travel all over US to try different roasters and coffee bars. By far the best tasting coffee.
4,"Stopped by for some cold brew on my way to breakfast elsewhere and had a great experience. Right now, they&apos;ve got contactless ordering on an iPad near the door, then you pick up your order from a table inside. The coffee was great. My boyfriend also picked up a bag of treehouse blend coffee beans for his sister as a gift. Finally, the barista gave us a coupon for a free coffee, so that was a nice touch!"
5,"Yeah, you gotta check out this place. All types of action, this place is gold. And the coffee is really good. Also, they serve baked goods from this woman operated bakery (I can&apos;t remember the name, I asked a bunch of times), sorry woman operated bakery, I am terrible with names, yes, they are really good croissants and stuff. Also, a good assortment of coffee, and a cool retail space. The sitting space is cool also, I didn&apos;t come to work only to disturb those working. 

Watch out for parking meters expiring! They clock you to the second. I wonder what they do with all that parking violation money? They should give that money to all the homeless people. Can anyone do something about this?"
4,"FINALLYYY a matcha latte that I can taste actual matcha in. very cute coffee shop with a great millenially-oriented aesthetic decor and perfect for your coffee-snob friend menu. they also have baked goods which if I hadn&apos;t already gotten some from another bakery I would have tried.

lots of open space to do work, including a community table. it&apos;s pretty busy for a Wednesday afternoon, would come fully charged but there are outlets available near the community table if needed."
5,"I&apos;m in Center City for a conference each year, and instead of filling up on plentiful but mediocre hotel coffee, I duck out and head to Elixr. Their espresso and pastries are top notch. I recently had a croissant here with goat cheese and everything bagel seeds baked into it -- unique and well executed.

I don&apos;t fancy myself much of a pour over person (more a fan of cappuccinos), but I gave my barista some details about my taste preferences, and the pour over he recommended was one of the best I&apos;ve had. They know their stuff!"
5,"Delicious lattes. I had a matcha latte with oat milk- almond milk is not a thing here, and the squash latte. Both very delicious. The experience is very hipster boho. I would certainly come back again."
4,"tl;dr an edgy, lively coffee bar in the heart of Center City, but admittedly an unideal place to post up for work

While strolling down the hustle and bustle of Center City Walnut Street, you may see coffee enthusiasts in the know turning off onto an unassuming alley behind the Racquet Club. Tucked away on this side street is one of the better-known coffee roasters in town. If you&apos;re feeling bold (or if the caffeine addiction comes a-itching), follow the crowd to see what the buzz is about.

Immediately, the blasting low-fi music and the distinct aroma of coffee give you a good sense of what Elixr is all about. Across from the entrance, a stainless steel barn door marks the no-purchase-required unisex stall, and to the left, you are led into a long space divided into two levels. Closer to the entrance are long cushioned benches surrounding a communal coffee table. The back half of the coffee bar is mezzanine-ed and houses a collection of table space. This coffeehouse channels chic industrial vibes, featuring an exposed HVAC, wooden flooring and furniture accents, tastefully-grungy exposed brick, and high bay windows. 

Seasonal single-origin brews and an assortment of offbeat espresso beverages (such as the autumnal Squash Kombucha latte) are all the rage here. Even midday on a weekday, Elixr may have a line weaving down from the mezzanine toward the entrance. Wifi is free and fast, and seating is usually available. The real tragedy, though, is that the table area, which is more conducive to work, has a dearth of outlets. Power stations are plentiful at the benched common area, but without a convenient place to spread your devices. To be fair, Elixr is more of a hangout joint than a productive, cookie-cutter coffeehouse. But the lack of practicality makes Elixr lower on my tier list of ideal coffee spots for the everyday grind."
5,"My favorite stop in my coffee shop tour of Philadelphia. It&apos;s in an alleyway but wasn&apos;t really hard to find: there&apos;s a sign out front and tables on the sidewalk. I sat here and worked for a couple hours. I was there from 12-2 and there were open seats the whole time.
I got a matcha latte with oat milk (they don&apos;t have almond milk) and it was somehow creamy and had latte art! I also ordered a hummus eggplant baguette. It was kind of messy and hard to eat but it tasted good."
5,"Stopped by on my trip to Philadelphia and needed a coffee shop to get some work done. Walked to this place from the terminal market and it was easy/convenient/safe. 

The place has a ton of seating, though it was mostly full when I showed but I found some seating at the common area.

Coffee was delicious - I did the hand brewed option which came free with a purchase of the bag of coffee. Ended up with the Guayabal which was delicious - the same bag I bought which is probably one of my current favorite roasts."
5,"Absolutely fantastic poor overs I had an Ethiopian and a Colombian that were amazing, I am a coffee snob and it is extremely rare and I think it&apos;s probably happen one time where I had Ethiopian and Colombian as my two favorites in the same coffee house. You have to visit this place if you&apos;re in Philadelphia hands-down one of my favorite coffee shops I&apos;ve ever been to."
5,"I LOVE this coffee shop. The coffee is the best you can get in the city. I stopped by on a Sunday afternoon and tried ordering a matcha latte, but I was told that they ran out of the matcha. However, that did not stop me from giving them five stars. I got a Cappuccino instead, and asked for oat milk to substitute regular milk. It was so rich yet smooth, with just the right amount of foam. 

It&apos;s a great place to get some work done, with WiFi and plenty outlets. The servers were also very friendly. My only comment is that their bathroom can be a little dirty sometimes. I wish I can go through their entire coffee menu some day."
5,"Fantastic coffee and amazingly sourced pastries, located in a convenient part of Center City. They get a lot of their pastries from Machine Shop Boulangerie, an operation that I&apos;ve had my eye on for awhile now. And their latest latte (a lavender and cardamom one?) was absolutely delicious.

I&apos;ve been to this Elixr a couple of times before, and I&apos;ve always managed to find a space to work in during the day (near a power outlet too!). It&apos;s a real treat to enjoy their high quality coffee and pastries while working, and the noise level is reasonable."
5,"Elixr is a unique, cozy coffee shop located in Center City which will truly surprise your taste buds. Although tucked away in an alley, it allows you to escape the hustle and bustle of Center City. From excellent and informative baristas who are there to help find you a beverage that will enlighten both your mind and taste buds to the relaxed environment to enjoy all of the amazing locally sourced pastries, this is one of my favorite coffee shops to visit. 

The only downside to this location of the coffee shop is that it can get quite packed on the weekends during tourist season so I highly recommend grabbing your beverage to go and taking advantage of Rittenhouse Square park two blocks away."
4,"You know how when some people describe coffee, they rattle off a whole bunch of flavors that make you nod and go &quot;oh, yeah, I&apos;m definitely getting that hint of black currant&quot; so you look cool but then you have to keep up the facade for your entire life, until one day you&apos;re on your deathbed and you&apos;re like &quot;Jimmy, I never tasted the black currant - I&apos;ve been living a lie&quot; and no one shows up at your funeral because of the betrayal?

Well, let me tell you, casual reader, at Elixr Coffee Roasters you will get a hint of black currant (depends on the coffee) and then some!

I&apos;m serious - some of the best coffee I&apos;ve had in my life. Who knew a simple blonde roast pour-over could taste this good? It&apos;s so good, putting anything in it is like a slap in the face. Throw out the sugar, throw out the cream, keep the illegal drugs, just don&apos;t put them in the coffee.

I&apos;ve had two coffees here and I&apos;m confident in two things:

1. Enjoyment coffee is to be cherished.
2. Morning every day coffee is to be tolerated.
3. I can&apos;t count.
4. Maybe I&apos;m just really bad at making coffee because even with the same beans, I probably couldn&apos;t make it come out a fourth as well as the folks at Elixr.

Go here. Get ANY pourover. Sip it, savor it, and ask yourself if you&apos;ve ever had citrusy coffee that didn&apos;t involve a giant soap-dispenser style jug of &quot;orange&quot; syrup for your summer Dunkin&apos; ice coffee.

Yeah, my nose is a little raised right now."
4,The coffee and ambience is great here but it&apos;s pretty tight space-wise for getting work done without too much in the way of seating or outlets.
5,"This is my new favorite coffee shop in philly!

I love getting either an iced coffee or a chai latte since they are both tasty. In addition, their baked goods are delicious and very fresh.

The best thing I enjoy about Elixr is the aesthetic and vibe. The music is basically my own personal playlist so it makes me feel at home. There is decent seating area, but I would come here for very large groups. Service has always been pretty quick for me and the baristas are good at what they do."
