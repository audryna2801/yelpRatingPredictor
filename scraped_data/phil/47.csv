5,"On a cold, dreary, frigid, bitter winter evening. 

My wife, dog, and I came for my birthday dinner. 

We sat in a covid cabin. 

Our valiant waiter was attentive, masked, and seemingly unperturbed by the awful weather. 

Despite the long cold walk between kitchen and table, the food came out warm, delicious, and quickly. 

We ordered a Wagyu NY strip, a Wagyu porterhouse, shrimp cocktail, broccoli, and about three extra baskets of &apos;popovers.&apos; 

It was an absolutely LOVELY night! It was a first night out in nearly a year and it did not disappoint. We will happily go back again and I&apos;d highly recommend Barclay&apos;s. 

Small note- not their fault at all- the cabin wasn&apos;t COLD but it certainly wasn&apos;t warm. We had our coats on the entire night. This isn&apos;t an issue if you come prepared and is understandable given the weather, but still worth knowing if you&apos;re planning on a visit. 

Other note- they allowed Bella (our dog) to come and sit on the floor and eat shrimp tales! Dog inclusion is always a plus!"
5,"Great meal during COVID. I celebrated my birthday here on a chilly evening. Most Stephen Starr restaurants have the nifty personal outdoor/indoor boxes, but this one was outfitted for the occasion, including &quot;high ceilings&quot;  and a chandelier! I wish I could check out the interior, but it was nice nonetheless. Service was outstanding, what you would expect from a high end steakhouse

It was my birthday and I had to try the famed cheesesteak. Before moving to Philly, I remember reading about the world&apos;s most expensive cheesesteak and thinking who would pay 100+ for a sandwich? Times have changed and there I was, ready to blow some cash.

My wife and I started with the Manhattan, the $30 price is steep for the city, I thought I left NY for a reason, but boy was it tasty and STRONG. The buttery popovers were amazing, but I had to save room.

Scallops- Tender
Crab cakes- Delicious
Caesar Salad - Perfect
Tator Tots- Outstanding
Mashed Potatoes - Silky
Cheesesteak-Rich
Cookie Trio- Decadent

It was all FANTASTIC. The cheesesteak was worth the hype! But, it was one rich sandwich. Truffle cheese sauce, foie-gras, wagyu ribeye, caramelized onions. Mmmmm

They also brought out a complimentary dessert for my birthday and multiple waitstaff wished me well throughout the meal which was a nice touch

I will definitely return for that sandwich. Who would pay 100+ for a sandwich- Me, Who will do it again- also Me"
5,"My wife (who is a vegetarian) and I recently dined in at Barclay Prime, and for years we have been putting it off because we were looking to justify a reason to go. Well, we had a spark of spontaneity and just went for it...and we were SO HAPPY WE DID.

For context, this visit were during the pandemic, and they have their operations together. Temperature check as you walk in the building, seating felt well-spaced out, and all staff were very friendly and accommodating. 

To call out the obvious - this is going to be an expensive meal, but we promise you, it is worth it.

Everything we ate was absolutely delicious! I had the American Wagyu Filet Mignon - literally could have floated out of my seat. Had it prepared medium rare, with no sauces on it, and the natural salty and sweet flavor the meat really popped. It just melted in my mouth, and this was one of those meals that I intentionally ate slow to make sure I enjoyed every bite. I also ordered the whipped potatoes and grilled broccolini, both of which paired nicely with the steak.

My wife got the caesar salad, truffle mac &amp; cheese, and the Kennett Square mushrooms. As far as portions, they were all HUGE. Do not be put off by the price of sides or starters, the portions are more than fair. And for her being a vegetarian, she had plenty of options on the menu to choose from. If anything, we over-ordered thinking the sides would be smaller.

The only dish we had that we weren&apos;t over the moon about (personal preference) was the Caesar because it had a pretty strong anchovy dressing. Our waiter did mention that prior to ordering though, so we were prepared, but just not our favorite. 

One of the unique features of the meal as well was their bread, which really is more of a popover. So a different experience from other steakhouses, but the fluffy and light dough ball was a great starter, served warm and the butter melts throughout. Also worth holding on to for any dipping in larger plates ordered. 

We ended with a banana creme brûlée, which was FIRE. The bananas were cut thin and layered on top, and caramelized with sugar. It was also served with whipped cream and vanilla wafers - just a perfect way to end the dinner.

Their menu had tons of options that we both would want to go back for and try. The drink menu followed suit, and had a much larger bottle selection for wine, as opposed to &quot;by the glass&quot; (something else to consider as you are preparing for the meal.) 

Atmosphere was stellar - really a high class, fancy environment, but doesn&apos;t feel snobby. The main dining room is lined with wooden built-ins and cool book decorations. Seating was comfortable, and the chandelier lighting made for it to be a very cozy evening. 

And to top off, our waiter was phenomenal. We kept fun conversation throughout the night, he provided a ton of insight as to what we should order, and made for it to be that much greater of an experience. 

So we would highly recommend you check this place out. Find a reason to celebrate something, get dressed up, and just go!"
5,"We came here for a special date, and everyone from the manager to our waitress were so friendly and lovely.

The bartender made us special drinks, and all of the things we ordered- especially the wagyu beef cheesesteaks- were very good quality and delicious.

The ambiance is gorgeous and romantic, and we had a wonderful time."
4,"Quarantine induced psychosis must be a real thing, because my boyfriend and I paid $95 for a takeout cheesesteak! While the experience is likely so much cooler when you&apos;re sitting in the restaurant as opposed to taking out and eating at your own dining room table, it was still pretty cool! Calling this magnificent creation a cheesesteak is kind of disrespectful. This sandwich was the most delicious steak I have ever tasted, topped with the most delicious cheese ever, and then placed on this garlicky amazing roll. And of course we are fancy bitches so we got the champagne to go with it, which was also surprisingly fabulous. The steak they use for this sandwich is the most tender steak I&apos;ve ever had. You really didn&apos;t even have to chew it, which was kind of weird but also interesting. 
We also got the truffle mac and cheese that while delicious wasn&apos;t anything to write home about. Crab cake appetizer was above average too but not mind blowing. 
I think the key to Barclay Prime is stick to the steak! Everything else is just a distraction. Hopefully soon when indoor dining is a thing again we will get the full experience."
5,"I would rate this restaurant 4.5 stars. My friend and I came here this evening and were pleasantly surprised. We split our entire meal and still had huge portions, basically forcing us to waddle as we left. Every single thing we ate from the table bread to the steak was delicious. Their outdoor tables were also well set up, with their own vents and lighting, giving a classy and private experience. 
This restaurant is a little pricey, but also delicious."
5,"Came here for a special treat. The Japanese Wagyu steak. I&apos;ve done my research and this restaurant is one of the few on this end of the east coast with authentic wagyu. The steak is incredible, rich and buttery all the way through. You don&apos;t need a lot of it to feel satisfied."
5,"We had a great experience with dinner outside at Barclay prime. The precautions taken for the pandemic were thorough and thoughtful. Our temperatures were checked upon checking in at the hostess stand. All employees wore masks and many wore face shields.

We started off with the scallops which were perfectly cooked and the accompanying cauliflower was amazing. There were only two scallops included in the appetizer. The porterhouse steak was cooked perfectly for my husband and my filet mignon was cooked perfectly &quot;medium plus&quot; exactly as described. The white potatoes were a bit boring but delicious and the grilled broccolini had a nice char. It was topped with garlic.

Overall this was a perfect dinner for a special occasion. Their pandemic precautions were appropriate."
3,In comparison to other top notch steak places I was left disappointed. The overall ambience was nice and the service was good. The appetizers were good including the Caesar salad and bread &amp; butter. The NY Strip had a bitter peppered after taste. By the time I got near the end of the steak I wanted it to be over but for over $100 I finished it. My gf said her steak was &quot;decent&quot; but again for the price I expect more. The Mac and cheese was very good and flavorful. The whipped potatoes left something to be desired. The desserts (cookie dessert and peanut butter dessert) both were average . The outdoor dining was a miss and the booths were freezing. We ate multiple places outside with a warmer system.
5,So good. Too good. My boyfriend and I had an incredible experience here. We even got a sommelier I was so impressed it was a lovely experience
1,Service was fine.  Overpriced for what it is.  The filet I ordered medium plus and was dry and salty. The sides (mushrooms and creamed spinach) were subpar at best.  The mushrooms tasted like they were bathed in salt.  The drinks? Charged 36$ for a glass of Cabernet that was no more than 2-3 oz in volume.  Awful food.  Please save your date nights/celebrations for another location.
5,"lovely lovely experience for a bday dinner!! complimentary dessert and a wonderfully delicious dinner at an amazing space 

the food: obviously get at least one of the steaks. i got the ribeye (not kosher rib eye) and one of the wagyu&apos;s - the server recommend that i go medium with the wagyu and medium rare on the ribeye and i think it was the right choice! any rarer for the wagyu i feel like would&apos;ve been too raw to enjoy the softness of the wagyu texture. honestly the truffle mac and cheese i would pass next time, i LOVED the whipped potatoes ( so soft) and the broccoli dish. it comes with garlic pieces that melt in your mouth and are seasoned with lemon! 

the place: very dark lighting ngl - but beautifully pulled together! i love the living room library esque vibe and it made it seem modern with still a luxuriously warm feel"
4,"I recently went here for a birthday dinner and was really impressed. As someone that doesn&apos;t eat red meat - I never had any interest in coming here and am so happy that I did. The fish was really great, I tried the Branzino and my husband had the sea bass. The little outdoor rooms they set up were great and I felt really safe in the time of COVID. The service was also great, but my favorite thing here was definitely the warm sweet dinner rolls."
5,"After hearing my two friends glow when recalling their dinner experience at Barclay Prime, I had to try it out. Barclay Prime is tucked in the corner of Rittenhouse Square which is nice to come to after a stroll in the city. 

The initial intent was to go in for Happy Hour (which I heard is amazing), however make sure you sit at the bar area specifically to get the offers. In my case, we got sent straight to our table so we missed out - oh well. 

The bread to start off is quite enjoyable with a nice outer crust, (mostly hollow inside) doughy inside coupled with butter. Aside, we ordered a Waygu Beef Carpaccio as an appetizer. Absolutely fantastic. The beef paired with the refreshing citric acidity of the lemon paired well for a symphony in my mouth. If anything, brush the Parmesan away to get the most from the beef. 

I ordered the 40-day dry aged 20 oz Ribeye. A nice little touch on the experience is when they offer a selection of international knives to choose from as &quot;your weapon.&quot; I chose the German knife. The steak itself was perfectly seared to capture the peppery but also buttery for the taste bud indulging flavors. I would go as far as saying it has been the best steak I&apos;ve ever had. 

The sides were solid, but nothing earth shattering. The Truffle Mac &amp; Cheese was perfectly creamy. The truffle added just noticeable flavor. The crumble on the top is barely a compromise for the desire for the dish to be baked. The other side, Tater Tots, were just well cooked tater tots and nothing to waste the experience on. 

To end the meal, I got the Warm Cookie Skillet. A blend of three cookies - sugar, chocolate chip, and oatmeal raisin - topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and a side of chocolate sauce. One of the better cookie skillets I&apos;ve had - crisp outside and warm, soft inside. My favorite of the three sections was surprisingly the oatmeal raisin.

Overall, fantastic spot for steaks and that should be your primary focus. If you want to try the other stuff, happy hour is the time as you&apos;ll get your bang for your buck. Maybe even stop by for dessert just to indulge yourself. Will be back at some point for the $120 cheesesteak."
5,"The warm cookie dessert. That&apos;s all I can say. 

Kidding. In all seriousness, this is one of the best restaurants I&apos;ve ever been to! I&apos;ve been a total of three times, and each time I was blown away by my meal and the service. The servers are incredibly knowledgeable and accommodating. I would recommend if you&apos;re wanting to celebrate something, or just want a fantastic dining experience."
4,"If you agree with the proposition that if a restaurant can feed you one mouthful of exquisiteness then it&apos;s worth whatever the market will bear. On that basis alone, Barclay Prime should be considered the best dining value in the plutocracy.

The food here is outstanding but in portions so obscenely small that Barclay Prime is the literal incarnation of steakhouse porn - so keen to be chic and unpretentious that they are literally drowning in both.

The design of the space is impeccable as is the service with presentation as crisp and understated as I have ever experienced. You&apos;ll soon discover that you&apos;re no longer dining but participating in a ridiculous performance art ritual as you indulge in whispers of steak and rumors of side dishes. It was so amazing, that I couldn&apos;t wait for it to end regardless of the cost to purchase my freedom. In fact, that may just be their genius.

Honestly, I&apos;m very aware that this place is swimming in accolades and awards but for me the entire experience was stilted in the extreme. First and foremost my expectation for a night out is to relax with a great meal and to enjoy the company that I&apos;m with.

Barclay Prime is a gilded fishbowl that left me cold. By rights the service and the food were exquisite and demand five stars but I am leaving one off for personal preference. Nothing personal."
4,"Solid steakhouse! I split the prime rib, mashed potatoes, and truffle mac and cheese. All extremely good. The prime rib was enough for two and I ended having some left over to go. In retrospect, we should have gotten at least one non-carb side since the complimentary bread is so good. 

The outdoor dining experience was nice and the service was excellent. Our waiter was enthusiastically trying to upsell us with an $85 lobster (&quot;do it yourself surf and turf!&quot;). Not sure why the lobster was $85 but it&apos;s a nice concept for future visits. Plus the waiter was attractive, haha. We overstayed our outdoor dining allotted time and the staff was very courteous in telling us our time was up."
5,"Ordered delivery during COVID. Filet mignon, truffle Mac and cheese, creamed spinach and Caesar salad. Everything was delicious. Food was cooked perfectly and packaged well. Would recommend and will order again."
5,"This was our last meal out to eat before the quarantine started and definitely one to remember! We came here for my husband&apos;s birthday and the experience was incredible! The ambiance is very classy and inviting. We started out with the Caesar salad and The Barclay Prime Cheesesteak which came with a half-bottle of champagne! The cheesesteak was mouth watering, literally the best cheesesteak in all of Philadelphia. The truffled cheese whiz was amazing and the roll was so soft! For the entree, we split the wagyu filet mignon and an order of creamed spinach. The steak was so soft and tender and the whole meal was delightful! The food and experience was definitely worth the price!"
5,"I&apos;ve been here twice and have been officially converted! The second time was what made it official for me - so ordering the right items might make or break the visit!  The first time I ordered wagyu sliders, beef tartare, and roasted foie gras to start. For the main, split a bone in New York strip and side of truffle Mac and cheese. The wagyu sliders were AMAZING, and everything else was fine. Overall, we ordered too many rich items so we were just overwhelmed by the fat.

The SECOND visit here - oh boy! This time was spectacular. I ordered the wagyu sliders and sea diver scallops to start. Both were amazing! Also tried the yellowtail dish and it was great.  The main was the wagyu ribeye (split among 4 people) - it is huge; it is tasty; but it is SO rich.  Sharing between 4 people was the right move.  Get an entire one for yourself - if you dare. 

Crab cakes were good, nothing spectacular. Potato au gratin was creamy and cheesy.  

The Chilean sea bass was so tender and served in a clam chowder type sauce (thicker). I was skeptical but it worked somehow! Tasty mm mm good! 

Lastly, for dessert we ordered cheesecake and a frozen cappuccino. The frozen cappuccino was amazing (would order again).


I&apos;m SO happy I gave Barclay another shot!  Ordering the right items skyrocketed it from another fine but slightly underwhelming restaurant to a place I&apos;d love to take my loved ones and check out again and again."
