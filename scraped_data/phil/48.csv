5,"We have been here once to dine and I would give that four stars, however Han Dynasty crushes when it comes to delivery and take out. Everything is cooked to perfection and still hot and fresh upon arrival. I love the stir fry and the veggie lo mein dishes. You can&apos;t go wrong with Han for takeout or delivery!"
5,"We are from out of town and really enjoyed dining at this restaurant, we sat outside on the side walk, waiters were attentive and responsive. 

Wow the food was something very special!! I could not believe the flavors of all the dishes. We got honey walnut shrimp, garlic snow leaves, dry chicken and garlic chicken. Some of the best Chinese I have had in recent memory. I want to go again 3 hours later!"
3,"Left me preface this by saying we were introduced to Sichuan food from a tiny hole in the wall joint just off Canal in NYC Chinatown. I could eat cold sesame noodles with their peanutty goodness. 
When we moved to Philly, we were happy to have University City&apos;s Han Dynasty so close. When Covid hit, we&apos;d order once a week just to wake up our senses. 

After two years. We just moved to South Philly from West Philly and so excited to see Han Dynasty in Olde City was here and delivering. Our 1st night in our new place we ordered our faves. Comfort food after a hard move. It was ok and I just wrote it off as stress from the move. 
We&apos;ve ordered 2 more times and both times it was disappointing. The sesame noodles were bland &amp; nearly sauceless. The pepper chicken, normally a nice crunch - was limp and none of the bright flavors of UCity location. 
I&apos;m hoping its a Covid thing and lack of access to supply chain will get better."
4,"Went to Han Dynasty my visit to Philly back in August. I wasn&apos;t sure about Philly&apos;s Asian cuisine being that I had never had it there before but they did not disappoint at all. Had the cumin style chicken and rice and it was very good. A bit more spicy than I thought it would be but still fairly very good. 

Good outdoor dining area away from direct sunlight in a subtle but mildly busy restaurant area. Very good service and affordable. I recommend it for anyone visiting in that location or live in the area."
4,"This review is very overdue! I&apos;ve been to Han dynasty a few times, and I absolutely love it. The dan dan noodles are a must! I highly recommend them to anyone who is trying this cuisine for the first time. Their outdoor dining section is very nice and spacious, and you don&apos;t feel on top of other tables like you would at some other places. Overall, it&apos;s pretty good and the prices are great!"
4,"Great happy hour!! 
Came in and had a drink (Strawberry Smash) as well as happy hour cucumbers and dan dan noodles.
You cannot beat the price of the food as well as the portions. It was very tasty. The cucumber was crisp, sweet, salty and spicy. Very well balanced, and only four bucks! The pork dan dan noodles were amazing. Only five bucks, and could feed 3-4 people for a nice snack. The drink was delicious. Not overly sweet, with fresh strawberries. 
Cocktails not on the happy hour menu are slightly overpriced in my opinion. But the food was excellent."
4,"I&apos;ve ate in the restaurant once but have ordered pick up through Caviar a handful of times. Their service is quick and great and food is pretty good!

I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 because there were a few times I ordered that I feel could&apos;ve tasted better or it wasn&apos;t what I was expecting it to be. 

I really enjoyed their cold sesame noodles! Delicious."
2,"COVID TAKEOUT REVIEW
Businesses are definitely struggling during these times and it saddens me to write anyone a negative review. However, I ordered fried rice from this location last night and had extremely unpleasant food poisoning since. The rice tasted stale/old and definitely funny, but I ignored it and chalked it up to weird flavoring. Big mistake. When rice specifically  is kept too long, it tends to breed a specific bacteria (b cereus) resulting in very painful food poisoning. It must be very hard to keep a business going right now, but old food, ESPECIALLY rice is not acceptable. Very disappointed in last nights meal. Won&apos;t be ordering from here."
4,"I have been battling a viscous cold and since I was just leaving a YEE across the street I knew Han would have just what I needed. Something hot, comforting and soul satisfying, the dan dan of course. I got an order of that and the garlic style chicken to go.

The guy who took my order was nice and sympathetic. He offered me water while I waited. The bartender offered me tea. I declined both but appreciated the gestures. I was asked if I wanted any condiments and asked for soy sauce but the young man forgot. No worries, don&apos;t we all have a bottle at home?

The garlic style chicken was good but not like I remembered and definitely did not have bell peppers in it as the description says. The dan dan is still the same and that&apos;s really all that matters isn&apos;t it."
2,"Ambience is wonderful. I love the Chinese theater theme. Service was quick. 

Food is average bec I have high expectations for Chinese food. 

The wonton in chili sauce was decent, but I&apos;ve had better. 

Beef lo mein had a good flavor, but everyone in my party thought it was extremely salty. 

The szechuan chili fries were undercooked and soggy. There was no crisp to the fries."
5,"I&apos;m so obsessed with Han Dynasty, the authentic Sichuan spot!! This is by far their most striking location, as it&apos;s housed in historic Olde City in a converted bank! They leave just enough original details for you to get that feel. 

The food is incredible!!! All items on the menu are rated on a spiciness scale from 1-10, but they are always willing to adjust to your preference. Seriously, don&apos;t be afraid if spice isn&apos;t your thing. We bring our children here and have never had an issue &quot;dulling down&quot; the kick for them. If you do like spice however, you will be a kid in a candy shop here! 

Their signature dan-dan noodles are a MUST!! They are perfectly spicy and peanut flavored. They&apos;re really quite outrageous!! 

We absolutely love the garlic eggplant, the mapo tofu and salt and pepper shrimp also. Can&apos;t go wrong with any of those!! (Just a heads up, They will deliver the minced pork, which comes atop a few meals on the side if you ask) 

They offer super reasonable lunch specials and some neat cocktails, too. I recently had the &apos;Empress&apos; and enjoyed it thoroughly. It was lighter and refreshing. 

I will say service is never real friendly but the food is ready rather quickly. 

We most recently visited for my parents 45 wedding anniversary, and while there were no reservations on Open Table, I called and they accommodated us without issue. Don&apos;t hesitate to call if you don&apos;t see availability!!

Portions are decent and the plates are delivered family style. It&apos;s a great, fun spot for larger parties! 

This is one of the places Anthony Bourdain hit up while he was in town. Although a chain, the food is apparently as close to that offered in the city of the same name as you&apos;ll get here in the states. 

YUMMMMMMM!!!"
5,"One of my favorite places to get Dan Dan Noodles! It&apos;s definitely a go to when I&apos;m craving the dish. It has a nice spice that you can always change to make it more mild or spicy. As for the inside is nice and spacious, a great place for a group to go! It&apos;s also nice and clean within the restaurant as well.

As for the staff, they&apos;re always very nice and accommodating. They&apos;re quick to answer questions and very knowledgeable about the menu. Especially  the waitress, Asia! Love when she serves me! Very professional while making you feel very comfortable!"
3,"Here for the dan dan 
AKA peanut butter 
Bomb with some noodles*

*legit is was like eating peanut butter, very little meat or flavor. All other dishes were very delicious (triple fried chicken) 

** they are open and we did take out- super fast"
5,"We had dinner here while I came to visit my sister who goes to Temple University. The servers here were wonderful and the food came out in a very timely manner. 

The Dan Dan Noodles and scallion pancakes are amazing! 

I&apos;ve also been to the one in Cherry Hill, NJ. It&apos;s just not the same experience as the Old City location. The ambiance and atmosphere is much classier and upscale here. 

Must try!"
4,"I order from here whenever I&apos;m in the mood for delivery and I want a safe and reliable choice that I know is going to blow it out of the fucking park.

The thing about Han Dynasty is that the flavors have so much fucking depth. You will be getting something with plenty of grease but...in a good way. 

I usually go with the cumin because it&apos;s a classic and done very well here. The cumin is so intense it almost hurts but, again, in a good way. We also ordered dry pot style with fried tofu and this was EXCEPTIONAL. both of them were definitely adequately spicy. Unlike many other Asian establishments, the majority of the contents of the dishes are actually tofu and not bullshit like chestnuts or celery or some shit but stuff that you actually WANT to eat. The dry pot style has actually replaced cumin as my favorite. 

The last time we actually ate inside this place (amazing interior, this place definitely used to be a bank or something regal), we ordered a soup and I&apos;m not joking you, it was literally as big as my girlfriend (who&apos;s 5&apos;10&quot; but still). 

This is definitely a must visit in Philly."
4,"I had been &quot;ordered&quot; by an Asian American friend to eat as much Asian food as possible in Philly, so on a slightly cold and rainy night, I kind of stumbled on Han Dynasty ... and I am SO GLAD.

When I walked in, it was like I had been transported to a different time. Like the set of some Chinese gangster movie in the Roaring Twenties. Well, I was a little bit off. The actual restaurant is only five years old, but the building is at least a hundred years old and was a bank. 

The complimentary hot tea is a welcome treat and the menu offers a lot of information. I cannot stress this enough: the spiciness rating scale must be followed. They are not fucking around. I loved the hell out of my Dan Dan noodles (without pork), but they were just the right amount of heat as a &quot;6&quot;; any hotter and I would have been in distress. The food portions are also family-style and meant for sharing unless you are a greedy bastard like me.

I was so full with just one bowl that I ordered the sesame cold noodles to go and am so looking forward to breakfast. In the words of the Scissor Sisters, &quot;it can&apos;t come quickly enough.&quot;"
2,"I ordered Han Dynasty for delivery during the COVID quarantine. I&apos;d been craving some Dan Dan noodles and wanted to introduce my mother to them. Of course I was hype when the order came, but that quickly wore off as I opened my food and all of my excitement went out the window. I immediately saw that the sauce for my noodles was missing on some spots (I wish I&apos;d taken a pic, but I just figured I&apos;d stir it up and that would fix it). It was hard to get out of the container bc the dried parts were sticking together. Then, my shrimp &amp; rice looked tired, with only about 6 shrimps in it. The next day I figured I&apos;d eat the rest of the noodles, and I think i figured out why the noodles were dried up. I had ordered it w/ no meat, but as I reached the bottom, there was definitely meat there. I&apos;m thinking once they realized that it wasn&apos;t supposed to have meat, instead of giving me a whole new order, they took out most of the meat and just added more noodles on top. Of course I ended up eating some of the meat before I realized it was in there &amp; had me on the toilet most of the evening. From now on, unless I am able to sit and eat (&amp; return food that&apos;s not right) I&apos;ll lay off the Han dynasty take out. I understand that the demand is high right now, but if customers can&apos;t receive the quality that they expect, and pay for then maybe there should be a limited menu or something."
4,"I have always been a fan of Dan Dan noodles from han. We were here on Saturday for dinner. The Han dynasty in old city is huge. They have a lot of seating options. We ordered the dan dan noodles and chicken in garlic sauce style. The dan dan noodles as always was really good. The chicken however had no taste at all. The service was ok. The server was rude but he did make an effort to fill our glass. 
Overall,
Dan Dan noodles - 5/5
Chicken in garlic sauce- 1/5
Service- 3/5
Price- 4/5"
5,"One of my go to places. I love everything I&apos;ve had here - scallion pancakes, Dan Dan noodles, Kung pal chicken, dry beef and garlic chicken are some of my favourites. Literally anything from the menu that I&apos;ve tried has been amazing"
5,"Absolutely love Han Dynasty, especially this location because it&apos;s the one with the spiciest dishes! I come here as well as order take out from Han on a pretty regular basis, and love living so close to it.

Regarding the space of this location, it is a very large area in what looks like an old bank. There is a big bare area with high tables around it, and there is also a very large seating area. I rarely have had to wait more than 20 minutes to get seated even on a weekend night, but the wait is longer with a bigger group.

The food and drinks here are both awesome. They have a great beer draft list, as well as some good wines and some creative cocktails. For food, we usually order the dumplings in chili oil, spicy cucumbers, and dan dan noodles to start. Their dan dan noodles are their signature dish and they&apos;re incredible, so I definitely recommend those. I also wouldn&apos;t sleep on the cucumbers because they&apos;re perfectly spicy and refreshing. For the entree, my favorite dish is the garlic style beef which is very tender. I also really enjoy the kung pao chicken. The numbers next to the names of the dishes indicate how spicy the dish is - so beware! You definitely end up sweating a little bit after you&apos;re done.

Han Dynasty is one of my favorite places in the city and I highly recommend it!"
