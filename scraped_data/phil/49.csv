5,"This is another hit. A great Stephen Starr spot. I&apos;ve shared many special moments at Buddakan. I wish Old City was cooler! It&apos;s such a cute neighborhood but for some reason lacking a reason to frequent. Buddakan is consistent and yummy.

I came with my partner during covid, so we sat outside missing the chic ambiance of the interior. I&apos;m pescatarian. I always start with the Asian Cashew Salad and Edamame Dumplings.  You can&apos;t go wrong with any of the fried rices. The crab fried rice may be my favorite. The donuts for dessert are very popular. 

All of our drinks were great! Anytime lychee is on the drink menu, I get it!"
5,"Buddakan has done a nice job with their outdoor seating in the midst of the restrictions, and I always get excited about Starr restaurants and this definitely delivered. Our server was really knowledgeable about the menu and offered solid suggestions for both food and drink. The Rock Shrimp Bao Buns and Edamame Dumplings were a highlight of our meal. My girlfriend has been obsessed with their Sea Bass and I am now sold on it as well. We finished our meal off with the Dim Sum Donuts which were served with unique and very tasty dipping sauces. This was our second time here together and it definitely won&apos;t be the last, though we hope we can enjoy indoor dining here soon as it&apos;s super cool inside!"
5,"Went here for dinner on a Saturday night. Had a reservation for 4 outside seating. 

Temperature was checked (even though we sat outside) this was a plus for me. Made me feel more comfortable 

They have set up a cute floor and covering for outside dining on the street. Tables are distanced and there was a hand sanitizer station outside and a few inside. 

I went inside to use the restroom. The inside was beautiful. I wanted to take more photos but I didn&apos;t. 

Lobster egg rolls, crab fried rice, lobster fried rice, spring rolls, shrimp lo main, lobster curry. We ordered this as a table. 

I sent back my lobster fried rice, it was very dry. The crab rice was dry too. 

The lo main was really good and the lobster curry was flavorful and not spicy. 

It was enjoyable to get a break and try something different.  

The service was immaculate. No issues here at all. 5 stars earned here."
5,"My dinner at Buddakan made me want to be a better person. The type of person that deserves this level of deliciousness in their life. From beginning to end, with the exception of freezing our asses off outside, everything was spectacular. I&apos;ve been to Buddakan before during restaurant week but to be a real paying customer is next level amazing. 
We started off with a pitcher of zengria which was refreshing and delicious. We sampled the dim sum and agreed the edamame dumpling is the runaway winner. 
Our dinners were truly a feast for the senses. Visually stunning and equally delicious. The lobster dish my boyfriend got was almost overwhelming it was so gigantic. The presentation was perfect and of course the taste was phenomenal. We also ordered Mongolian lamb chops and found them to be the best lamb in the city. And there was a year where my boyfriend tried all the lamb in the city so that declaration actually means something. 
All of this amazingness was followed up by some dip sum donuts...a delicious donut and delicious pun! Impossible to resist. 
Our waiter Isaiah was wonderful-very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. He also hooked us up with a little heater so we didn&apos;t die out in the elements. Buddakan is so much more than a restaurant. It&apos;s an experience. And it shouldn&apos;t be missed."
5,"Went here yesterday for my birthday. 

My wife got this email about how Stephen Starr&apos;s restaurants here in Philadelphia have built these outside enclosures and filling them with heat lamps.   I really enjoy most of his places but wanted to try a new one. So she read me some menu items and the one that stuck out most to me was Buddakan. Funny thing is the best sounding thing on the menu wasn&apos;t even what I got. 
So we got the shrimp buns, Korean beef rice, dim sum sampler, sea bass and the wasabi mash potatoes. Everything was excellent. The single best item was the shrimp buns or the edamame pot stickers in the dim sum sampler. I could&apos;ve eaten entire meals out of either of those. We shared everything and still had left overs. 
The heated enclosure wasn&apos;t bad. Of course we still had our coats on so it wasn&apos;t like we were really warm but it was comfortable enough to enjoy our meal. If you enjoy stripping down it won&apos;t be the dinning experience for you. I&apos;m normally fairly cold. They have a heat duct running through the structure, a heat lamp outside of it and they gave my wife an extra small heater. It was 36 degrees. 

Everything is completely separated and they require temp checks. It&apos;s 4 to a table. 

I hope this helps inform your decision to go out support local business."
2,"This was my first time at the Philly location; however, I&apos;ve been to the Atlantic City location (which closed permanently due to COVID unfortunately) quite a few times. I never had a bad experience and the food/service was always excellent in AC, so I expected no different from this location.

When I first arrived, I was relieved to see the semi-enclosed booths for the outdoor seating. I had made reservations in advance, so I figured my party would get one of these booths. INSTEAD, we were seated in the open-air on the sidewalk, which was quite cold and uncomfortable. Somehow it didn&apos;t sit right with me that we were paying the same price as the more comfortable patrons while being completely out in the elements, despite having a reservation. It was especially bothersome when other parties seated on the sidewalk were being offered to move into a booth. I just don&apos;t believe you should have to sit entirely outside if you made a reservation. That should be reserved for last minute walk-in&apos;s.

The service also left much to be desired for. I do empathize with the difficulties of serving tables during COVID with outdoor dining, but our server first dropped my boyfriend&apos;s beer and promised to bring another free of charge, which took at least 30 minutes. Meanwhile, he was favoring other tables and giving them better service. It almost seemed like he was ignoring us and didn&apos;t even come back to check with us. After we&apos;d already FINISHED our entrees, he told us &quot;your dinner will be out shortly&quot; which speaks volumes on his lack of awareness of our needs. I did want to order dessert and another drink, but everything was taking so long that I didn&apos;t even want to bother and by that point, we just wanted to get out of there.

The food was pretty mediocre aside from the spare ribs and edamame dumplings. I would not return to this location or recommend it to anyone."
4,"We made a 5PM reservation on a Sunday so the number of dining guests socially distancing was perfect. The servers and waitstaff wore masks and face shields to protect themselves and the patrons.

Our drink and food order came out in record time in comparison to pre-COVID. 

Myself and a dining companion both ordered the same items of Cantonese spring rolls which are shrimp and chicken spring rolls served with a mustard dipping sauce that has a horseradish base so you will get that kick in your nose with each bite (at least that&apos;s what happens to me). For dinner we ordered the Lobster Fried Rice.

I love rice based dishes so I can not speak to other items on the menu as my go-to when I dine at Buddakan is something with fried rice.

For dessert, we had the very delicious donuts that include 3 dipping sauces (a chocolate, a cream cheese, and raspberry)."
3,"So I didn&apos;t love Buddakan. Granted, it was take out and I  didn&apos;t have the whole dining experience. But I was honestly expecting more, and was a little disappointed.
We got the edamame dumplings, tofu bao buns, tofu cashew, and vegetable lo mein. The bao buns were my favorite part! Dumplings were also pretty good, but I think I may favor the ones at sampan just a little. The tofu cashew and lo mein were really mediocre. They were both a little dry, and not very flavorful. 
Maybe I&apos;ll just get appetizers next time?"
4,"We ordered delivery and it came FAST! Still piping hot and well prepared. The crab fried rice was good and dim sum sampler was awesome as well. I will definitely get the edamame dumplings next time because they were our favorite out of the sampler (hint of truffle, yum!). I will say the cashew chicken was okay, veggies were great but the chicken itself was nothing special. The donuts were a plus with lots of toppings to make it special!"
5,"Once again we had a fabulous time at Buddakan!  Delicious food &amp; drinks, very safe environment, wonderful ambiance and amazing server!!:) Suzie provided awesome service &amp; perfect recommendations along with a delightful personality...total win! We&apos;ll be back to see her soon.:)"
5,"You just can&apos;t go wrong at Buddakan!

You walk in, and it is just this huge open room, with high ceilings (they need it to fit the 10ft. buddha statue - which is really cool.) Lots of tables and energy in the restaurant. 

Their menu is HUGE, and really fairly priced for their appetizers, dim sum, noodles, etc. The portions are great too, you&apos;ll likely have leftovers. Their main entrees a little pricey, but you can easily avoid them if you aren&apos;t looking to spend a ton of money and get a few smaller plates. The flavors though are poppin&apos; on every meal.

Desserts and drinks are must gets - worth the indulgence. They have really cool Asian influences to them."
5,"The Crispy Calamari salad is one of my favorite salads in the city! Always have a delicious meal at Buddakan, and even with COVID, we had a delightful experience with takeout.

Splurged on the Peking duck dinner for two, and everything was perfectly executed: whole Peking duck served with 5 bao buns, mu shu pancakes, cucumbers, scallions, a large asian Caesar salad, which we swapped out for the crispy calamari salad for a small charge, a light fried rice, and scrumptious wok Gai Lan.

Served as an amazing dinner with leftovers for a terrific lunch."
4,"Fancy Chinese place in Old City. Great dumplings, my and my boyfriend tried the dumpling sample of 2 of each of their 4 dumplings. Then went for the crab fried rice, and still needed a little more so got shrimp bar buns which were out of this world!!! A little pricey, but it had a great ambiance that added to the good food."
4,"One of favorite restaurants in the history of ever. I love Buddkan so giving them less then 5 stars hurts a little. But I believe 4 stars is warranted. 

Had reservations for 4 during COVID. We ate outside not under the make shift seating are they had in the street but on the side walk. It got a little cool and I was thankful for the heat lamps they had. We ordered the dim sum sampler. Our favorites from that was the edamame dumpling and the pork dumpling. So then we ordered another order of just the edamame dumplings. The table got 2 orders of black pepper beef, the wasbi encrusted filet and the char grilled beef. Over all the pepper beef was a hit but all a little 1 texture. The &quot;birdnest&quot; that came with it was kind of odd and hard to incorporate as texture. The char grilled beef &quot;fries&quot; were super crispy and were a good addition to the black pepper beef for texture. The beef was cooked well. The filet I wish had more wasabi crust to it. It was also a bit over cooked which is why I am only giving 4 stars. We got 2 orders of the donuts which were a perfect
Sweet ending to the meal. Hot, sweet and a bit crisp. With the cream and the strawberry sauce mixed on top was like heaven. 

Our server was ok. She was knowledgeable about the menu and was able to answer questions. She rest silverware without being asked. But we did have to ask for water a couple times when we ran out. My sister also didn&apos;t like her drink -legit had 1 sip- and the server didn&apos;t notice she didn&apos;t drink it. Which I guess I&apos;m use to more upscale places like this, they usually ask what&apos;s wrong. But over all yummy meal and I&apos;d come back"
4,"We went on a Tuesday night for dinner and ate outside in the private chalets. The outdoor seating was extremely warm (no jackets necessary) and felt very safe, they did a great job with the setup. We did go on a night on which there were only 3 other tables outside, but the service was great. The servers were extremely polite and quick. We ordered the general tso&apos;s soup dumplings, the chicken and ginger dumplings, slow roasted short rib, wasabi crusted filet, and the whole peking duck. The soup dumplings and the wasabi filet were great and had amazing flavor. The peking duck was good too, the skin was crispy and it came with hoisin sauce and small wraps. The chicken dumplings were okay, nothing special. Same with the slow roasted short rib, we were told it was a new addition to the menu but it wasn&apos;t very good. Overall, the price is a little high for the type of food they serve, but it is definitely a good option for asian fusion."
5,"We came here at the recommendation of a friend. Early on a Sunday evening, it wasn&apos;t crowded. 

Four of us shared a bunch of different things. Food comes out as it&apos;s ready, so this worked well. 

We tried: Tuna Pizza, Tuna Tartare Spring Rolls, Spicy Rock Shrimp Bao Buns, General Tso Soup Dumplings, Lobster Egg Rolls, Wasabi Tuna Tataki, Lobster Fried Rice, and Grilled Lamb Chops. 

My personal favorites were the Wasabi Tuna Tataki, General Tso Soup Dumplings, and the Spicy Rock Shrimp Bao Buns. These were all phenomenal. The Lamb Chops were really good as well. 

The only things I wasn&apos;t a big fan of were the Lobster Egg Rolls and Lobster Fried Rice. Neither were bad, they just lacked flavor in my opinion. 

Most of the plates are pretty small so this was a good amount of food for four people. 

For dessert we got the donuts which were amazing. They were served with a ginger whipped cream and blood orange sauce that I loved. 

We didn&apos;t have trouble finding street parking (time and day helped I&apos;m sure). 

This is a good place to come for some high end Asian food in Philly."
5,"Went here for my 23rd birthday the other night. Great food and drinks! We ordered the Tuna Tartare Rolls (2x), dim sum sampler, edamame dumplings (2x) &amp; the whole Peking duck. I recommend everything except the dim sum sampler. Some of the dumplings were way better than others. Other than that, a lovely experience and a great way to celebrate a birthday!"
4,"GREAT SERVICE !!! Truly enjoyed outdoor dining here. It was an amazing experience all around. The sea bass was delightful. Perfectly cooked and melted in my mouth. The crispy tuna roll was a surprisingly delicious burst of flavor in my mouth. Can&apos;t wait to go back , especially when indoor dining resumes !!! Wanna try everything on the menu :)"
5,Okay wow! Totally impressed by not only the atmosphere but how incredible that staff is. Kurt was our server and he was excellent! Definitely a 5 star rating from me. Can&apos;t wait to come back.
1,"We came here for a birthday dinner last month. We booked a reservation for a party of 8. When we got there, they refused to sit us together because covid restrictions (which they should have said over the phone). The two tables of 4 were spread over 15 feet apart. If they knew we were a party of 8, at least have tables close together ready for us. We asked staff could they at least push it to 6 feet apart and they refused. We mentioned that other tables around us were closer together even with restrictions but they refused. I don&apos;t like how they were not accommodating, flexible or helpful at all. The service was definitely lacking as the server disappeared for long periods of time."
