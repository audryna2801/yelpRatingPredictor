5,"For years I commuted from the suburbs into Center City, and walked by the Rittenhouse Tria (every day), wishing I could go in, but I had a child to take care of at home. Lo and behold, we moved into Washington Square West (when said daughter graduated from HS), and I stumbled upon this location of Tria.  I checked out their menu, and reviews, and quickly got excited to try it. Please be advised that this review is being done during the COVID-19 pandemic, so it does NOT include any comments on regular in-house service, or ambience.

So, I ordered the fig/prosciutto/Gorgonzola salad, mushroom bruschetta and crab stuffed peppers for my husband; the Mozzarella/prosciutto panino for myself. OK, so, we both LOVED our dishes. I did not know that my panino came with a side salad - very fresh and delish! The panino was gigantic, stuffed with mozzarella, prosciutto, pesto, tomatoes, and grilled to perfection on a lovely bread - could either be shared, OR, in my case, 2 meals - gigantic!  The crab stuffed peppers did not sound all that good to my husband, BUT, HE QUICKLY CHANGED HIS MIND AT THE FIRST BITE!!! Fresh lump crabmeat stuffed into red peppers (with a delicious (basil?) sauce.  We both tasted the mushroom bruschetta, and (imagine that), we both enjoyed the earthy flavors of the mushrooms (not sure what type they used (still learning my way around mushrooms), but they were not button mushrooms - shiitake, Cremona???),  and the smooth, melted fontina was a perfect pairing with them. The salad was right up his alley; he adored and devoured it!  We both really enjoyed the prosciutto they use - a little salty, a little sweet - just perfection (obviously imported,  which in our opinion is the very best). He is about to go back onto a low/no carb diet, which helped him lose 100 lbs - now he wants to lose 20 more, so he is going NO carb, and this was a last hurrah - for him. I will continue to order from Tria, and when my husband loses his last 20 lbs, he wants to keep going back for more! We can&apos;t wait for a vaccine, so we can feel safe eating outdoors in nice weather, and seeing what the indoor space has to offer.

Their on-line ordering system was very simple to use. The system did state that it would be 40-45 minutes for pick-up, but I got there early, and expected to wait, but our order was all packed up and ready. The servers at the door asked me to wait for a moment - OK, well, it was REALLY only a moment, while a drink was delivered by one, and a plate delivered by the other. Less than 30 seconds later, I was approached by a very pleasant, smiling young woman, who brought out my order in a matter of 15 seconds. I have long suspected that I would enjoy this place - and I was RIGHT!!!!"
5,"If you read my recent review for Tria Rittenhouse, this one is essentially going to be pretty similar. We once again ordered the Cheesy Package for 2 from Tria&apos;s current takeout menu. This time, we went with pickup instead of delivery because we also wanted some wine. 

Again, everything was packaged so nicely though I will say Rittenhouse had a slight edge because they packaged their side salads separately (not a big deal). This time, we went with two sandwiches, one turkey and one tuna. I asked for aioli on the side for the turkey sandwich but didn&apos;t think to ask for no mayo on the tuna since our sandwich the week before didn&apos;t have any. Turns out, the tuna sandwich does come with mayo and it was on there pretty thick, so it&apos;s something I&apos;ll keep in mind for next time. 

We also switched up our dessert from the flourless chocolate torte the week before to the ricotta cheesecake. I didn&apos;t think the chocolate could be topped but the cheesecake was incredible! Next time, we might have to add on the extra dessert because it will be tough to decide between the two. 

Can&apos;t wait to enjoy Tria in person again but I&apos;m loving their current to-go offerings!"
5,Have been wanting to try this place for a while and finally did! Got to sit at a table outside on the sidewalk. My friend and I each ordered a glass of wine and a charcuterie board to share. The service was pleasant and all employees wore masks. The food was good. The charcuterie board was put together nicely with the food and flavors pairing together well. I look forward to trying this place again soon.
2,"Waitress told us we should have made a reservation because they were &quot;busy&quot; despite the place being empty. Forced gratituty of 20% is a bit outrageous. I get it concept but make it reasonable for customers, 20% is on the high end. Seating is OK but nothing special. Beer selection is good but no happy hour or drink specials. I will not be going back."
2,"Okay place that offers basically a couple of salads and sandwiches. Not really my type of meal but maybe it&apos;s yours. I also hate forced gratuity. I would wait until after the pandemic quiets down to frequent this place. The outdoor seating is cold and unenjoyable. As a bar that offers a limited menu its probably okay. As a restaurant during covid, not so much"
5,"Indoor dining has reopened in Philly, but I still don&apos;t quite feel comfortable. I would prefer to eat outdoors. While other restaurants are limiting their outdoor seating, Tria has made it their mission to keep outdoor dining open. I am incredibly grateful. In addition to their spacious outdoor seating, they have an excellent menu- full of wines and cheeses. Our waitress did a great job of helping us to decide what drinks, apps, and entrees to order. I opted for a Sauvignon Blanc with the PA cheese board. The cheese board included a variety of cheese from soft to hard and all were freshly made in Pennsylvania. As an entree, I had the Turkey Sandwich. It was honestly the best turkey sandwich I have had in my life. The cheese was delicious, the bacon was crispy, and the tomato and truffle-herb aioli was an excellent addition. Next stop- the Rittenhouse location!"
5,"Hands down, BEST turkey sandwich of my life! The turkey was well-seasoned, the aioli was amazing, and the bacon added the perfect extra flavor. Highly recommend getting this when you go! The wine list was not extremely extensive, but this may be because I went during quarantine. The service was great, though, and the outdoor seating was well-shaded with tons of space."
4,"We were on the search for a casual eatery prior to a show at the theater and Tria café fit the bill. We arrived during happy hour which runs from 5 PM to 7 PM. There were no available tables so we opted to sit at the bar. There are also outdoor dining tables. 

The bartenders were very personable and professional. The happy hour menu offered a small selection of $5 wines, beers and snacks. We ordered the cheese and salami appetizer which was ok for five bucks. 

The dinner menu includes salads, sandwiches and small bites. We ordered the roasted beets and goat cheese salad and the roasted turkey ciabatta bread. The salad was fabulous and I didn&apos;t think I was really a beet person. One of the best beet salads I&apos;ve had! The turkey sandwich, served cold, was very tasty and on great bread. A good sandwich is typically all about the bread. 

All in all, Tria café offers some nice food options at affordable prices."
5,"Another great Tria iteration. Awesome draft beer and wine list, and chill spot to hang out outside. The turkey sandwich that is written about as one of the most popular items is as delicious as it&apos;s lived up to be. Great bread, crispy bacon, and awesome for the summer."
4,"Tria Cafe is definitely another great Sunday lunch spot, especially with their Sunday school offers (i.e. day time happy hour). Service may be spotty, so be prepared to ask for the same thing for a few times

Must get: bruschetta (mushroom and goat cheese), mixed green salad, sunday Cheese and wine pairing
Meh: white bean spread, crab stuffed peppers, chocolate torte, bread pudding
Missed: sandwiches

I really loved our time at Tria Cafe, and with some minor gripes, I think everyone should visit this establishment at least one Sunday a year. For my yelp followers, I dislike brunch with its emphasis on different plays on egg and charging an exorbitant amount of money on it. Tria, at least on Sundays, only open at 12pm, making it easier to visit a popular brunch spot without fighting the usual crowd. My favorite dishes at Tria had to be the mushroom bruschetta and the cheese of the day (goat cheese for our visit). I think the blend of the mushroom and cheese worked so well for a toughened, flavored bruschetta and the cheese was served at a very generous portion. As for the other dishes, the crab stuffed peppers looked so great on paper, but was a definite hard pass as it just left me mouth feels: cold and wet - not at all what I  had imagined or liked.

The mixed green salad was probably my favorite &apos;large&apos; dish option that was also easiest on the wallet. The pine nuts and dried figs definitely made each bite a true delight, just wished there was more greens.

As for the dessert, we had ordered the dessert very early on due to an earlier departure, but that request was completely forgotten and we had almost missed our after-lunch appointment. Also, the taste was below expectation, as the bread pudding tasted like a pre-made block of pound cake with unripe banana serving as garnish.

Overall, if you come here for the Sunday School Wine/cheese tasting, it is great! 

Food: 4 stars
Price: 3-4 stars
Service: 3 stars
Ambiance: 3 stars"
5,"Came here with a friend for happy hour. The staff was super nice and accommodating - we waited for a table to clear outside and got our order placed at the bar. 

The inside is beautiful but when it&apos;s nice out, I would definitely suggest snagging an outside table.

We got the amanteigado grande cheese and charcuterie board. Everything paired together wonderfully. The meats were all different and the spreads were different enough to make each combination unique. Food was amazing but I would come back for the service alone. As soon as our bread started to get low our server replaced it before we could even ask. 

Nothing you can&apos;t love about a tasty wine &amp; cheese place!"
4,What&apos;s Philly without it&apos;s iconic Tria cheese and wine cafe.  Went on a Friday lunch with some of my coworkers.  The restaurant wasn&apos;t packed we shared an assortment of cheeses with good company.
5,"Just an update, Tria now has cocktails. We tried the Fig Sour and the Winter Woods. Both were very delicious and very balanced. Just like everything Tria does, the recipes were clearly well thought out before being added to the menu and go really nicely with just about any cheese. This place, somehow, got even better. Didn&apos;t think it was possible.

I just want to reiterate for anyone checking out Tria for the first time. LOOK at the reviews. The restaurant owners/managers answer to almost every single review posted here. They thank people for positive reviews and they offer their personal email and an invitation to return to the restaurant for (the few and far between) negative reviews and actually use the constructive criticism. When is the last time you saw a business do that? Also, this location has been open for more than 9 YEARS. And they&apos;re still doing this! The owners/managers are still that much personally invested into every person&apos;s experience. That should tell you something. Truly warms my cold, cynical heart."
5,"I had dinner here on a Thursday around 6:30pm with the wife and babe. I&apos;m not usually a fan of wine bars and typically the food is very bread heavy. Not ideal for a gluten free non drinker, but in this case, even though there was much of that, there were a bunch of options. 

I ordered the chicken salad and omitted the croutons. When it arrived, I was very pleasantly surprised. The lettuce was super crispy and fresh, the bacon was salty and perfectly cooked, the chicken was moist and plentiful and the farmer&apos;s cheese was so creamy. Ohhh the cheese...there was probably enough cheese on my plate for 2 people&apos;s salads, but I am NOT complaining! The chef must have known that I was going to share some of my cheese with the kiddo and that a few chunks would land on the floor, so they gave me extra. Thanks chef. 

My wife got the tuna sandwich, and I&apos;m very sorry (not sorry) to say that I didn&apos;t ask her about it. If there&apos;s anything on this planet that I will not go near, it&apos;s tuna fish. The woman still insists on eating it! Rude. Regardless, she seemed happy with it and I was nice enough not to complain (this time). Actually that&apos;s definitely a lie. I complained. 

All in all, I&apos;d definitely head back here. Oh and don&apos;t worry, I did clean up the cheese from the ground and the high chair. Who knew scrubbing squishy cheese out of cement with a wipee was really difficult?! So if you dine outside and you see some cheese, I personally apologize (for the child)."
5,"We came by for dinner during a convention in Philly. Absolutely excellent. We got a couple cheese plates and a meat plate and everything was great. The sandwiches were awesome, and I&apos;m told the wine was excellent as well."
4,"It had been years since I dined at this location so when my girlfriend wanted to go here to catch up on a weeknight, I was all for it. 

We arrived just a little before 5pm (happy hour is from 5-7pm) and were ready to indulge in lots of wine and cheese and hoped for some good specials. Sadly, their happy hour deals aren&apos;t very impressive at all, so besides a glass of wine for $5, everything we ordered came off the regular menu.

We started off with a few snacks including Crab-Stuffed Piquillo Peppers, Warm Poached Black Mission Figs and an order of the Pistachio Herbed Ricotta Bruschetta. All three of them were delightful. The bruschetta was my personal favorite. I loved the lavender honey that was drizzled on top. I would definitely return to Tria for that!

We then moved on to ordering two different cheeses which were quickly brought out to the table. The cheese came with a substantial amount of bread and some delicious jam. 

To conclude our evening, we shared the Banana-Hazelnut Bread Pudding with Nutella sauce. Being a huge fan of bread pudding and Nutella, I was very excited about this dessert. Sadly, it didn&apos;t impress. I thought the bread pudding was quite dry. I also didn&apos;t taste much hazelnut. Still, it was a good way to end a few hours spent wining and dining. 

Our waiter was fantastic - so nice and friendly, and also very knowledgeable. We asked him for recommendations on both wine and food a couple different times and he gave us helpful answers each time. 

I would happily return here for another wine and cheese night in the future. I only wish their happy hour was more promising."
4,"Came here for &apos;Sunday school&apos; around 530pm, the place was pretty packed but my friend and I were luckily able to get a table right away.

We got the Sunday school specials of wine (usually around $7) and cheese (around $5), which were nicely chosen and a great value! Though It should be noted that you can only get one glass/cheese per person at the lower price and the next glass will be at the regular price.

It was a fun experience trying out new wines and cheeses in a nice ambience. I&apos;d recommend coming for Sunday school and will be back to try others as well."
3,"I&apos;ve been to every other Tria in Philly at least once so bae and I decided to complete the trilogy on Labor day 2018. 

I&apos;m an unfortunate soul that had to work the morning of LD this year about 45 min outside of the city so we needed a place that was still serving intriguing shit at the awkward time of 3pm. Tria WW was open and seemed to be relatively &quot;lit&quot; at that hour. 

We were seated in the back, I snagged the side of the table where the booth was and COB laid that fine ass in the chair. 

I was impressed by the duration of happy hour deals. I don&apos;t remember the exact hours but it was something extra like 2-7. We both went with one of the $5 red wines. Wine was standard fare. 

We wanted some snackies and are doing the low carb thing so we ordered the herbed olives and some of their cheeses. Tria does appetizers and snacks super well. The olives were delectable. The cheese list to choose from is outrageous, it takes up an entire page which may be problematic if you hate decision-making as much as I. 

The AC was cranked up particularly high on this day and I was absolutely freezing. I slipped my feet from my flip flops and sat on top of my legs to retain some of my body heat. The waitress, no joke, told me that my position was a health code violation.  Uh? I have literally never in my life had this encounter at a restaurant. I&apos;m sure my shoes 4 feet below and underneath the table posed a threat to my or anyone one&apos;s meal. 

Needless to say, I&apos;ll be skipping this place next time."
5,"Love coming here for wine and cheese! The restaurant is on a corner, and in the summer it has wonderful outside seating. Inside there is a bar, high top tables, and regular seating. It&apos;s pretty casual but you can make it as classy as you like!

This is my favorite spot to come to when I&apos;m in the mood for some wine and cheese, such as before grabbing dinner or on a weekend afternoon. They have an extensive wine list with great descriptions of each wine, and the waiters are also very knowledgeable. I&apos;ve loved every wine I&apos;ve tried here. Their menu also features a variety shareable dishes, but I haven&apos;t ventured beyond the cheese plates and charcuterie. They have a list of cheeses broken up into different types. with descriptions for each one. Most recently when I was there with a friend, we asked the waiter to surprise us with five different cheeses. The pieces were quite large and we loved his selection!

Tria is a staple in this neighborhood, and I will keep coming back!"
4,"Bar seats are a must for wine aficionados who want to sample the staffs choice recommendations, people watch and make new friends
We popped in pre sushi dinner and although it was full on a Friday night, a couple conveniently finished up as we were headed in from the cold
Heavy drapes, dim lighting and dark wood embellishments immediately sink you into the mood for a bold red to cozy up to
We were immediately greeted, welcomed and inquired about our taste profile and what kinds of wines we usually like as well as what mood we were in tonight
I&apos;m a fan of reds. The deeper, more unique, rare finds are why we come to Tria
The staff are knowledgeable and personable. This is a must for helping select the perfect glass and encourage me to not only try other styles and origins but to make me want to come back again and again for both the wine and the people
Wash west location is cozy, romantic and also a great spot to catch up with friends or family in a small group setting 
I have yet to eat at this location as we tend to stop in right before dinner but the dishes being passed around us were well plated and enjoyed by all"
