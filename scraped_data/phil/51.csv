5,"Just a good ole cheese steak. We flew in for Labor Day on the jersey shore and had to stop for authentic Philly cheesesteaks!

I got the original and asked what cheese is authentic, the nice cashier lady said cheese wiz or American ..... needless to say I got the Pepper jack haha which was good.

Boyfriend got cheese wiz and enjoyed it. I LOVED the pickles! 

Outdoor seating and porta potties only, but they do have parking!"
5,"Came here as part of our cheesesteak tour of Philly 2020-2021 (temporarily interrupted by Covid but we are back!) Tony Luke&apos;s is the reigning champion right now, with Dalessandros as a strong second. We are still talking about the rolls. I also got chili fries. Get the chili fries!! Be prepared to stand in line for a while, with a large amount of that time out in the elements. I got the chicken cheesesteak (American wit and hot and sweet peppers) and my husband got a regular cheesesteak (American wit and hot peppers). This is the place we will bring visitors whenever people travel again and they say they want to have a Philly Cheesesteak"
4,Good food and good service great place to pickup a quick lunch sandwich was delicious parking was double parked
4,"The pork Italian seemed to be made differently.  The broccoli rabe was layered in the roll then the pork on the outside.  So unless you have a big mouth 1 bite is full of broccoli rabe then the other bite is full of pork.  

That being said you could easily have a sandwich of just either alone!  Delicious!"
3,"I once thought Tony Luke&apos;s was worthy of being above the &quot;tourist trap&quot; designation. 

It had been a while since I&apos;ve been here. I gave them a shot today. 

Whatever was not true then may be true now. 

This wasn&apos;t a bad cheesesteak. There&apos;s nothing wrong with it. But I&apos;ve had a lot of different cheesesteaks in town since I last had an original Tony Luke. 

And now I&apos;m noticing that the beef flavor just doesn&apos;t sit the same way here as other places. I&apos;m noticing that it seems saltier with the cheese. I&apos;m noticing that the flavors don&apos;t seem to marry as well as other places. I&apos;m noticing that it seems to be a little greasier than others. 

There&apos;s nothing wrong with Tony Luke&apos;s. They have many great sandwiches. The rolls are wonderful. 

But as of today, they&apos;ve fallen out of my top 10 in the city. There&apos;s newer places and classic places just doing this sandwich better right now.

2,"Three of us went here looking for really good Cheesesteaks. My wife grew up in the area and now that we live down South, we all had the craving. Unfortunately - this wasn&apos;t the place, although where it&apos;s located reminds me so much of where I grew up.

1. The cheesesteaks were dripping with grease, which is always a bad sign.
2. The mayo tasted like mystery sauce. Not good.
3. The steak was sliced very, very thick. Hello? The steak is supposed to be THIN.
4. The bread was like Wonder Bread. Really? That&apos;s the best you can do?

On top of the above.......
1. The woman who took my money treated me like I was a germ. I grew up in an Italian neighborhood and have eaten at a lot of local places - you don&apos;t get treated like this.
2. There was no one waiting for their order (although plenty were eating) and after I ordered it took 20 minutes to make the Cheesesteaks.

Honestly - try somewhere else."
3,"Maybe I ordered the wrong cheesesteak (hoagie) because I was under impressed. I pictured a well-seasoned cheesesteak with extra cheese, onions, and green peppers. Now, while my sandwich had all of the fixings, the taste was just ok. Further, I was a disappointed that the meat was not finely chopped. Don&apos;t get me wrong, it wasn&apos;t bad, just wasn&apos;t &quot;oh my goodness!&quot; 

I&apos;ve visited Dalessandro&apos;s before, and had a better cheesesteak (hoagie) there...the meat was chopped too! Anyway, definitely visit and come to your own conclusion, but this isn&apos;t it for me."
5,"The &quot;best&quot; cheese steak in Philly is always a subject for debate, but I put Tony Luke&apos;s right at the top. Perfectly seasoned, non-fatty meats with absolutely the best rolls in the city.  One whiz wit from TL always leaves me with a smile. Add the friendly service and self serve tables and it&apos;s nothing hit five stars!"
5,"I literally made a stop in Philly on my way to NY JUST so I could eat a real Philly cheesesteak for the first time in my life. And I&apos;m so glad I chose tony Luke&apos;s bc this cheesesteak was soooooo dank. It came out to be ~$11 bc i think my choice of sharp provolone was an extra $1 or so - idk which cheeses are not extra cost bc I don&apos;t think they stated it. You can get sauteed onions with no extra charge, but other toppings and veggies are extra. I felt like the rib eye steak, cheese, and onion were the only things I needed bc the flavor was AMAZING and it just melted in my mouth. Kinda oily but it&apos;s fine. They also have a condiments bar with sauces if you want - I thought it was equally good plain and with hot sauce. When I went, it was around 3:30pm on a Friday so i didn&apos;t wait in line (although waited 5-10 min for the sandwich itself) but I saw a bunch of ppl form a line after I ate. Ugh I&apos;m craving it again...."
3,Not my favorite cheesesteak spot but not bad either. Ingredients are fresh. However they skimp on everything including meat and toppings.
4,"This place is not bad! I&apos;d definitely come back again. The line for a Philly cheese steak was out the door. This place is crazy packed and for good reason 

Cheesesteak 4/5

Massive cheesesteak sandwich. I had to split it with my boyfriend. The bread was very soft, fresh, and slightly crispy. I got a Philly cheese steak with provolone. They give you a good amount of meat. My only complaint is I forgot the saut√©ed onions. If the onions were added I&apos;d probably give it a 4.5/5. Final Score: 4/5

Curly Fries 4/5

You cannot go wrong with curly fries. They are nice and zesty. 

Chocolate &amp; Strawberry Milkshake 3.7/5 &amp; 4.2/5 

The chocolate shake was really good but the strawberry milkshake was excellent. It tasted like strawberry Nesquik. Would definitely get again :)"
5,"Holy mother of food. Was this the best cheesesteak I&apos;ve had in Philly? It&apos;s so close to Dalessandros for me it&apos;s kinda scary. 

Tony Lukes isn&apos;t like any other cheesesteak though. It&apos;s thickly sliced, heavy layer of cheese, and delicious bread roll truly separate it from the rest.

It also has the best seating area out of any classic cheesesteak spot I&apos;ve been to with plenty of open tables. The steak is also reasonably priced and the cheapest I&apos;ve paid.

Aside from their steaks, there&apos;s a lot of enticing other menus off the menu. My friend got an Italian steak with broccoli rabe and it looked even better than the steak.

Overall, this one of the most satisfying, memorable philly meals I&apos;ve had. I&apos;m definitely going back and recommending this as the go-to spot to friends."
5,Very good Cheesesteak right in the heart of it all. Had all the ambience of South Philly. I will definitely go again.
3,"I took a day trip to Philly in December because I had a cheesesteak craving that just wouldn&apos;t go away.  I tried De&apos;Allessandro&apos;s last time I was in Philly and it was the best I&apos;ve ever had.  I decided to try Tony Luke&apos;s this time.  The place is located on an industrial-ish looking street and I couldn&apos;t really find the parking lot so I parked on the street.  The inside is pretty old and bare bones.  It&apos;s pretty crowded and the metal tables aren&apos;t comfortable.  The service from the workers I interacted with was pretty &apos;order your food and get out&apos; status.  However, there was this older black brother working there who asked me if I wanted hot peppers.  I declined, but that was nice of him to ask.  He was also singing like Marvin Gaye as he was going about his work.  I thought that was cool.

I got a cheesesteak ($9.75) with whiz and fried onions and a soda ($2.25).  Total came out to $12.69.  I was kind of disappointed looking at the cheesesteak when it came out because it wasn&apos;t nearly as meaty as the one I got from De&apos;Allesandro&apos;s.  But the bread they used at Tony Luke&apos;s seemed nice.  I also made the choice of getting cheese whiz because I read that is how you&apos;re supposed to get it (I got swiss at De&apos;Allesandro&apos;s).  I think getting whiz was a mistake though.  It wasn&apos;t too bad, but tasted a little too artificial for my liking.  Also they put a little too much of it on the sandwich.  The onions were good.  I have to say there was definitely an addictiveness to the steak at Tony Luke&apos;s (maybe all the oil) and it was definitely uniquely satisfying.  

All in all, the cheesesteak was definitely good but it could have been much more meatier and the cheese whiz took away from it a bit.  The price was also OK but not great.  This was a hard decision between 3 or 4 stars but I&apos;m going with 3 cause the experience was a little uncomfortable (what I said about the interior and also factoring in the gruffness from the workers that I interacted with except for Marvin Gaye).  

So in conclusion I&apos;m glad I tried this place.  Food was pretty good but maybe a little overhyped."
5,"Italian Hoagie Cheesesteak.  Wow.  My flight had just arrived from TX.  I was starving.  I asked the lady at the rental car place for a recommendation and she did not disappoint.  The sandwich was amazing.  Hot, fresh, tasty, messy, just the way I wanted it.  Great flavor and texture.  Also had the carmelized waffle fries. They were ok but a bit too sweet for my taste buds.  But overall the meal definitely hit the spot."
2,Not what it use to be. The portions were smaller then before and it taste different. Their chicken cutlet sandwich was my favorite. I was excited to get one again but dissatisfied with the food
4,"Best Philly cheesesteak*

Being born and raised in philly, growing up there till I was 18 years old, I consider myself somewhat of a Philly cheesesteak connoisseur.  Tony Luke&apos;s is the best Philly cheesesteak offered by any chain* restaurant. Better than Geno&apos;s and Pat&apos;s by far. 

I ordered a provolone cheesesteak with onions, mushrooms and sweet peppers. Outside of Philadelphia, not many places offer cheesesteaks with sweet peppers!!! Roll eye emoji. Tony Luke&apos;s does it right, and they certainly did it right on this trip.  The sign of a great cheesesteak isn&apos;t just the meat"
2,Ordered ahead to carry out. Ordered 2 orders of fries and 4 cheesesteaks with Whiz. I think it was because it was wrapped up and waiting but they were SO greasy. It was gross. I took a paper towel and whipped some extra grease off and it was still dripping. The meat itself was good. The lettuce in it was 2 large lettuce leaves they were odd Bc not chopped up at all. The hot peppers were HOT. The were a little skimmy on the whiz. The bread was a bit to hard in some spots and soggy in others. The fries were alright. But had not a bit of seasoning on them but they provided salt and pepper. So 1 star for ok fries and 1 for the meat in the cheese steak. But overall I&apos;d head somewhere else for cheesesteaks.
2,"Nothing special. 
Used to be better years ago.  

Greasy. Oily. Rushed . 
Time to move on."
5,"Other then John&apos;s where else are you going to go to get the best Philly?!?

The sitting area sucks, the bathroom is still 2 ports potties outside and the parking sucks!

But the food... the sandwich... the atmosphere and the food!

You don&apos;t go to Pat&apos;s and Gino&apos;s... you go to John&apos;s or Tony Luke&apos;s when you are in Philly. Instead of acting like tourists, make some friends who actually like you enough to take you to the real Philly steak places in Phi"
