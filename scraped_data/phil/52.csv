5,"I am left speechless at this ma-and-pop restaurant, (or should I just say, &quot;mama&quot;) but to sum up my experience: ¡fantástico! 
I learned about it by accident while binge watching Chef&apos;s Table on Netflix, and considering the place is walking distance from my house, I had to check it out.
It was started from a Mexican immigrant chef, and the history behind it is amazing (check out the episode before trying the food, it makes the visit even more magical).
I even bumped into the owner while there right before closing at 3pm on a Saturday, and felt like I was bumping into a celebrity - star struck! But I could tell she was so humble, and just loves what she does and wants to feed the neighborhood!

Now, onto the food...

My friend and I got everything on the menu- and it was all mouthwatering. I enjoyed the taco Pancita most (spicy sausage of lamb offal and turkey) which had the most defined flavor, but the veggie taco was a close second, since it was OVERFLOWING with cauliflower, peppers, potatoes, guac, and others I can&apos;t remember because I gobbled it up too quick. (And for only $3!)
The taco shells are from locally grown organic, non-gmo corn, and it really shows in the taste.
The Agua Fresca (fresh-squeezed fruit juice) of the day was Guava, which was spectacular with a subtle flavor and not too sweet (I don&apos;t believe there was any sugar added- a plus!)

The atmosphere is family friendly with authentic Mexican aesthetic, and the staff speaks Spanish (and I only know a little) so it was a tad confusing getting the food after ordering. 

Process: you get your tacos first from inside, self-serve from three home-made hot sauces, and add cilantro, onions, green peppers, and cactus, sit OUTDOORS and wait for your remaining drinks/desserts/soup in socially-distanced tables. Yay to excellent Covid-prevention measures! Hand sanitizer and napkins at every table. 

Will definitely go there again. If you live in or around the philly area, you NEED to try this place out, and then deal with the struggle of being tempted to go there every weekend following because the food is so filling, yummy, and reasonably priced."
5,"I was in town with some friends for Hijinx music festival and we wanted some GOOD eats. This place happened to be walking distance from our airbnb. This place was on my radar after watching Cristina Martinez&apos;s episode on Chef&apos;s Table. I would consider this place a hole in the wall, but you&apos;ll be able to spot it with the long line. 

The decoration was very homey and vibrant. They did a wonderful job with that. This is a cash only joint that won&apos;t break the bank. After waiting for about 30 minutes, it was finally time to order. First thing you&apos;ll notice is home boy sicing up the barbacoa. You order, receive a ticket, and then hand it over to home boy. Home boy hard at work in his zone, slicing up that good good. That&apos;s what you love to see. 

After taking our seat, we sat around and waited for our food. To my pleasant surprise, Cristina Martinez brought us out our food!! Only in a place like this will you find the humble renowned owner running food on the floor with a bright smile on her face. She was so nice and made sure we got our order in full. Of course, got the barbacoa tacos and they were BOMB. I&apos;m not a big fan of barbacoa and I&apos;ll hardly order it elsewhere, but after all, I am at THE South Philly Barbacoa. I&apos;ve never had barbacoa like this before. SO TENDER and juicy bursting with flavor! The horchata was mediocre, but it got the job done. The salsa wasn&apos;t as spicy as i liked but it had great flavor. I will definitely be back!!"
5,"THE BEST TACOS IN PHILADELPHIA!!!!!!! I used to go every week before the COVID lockdowns, and I recently found out I can do takeout!!!! We enjoyed a beautiful feast at home"
5,"These tacos were amazing, easily one of the best authentic tacos I&apos;ve ever had. Multiple friends recommended South Philly Barbacoa as a place to try! I ordered two taco barbacoa (honestly, should have ordered more - I learned for next time). Tacos were delicious and lamb was tender, flavorful, and juicy. Their corn tortillas are handmade, fresh, and made from organic corn. 

There is a topping bar, where you can add onions, cilantro, guacamole, and sauces (self-serve). One of the few places that doesn&apos;t charge extra for guacamole. Each taco is $4. This place is cash only.

I feel like their taco choices are limited (3 kinds - taco barbacoa, taco pancita, and veggie taco), but I could totally just eat the barbacoa tacos all day. 

Also, I would definitely keep an eye on their hours (only open Friday-Sunday). We actually missed them the first time we were in the area and had to come back the next day (totally worth it though).

Definitely coming back in the future!"
2,"Never again. Bone fragments in my taco. 
I had seen the glowing yelp reviews and read something by Laban praising the place, so it was on my to-try list. Very limited menu. You can order barbecued lamb by the pound or tacos. At $4 a piece, I thought the lamb tacos were pricey, but I decided to try 3. Basically, it&apos;s just the meat on three tortillas. There&apos;s a fixings bar with four choices- cactus salad, hot peppers, chopped onions, and cilantro Plus a choice of red or green sauce. No side with your tacos or anything. 
The problem was when I ate the tacos, I kept biting into hard bone fragments. Total turnoff. I don&apos;t want to have to keep spitting out bone fragments. One time was enough for me. Too many better options within walking distance."
4,"What a great experience! It feels like they have mastered the art of keeping it simple, and making more with less.

Is their menu limiting...yes, but can you find something worth trying...absolutely? They have an equal share of options that are vegetarian and meat. For meat, their main focus is on the lamb &amp; pork tacos. I tried both, and felt that one was not exceedingly spicer than the other. 

You can appreciate though as you walk in, when it comes to meat, they are focusing on that one style of cooking (barbacoa) and usually only one or two meats at most. So all of the flavor, seasoning, thought into their menu and offerings is mastered on this. They have a little cart set up inside with all of the additives for the taco (peppers, hot sauce, onions, cilantro, etc.) 

These truly tasted spectacular. You could still taste that gaminess flavor of the lamb, but it paired so well with the spice and heat of which it was cooked with. 

We also tried the vegetarian tacos, which I thought were top notch. The base was heavy on collard greens, onions, mushrooms, but had the texture and filling to be satisfying despite it not being meat.

We ordered the quesadillas, which were just okay. They were pretty greasy, but FILLED with some sort of neutral tasting cheese. These tasted great dipping in their soup or adding hot sauce to them.

Lastly, we ordered the sweet tamales - this was a first time experience and they did not disappoint.  I could eat for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

The restaurant was empty inside due to covid, but you can tell it is full of culture, history, and hardwork. There are some cool photos on the walls, and bright colors with glass/mirror mosaics. 

Service was friendly and overall, our experience was fantastic."
3,"Overhyped? Maybe I went in with my expectations too high. I was expecting to be blown away considering they were featured on Netflix&apos;s chef&apos;s table and are James Beard award winners. There was a line but it went super quick and they have a nice cute seating area. The pineapple drink was delicious. The barbacoa was whatever in my opinion. Yes, it was super tender but I feel like the flavor was lacking. I enjoyed the lamb more than the barbacoa. Way more flavor in my opinion. Overall, not sure if I would go out of my way again!"
5,"South Philly barbacoa is a absolutely the best taco joint in all of Philly. This place always have a line wrapped around the building. I happen to be in the area around closing time and to my surprise there was no line! I had literally just finished eating lunch but couldn&apos;t miss out the opportunity. Those are the best barbacoa tacos I&apos;ve ever had! My favorite thing about this place is the owner.  She is extremely nice and caring. She was greeting sitting customers, giving us free dessert and cleaning tables. Such a nice humble woman. I encourage everyone to try south Philly barbacoa and waiting in line IS worth it."
4,"tried the amazing, notoriously good lamb tacos.. one question, have you had a lamb taco before? I have because I went to this place and it was tender, not too gamey.. pretty interesting

the only thing is it could&apos;ve used a little more salt for the meat.. but indeed a good one that you have to try if you&apos;re here

you stand in line and order, get a seat outside and they&apos;ll call you to go inside the restaurant to pickup your food, and then you&apos;ll help yourself to condiments and carry your food back outside to your table

Enjoy

The End"
5,"My goodness, I&apos;ve been here 3 times and every single time, the food is SOLID. The owners were featured on Netflix&apos;s Chefs Table and they did not disappoint. From the tortilla which is made from a corn that they grow to the barbacoa, they deliver every - single - time. The owners, both Christina and her Husband are friendly, being gracious enough to take photos with out of towners and chat with them when they can. All of this while constantly moving the line forward. I found them both pleasant. Even if I&apos;m not hungry and I&apos;m in Philadelphia, I stop there to take the food back to MD with me."
5,"This place is rich with history as well as rich with delicious flavor. Ive been to Mexico a few times (from the city to southern region of Veracruz and puebla) and each place i went to, Ive always tried tacos. This place is the exact type of flavor and texture as i had back in the native land. 

This kind of authentic food is hard to come by and it is in the heart of northern liberties. (I am super honored to know that such cuisine exists here). Let&apos;s started with different components: 

The tortilla: it is handmade with locally grown corn. You can take the love and work that was put into making this tortilla. Each bite is full of flavor just in the tortilla in itself. 

The barbacoa: needless to say, this is the main entree and hero of the tacos. Super succulent, juicy, flavorful, and tenderness to the point where as soon as it touches your mouth and tongue; it breaks and releases the aura of goodness amount your taste buds. Enough said 

The rest (cactus, cilantro, onion, lime): you get plenty of these to fill your tacos so that the taste is maximum. 

Special addition: consome (soup). Don&apos;t sleep on this; very balance between a mild spice that tingles your tongue yet warm and fragrant enough that you want to keep eating spoonfuls. 

This was my first experience here. Ive been told that they have shows such as chef&apos;s table featuring them. Not knowing who they were, what they stood for, I didn&apos;t have any expectations. I was blown away by the food as well as hospitality. For the chef herself to come and greet us as well as make an effort to chat and get to know us; this place is on another level for Mexican food. 

I would travel from another state to come and eat in this place again if i had to (heck i drove over an hour to try it already so...)"
5,"Went on a Monday morning around 10am and there were no crowds! Make sure you pick a day/ time, because SPB will close when they sell out! 

We tried the lamb and beef tacos, as well as the guac and soup. The lamb tacos were absolutely phenomenal and definitely the best out of everything we ordered. Love that the tacos are simple (self-serve for toppings) because it makes you appreciate the lamb so much more! Each taco is super filling - I was full after the 2 tacos I had. Hope to come back the next time I&apos;m in Philly!"
5,"Recently saw the Chef&apos;s Table episode featuring South Philly Barbacoa and had to make the trip. The first time that boyfriend and I stopped by (around 4 PM on a Friday) they had sold out, but we came around noon the next day (Saturday) and were successful. 

The tacos were amazing, and I loved the pineapple agua Fresca, which was only $2. Love that you can pay with Venmo, and the staff member helping out with the line was super nice. 

Definitely recommended for inexpensive and delicious tacos!"
4,"A must-try given all the praise, media buzz, and backstory. Love this gem in Philly and had high hopes. Although the barbacoa was good, it wasn&apos;t the level I expected from maybe the unfairly intense hype. I loved the tortillas, which are clearly of a step above quality. The barbacoa had a lot of small bone bits in it though, which made it difficult to enjoy. But with still-reasonable prices and friendly service, it&apos;s something I would always recommend to visitors."
3,"I just don&apos;t get the hype for this place. I was in town visiting my little sis at Penn and decided to check this out after finding it on a list of best restaurants in Philly. I hadn&apos;t seen the Ugly Delicious or Chef&apos;s Table episodes at the time although I watched the latter after I went and will say that the chef&apos;s story is incredible. It did make me appreciate the place a little more. 

There was a line when we went but it moved fairly quickly. Maybe spent 20-25 minutes or so in line total. The ordering experience is WILDLY confusing, and the employees don&apos;t seem keen on helping. We were kind of unsure of where to stand or pick up food or really do anything the whole time, and the only instruction we were given was delivered as fairly curt commands. 

The tortilla is unbelievable which, after having seen the Chef&apos;s Table episode, now makes sense. However, the barbacoa was just okay? I didn&apos;t think it had a ton of flavor although it was very tender, and I found two small, sharp bones in the meat. It could have potentially even been a danger had I swallowed one mistakenly. They had some pickled veggies and salsas to accompany the tacos which were just fine. I ordered a horchata as well which was delicious and very flavorful. 

Glad I went, probably won&apos;t go back."
5,"I had heard of this place even before it was featured on David Chang&apos;s Ugly Delicious but never found the time to attempt and beat the long line. Finally, I decided to wake up early on one Friday but before that there was confusion in terms of their hours of operation. Please refer to the schedule I attached to avoid any confusion - it comes straight from their front door. 

We went 830am on a Friday and although the place was still packed, we thankfully did not have to wait very long in line. This was the PERFECT time to come as I have heard of friends waiting over an hour. 

There was only one thing to get here and it&apos;s the best tacos in Philadelphia period. The Barbacoa Tacos come with a fresh corn tortilla that you can top with whatever salsas, vegetables, and herbs you want. We ordered the Familia Style for 3 of us and had to order extra tortillas in the end because of how much we enjoyed it. The consome soup served is a delicious lamb broth that is a bit spicy and I could drink it all winter."
4,"Having been featured on @netflix&apos;s Chef&apos;s Table (loved the story), I expected Cristina Martinez&apos;s restaurant to be packed with tourists. And since I was in the vicinity, I wanted to drop by to witness the throng. I did not expect it to be so quiet, but it meant I could have a bite of lamb (yay)! 

The barbacoa taco itself was pretty authentic - tender, non-gamey meat and a handmade corn tortilla (you can taste the difference). The garnishes tasted very fresh. I liked the consomme better, perfect for a cold day. But overall, I wouldn&apos;t say it was mind-blowing; it&apos;s equivalent to the tacos one can get in Mexico."
5,"Honestly a wonderful experience- I think the customer service was superb and made the already great food taste even better. 

Our server gave us a free taco to sample when we didn&apos;t know what one of the entrees was and it was so yummy we ended up getting it! We got a small family combo and it was a ton of food for 3 people. It comes with 2 choices of meat, toppings, and 2 soups. They even gave us extra tortillas for free when we ran out! 

Lamb was so tender, but the spicy pork really stole the spotlight. I loved the flavors and the freshness of the toppings really brought the tacos together. I ended up eating like 10 tacos I think- dying now but it was worth it. 

The horchata is also spectacular- I think that is what I remember the most. Perfect flavor and really helps to tone down the spice. 

At the end our server brought us some sweet tamales on the house and they were also delicious! Honestly such a great experience here that I will definitely be coming back. Maybe we got special treatment since we were here at like 9am and they were just giving away stuff since were early or looked lost, but either way, I&apos;m loving this place. Street parking is available if you look around."
4,"This was one of the last places I got to try before leaving Philly for a while. I was starving so naturally instead of ordering just a couple tacos here and there, I decided to just go for the 1/2 kilo. First of all, the menu just said 1/2 kilo of meat...I had no idea what kinda of meat this entailed. Jesus take the wheel. I ordred ahead on the phone and 20 min later, came to pick it up in person. they did ask us to wait another 5-10 minutes when we got there but please give them a break. It is blazing hot and they have mob of hangry people breathing down thier necks. Step off.  

Some people hate self assembly, but honestly I like being able to customize each taco because I can be a control freak at times. From what I gather the meat is that of a lamb. it was pretty gamey, as lamb naturally is, so if you don&apos;t like that maybe opt for the chicken instead. It was super soft and although not as flavorful as I would&apos;ve liked it to be, I appreciated that it wasn&apos;t super salty because that&apos;s definitely the worst.  For sure, check this Philly staple."
4,"The tacos were good, a couple bones I think that I had to spit out. I got a taco of each, lamb, spicy lamb and the vegetarian. The lamb was my favorite, spicy lamb was my second favorite (it was not spicy) and I don&apos;t suggest getting the vegetarian one. Small place and sucks w/ COVID that you can&apos;t sit down to enjoy."
