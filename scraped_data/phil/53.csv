5,"I ate their Reuben last Thursday!!!! And I have to say that I am very surprised my pregnant self didn&apos;t want to get more. Their homemade sauce for the sandwich makes it even tastier. I always last by the Dutch Eating Place and never ordered because I would stare at the menu wondering what is good among all of their selections... next up, I need to try their pancakes and something agreeable with my baby belly. Haha. The workers are all very friendly. Of course during this pandemic you cannot eat inside yet, I think Jan 15 that Philadelphia will lift the restrictions. I just wish their fries were a little different though... I am extremely picky. Definitely want to come here again. While their sauerkraut helped my cravings with sour foods, I would definitely ask for a pickle on the side with your sandwich! 

Unfortunately I didn&apos;t have a picture. It was WAY too delicious and hot for me to wait and take a photo."
5,"Found this place located in the Reading Terminal Market while Yelping! The entire market is pretty big so you may need to walk through the aisles to find this place. Our food came out super quickly and was cheap for its quantity and quality. Food tasted like homey breakfast. 

Would definitely recommend this place if you are looking to grab breakfast in the area. FYI there is limited seating but you&apos;re able to order takeout and sit at the common areas."
5,"This is one of the best breakfasts I have ever had. Even though indoor seating was not allowed during the pandemic, the food was great on the streets on Philly. I had the apple dumpling and scrapple (clich√©, I know) and everything was great. I&apos;d say that this place definitely deserves the acclaim it has been given!"
3,"Heard about this place and passed it many times while shopping at the Reading Terminal. I planned to dine here on this day. 

Restaurant: clean.  Practiced social distancing. 

Service: Our server was nice and pleasant.  

Food: I ordered Turkey sausage, scrambled eggs with cheese and French toast.  My food was luke warm. Our server offered to heat up on the gri but that didn&apos;t sound sanitary.  I didn&apos;t taste cheese eventhough my server said there was cheese.  The French toast was ok. I also ordered strawberry lemonade and tcast was delicious. 

Overall I wasn&apos;t impressed with my meal. I may go back and try something different."
3,"Review of Apple dumpling only! 
I thought the Apple dumpling here was underwhelming for what it was hyped up to be. It tastes exactly as you imagine it would taste like and seems not much different from what I could get at any kind of fair or festival. It doesn&apos;t taste bad, but also was not very special. Good option for people that enjoy baked apple desserts though!"
5,Ordered the famous apple dumpling for the first time this weekend and it was amazing! My boyfriend and I devoured the dumpling so fast and talked about it for the rest of the day. Our waitress was the absolute sweetest and was just so happy. She preferred whip cream over heavy cream so we went with that and it was amazing. My experience here was great! I cannot wait to come back and try the blueberry pancakes and grab another apple dumpling
5,"Yum! We ate way too much! Such a cute little place inside the reading terminal market! Very cool to watch the girl working the stove, she made delicious food, I got the blueberry pancakes special! Very good, though could have cooked a little longer and we ended with the hot apple dumpling with heavy cream! Which was amazing!  Wayyyyy too big of portions so would definitely recommend splitting!"
5,"Looking for homemade apple dumplings, you can buy them ready to eat ($5 each) or frozen ($8 and u get 3 pieces)
I have been buying from this store for the last 8 years, they simply keep their recipes consistent and you can taste quality raw materials on all of their products.  You have to go early, otherwise visiting after 12pm may mean they are running low or they are out of product. They are located inside the Reading Terminal Market."
5,"Enjoy your breakfast or lunch here!  The pancakes are delicious, especially the pumpkin pancakes that they serve around Thanksgiving. I like to get scrapple, too. At lunch, I like to have the specials, particularly the ham loaf.  The Reuben is always a menu item, and it is great, too, especially with fries.

I tried the turkey burger and 1/2 order of french fries. The turkey burger was fabulous. Most places have dry turkey burger, but this one was not dry!  I went on a Thursday at 3:00 p.m.  This was a time that The Reading Terminal Market is not crowded, unless a big convention is in town. 

The family who owns the restaurant is super nice. All of the servers are down-to-earth and friendly."
3,"So had to try this place out for the famous apple dumpling and also just a reuben sandwich cause by the time we got here it was lunch time. Granted, I should have just splurged and went for the blueberry pancakes, next time.

The place is very Pennsylvania Dutch, from the outfits and service to the menu. Almost like you got transported out of Reading Terminal, almost. You can sit st the bar or you can order at the cashiers to take food to go so its a pretty good place to stop and grab food if you&apos;re on the go or if you wanna sit a bit and people watch.

Food wise I didn&apos;t think anything was that special. The reuben was good. Greasy in the excellent hangover food kind of way, salty, acid from the sauerkraut and dressing, crispy toasted rye. The corned beef was sliced almost too thin for my tastes, it was good corned beef, don&apos;t get me wrong, I just like thicker slices a la Langers in LA (except yes, I know that&apos;s pastrami). Got a side of fries cause this fatty can almost never resist a side of fries. Fries are fresh cut but a little soggy for my personal preference. I&apos;m a fresh, crispy fry kinda guy.

Now that famous apple dumpling... its probably just me but I&apos;m not the biggest fan. My friend and I both thought it was a bit on the soggy, mushy side. It had a good apple cinnamon flavor and the whipped cream brought in a bit of fresh creamy sweetness but texture wise it just felt like baby food. Flavors were all great but I think I wanted a bit of crunch or flakiness like you&apos;d expect in a pie. But again, I think that&apos;s a personal preference.

Overall, I think this is a good place for a grab and go or a short sit down and people watch. There&apos;s definitely lots of options around Reading Terminal though so feel free to look around before making a final decision."
4,"This place is located in Reading Terminal Market. I went on a Saturday morning, so it was packed. On a weekend, this isn&apos;t an ideal place to sit, but it would be great for takeout. There wasn&apos;t much seating in the area.

We ordered a hot apple dumpling, which was INCREDIBLE. It was warm, delicious, and filling. I would definitely recommend this, and I believe it is one of their more popular items. Next time, I would either get one to go or go on a weekday to avoid the huge crowd. Overall, I would highly recommend this."
5,"This place is a Center City gem. They have so many dishes, but my go-to is the hot turkey sandwich. They smother it with gravy and serve it with a side of mashed potatoes and a dab of cranberry sauce. It is THE BEST!! The Dutch Pennsylvanians know how to hook up a plate! Also, you can get their delicious apple dumplings hot or cold. If you&apos;re ever in downtown Philly, make sure you pay them a visit. They&apos;re a lunch counter in the Reading Terminal Market (it&apos;s a big space with lots of different food vendors) behind Market Street. You won&apos;t regret it."
5,"In Reading Market, the Dutch Eating Place serves local Pennsylvania Dutch comfort food. Reasonable prices and large serving sizes, some so large I take half to go. You can order to go or sit down at a counter to eat there. I had the chicken pot pie for a great lunch.

A favorite I always return for are the apple dumplings with heavy cream."
1,"I ordered pancakes and it tasted extremely floury. My potatoes were completely hard. I tried several times biting it but it wasnt edible. No one likes to waste their money but I definitely felt that I wasted mine here. Nothing was worth what I paid. 

There wasn&apos;t enough effort nor skill put into the dishes. Unfortunately I will not be coming back here again. 

Parking is tough because it&apos;s in reading terminal. And it is hard to find a seat most times."
2,"I saw this place had a lot of good reviews and awards, so had high expectations. I ordered the cinnamon apple French toast, there was no apple at all in the French toast, just cinnamon sprinkled on the top. Very disappointing, I am not sure if I went on an off day? Otherwise I have no idea why this place is so popular, it must just get a lot of tourist food traffic or something. 

On the plus side the customer service was very prompt and friendly. However I would not come back because of the food. I should have just gone to ihop."
5,"While I worked/lived in Philly for a year and a half, the Dutch Eating Place was my choice 3 out of 5 days a week, maybe more depending on the specials!

I&apos;ve had the burger, sloppy joes, a bucket load of turkey with mashed potatoes and the pancakes that are so large it was folded in quarters in the box.  

Yum - I finished it all without a togo box - which explains why I never had room to try the famous apple turnover!  Next time I will."
5,"We hadn&apos;t planned on eating here but decided on them as the place was packed.  A line is a good sign!  

ATMOSPHERE:
They&apos;re located inside of the Reading Terminal Market.  A good-sized countertop snakes around the kitchen with a takeout counter on one side.  The place was jam-packed with a constant line that moved quickly.  If you don&apos;t like communal dining, this place isn&apos;t for you.  

MENU:
Pancakes, French toast, eggs, hot &amp; cold sandwiches, soups, pot pies, burgers.  Lunch starts at 10:30am, including daily specials. 

FOOD:
Mushroom &amp; Cheese Omelet - $5.95
There was a real earthy flavor, but I couldn&apos;t tell if it was coming from the fresh mushrooms or cheese.  The omelet was packed full of said ingredients and a bit on the runny side, a positive for me.  

Home Fries - $2.25
I gotta learn how to make this at home!  The rough chops of potato had textures of soft and crunchy pieces which made for a true homemade taste.  Seasoning was left up to the consumer, so I added salt and pepper and was good to go. 

Hotcake - $2.75, 1 pc.
It was everything I had imagined; fluffy and moist with a creamy batter.  Big portion too. 

SERVICE:
As you stand in line, a worker goes down the line asking how many is in your party and seats everyone according to availability.  Naturally, smaller parties get in and out quicker. 

The gal we had was so friendly and patient despite the busyness.  That&apos;s how you do it!

CONDUCT:
Don&apos;t be like this rude, salt &amp; pepper-haired man in a blue business suit that cut in front of the entire line because &quot;he eats there daily&quot;.  The women next in line heckled him for it!  LOL. 

OVERALL:
Affordable, tasty, great service from start to finish.  Don&apos;t let the long line deter you from a great breakfast as it moves quickly!"
5,"Every Philadelphian knows Dutch Eating Place is a must-visit when visiting Reading Terminal Market. If it wasn&apos;t already apparent by the multitude of reviews, this place is the bees knees. As someone who has been eating here for coming up on 5 years, here&apos;s my guide to Dutch Eating Place: 

When to go -- THEY ARE CLOSED ON SUNDAYS! But when they&apos;re open, lines get long and there aren&apos;t great places to stand, not to mention sit. Go early (like 8-9 am) or later in the afternoon 12-2 pm to avoid the breakfast rush. Do note that breakfast ends around 2 pm. I suggest someone in your party scout out seating (it&apos;s quite difficult at RTM, especially for more than 2-3 people) while the other orders. 

What to order -- They have great breakfast specials listed out that are huge portions. I suggest everyone in your group orders something different and you share. My personal favorites are: 

1) the apple dumpling which feeds about 2 people (no heavy cream for me, they really drench it in that stuff)
2) the bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich (also very heavy and can feed two)
3) the apple cinnamon french toast special, which includes OJ (MUST TRY THE OJ!)

Everything in their menu that I&apos;ve tried thus far pretty great! It&apos;s a great deal and also a lot of food, cooked right with friendly service. Enjoy! 5/5"
4,"This place is situated in Reading Terminal (which by the way is an awesome place to just roam around).  Because of the tight quarters, be prepared to wait in line if you don&apos;t come right when this place opens (I think it&apos;s 8am).

What we ordered from the menu:
1) 2 eggs with sausage, wheat toast - $4.95 as of 7/2019.
Highlight was definitely the sausage which had a great smokey flavor to it.

2) French Toast Special - $7.99 as of 7/2019
The french toast was spectacular.  Crisp exterior with a light, fluffy interior.  The orange juice was also a surprise because it was so darn fresh!

3) Side of bacon - $2.75
It&apos;s bacon!

Given the popularity and close quarters, be prepared to order, eat and scoot!"
5,"Our whole bill for a family of 4 with drinks was under $40 for four of us.  We all left this place in agreement that it was probably the best breakfast place we had ever visited.  I would suggest even splitting meals, especially if you get pancakes.  They were so big they couldn&apos;t fit on the plate.  
If you are in Philadelphia this place is a must!"
