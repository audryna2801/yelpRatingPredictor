5,"Growing up in NYC, I was raised on corned beef &amp; pastrami from Katz&apos;s on Houston Street. Hershel&apos;s meets the same standards. Their pastrami is moist and delicious, corned beef the same. And they don&apos;t skimp on how much they put in their sandwiches, my wife and I can share a Pastrami on marble rye from Hershel&apos;s and not have room for anything else! Don&apos;t miss Hershel&apos;s take out when you visit Reading Terminal."
5,"I got a delivery from Hershel&apos;s that included corned beef, fresh roasted turkey and beef brisket.  All of the meats were great.  I used the corned beef to make the best corned beef hash I&apos;ve ever had in addition to a couple of sandwiches.  The photos here are from my making the corned beef hash.  

The delivery was brought from Reading Terminal Market by Mercato and it showed up a couple of items short.  When I noted this in an online review, Steve, the Hershel&apos;s owner called me personally very quickly and made the whole thing right.  

So great quality meats and great service.  Thanks, Steve!"
5,"The pastrami Reuben has so much meat it falls out the sides. It drips of flavor and bad caloric decisions and I&apos;m here for it! All ingredients are extremely fresh and make a tasty combination that keeps you wanting just one more bite. 

Hershels has quick, friendly service and a superb product. Worth a stop while in Reading terminal."
4,"This is why Herschel&apos;s is perfect for a guy like me. 

I don&apos;t eat as much now due to bariatric surgery. But I can enjoy some good meats and a little bread. So the fact that they will make a half sandwich is perfect for me and my wallet. 

They still give you a great amount of meat. So you won&apos;t go hungry. 

The pastrami is excellent. Very juicy, tender, and just enough flavor. Maybe not best I&apos;ve ever had but that might be too high a bar. It is definitely satisfying. 

I have several go to spots in the market. Herschel&apos;s is definitely on that list now."
5,"My go-to deli and an absolute must-have when visiting Reading Terminal. The pastrami reuben and rachel are both phenomenal sandwiches, but the rachel is my personal favorite. The kugel and Jewish apple cake are also tasty and made fresh daily. They even have Junior&apos;s Cheesecake from New York. Need I say more?"
3,Me being from Detroit corned beef is very serious &quot;Look up Lou&apos;s Deli in Detroit.&quot; Since this was listed as one the best delis in the city I had to try it.  I will say the portion size was pretty decent for $13 with .50 for cheese. As far as quality it was on the fatty side for me. I got it grilled but all in all the taste didn&apos;t blow me away. I honestly will say I can get more meat at Fresh Grocer on Market St. Their portions are stupid and it&apos;s only $8.50. The corned beef tastes better to me from there. Just my opinion. I&apos;m definitely going to go back but try the pastrami because I may be biased on the corned beef.
5,"Stopped by Hershel&apos;s for breakfast over the weekend and they did not disappoint. The pastrami/egg/cheese sandwich on rye is where it&apos;s at. I ordered the Turkey bacon/egg/cheese on rye, which was also good but do yourself a favor and order pastrami/corned beef. I feel like a tiny bit of Russian dressing would&apos;ve been nice since they stack the sandwich with meat. Overall 10/10"
5,"What can i say... didn&apos;t think I would ever find a pastrami sandwich that I would love as much as Katz&apos; in NY!

It&apos;s located inside the Reading Terminal and the must eat!

I definitely would recommend getting it with the special sauce, cheese and coleslaw! The bread is fresh and toasted on a panini press which melts the cheese and makes the bread crunchy and warm!

The moisture level in the pastrami is next level amazing! Everyone overhypes the roast pork sandwich next door... but it is greatly exaggerated and doesn&apos;t even compare.

If you are struggling with which is the must have sandwich... it is definitely the pastrami at Hershel&apos;s."
4,"Hershel&apos;s is the perfect place to go when you&apos;re hangry-level hungry or want to split a very filling sandwich with a buddy. I got the pastrami club sandwich - with mustard, never mayo - which is thick layers of juicy pastrami accented with lettuce/tomato (so crucial) and toast. It was so hearty that I ended up saving half for next day&apos;s lunch. A Hershel&apos;s sandwich is not for the feint of heart. Cheesesteak who?

(It would be 5 stars if the takeout packaging was more environmentally friendly.)"
5,"Ahhhh Philly. City of HOLY CRAP THAT BUM JUST PUNCHED THE CRAP OUT OF THE OTHER ONE!!!
Ahem. Sorry. Ahhhh Philly. The city of brotherly love. Birthplace of a nation. And the city of cheese steak sandwiches, right? 

Wrong. You get a Reuben. Yes. That&apos;s right. I said it. Forget the overhyped cheese steak sandwich. You walk to Reading terminal, bypass all the useless other places, and you grab a seat at Hershel&apos;s order a full Reuben Sammich, a cup of matzah ball soup, and you get to work. 

Good luck fitting the whole sammich in your mouth. It is like a cow with a cracker on both sides. You will need multiple napkins to eat this monster. Which is a good thing. I always say that the best meals require the most napkins. 

The booth is a total dive. Just don&apos;t let looks fool you. The staff are extremely friendly and the food is deadly good. 

Easily a rock solid 5 stars."
5,"Before you get a philly cheese steak sandwich, I recommend coming here. Hands down the best pastrami sandwich ever if you&apos;re in Philly. I think it&apos;s better that Katz tbh."
5,"Of all the &quot;essential Philly eats&quot; I have tried this weekend, I would put Hershel&apos;s at the top of my list! 

After waiting in a surprisingly short line, the fiance and I ordered a hot sandwich, half pastrami half brisket, famous hershel style. Seeing New York Egg Cream on the menu (for the first time after seeing it from a food network show), I decided to go for one just to try it out. 

THICK layers of meat was piled between two marbled rye bread, with some sauerkraut snugged in to make you feel *slightly* better about eating so much meat. The meat was very juicy and the rye bread toasted just right! I would have to say though, the pastrami meat was better than the brisket as it was more juicy and flavorful. I&apos;m sure it was because we split a sandwich, but every bite was heavenly and I&apos;m so glad we tried Hershel&apos;s after trying another sandwich place just moments before!

And as for the NY egg cream, IT WAS AMAZING! For those who&apos;s never had it before, it tasted similar to a chocolate milk shake, except not as thick. Though the sandwich was great, the egg cream was definitely the cherry on top! 

This is the one restaurant I would re-visit should I be back in Philly again!"
4,"Hershel&apos;s had been on my &quot;to try&quot; list in Reading Terminal Market for years by the time I finally checked it off last week. It suffered partly from extreme proximity to my favorite sandwich spot in the whole market, DiNic&apos;s, which has lured me in with it&apos;s intoxicating garlic &amp; pork aroma a number of times I was considering Hershel&apos;s. Hershel&apos;s itself does very solid business, so long lines had also scared me off in the past.

I finally stopped in on a Thursday night and did what seemed like the only right first move there - ordered a corned beef Reuben. It was very good and I would definitely eat it again, but I have to say that after all of the anticipation that I had built up, it still managed to just every so slightly disappoint. 

The meat was excellent, and standing in line while it was prepared, I found myself fantasizing about pigging out not only on the corned beef brisket my sandwich was carved from, but also the pastrami and brisket ones nearby. The portion of meat is generous and makes a very filling sandwich. But for much of my meal (the Reuben came with two pickle spears that complimented it nicely) I did feel that the corned beef was so abundant that it was masking the flavors of the Russian dressing, sauerkraut, and cheese. Now a sandwich bursting with delicious meat is hardly anything to complain about, but I did order a Reuben because I wanted all aspects of its flavor profile and so there were bites where I wished I tasted some sauerkraut. 

That said, I enjoyed and was satisfied by my sandwich and expect that I will order from Hershel&apos;s again, if nothing else to sample those other meats."
4,"Corn beef Ruben: 4 Out of 5
Meat loaded sandwich fresh off the griddle! Make sure you have some liquids to wash down all of this richness. Perfectly seasoned brisket &amp; it melted apart as I picked up to grab a bite! The only thing I wish was that they gave us more of the of the sauerkraut and a pickle on the side. 

Service: 5 Out of 5
The guys that helped us were on point. We were waiting for about a couple minutes and one of the line men took our order &amp; got us rolling. Within 10 minutes we put in our order and left to eat our hot of the press ruben.

Environment: 4 Out of 5
Busy environment on the weekends. It&apos;s a grab and go situation most times I come here. We chose to eat outside in the Marriott courtyard across the street. 

Overall:  4 Out of 5
The sandwich itself was $12.75 out the door. Coming back to try the pastrami Ruben!"
5,"What can I say besides fantastic sandwiches.
We got the pastrami and corned beef sandwiches. Both of there were amazing. Meat was flavorful, tender, juicy.
They pile the meat high. Definitely worth the stop!"
5,"While I was in Philly, I swung by the Reading Terminal Market for a quick bite.  Turns out that I got there just as the whole market was closing, which was only at 6 pm.  I found Hershel&apos;s East Side Deli, and I gave it a try.  They were very nice to still be serving even though the whole market was about to close.

Really quickly I just ordered the corned beef on rye with Russian dressing.  I just found the meat to be so incredibly tender and flavorful.  It really melted in my mouth, and I can still taste it now.  The rye bread wasn&apos;t anything special, but it didn&apos;t matter as a whole.  I would definitely go there again."
5,"The food here is magically delicious!
I&apos;ve had the Pastrami and Corned Beef Sandwiches from here twice and they have been sooo good!
Perfect cut of meat for each sandwich.

I normally stop through here when leaving Philly and I take these bad boys home to heat an eat and I swear it takes me 3 days to eat 1 sandwich... I ain&apos;t lying!!

This place is located in the Terminal Market so it is very hard to pass up all the others to get here but do yourself a favor and get at least something to take home w you! 
You will not be disappointed and it tastes the same.. TRUST!!!"
4,"Be prepared to stand in line. It&apos;s a popular spot. Every time I travel to Philly, I stop by Hershel&apos;s to get the Reuben. Laden with corned beef, the meat is succulent and plentiful. It even has the right amount of Russian dressing that adds to hefty and delicious sandwich. 

."
1,Not very good at all.  I know delivery can be tough but the chicken salad had no taste and the pastrami was fatty.
4,"Re-visted Hershel&apos;s on memorial day weekend (a surprisingly not crazy busy weekend for Philly) and got to try their pastrami sandwich again PLUS the BRISKET sandwich

You definitely want to order your sandwich TOASTED! 
---pastrami sandwich: still good!!
---brisket sandwich: wouldnt have thought to order this, it was almost a mistake, but glad we did! They recommended it with a bit of bbq sauce which paired well with the meat which was very moist!

Meat was all cooked perfectly but could have used a tad bit more flavor"
