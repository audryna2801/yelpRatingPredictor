5,"One of the best Italian meals I&apos;ve ever had and really great service. I didn&apos;t have reservations around dinner time on a Friday evening but it was early enough the waitress was able to seat me in their very comfortable outdoor street eatery tables. The waitress explained the Covid measures- please keep the mask on when the staff enters and the menu can be found electronically by scanning the barcode, and each table had a spray bottle of sanitizer. 

I ordered a sazerac to drink, garlic bread, and the bucatini in white wine sauce with shrimp. Simply divine- the shrimp were all very large and the sauce lemony and light with a small kick of spice, which the waitress was kind enough to make sure I was OK with before ordering. Portions were very large and the garlic bread paired nicely to help soak up some of the wine sauce. Really looking forward to coming back and trying out other items from the menu!"
5,"If you&apos;re thinking about ordering out from little nonna&apos;s instead of dining in- DO IT. DO IT. YOULL THANK YOURSELF LATER. 

After dining in before the latest covid restrictions, I couldn&apos;t wait to go back. I was craving the garlic bread sooo badly, so I decided to order it and give takeout a try. I always get so nervous with take out especially delivery because the food can sometimes get soggy or mushy. But you guys, I was so impressed. 

The pastas came so yummy and everything was warm. Even the toast was crispy. Highly recommended the burrata and the garlic bread, don&apos;t sleep on it."
5,"Came here on a Saturday night and was lucky enough to nab a reservation in the courtyard. During COVID they also have tables on the sidewalk and a few in the restaurant, but if you get a choice definitely go for the charming and lit up covered courtyard in the back. It is dark and cozy making it a good spot for a date. 

We started by splitting a carafe of the montepulciano ($28 for about 4 cups which was a great price). For the appetizer, we started with the wild mushroom arancini. This was awesome, the crispy exterior with a decadent cheesy interior was on point! For the main, we had the Nonni&apos;s spaghetti and meatballs and the rigatoni alla vodka. I though the rigatoni was a hit - mildly spicy, rich, and cheesy with hefty slices of sausage. The spaghetti had an interesting aromatic tomato sauce and two very large meatballs. The portion size of both entrees was impressive - I was pleased to take home the leftovers and make a second meal of it. 

Overall, I was very happy with the quality of the Italian food, romantic ambience of the courtyard, and the prompt service. Would definitely go back!"
4,"After so many people recommended coming here, I decided to give it a try. I was lucky to secure a reservation on a Wednesday night.

With regard to COVID, they are handling it very well as there are several options for seating indoor and even outdoor in a heated tent. 

In terms of the service, this is the reason I chose to make this review four starts and NOT five. The waiter we had was persistent on making us feel uncomfortable. He would come back every two minutes asking us if we were ready to order. After a few times it got really annoying and I was fed up. 

Now to the good stuff -- the food was amazing. Some of the best Italian food I have had in a while. I ordered the B + V + P Meatballs which consisted of fontina stuffed meatballs with some spaghetti. The meatballs were delicious with rich and flavorful taste. Then, for desert we ended up ordering the Hazelnut Cannolis which were mouth watering. So for food, I would definitely recommend coming here.

Overall, the experience was not bad but could&apos;ve been better."
5,"I&apos;ve been here for restaurant week twice and had a great time both times! For appetizer, I&apos;ve had the BVP Meatball, which came with two huge delicious meatballs, and the Wild Mushroom Arcancini, which was also amazing. I especially loved the truffle aioli that came with it. For entree, I had the Orecchiette which was pretty decent pasta. I think the fennel sausage was the best part of it. For dessert, I had the Apple Crumble. 

I would say the meatballs were the best part of the meal and I high recommend them. All of my friends who got it also really enjoyed them. Overall, Little Nonna&apos;s is a good place to go for a nice hearty meal."
3,"Just writing this review, I am excited to go back here. Candidly, I felt like I just had an all-around okay experience. But since I have been there, so many friends have come to me and said how much they love it, so I am dying to give it another chance.

The food was good, no complaints, but my meatballs just weren&apos;t thaaaaat impressive. The eggplant parm was solid though. 

I loved the restaurant though - the aesthetic was cute and they have a quaint outdoor patio which is a nice breathe of fresh air being located in the think of the city."
5,Anytime I crave Italian food I order from here. It&apos;s been one of my go to pandemic deliveries. Everything is delicious and the servings are huge
4,"Ordered delivery from here for restaurant week and I was pleasantly surprised! 

I got the B+V+P Meatballs as an appetizer and this was my least favorite dish out of everything I tried. I would&apos;ve liked to have more sauce and I wish the cheesy was clumping together. There were 2 huge meatballs that were big enough to be a meal.

The dinner is what really sold me. I got the Lemon Chicken and it was delicious! It was so flavorful and it had the perfect blend of veggies and potatoes. It was a generous amount too. 

Finally, I had the Lemon Cheesecake for dessert and it did not disappoint! It was very small though and it wouldn&apos;t have been worth ordering it without the restaurant week deal. 

Overall, I enjoyed Little Nonna&apos;s and would definitely like to try it again."
4,"This place is soooo good. First off, the ambiance is great. It&apos;s on Locust, a lot of outdoor and socially distanced seating. The servers are so nice, they set up the ambiance outside to be very warm and cozy. 
I came here for restaurant week, and got the meatballs which were huge and amazing. When I checked in on FB I got two comments from friends telling me to get the meatballs. The lemon chicken was absolutely incredible, super light and refreshing with great flavor, a perfect portion and fresh veggies. Lastly the tiramisu was also great, very light and fun, it was served in a mug with whipped cream which is way different than the square cake i&apos;m usually used to. 
Overall great experience!"
4,"We were originally looking to grab happy hour in the area but discovered it was Center City Restaurant Week. We knew we had to take advantage of the food deals. We didn&apos;t make reservations since we found out about restaurant week last minute. We walked up to Little Noona&apos;s and they fortunately had an outdoor space for us. 

I ordered the arancini, braised shortrib radiatore, and lemon cheesecake. Boyfriend got the B+V+P meatballs, lemon chicken al matone, and tiramisu. Our meal also came with bread and burrata to share. As usually I made sure to take at least a bite of each thing so I could taste test everything. 

Food was amazing. I especially loved my arancini and shortrib radiatore. Arancini was fried to perfection. The risotto inside had great texture and flavors. I don&apos;t eat arancini that often but this was the best one I&apos;ve had so far. My pasta was perfectly al dente. It had a nice springy chew to it and was full of flavor. The whipped ricotta added a nice creaminess to it. The meatball and lemon chicken were honestly solid dishes. As for dessert, my lemon cheesecake was decent, but my boyfriend&apos;s tiramisu was what I wish I ordered. It was moist, creamy, and not overly sweet. I never really liked tiramisu but this tiramisu changed my opinion. All I have to say is don&apos;t sleep on the tiramisu."
2,"I&apos;ll start by saying the food was overall tasty. The rigatoni was amazing but we were all really put off by the service. 

When we entered we walked through the little alley thinking we weren&apos;t supposed to go in (mind you there&apos;s no sign on the door with instructions). The hostess was very rude and made a very dry comment about going back to the front &quot;you know the front where the front door is&quot;. Not a great way to start the night. 

Then our waitstaff made a comment halfway into talking about keeping our masks on when the waitstaff came to the table. I totally get that but would have been great to just state that from the beginning. It just came off as a scolding.

Then we asked for a carafe of wine and she said &quot;well usually a carafe only serves 3 so I&apos;ll bring 4 glasses but it will be less&quot;. I feel like most restaurants would offer to top us off but not this place. Also most carafes are = 0.75 liters which is about 8 oz per glass? 

Then we asked for serving spoons as they did not give us any at all and they seemed to make a big deal about this. Is it a big deal to ask for a serving spoon so we can split up the dishes we were sharing? Just very weird. 

Lastly, we are a group of doctors who thought we would go out to dinner in a safe manner to support restaurants. We know the importance of COVID safety. We would have just appreciated some thoughtfulness from the staff. Also we usually love safran-turney restaurants and at the beginning of the pandemic many of us donated to the fundraiser after seeing their Instagram post. We love supporting local businesses when we can. I just overall thought last night the waitstaff was slightly rude."
3,"We were looking forward to a night of fine Italian dining so we came this restaurant. 
There was no wait time, but we had a reservation.  The server was pleasant. 
We ordered the Little  Nonna&apos;s dinner Menu for $35/pp.
The appetizers were okay.
The Lemon chicken was bland but salt made it good. The swordfish, however was very bland, and tasteless. I had to order something else. I ordered the Eggplant, it was okay. 
The dessert was decent."
5,"More like BIG Nonna&apos;s for their BIG time quality of service and delicious food. We stopped by here on a whim trying to snag a table on a Saturday during the pandemic. Shoot your shot, right? Well, we did and succeeded. We seated right away in their backyard atrium. Very comforting and service was spectacular. 

What we snagged for adult beverages:
-Bourbon Drinks (can&apos;t recall the name...sweet, but freshening) 
-Aperole Spritz because it&apos;s Summer beaches. 

Food:
-Started with the burrata with some extra bread. It was FIRE. Highly recommend sharing with the table or scarfing down alone. 
-Shrimp Scampi 
-Pan Seared Gnocchi
-Penne al Vodka 

All dishes were wonderful. However, VERY salty. I get it, you&apos;re coming to a fine Italian joint, expect some good seasoning. However, the hand was heavy on the salt this day. Didn&apos;t ruin our evening, and we&apos;ll be 100% coming back. 

Dessert:
-Tiramisu. It. Was. Amazing. Rich, fresh, and a great end to the evening. 

Recommend little Nonna&apos;s to all during these turbulent times. Make a reservation!"
4,"One of my favorite spots for Italian food in the Center City area. Consistently good food and service. Definitely worth checking out.

Food:
Garlic Bread - 4/5 stars - Order this or a dish that comes with it! The bread is chewy, comes with a nice crust on the outside and wasn&apos;t overly garlicky.

Wild Mushroom Arancini - 5/5 stars - Highly recommended! Perfectly fried on the outside for a nice crispy shell with a soft, creamy inside. Great rice to cheese ratio and the truffle makes this dish even more rich.

Stracciatella - 4/5 stars - Not to be confused with the dessert! This dish is a runnier version of burrata, which makes it more like a spread with chucks of curds throughout. The dish comes with a mound of olives, some olive oil spread on top and more of that delicious garlic bread. Definitely a heavier appetizer so suggest splitting it with others. 

Pan Seared Gnocchi - 4/5 stars - The gnocchi was super smooth and creamy, so the texture alone makes this dish great. The chunks of pork jowl are small but packed with flavor. The butternut squash and turnips add some sweetness and texture to the creamy and garlicky sauce, balancing out the dish. The portion is smaller than their other entrees so just keep that in mind."
5,"Great food and wonderful service. We were seated in the courtyard and enjoyed the Meatballs, Garlic Bread, Rigatoni alla Vodka, Chicken Parmesan, Pinot Grigio, and had the Tiramisu for dessert. Thank you to the Little Nonna&apos;s team! Everyone was kind and attentive. We&apos;ll be back soon."
4,"The spaghetti special is delicious but its alot of food. 

The meats and cheese sampler thingie was kind of a bust. Nothing particularly interesting in regards to variety, i ordered it to go for a gathering and it was nothing to write home about when i opened it up to serve."
5,"This place was amazing! The new &quot;streetery&quot; is adorable and feels perfectly safe during these covid times while getting a full service experience. Felt really safe to bring our child, enjoy a hot meal and stay warm! We ordered the garlic bread which arrives with a full roasted garlic head so you can squeeze the cloves out and spread additional garlic on your toasty bread, we used it to sop up the extra san marzano marinara and basil pesto from the perfectly fried eggplant parm. Just when you think they couldn&apos;t top themselves, we enjoyed the braised short rib radiatore with the whipped ricotta, nonni&apos;s spaghetti and meatballs- with ridiculously tasty oversized meatballs drenched in the braised pork marinara and best of all the pan seared gnocchi. The gnocchi was to die for! The seared edge on the pillowy goodness with the sweetness from the butternut squash and the salty pops of pancetta, yea I&apos;m drooling right now. The service was great! Our 7 year old was also super impressed but our jeans were maybe a bit snug after our departure! Haha! Go support this place. Amazing!"
4,"The ambiance is lovely, the menu is divine.  Loved the brocollini Caesar, garlic bread and the wine.  I ordered the shrimp scampi pasta, and that wasn&apos;t so great.  The dish was completely missing the capers and breadcrumbs, no sign of any lemon or taste of lemon, and had a LARGE amount of chili flakes.  Two bites and my mouth was ON FIRE. Two bites, and I was done. I would definitely go back, but would pick another pasta option."
5,"Went to Little Nonnas last weekend and my experience could not have been better.  The courtyard area was very charming and adorable as it was very nicely decorated with lights.  Our waitress was spectacular and the food came out within 15 minutes.  We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer, pasta and meatballs, and rigatoni vodka.  Everything was delicious.  The pasta and meatballs was a 10/10 would highly recommend!!  It came with huge portions and the meatball had cheese in the center.  The vodka rigatoni was still very good but we both preferred the spaghetti and meatballs.  The drinks were good and strong! The restaurant is reasonably priced and takes COVID precautions seriously.  This is a perfect date night spot and we can&apos;t wait to go back!"
5,I&apos;m not doing justice to this review without pictures but Little Nonnas is a MUST during this winter&apos;s shut down. I have ordered takeout from here twice and both times have not disappointed. The burrata is fantastic with their charred bread along with literally any pasta dish. I have gotten the gnocci twice but my husband really enjoyed the braised short rib raddiatore and the pasta alla vodka. It is a bit pricey but I feel it is worth it for the quality of the dishes!
