4,"Village Whiskey is a classy American restaurant featuring burgers and cocktails. The Whiskey King burger was amazing, but also so large I needed to use a fork and a knife! The cauliflower appetizer was also delicious. The outdoor seating was a bit sketchy - we were along an alleyway with lots of people passing by. But if you&apos;re able to eat indoors, the ambiance looks nicer there. Overall a fun joint if you&apos;re craving this cuisine and want somewhere a bit upscale."
4,"This review is for happy hour during COVID. We have always loved Village Whiskey but hated not being able to make a reservation. With the addition of so many outdoor seats, they now accept reservations! Their happy hour is great - $7 handmade cocktails. The Rose Gold is so refreshing and delicious. We also got $1 oysters and the freshest, most flavorful fried pickles I have ever eaten. Not greasy at all. Only complaint is that we were seated on the street (with a barrier), and people drive by SO fast during rush hour down 20th that I thought we were going to be hit by a car or someone&apos;s mirror. Overall will definitely be back!"
5,"We stumbled upon this place just walking around town and I am so grateful we did! It was such a great experience! The food was amazing! The drinks were so delicious! The service was great! I can&apos;t wait to go back!

Update: I went back to bring my husband because I was with my friend the first time.. we didn&apos;t make reservations and they squeezed us in anyway.  It was a great experience again! Great food! Great drinks! Thank you for seating us without a reservation! It really made our night!"
5,"Village Whiskey is a timeless favorite of mine with excellent cocktails and whiskey as well - duh! By far one of my go-to happy hour spots. 
Snacks
1) deviled eggs - good, but I&apos;ve had better
2) popcorn shrimp- delicious and the breading is perfect along with their spicy mayo
3) tater tots is a must with an added garlic/Parmesan touch
Entree 
4) village burger is a must! It&apos;s loaded with flavor and savor especially if cooked at medium. The burger itself is super juicy and makes you want to come back for seconds. The sides can get expensive but the truffle mushrooms, sautéed onions, bacon and/or egg is a must! 
Drinks/cocktail
5) old fashion is a classic and village whiskey does it right!
6) rose gold is another favorite of mine. A bit on the sweeter side, but you will crave some more"
5,Your burgers. Your whiskey. Your oysters and dirty martinis. Y&apos;all are perfect in every day and my dog loves coming with us. Thank you
5,"Can&apos;t believe this was my first time here. Loved the food. Everything was so fresh and flavorful. The best part, they have 1$ oyster for happy hour and you can&apos;t beat that. The pulled pork slider was the best I have ever had. Can&apos;t wait to come back already!"
4,"I&apos;ve hit up Village Whiskey twice in the past couple of months and it&apos;s still a great spot for a bite. Both visits were on Sundays, and we&apos;ve been lucky to get seated right away both times even though the restaurant is small and seating is tight. 

On the first visit, three of us shared a bunch of plates: pickled cherry tomatoes, village burger, bbq pork sammy, and duck fat fries with Sly Fox cheddar sauce. Everything was delicious! I was also happy to see a couple solid non-alcoholic options as well; the lavender fields was a hit! 

Last Sunday, I tried the veggie burger and my sister had the bbq pork sammy. Again, we ordered the fries with cheddar sauce. I do think the cheddar sauce could have a bit more flavor, but the fries themselves are really great regardless.  

Honestly, Village Whiskey is a spot I didn&apos;t think about much because I always just assumed it would be too crowded. Now that I&apos;ve found the sweet spot, it&apos;s becoming part of my weekend rotation!"
4,"Just a brief update! I&apos;ve been back many more times since my first time around, and I&apos;d say my experiences were far better. They opened up a large outdoor area and have tables on 18th and Sansom! What&apos;s also great is that it&apos;s so easy to book a table through OpenTable. The burgers I&apos;ve subsequently had here were much better than my first one. I&apos;ve most recently had their &quot;Dundie,&quot; which is the Burger of the Month and it was a great burger with a sweet tone to the bacon it comes with. I almost always get the Deviled Eggs as well, which is a great appetizer. Rating now up!"
4,"Really cool low-key spot.  I&apos;m only giving it 4 stars, because I didn&apos;t try the food.  We arrived around 8:30 pm, and were able to snag 2 seats at the bar. I did the Around the World whiskey tasting.  The Canadian whiskey was my favorite, but the Irish whiskey I wasn&apos;t a fan of.  I also tasted a couple of their cocktails, all of which were very good.  If you like cold brew coffee, try the Café y Tonic (warning, this drink is VERY sweet).  In my opinion, however, the Commodore was the best drink of the night.  It was the perfect mix of sweet, and tart, and was light, and refreshing.  

A bit of advice: Don&apos;t sit right by the door in the Winter, you&apos;ll be cold every time the door opens :)"
4,"They always seem to be busy which is a good thing. 

I find their cocktails pretty average compared to other places in Philly. I tried their Brunettes And Breakfast Food which is super pretty - a lavender color drink decorated with flowers on top. However, taste wise I would give it a 0 as it literally tasted like water.

Their burgers are pretty famous and awesome but the last time I went, I tried their Chicken Sandwich which was sooo good! The portion sizes are enough to fill you up for an entire day! Try it!"
5,"I came to Village Whiskey for a little impromptu date night when I was really craving a burger.  The space inside is cute, the tables are booths that face towards the bar so you can watch the TV (so when we went, a few people were definitely watching the Eagles game).  The burger were really filling without feeling really overly greasy or heavy, which was nice. I got two burgers and split them with my partner: We ordered the burger of the month, the Midnight Rider, which was a lamb burger with harissa mustard, halloumi, and chickpea puree as well as their Whiskey King burger with foie gras, bacon, and bleu cheese.  The burgers were both cooked to perfection (medium rare is what we requested) so tender, flavorful, and absolutely delicious.  The combination of all of the ingredients and toppings on the burgers was just perfect, and I couldn&apos;t have imagined a better combo than they did.

I also ordered one of their special soda drinks, which had lavender and ginger and my partner ordered a whiskey.  Their whiskey selection is out of this world, you absolutely have to come just to marvel at how many they have.  It&apos;s in the name after all, and I had to laugh even at myself for just piggy backing off of his whiskey tasting and not getting my own!  

Like I said before, I gobbled down both but felt like I wasn&apos;t dying afterwards.  It was a &quot;heavier&quot; meal for sure but I felt like I could comfortably eat dessert.  The burgers were pretty messy, but you can expect that while eating such a packed burger.  We also ordered the duck fat fries with a side of cheese sauce made by Sly Fox, a local brewery and they were delicious! It was the perfect amount of fries after the burgers we gobbled down.

The restaurant is another one of Jose Garces&apos;s, who created it because he wanted a restaurant he could eat at (he wanted to drink whiskey and eat burgers!).  This is 100% the place to do just those two things in a comfortable, cozy atmosphere.  Check it out, you won&apos;t be disappointed!"
5,"We went to Village Whiskey at 5pm on a Saturday evening. We were able to make a reservation for outdoor seating online and were seated almost immediately when we arrived. The wait staff seated us in the bike lane on Sansom, which worked out very well because it was quieter than the seating on 20th Street and we were further away from other patrons. Since happy hour was from 4pm-6pm, we were able to enjoy delicious cocktails for only $7. I opted for the Rose Gold, which had excellent hints of rosemary. For an appetizer, we split the fried pickles. They were the most unique fried pickles either of us had had since they were thick chucks as opposed to the typical thin slices. They were served with a chipotle aioli, which was delicious. For an entrée, we both ordered the October burger of the month- The Other Sanderson Sister. It was a 1/2lb burger with caramelized onion, bacon, blue cheese, and pumpkin aioli. I requested the pumpkin aioli be served on the side, which they easily accommodated.  It was one of the best burgers I have had in the city primarily due to the generous amount of blue cheese. Can&apos;t wait to visit again!"
4,"I visited Village Whiskey a few weeks when the weather was still bearable to sit outside. The weather was beautiful and we were quickly sat outside. The restaurant is located right across from the Shake Shack so naturally, there were a lot of people to look at. It was also a pretty small table very close to the table next to ours. I felt bad ordering so much food as we had to constantly switch plates around. There are over 200 whiskeys available on the menu. We both didn&apos;t drink nor would I consider myself a whiskey connoisseur, but I could only imagine how tasty the selection is.

We ordered the following: duck fat fries, flight of bacon, village burger, and the veggie burger. The Duck fat fries with short rib and cheddar was one of the best fry dishes I&apos;ve ever had, Hands down. I&apos;m not sure how they managed to get the fries so crispy on the outside, yet so airy and fluffy on the inside. The flavor seemed to just melt in your mouth. I know there are about a million restaurants in the city that I want to try, but I immediately want to go back to Village Whiskey for these fries. I typically stay away from dairy, but these fries are worth the discomfort. 

The veggie burger: I&apos;m not one to typically order a veggie burger- give me the meat, but I was in the mood for something lighter. The burger was a lentil and black bean mixture topped with guacamole and pickled red cabbage. Definitely tasty, the flavors worked well together. Not the best veggie burger I&apos;ve ever eaten but would recommend.

The Village burger: my boyfriend ordered the burger, not the infamous Whiskey King Burger, but the regular burger. It was topped with lettuce, tomato, and Thousand Island dressing. He said it wasn&apos;t too saucy, just a bit undercooked. He requested it to be cooked medium, but there were parts of the burger that was closer to the rare side.

**Neither of the burgers came with any sides, just a pickle.

We ordered the flight of bacon because we both have never seen bacon as a flight before. The bacon came out on a cedar plank which looked nice coming out, but there was a ton of grease that pooled on the top. I also immediately noticed that texture on most of the pieces was not crispy enough (hence all the grease). Also, the cedar wasn&apos;t the most appealing. We received one piece of each flavor: Jerk, Jalapeno, Espresso maple sage, Honey Dickel Rye, and Regular. The pieces weren&apos;t labeled so we were constantly trying to guess the flavor/remember what was listed on the menu.

All in all, I recommend the Village Whiskey. If not for the duck fat fries alone, they were probably one of the best fries I&apos;ve ever had in my life. The rest of the menu looks delicious and would highly recommend it if you love whiskey. I think it&apos;s a staple in the Rittenhouse Square area and I would definitely check it out."
5,"Went to Village Whiskey with my good friend who loves a great burger almost as much as I do. This was a bucket list trip for me. I have been dying to go to VW since it opened and now I can mark it off my culinary bucket list. While we were not able to sit inside due to Covid, the outside dining atmosphere was perfect. The weather was spectacular and the diners were out in full force as if to proclaim: &quot;I rebuke you COVID!&quot; We started with the popcorn shrimp and deviled eggs. Yummy and yummy. I had the Founders All Day to start. It was a  very cold pour. For our mixed drinks we went with the Rose Gold and the Whiskey Summer. Both were crafted with attention and full flavor. For my burger I chose the Village burger and added carmelized onions and mayo. My friend got the smash burger. I&apos;m  not sure how they procure and craft  this magnificent thick hockey puck of a concoction but it is scrumptious and it is beautifully presented. From the very first bite I was blown away with how much flavor this burger had. It kept its shape, held up strong in the bun. The homemade 1000 Island was delicious. The pickle had tremendous crunch and flavor. This restaraunt and burger lived up to my high expectations and it was great to be able to get back out and dine again as we traverse tepidly through these uncertain times. Great job VW."
4,"This is a really cool (but kinda small and narrow) place to eat.  There&apos;s a pretty big bar, several booths, and a couple of small tables in the restaurant.  Thats pretty much it!  It can get pretty packed and there&apos;s only one restroom.  As someone who has a disability, it can be a little difficult to maneuver around...but it is a lively spot!  The staff here are very friendly and helpful.  They give you time to look at the menu, and will answer any question you have.  They also have a pretty large selection of whiskey!

When we went there, they had happy hour.  So we ordered several happy hour plates (shareable).  Portions are pretty good for happy hour.  No complaints about the food, they were all pretty tasty!  I would have to say, my favorite shareable plate is the short ribs with fries (not on the happy hour menu). 

Street parking (after visiting Philadelphia for the first time, i think majority of the places are street parking).

Only drawbacks is probably the size of the restaurant...everything else about the place was nice!  I would definitely come back again...maybe actually try some real food next time (entrees). =P"
5,"Maybe in the season of Covid the bar is low because we have not been able to go out. Regardless, this was one of the best experiences I have had at a local spot in a while. First, the outdoor dining is well done by this establishment. The distance between the tables is extremely reassuring. Our waitress was masked and gloved, but still seemed warm which really enhanced the experience. Now, I was told that their burger was the best in the city and I was totally prepared be kinda let down. Did not happen. It&apos;s a massive piece of goodness that my wife and I opted to share. We also had the short rib and cheese fries which felt like a meal on their own. With  a well done old fashioned to sip on, this place really won me over. Like, I like it so much, I want to give them 1 star and drag down the rating so people would stay away. That&apos;s selfish, but this place is worth being slightly selfish with."
4,"Came here on a Friday night around 8pm and only had a 10 min wait. We ordered the pickled cauliflower which wasn&apos;t too sour and slightly sweet. We enjoyed this dish. It came with sourdough bread, a cheese spread, and olive spread; all were delicious. 
I ordered the short rib cheese fries as my meal. The portion was huge and I could barely finish half of it. Pretty good fries though! It can be a bit soggy for some people due to the cheese and short ribs, but flavor-wise it went well together. Some parts of the fries were a bit too salty. 
The burger of the month was the Frenchman burger. It was a good burger, but I think their patty melt is much tastier which wasn&apos;t on the menu this time. 
The tater tots had a good seasoning, but was over cooked. Some of them were crispy like chips."
5,"I have to admit, Village Whiskey was truly epic. This place is pretty solid. A dish that I am sure you will definitely love is The Namesake Whiskey Burger. Service was wonderful and everybody working here was incredibly nice and helpful. Why haven&apos;t I tried Village Whiskey before?"
1,"I understand that maybe operations aren&apos;t at their peak because of the covid lockdown. 
It however, must be said that I received what I believed was a cheeseburger made with expired beef.

I got the VW smash with a double patty expecting a pretty decent, classic cheeseburger based on the reviews. I usually enjoy almost any cheeseburger but I knew something was off when I opened the packaging and took a big hit of a stench I wish I could unsmell. I took a little bite to anyways to make sure idk why I did this because it was really a dry, nasty rotten cheeseburger. Disposed of it immediately and contacted the delivery service which thankfully apologized with a full refund right away otherwise I would have been pissed. 10$ for a cheeseburger and you&apos;d think it would at least be edible.

The dine in experience may be different but to village whiskey please check your meat! 

Honestly don&apos;t think I would have loved this burger even if it wasn&apos;t rancid. Barely any cheese was on it.
The bun was just too dry/crumbly with a strange aftertaste and the thousand island type sauce I got on the side was just really tangy and watery and had no other flavor. You are better off going next door to shake shack instead if you are only interested in tasty burgers."
5,"I can&apos;t believe I&apos;ve never reviewed Village Whiskey!  I have been a big fan for a long time and consistently maintain that VW serves the best burgers and fries (duck fat!) in the city.  (To be fair, Garces serves the same duck fat fries at several other of his restaurants.  But that doesn&apos;t make them any less delicious at VW!)  I chose to have my final meal as a 20-something -- i.e., dinner on the night before my 30th birthday -- at Village Whiskey because I like it that much.

What&apos;s inspiring me to review VW now is my impromptu visit last Saturday morning.  My fiance and I had an 11 a.m. meeting nearby that did not last very long, and we found ourselves with some time to kill before some of the local brunch spots opened at 11:30.  The weather was very chilly and rainy, so we ducked into VW to grab a drink and plot our next move...and I am so glad we did!  The place was virtually empty and the staff was super friendly.  I had the best bourbon cocktail I&apos;ve had in months (and that&apos;s saying something because I order bourbon cocktails pretty regularly), and the bartender treated us to a sample of another one that was almost as good.  We opted not to stay and eat only because the brunch menu is fairly limited; certainly not because we were not enjoying ourselves tremendously.  

All of this said, a word of caution for new visitors is that the restaurant is quite small and I don&apos;t think they take reservations (or at least they didn&apos;t used to), so it can be hard to get a seat during peak hours.  But if you are willing to wait it out or visit at a slightly less trafficked time, you will be rewarded by the most delicious burgers, fries, and whiskey drinks in Rittenhouse."
