5,"Excellent vegan spot with nice menu, competitive prices, and very dependable service. The food is so good you won&apos;t even know that you&apos;re not eating meat! 

Also, I&apos;ve had very good experiences ordering in Uber eats. Delivery is usually within 30 minutes!"
5,"I was in Philly for the day and needed to find a vegan spot, as I&apos;m on the 16 day of my vegan journey. The process was easy with the social distancing process. Forgive the blurry picture, as I was eating in the car on my way back home to the DMV. The Jerk Caesar Salad was Awesome and Mocha Latte Shake was phenomenal!!! I will always hit this location up, when visiting Philly."
5,OMG. THIS WAS SO SO GOOD. Spent the entire day walking the city and decided to stop here after seeing it the night before. No regrets- not even plant based my self but may consider now after eating this delicious meal. Staff super friendly and everything COVID safe. Thank you for your business!!!! The garlic aioli sauce was probably the best sauce I&apos;ve had in a while
4,"Came here to try some healthy food, fully expecting to pay $25 for a salad that would keep me hungry all day. I was pleasantly surprised when that wasn&apos;t the case, as the prices are reasonable and the quantity is more than adequate. 

Located near Rittenhouse square, it is surprisingly not busy, even during lunchtime. The food comes out quick and the service is friendly.

I got the arugula taco and the chipotle fajita wrap, and both were really good and packed with flavor. The wrap was like a burrito, and the pico and avocado really came through as the dominant, good, flavors. The arugula taco is basically a salad, but because of the avocado and the sheer quantity, it makes a pretty filling meal. Both are great values at around $10 each. I also got the sweet potato fries, but they are expensive and the quantity is small, so I wouldn&apos;t recommend those. The drinks look interesting and I will definitely try one next time!

Overall, a good tasting vegan place with decent quantity and reasonable prices, especially considering its location in Rittenhouse. Would recommend."
5,"Best Vegan cheesesteak!
I was not going to leave Philly without trying the food at the place.
It was juicy, the sweet potato fries were also good. We will definitely be back on our next trip to Philly."
4,"Got delivery, food was absolutely delicious! Would get again! Only complaint is the salad didn&apos;t have a lot of chicken whatsoever; but the combination alone was tasty!!! The tangerine turmeric hit the spot too. Love when a drink has just the right amount of sweetness."
3,"I have been eating at hipcity for years. I crave the hipcity ranch occasionally and treat myself to it. More recently, the sandwich has been tasting not amazing and at the price point quite honestly not worth it. It used to have a crunchy outside and juicy inside and was covered in the delicious ranch sauce. However, the recent times I&apos;ve gotten this sandwich it has been very dry and flavorless. The brioche bun(which before got soggy very quickly so wasn&apos;t great in the first place) was replaced by a rubbery bread. We also made the mistake of trying the new oh maitake burger which was dry and tasted like cardboard, and was such a small burger at a ridiculous price. Overall, I&apos;m pretty disappointed with the decrease in quality in what was previously a fantastic alternative for vegans/vegetarians."
5,"I came to Philly to enjoy family time away, but wanted to enjoy the food scene as well. As a plant based girl, I was worried I wouldn&apos;t be able to indulge in my fair share of a cheesesteak, but boy was I wrong! I ordered the Philly Cheesesteak and it was delicious! The vegan cheese melted perfectly and didn&apos;t have a weird aftertaste or texture. The mushrooms were cooked to the perfect texture and it served my cravings well! Next time I&apos;d order it without ketchup though. I order vanilla milkshake and it was BOMB! The consistency and flavor was just the nostalgia I needed when I wasn&apos;t dairy free and could order a milkshake at whim. The staff was friendly and gifted our impatient and hungry kids with chocolate chip cookies, and besides the kids gesture, the service was fast and safe! Thanks HipCityVeg."
4,"Delicious as hip city veg always is! As of October 2020, this location does not have  indoor or outdoor dining but it is a few minute walk from rittenhouse square which has plenty of bench space. I would give it 5 stars but it&apos;s too expensive for the amount of food you get."
4,"This counter-service vegan/plant-based restaurant in the Rittenhouse Square area of Philadelphia is a great stop for a quick lunch and bite to eat.  I stopped twice on the same day, once just to try their chicken nuggets (with buffalo sauce) and again for the cheese steak.  The nuggets were OK, nothing spectacular, but edible and flavorful with the buffalo sauce.

The cheese steak was delicious.  It was flavorful, cheesy, and a bit messy which made it excellent in my opinion.  It was a good interpretation of a Philly Cheese Steak.  It&apos;s more on the meal size than the snack size though, so it can fill you up.

The staff was super friendly and had everything out to me quickly each time.  They even have books for sale so look around at the walls for things you may want to look at.  It&apos;s small so looking around may just be turning your head a bit.

I wish they had Coke or Pepsi though.  Just because I&apos;m not eating meat doesn&apos;t mean I don&apos;t want a delicious cola to wash down my sandwich and nuggets!  I&apos;d go back for the cheese steak and would like to try some of their other items."
5,"Hip City Veg- Rittenhouse Square! This is a must visit hip vegan cheesesteak restaurant. I can not visit Philly without having a plant based cheesesteak. I ordered my sandwich well done. The saut√©ed onions, mushrooms, The server suggested I try the turmeric tangerine drink. I must say everything was phenomenal.  The only thing I wish they had was French fries. I don&apos;t like sweet potato fries, and I didn&apos;t know where to go to get fries. But that was fine because my amazing sandwich was everything. 

My only regret was that I didn&apos;t buy two sandwiches. I live in the NYC metro area, and couldn&apos;t just go back the next day. If I lived nearby, this would be my weekly go to place. 

I want to thank the staff, and manager for an excellent experience. Could not have been better. So grateful this place exist for lovers of Philly cheese steaks but without harming animals or the environment."
3,"This year, I&apos;ve focused on adapting a more plant based diet and was super excited to try HipCityVeg because I&apos;ve heard so many great reviews. I think it&apos;s my own fault for hyping it up in my head so much before going in. My friend, got the smokehouse burger and I got the Crispy Ranch Chik&apos;n. Let me be clear, there was nothing flavor wise. However, for the price there was nothing that blew us away. It is not vegan &quot;meat&quot; that magically tastes like real animal meat. It tastes good for what it is and I enjoyed it. That being said, I probably won&apos;t be back considering they sell these types of patties in most grocery stores. I&apos;d recommend for the experience!"
4,"As a recent pescatarian, I have been trying to find restaurants around me that would allow me to not give up the taste of meat while still being able to stick to my choice of diet.

After a few yelp searches I came across HipCityVeg. It seemed to be really popular since there are various locations in Philly. 

I ordered the crispy hipcity ranch and the vanilla milkshake. I was surprised at how close the sandwich resembled the taste of a real chicken sandwich and actually even better than most chicken sandwiches I have tasted. The milkshake tasted like any milkshake if you replaced cow milk with soy milk.

One thing that I enjoyed the most about my meal was that I felt satisfied without the overstuffed gross feeling you get after you eat a large meal.

I do think this place is overpriced like many vegetarian/vegan restaurants, but it is always nice yo treat yourself once in awhile"
3,"I walked here with my cousin for a quick lunch and saw this place had good reviews.  As a plant based eater, how could you not come to philly and order Philly cheesesteak? So, I did!  I ordered the philly sandwich and it was yummy, but I think that I was expecting something more.  There was more bread than the substance of the philly itself. I also ordered sweet potato fries (this is the only type of fry they have) and they were decent, though I do not typically like sweet potato fries. Service was fast and friendly and they have several options on the menu to choose from.  I&apos;ll give this place a try again the next time I visit Philly&apos;"
4,"I have always heard about this place, but never had the opportunity to try it, until today!

The restaurant is set up neat, but very tiny. Not much place to stand while waiting for your food to be ready, it gets cramped very quickly. I ordered the Smokehouse Burger and sweet potato fries.

The burger was actually pretty good. For being plant based, you almost can&apos;t even tell! The sweet potato fries were phenomenal!"
4,Nothing has ever made us question leaving our carnivorous ways more in our lives. The food at HipCityVeg is so satisfying that you would never guess that you&apos;re not eating meat. The sweet potato fries and (fake) chicken nuggets makes you feel like you are splurging on a cheat day.The Udon noodle salad is great for a lighter day but is packed with flavor and leaves you full. We seriously eat here twice a week and have cravings if we don&apos;t.
5,"It&apos;s vegan fast food, but a little fresher, and I&apos;m totally here for it! It&apos;s definitely a must-hit (any of their locations) while you&apos;re in Philly if you have a plant based eater in your party.

I came here for one reason although I&apos;m sure I&apos;ll come back for many more based on their menu. The vegan Philly &quot;cheese steak&quot;! While the rest of my party had been eating the real, original version all weekend, I was on the hunt for one I could safely eat without cross contamination. Finding this place made me ecstatic. The whole menu is vegan from drinks to entrees to desserts. It&apos;s less of a sit down place and more of a grab and go, so it&apos;s great for grabbing lunch while walking around the city.

The Vegan Philly Steak itself was great, my boyfriend the meat eater even went back for a second bite of mine. I&apos;m glad this place exists, so we can all get our tourism eating in!"
4,Love coming here for their &quot;banana whip!&quot; It&apos;s purely made of banana that they whip so hard that it turns into icecream consistency. You can get all sorts of add-ins - my favorite is to get chocolate chips! Each portion is huge. Basically guilt-free icecream. Perfect for a hot day or just a refreshing snack! Great service at this location.
5,"The taste, and texture combination of the blackened fajita burrito combined with the sweet potato fries made it plenty worth my trip from Wilmington to Philly.  The staff was very prompt, and friendly.  Furthermore, there are unclaimed picnic benches nearby where you can enjoy your meal.  I am looking forward to trying their milkshakes next time that I visit."
5,"This was my first visit in awhile. It&apos;s a few blocks from my church and a nice walk when it&apos;s nice out. Everyone is very friendly and they have enough choices to satisfy different tastes. I had the arugula salad and sweet potato fries. Note they do not offer a public restroom, but they do have an easy and clean hand washing area."
