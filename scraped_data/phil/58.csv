5,"I&apos;ve been dying to try this spot ever since i found them on Instagram. What better time to dine in than during Covid right....... just kidding lol. They did not offer outdoor seating so my group reserved an indoor spot. Everything was extremely sanitized- they checked your temperatures at the door and offered disposable menus. 

Food took a little long in between courses but I noticed an influx of takeout/delivery orders so I completely understand the slight delay. Our waitress was very transparent and accommodating with this. Food was 1000% worth it! We ordered the Sashimi appetizers and a 4 separate special rolls. By far my favorite was the Lost Rainbow roll- it was so incredibly flavorful with every bite. I wish I was able to try every single signature roll! One thing I noticed and loved about Fat Salmon was how every one of their special rolls were unique in both names and ingredients. Most sushi restaurants have a handful of special rolls on their menu that are made only by them but most of the time it&apos;s filled with basic special rolls like &quot;Dragon Roll&quot; or &quot;Godzilla Roll&quot;. Fat Salmon&apos;s menu of special rolls consist of very thought out and creative recipes... this place is a must try if you are a sushi lover in Philadelphia area!"
5,"Wow, I was very impressed with this pick. I trusted yelp pick my dinner for my birthday and if you&apos;re looking for great food for a moderate amount of money this is your place. These sushi were very big and the fish was not shy. I ordered the alaskan roll and it was packed with salmon and tuna! 
It was during covid times so they took everyone&apos;s temperature and we were sat one table away from people. The inside is way more trendy than you would think from the outside. 
The service was just find for our night. The sushi came out on the wrong places and she switched it for us. 
This place definitely seemed like a take out spot too. They&apos;re hooked up with grub hub i believe, so that is a plus as well."
5,"My fiancé and I came here for my birthday weekend, on a Thursday night during Covid-19. They had excellent sushi and excellent food. They didn&apos;t have any cocktails or scorpion bowls that we were hoping for. Nice environment"
4,"Fat Salmon is a solid choice for delivery sushi! 

PROS: 
* Rolls are HUGE, seriously. Almost too big to eat one piece in one bite. The two of us ordered 4 rolls and there was a lot left over. 
* Fish is fresh &amp; delicious. 
* Lots of options for modifications, from having a different wrap or rice to including add&apos;l ingredients. 
* Price is on point! 
* HUGE selection... but you do need to know what you want (the Caviar menu is very sparse, does not include descriptions, and often just uses the Japanese (?) name (for example, what is enkai?). 

CONS: 
* NOT a ton of ginger &amp; wasabi included... we always end up adding on add&apos;l (for $1 each). 
* Only 4 shumai in an order (typically there are 6-8 from other places). 
* Delivery was a bit slow."
4,Sushi is decent and probably one of the &quot;better&quot; sushi in Philly although still not the best sushi I&apos;ve had overall. I recommend trying the specialty rolls as they are more unique and the combination of sauces are definitely interesting. Other items are pretty average to Japanese restaurants. Would definitely prefer dine in than taking out as rolls with tempura or cooked fish do taste better when they&apos;re warm. Ok size of pieces although most rolls are cut to 4-6 pieces; you do get decent amount of fish compared to some other places in center city.
4,"This is def some of the better &quot;sushi&quot; I&apos;ve eaten in Philadelphia.. Coming from NYC/Japan, I don&apos;t think sashimi/chirashi/&quot;real&quot; sushi is a thing in Philadelphia. I often find their roll game to be better than dishes that actually feature the fish cuts.

Anyhow, we ordered to go from here. Got three specialty rolls I can&apos;t recall but I know one of them had eel (listen, rolls are pretty much all the same with a variation in 1-2 ingredients), and the chirashi. The rolls were good but the chirashi def featured frozen fish which was kinda an anticipatory letdown. 

So overall, would I come back? Yes but only if I was in the mood for rolls. If I wanted actual fish, I&apos;d probably take an Amtrak to NYC. That said, Fat Salmon def can make some bomb rolls!"
5,"I ordered a chirashi bowl for take out and was super impressed! They gave me an assortment of 6 different types of sashimi along with tamago, not to mention that it also comes with a side salad and miso soup! The quality of fish was fresh and everything was neatly packaged to go.

I&apos;d definitely recommend the chirashi bowl and will be back here when I have my next craving for sushi"
5,"The best sushi I have ever had! Recently stopped by late at night for a quick sushi fix and I am so happy I found this place! I ordered the Fat Futo Roll (tuna, salmon, yellow tail, crab stick, cucumber, avocado, masago, and mountain burdock) and the Alaskan Roll (avocado, salmon, cucumber). The sushi was unbelievably fresh with well-seasoned sushi rice and juicy raw salmon. Even the smallest dishes are up to par at a 10/10 as the ginger on the side was crunchy and flavorful! Can&apos;t wait to come back here again!"
5,Enjoyed a fabulous meal and excellent service here on a Tuesday night. Loved the understated modern garden decor. Quiet but not too quiet. We felt very welcome and comfortable walking here from the Kimpton hotel at night. We plan to return.
4,"Tried this place for the first time, surprisingly cause I live super close. Ordered through caviar, walked, and picked up at the window. It&apos;s gonna be weird reading these reviews when COVID time is over haha. 

I got the sushi for 1 combo that comes with soup/salad, nine nigiri, and a tuna roll along with the sashimi appetizer. I was definitely in the mood for some raw fish. I was pleasantly surprised by the variety in the sushi combo cause it ranged from regular tuna, salmon to unagi! That was such a treat. My only thing is that the rice didn&apos;t seem like it was seasoned and seemed a little hard. Overall fish quality seemed pretty good for a sushi place in Philly! 

The sashimi appetizer included I the usual tuna and salmon and well as what I can tell, hamachi and white tuna. I actually ate it as breakfast the next day and it still tasted great.

Great combo and appetizers! I&apos;ll be back!"
5,I have to say this is hands down the best sushi place in Philly. I&apos;ve eaten here once and ordered for takeout and both times did not disappoint. My fiancé is limited in what he can eat due to being partly vegetarian and even the vegetarian rolls here are AMAZING. Sweet Meadow roll is probably one of the best vegetarian rolls I&apos;ve ever tried. I got the rolling fire and Mr French kiss and both were so good and nothing like I&apos;ve had before. Super unique rolls here that do NOT DISSAPPOINT. No wonder the wait for pickup was like 75 minutes. Can&apos;t wait to try more of their rolls soon.
5,"Amazing sushi, amazing service, and great atmosphere. I don&apos;t get to go into Philly a lot to sit and eat but I definitely want to return here. Their different types of sushi are interesting and the portions are big. The sushi rolls fill you up and are delicious. I highly recommend anyone to try out this restaurant if you have a couple of extra dollars to spend. Worth the money for a special occasion!"
4,I was looking for some sushi and I ate here with a friend. We both loved the sushi and sashimi! They initially served salad and miso soup which were both great! The service was quite slow and it took awhile for the sushi boat to come in but it was well worth the wait. The restrooms are clean. The ambience is good. There is ample parking space in the streets. The price is fair but could be cheaper. I would love to come back again. I have not tried their deserts though.
5,There Agedashi is good! Food is fresh and fairly portioned. My wife and I love the service and ambiance. We would definitely come back.
5,"I went there for dinner last night to celebrate my birthday with a group of friends. I had made reservations through yelp. That went smoothly. 

Food was absolutely delicious and the price point wasn&apos;t bad for such great food. I ordered takoyaki, katsu maki, and salmon yaki. My friends and I all enjoyed our meals. Service was great as well! Definitely recommend it."
5,"Best spot for sushi. My fiancée and I come here often. The food is amazing, the staff is great. Will never go anywhere else. This was our first date years ago, my first sushi ever, and I will never stop coming here!"
4,"I was very impressed with the takeout we got from here. Take out or delivery sushi can be a hit or miss, but I would definitely order from here again. 

The portion sizes of the rolls we got were quite large and they have a really nice variety of different types of sushi rolls. I LOVE that you have the option of getting white or brown rice on your sushi rolls. We also ordered the spicy edamame, which was particularly delicious and it&apos;s now a favorite! 

The beef potstickers were fried very nicely and came with a delicious sauce. They have a few different varieties of sauces also. 

The meal was rather expensive for sushi, but the fish was all very fresh and everything we had was delicious."
5,Amazing service during covid! They were very clean and followed all guidelines. I would recommend to go even with family
5,"I came to Fat Salmon this past Sunday with my bf at 6:30 pm with a reservation I made via OpenTable. 

When our uber dropped us off, we walked right past the restaurant. For those that have been to FS many times/live in Philly, you probably already know the area well enough to know where it&apos;s located. Anyways, once we walked into the restaurant and were seated, I was blown away by the menu. Pictures for every item? Count me in! This was extremely helpful for someone like me who doesn&apos;t venture far from the basic avocado + sweet potato rolls (since I&apos;m vegetarian). The pictures on each item really helped me venture out of my comfort zone. 

For an appetizer, I ordered a miso soup and Vegetable Gyoza to share with my bf. First off, the miso soup? DELISH. I would say this was the best tasting miso soup I&apos;ve had in my entire life. The vegetable gyoza was tasty as well, but nothing out of the ordinary. For my entrée, I ordered a sushi roll called &apos;Sweet Meadow&apos; which had avocados, cucumber, cream cheese, and spicy mayo all INSIDE. Wowowowowowowow. My mouth is watering at the thought. 100% recommend for vegetarians. My bf got a chicken based sushi roll and he loved his as well, however, he requested our waitress multiple times to bring out spicy mayo, and by the time she remembered to bring it out, I was on my last sushi roll (my boyfriend waited to eat until he got his spicy mayo). Although the lack of quick service didn&apos;t ruin our meal, I would still give it a 4.5 stars. Can&apos;t wait to be back!"
4,"We went to this restaurant prior to to elite yelp event. 
We needed to wait a bit, but the wait was not long. We ordered 2 appetizers and 2 sushi rolls. 
Seaweed salad 
Mr. shiro 
Garden salad 
Rock and roll sushi
Our choices were outstanding
We both drank water
We did have a bit of a wait for the sushi 
We needed to remind our waiter that we have somewhere to be
Finally our sushi came and they tasted so fresh and good. 
I will again come to this restaurant   
The atmosphere is cozy, dimmed lighting and good vibe feeling. 
The bathroom is very clean with no smell, sadly it only has 1 bathroom both for male and female."
