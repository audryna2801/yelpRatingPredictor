5,"Vegan small plates? Yes please!!! I am so glad we splurged and got takeout from here. My non-vegan sister actually recommended this place and said it&apos;s one of her favorite place to go for drinks &amp; small plates. We got a ton of food and here are my reviews:

Zucchini crab cake sliders: One of the best &quot;crab cake&quot; sliders I&apos;ve had! It looks like zucchini, but it actually has a great crabby flavor. The bun was super soft and I loved the old bay remoulade.

Potato Croquettes: Omg. So different and amazing! They look like tater tots but when you bite into one, it&apos;s like a soft pillowy cloud of potato. The chipotle aioli it comes with gives it a nice kick. You also get a lot in one order! Maybe about 10.

Roasted Brussels Sprouts: These were good! I like my brussels really soft so I wish these were cooked a little longer, but they had a fantastic smokey flavor and I love the sweetness that the cranberries added.

Wild Mushroom Toast: This seems fancy with all the different types of mushrooms. The bread got a little soggy during takeout, but the overall flavor was like a mushroom explosion in your mouth. It was pretty big and great to split between 2 people.

Eggplant Bao Buns: The crowd favorite of the night! The eggplant had almost a teriyaki flavor, the buns were so soft and fluffy, and the sweet hoisin sauce was perfect. There are 3 to an order. I wish I didn&apos;t have to share!

Everything ran us about $75 for delivery and was a good amount of food for 2 people. Overall, I&apos;d highly recommend going here whether you are vegan or not! You won&apos;t be disappointed."
5,"This place is my one of my favorite bars to go to on a Friday night for drinks. They have quite an exquisite but limited indoor seating. COVID did not limit them from setting up a great setup outdoors with heaters while keeping all the safety checks in place. They also have mini stalls with plexi glass separators with heaters that are semi- enclosed. I&apos;d definitely recommend getting a seat there if it gets too cold. They have a special Warm Up Menu where they give you a free blanket on ordering a drink from. I got the Golden Eye - It tasted like a warm glass of spiced milk and felt really good to drink given how cold it was. The alcohol wasn&apos;t too overwhelming but it did leave us filling full. 
Overall, this place can get crowded given its location so if you feel unsafe being around a lot of people, this place may not be for you. Also, be sure to make a reservation ahead of time!"
5,"A+ drinks, A+ service. We stopped in during a walk in the gayborhood and were impressed with the outdoor seating!"
4,"Ordered the meatballs, mushroom toast, bahn mi, croquettes, and bao buns. 

The service and ambiance (even outdoors) was very nice. The food with the price in mind was very so so. It was good but for the price I&apos;d want more. 

It is really nice to have the menu be so eclectic with varying options (Italian and Asian themed). 

The bao buns were the best, make sure you scoop up the sauce. Next preferred the meatballs.

The mushroom toast needed more flavor - some type of sauce or seasoning to power it beyond just mushroom on toast. 

Overall good. Fancy spot with fancy drinks"
3,"It wasn&apos;t a pleasant experience due to multiple reasons 
A) we selected wrong day as it was raining and freezing cold due to that there was no heater (outdoor sitting though) Strange right? 

B) as there was only one server she was quite slow for servicing so she couldn&apos;t take much care

C) because I am a vegetarian I decided to give it a try however only fries was good the rest dishes 2 of them which I don&apos;t recall the name where okaies (Potato Gnocchi &amp;&amp; Wild Mushroom Risotto) 

D) the restaurant is hard to find because no sign or logo all you have to do is read all signs careful"
2,"Came here during covid when the christmas menu was introduced. Was extremely disappointed with the drinks on the warm menu. Thermos was cool, and held a lot of the drink, but it was undrinkable, had a spicy taste when swallowed and did not taste like what was described. 
The good thing was that it came with a comfy blanket, which was very necessary. The outdoor seating is great, we had a reservation but it didn&apos;t seem like you needed one earlier in the afternoon. Heat lamps available."
5,"This place was really good. I was initially very concerned because when I was handed the drink menu there were multiple drinks with a minimum price of 22 bucks.

The food thankfully was a much more manageable price. The mushroom sandwich was very tasty and the bread was delicious. If you like mushrooms, this is the appetizer for you guaranteed. The potatoe croquettes are very simple but very fluffy and not overcooked. The artichoke hearts were cooked well and were very tender making them very easy to chew and absorb the sauce ask in a mouthful. 

The Bahn mi was great. It was both spicy and refreshing at the same time. Everything he tasted like it was made with very high quality ingredients and I really enjoyed it here."
5,"Drinks, dinner, dessert? DOESN&apos;T MATTER.

Do yourself a favor and get to Charlie Was a Sinner Asap!!!! Their appetizers are incredible and the Espresso Martini is my all-time favorite in Philadelphia. (Although, I have come to CWAS for many other cocktails in the past and all have been just as fabulous as the next). YUM!"
5,"I am so glad I found this place. This is so so good, I&apos;m blown away by the food. We had a potato croquettes which are probably my most favourite thing on the menu. The eggplant bao buns the perfect cloudy consistency. The Charlie sliders were also a crowd favourite (you can add on extra  sliders since one serving has 2- our server was super friendly and had great suggestions). I would not order the ricotta again but that&apos;s just me. I would still recommend giving it a shot. Overall, I&apos;ll be coming here very regularly."
4,"This is a really cool spot. For meat-eaters, if you are feeling adventurous and want to try a vegan/vegetarian restaurant - add this to your list. 

I took my wife here a while back for our anniversary, and she is vegetarian (candidly - I wouldn&apos;t have given this a shot if it wasn&apos;t for her.) But as soon as you walk in, you get a good sense that you are going to enjoy your time here. 

It is a smaller space, dim lighting, dark colored accents, but when it is packed with people (pre-covid,) it gives off a classic/swanky restaurant &amp; bar feel that you want to experience in the city. 

The menu is off the charts for vegan options - lots of variety and I even found the dishes to taste pretty good. 

They have a ricotta toast plate that was killer - would highly suggest getting that. We also had cheese poppers that really stood out to me. 

This is a good spot if you are just looking for drinks as well. Creative offerings, and taste great."
5,"A group of friends and I were really curious about this bar after we found out it was vegan! 
We decided to stop by on a Sunday and the host was nice enough to seat our group of 5. 
The waitress was so sweet, she made sure we had everything we needed and answered all our questions and made recommendations.
I ended up getting the mojito, which was light and refreshing. My friends got the coffee based cocktail which was delicious! The punch which was light and fruity, and lastly my vegan friend ended up getting this drink with coconut milk and cardamom, which reminded me of a mango lassi.

All the drinks were fantastic, would come back if I&apos;m ever in the area."
5,"We were intrigued by both the name and the menu! 

We stopped in (or should I say out) over the weekend to try their cocktails. Everyone ordered something different which was nice because we got to sample each other&apos;s. 

Our waitress, Georgia, was awesome! She was personable and made sure that we were taken care of. 

I got the Done and Dusted which was a chocolatey and coffee-like delight! It was boozy but still easy to drink. 

My friend got the Tequila Smash which was basically a mojito made with tequila but refreshing nonetheless. 

My other friends got the Charlie&apos;s Punch which got better with every sip. The top can be a bit watery but it&apos;ll be worth the wait once you get to the middle. 

All the cocktails were amazing, if I&apos;m ever in Philly again I&apos;ll return to try their food."
5,Amazing experience as always! The food is amazing and I must say they are doing a great job at keeping everyone safe and warm. We are outside and they provided a seat warmer and a blanket! Reserving already for next week. Tori was an amazing waitress!!!
4,"Went here after hearing great recommendations from multiple people. Definitely kept me full and tasted great (especially for vegan food), but a little expensive for what it is (tapas style). We ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, ricotta, beyond burger and fries. Spaghetti and meatballs were my favorite and had a slight kick. I would go again, but more as a treat than a regular lunch stop."
3,"Our party ordered potato gnocchi, the spinach artichoke frites, &amp; the eggplant bao buns. Even with the disclaimer of &quot;small plates&quot; the position sizes for are outrageous for what they are priced. You need at least 5 &quot;plates&quot; to makes anything of a meal for a single person. Our gnocchi literally had 8 pieces, of $16.... 

With that said the little amount of food was good; however the Spinach Artichoke Frites were lackluster. 

Before leaving with my order I made sure to confirm there was utensils in the bag to which I was told yes only to find there was not. So I had to search for utensils from other restaurants because I wasn&apos;t on eating near the crowds."
2,"Charlie&apos;s is hands down my favorite restaurant in Philly! I also really love Marquis &amp; Co&apos;s other restaurants, Hip City Veg and Bar Bomb√≥n. Recently though, I came across Hip City Veg&apos;s former employee reviews on Glassdoor and was shocked to read many questionable remarks about the working environment of these restaurants and the way employees are often treated badly. I found this to be so disappointing because I&apos;ve always been so happy to support Charlie&apos;s, especially since it&apos;s a woman-owned business and 100% vegan too. I really hope that the conditions change for employees, especially given that they&apos;re working in the midst of a pandemic too. I want to feel good about supporting Marquis &amp; Co. again."
4,"After a particularly stressful week, a friend and I decided to go to Center City and unwind on a Friday night. Calling around last minute, Charlie Was a Sinner was the only place with reservations available and catered to both my friend (healthy-ish food) and my (good cocktails) tastes. Charlie Was a Sinner is a vegan gastropub and despite not being vegan or vegetarian, I overall enjoyed my time here.

+PARKING: Don&apos;t even try. We opted to Uber here instead of taking our cars because finding parking on this street is notoriously hard and expensive. They even closed down the streets to cars in some parts of this area. So if you can walk or avoid driving, I would to save yourself some time.

+FOOD: The menu was a little confusing to us at first. They have unconventional categories, so it was hard to figure out what were appetizers vs entrees. But the waitress was very helpful and helped us decide what to order. Dining was strictly outdoors and you can scan their QR code to get the menu on your phone.

-CHARRED SHISHITO PEPPERS ($9): Did not like this dish at all. The shishitos were not evenly spicy? The first bunch of the peppers we ate had no spice and it was like eating charred green bell pepper slices. Only 1-2 of the pieces had any real heat to it. Surprisingly the bucatini &amp; meatballs had more heat than the shishito peppers. The romesco sauce really didn&apos;t compliment the peppers. I see that they try to get some sweet to balance the bitter and spice. But didn&apos;t work for me. [Pass]

-AVOCADO TOAST ($10): A favorite of my friends, okay-ish for me. Generous on the amount of avocado, but for $10 I better hope so. The habanero mayo was an interesting twist and it comes with sprouts on top.

-CARAMELIZED EGGPLANT BAO BUNS ($11): So flavorful! The eggplant gives it a sweet, creamy texture that goes so well with the hoisin sauce. Typically this dish is made with duck or pork, but I wasn&apos;t mad at all this was made with eggplant. [Highly recommend]

-SALADE VERTE ($11): Once of the best salads I have had in a while. I was in love with this salad because of the variety of greens. The vinaigrette was fantastic and I loved the different textures. Makes salad not just limited to lettuce or kale/arugula.

-BUCANTINI &amp; MEATBALLS ($16): Very good! But not very interesting. Tastes like a vegan, spicy spaghetti and meatballs. Not sure what the meat in these &quot;meatballs&quot; actually is, but very tender and moist. The flavors were good and I liked the heat in the sauce.

-POTATO GNOCCHI ($16): Like eating pillowy pockets of heaven. The gnocchi is crisp on the inside and so soft on the inside. You know they had to have used a ton of fat to get flavors this rich. The pesto was on point and the white asparagus and summer corn gave a nice break from the heaviness of the sauces.

-BODHISATTVA ($14): If you like mango lassi, you&apos;ll like this cocktail. It&apos;s like a spiked mango smoothie and was perfect for a summer night. I&apos;ve never had a cocktail quite like this and I enjoyed the dash of cardamom on top.

-BRAMBLE ($14): They don&apos;t skip on the booze in this cocktails. I love fruity cocktails and this bramble was wonderful with fresh, muddled blackberries in a strawberry-lemonade juice. Delicious!

+PRICE: Won&apos;t be a cheap date that&apos;s for sure. I recommend ordering about 1 main &quot;entr√©e&quot; (Composition) and 1-2 more smaller dishes to eat per person. All in all, our bill for two was well over $100. The price made me wince, but I think it&apos;s competitive with prices in Center City for a trendy outdoor dining eatery.

Overall: Definitely a spot for special occasions. I can see this place for a girl&apos;s night out and tapas-style eating. If you enjoy creative cocktails and lighter fare, I recommend checking Charlie Was a Sinner out."
4,It was my first time trying this restaurant and I was impressed with the amount of seating they had. They also had great heaters that accommodated every table. I ordered a spiked hot apple cider drink that came with a blanket (at a cost) but it was a nice touch. My partner order the spiked hot chocolate and it was spicy... we weren&apos;t a huge fan. All the food was inventive and delicious! The Korean tofu was a bit spicy but still yummy. The potato croquettes and the aioli they came with were out of this world! The inside was gorgeous and the staff was top notch!
5,"As someone who can&apos;t eat dairy, but still eats meat was on the fence about this one before I came. But WOW; so incredible. The drinks were so good (and strong) and a great cocktail list highlighting all liquor options. I had the potato croquettes and the eggplant bao which were both incredible. Can&apos;t wait to come back for a full dinner!!"
5,"Came here mainly for cocktails, but was surprisingly blown away by the food as well!

To start off, the service was fantastic. We walked in on a weekday, and were seated immediately. Our server was incredibly kind and gave us some great recommendations. I had the penicillin which was such a great cocktail. Well balanced, with scotch and a hint of ginger. 

Like I said, we mainly came for cocktails but I was blown away by the food as well. I definitely did not miss having meat, and has blown away by the vegan menu. The potato croquettes were fantastic, crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. We also had the Korean tofu which was flavorful with a spicy kick. 

Can&apos;t wait to go back soon and indulge in some more cocktails and apps!"
