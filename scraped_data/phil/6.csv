5,"The food here was so good! My friend and I ordered the 8 course meal and the food comes pretty quickly after we finished each meal. Also, if you order the course meal, they let you take your time so don&apos;t feel pressured finish in an hr (there&apos;s a server that sorta felt rude, but w.e. I&apos;m only here for the food) there&apos;s plastic walls everywhere so no one next to you can breathe near you and the servers all wear facemasks while serving you. Our waitress helped us a lot with choosing our drink and we got really delicious ones"
5,"The in-house experience with food is just as good as takeout. Their Sukiyaki Udon is good with a sweet hint from the onions. But if you&apos;re looking for a premium beef experience, I would highly recommend their wagyu beef. Yellowtail maki is fresh and flavourful."

5,"I cannot begin to explain what a privilege it was to eat at Morimoto.  I do a lot of eating all over the country and Morimoto is the fifth iron chef restaurant I have had the honor of trying. 

All I can say I was simply left speechless."
4,"Visited the famed Morimoto restaurant on Valentine&apos;s Day and sat in their outdoor chalet&apos;s. It was a chilly night and unlike the other Stephen Starr outdoor setups, this one was not up to snuff. Unfortunately, that was one of the reasons why we chose this restaurant. The vented heating was clearly not working so each table had a couple of floor space heaters, but that was not useful at all, and made the rest of dinner fairly uncomfortable. Couple that with the terribly slow service and we couldn&apos;t wait to leave. There was a 30 min lag between two appetizers and it took     1 hr and 45 min to receive our entrees which is absolutely unacceptable on any day. The only reason this is 4 stars is because the food was so darn good! We mostly went with the waiter&apos;s recommendations on this one and it worked out very well!

Appetizers - Tempura Rock Shrimp and Tuna Tartare. Both were good, but the tartare stole the show! It was fantastic.

Entrees - Chef&apos;s combination sushi, Black Cod Miso, Tableside Buri Ishi Yaki Bop, and Shrimp Tempura Roll. All 4 were top notch. The sushi was fresh and flavorful. The Black cod miso was flaky with a crispy skin and one of the best renditions of this classic dish I&apos;ve had. Finally, the ishi yaki bop sounds simple, but the fresh vegetables, sauces, and crispy rice came together nicely

Dessert -  Fiery Chocolate Tart is not just about the frills, it was delicious, with a lot of small components that play off of each other well. Great balance of sweet, tart, tangy, crunchy and the brownies were awesome

I will likely return, but definitely not for a holiday or for outdoor dining during the the winter."
4,"Trendy spot for dinner. Food is on the pricier side, but that&apos;s kind of expected here. I recommend the wasabi fried rice and the toro scallion roll. The wasabi fried rice was unlike anything I&apos;ve ever had. It had a nice wasabi kick without being too overpowering. Portions were pretty big for it too. Toro scallion roll was rich and delicious. 

The other dishes we tried were the spicy tuna roll (nothing to write home about), wagyu beef ishi yaki bop (good but also pricey), and the koji salmon. My salmon was pretty good. The skim was crispy and the salmon itself was PERFECTLY cooked. They use king salmon so the fish was nice and fatty and moist. Only thing was the salmon was a bit on the saltier side. Service was pretty good. They were quite busy on the night we dined in, but that should be taken as a good sign. We made reservations in advance and was lucky enough to get an indoor spot."
5,Food is delicious Scott Our server was great. Very personable! Check on us every time food came out to see if we liked it! Definitely would come back.
4,"Perfect for date night :)
We came here for a special night and got a bunch of dishes ranging from the ramen soup, sushi, salmon, and cod, and we enjoyed the food and ambiance. Service was polite and helpful."
4,"Good sushi! I split the Chef Combination for two, which was a platter of sushi, sashimi, and cuts of fish. For those of us who have a hard time deciding on even one item on a menu, this is an easy way to efficiently get a large sampling of sushi.

The outdoor seating area is well spaced out, the waiter was helpful and friendly, and it was a good dining experience overall.

Four instead of five stars because it seemed a bit pricy for the quality. The sushi was above average but not the most amazing sushi I&apos;ve ever had, which is what I was expecting from a restaurant by a famous sushi chef."
2,"As an avid-foodie and sushi lover, I couldn&apos;t be more excited to try Morimoto. I must admit - I didn&apos;t get sushi so maybe that&apos;s where I made a mistake but I was highly disappointed. My bowl was extremely bland and the service was nothing to write home about which I wasn&apos;t expecting at such a high-profile place. When asked for a house tequila soda, they used Casa Migos so our drinks were $17 each which I wish I would&apos;ve known before ordering. All in all, I really want to give this place another go and go straight for the sushi."
4,"It&apos;s good to see that a place like Morimoto is still very much thriving amidst the whole pandemic. Booked for an early dinner, this place is packed. This is Morimoto&apos;s first restaurant which opened in 2001 in the heart of Philadelphia. 

They are adhering to all COVID-19 protocols. The most high tech temp scan that I have come across. Probably what you would see in Asia. Face the small scanner and it will read and tell you your temp with a &quot;pass&quot; reading before you proceed inside. Plexiglas at every table with the entire staff in mask, shields and gloves.

The decor reminds me of the ocean with cool neon dimmed lights. Perfect for a first or romantic date with sexy shaped lamps that will put anyone in the mood.

I expect a lot coming into a place stamped with Morimoto&apos;s name. To start, we had the Toro Tartare. The flavor had me wanting bite after bite. It&apos;s a sexy app and I appreciate their homemade taro chips. Next, we had their $23 Rock Shrimp Tempura. Major fail. Having just had the best thing in my mouth and then this over-fried, greasy dish with the batter overwhelming the tiny shrimp. I just forced myself to have 4 pieces before letting my companions finished it. We all shook our head like WTH with a frown on our faces. Why did I order this? Our waiter highly recommended it.

Our entrees made a redemption. Here is what we ordered:
- Chirashi Bowl (nothing spectacular about it)
- Ishi Yaki Bop w/fish (amazing) 
- Hokkaido Snow Beef, A5 Wagyu (perfection)
- Morimoto&apos;s Ramen Soup (this won me over)

Dessert:
- Fiery Chocolate Tart (no sesame detected)
- Japanese S&apos;mores Ice Cream (graham cracker was hard)
I&apos;m not a huge chocolate fan but my companions enjoyed it. I thought the brownies were super dense, like a brick. I should have ordered a mochi, fruity one for myself. 

Overall a great meal and expect to spend a $$$. It&apos;s all about the experience at a place like this. 5 stars to the entire staff."
5,"Came here to celebrate a new job promotion! It&apos;s a classy, expensive, and unforgettable meal. The atmosphere is swanky and modern, but still comfortable. My gf and I split the chefs tasting menu, which changes daily, and a selection of sushi. Everything we had was out of this world. We aren&apos;t huge Saki fans,  but we ordered a flight which gave us a great opportunity to try different kinds. I would highly recommend the chefs tasting menu, it was beautiful and delicious. I will never forget this meal - worth the price and hype."
3,"Came here to celebrate our anniversary. In short: for $400/ 2 people, I expected better, especially from somewhere with Morimotos name on it. 

We did 2 tasting menus + 1 beverage pairing. 

The beverage pairing was great and complements the dishes really well. 

The appetizers were tasty, the portions were ok. Portions of the hot plates (cod and wagyu) are very small. Our wagyu was presented to us as &quot;medium rare&quot; - completely well done. Chewy, ruined excellent cut of meat. Really disappointing and a manager came over to ask for more detail and that was about it. 

Service was super slow. I&apos;m sure they&apos;re understaffed, but we were told explicitly that we had a 1.5 hour limit on our table, yet 2.5 hours later we still had 2 courses to go. 

We sat outside and the heaters don&apos;t help much - it was extremely cold and as it got later the experience got less and less pleasant (few beggars asking for money, random shouting, colder temps etc). Not necessarily the restaurants fault, but something to consider. 

All in all, the food was good, but didn&apos;t warrant the price tag and service left much to be desired. Sadly, don&apos;t think I&apos;ll be going back after this when Philly has so many other excellent spots."
3,"Due to lack of things to do, I&apos;ve really dug deep to finish these drafts of venues that aren&apos;t just in another city from the past, but also places that don&apos;t even exist anymore. Here, it&apos;s good to see morimoto still stands!

I remember morimoto for two random things: where I first learned what &apos;omakase&apos; meant, and where I heard the word &apos;buri bop.&apos; To this day, I haven&apos;t tried either, but both originated from here (for me). 

Typical flashy Starr establishment, where sparkle will always get my short-term attention. First off, for the artistic vibe, you are greeted by a giant black...blob at the front by the hostess stand. Onto the dining room, it&apos;s designed into a long, rectangular shape with no room to hide. Two-seaters line the walls on either side, while tables for larger parties were in the middle of the restaurant. Phallic candles sat on each table, adding to the ambience of the constantly-color changing glowing decor. The sushi bar sat at the far end, but I never ventured this far in. The only separation was the upstairs lounge which was above the entrance. This space sat a smaller group and had its own bar, with an oblong shaped window that looked over the remaining restaurant below.

Since I don&apos;t eat sushi (I know kappa and avocado rolls don&apos;t count), I can&apos;t really wax poetic about their food but everyone I was with highly enjoyed the place. I thought the service was great, from the hostesses to the waitstaff. What I was impressed with was when I asked the friendly hostess for some matches, she handed over these super-sized boxes, pictured below (there are two traditional sized boxes housed in the longer box). Surprised I&apos;ve kept them for this long! 

They&apos;ve lasted this long in addition to their New York City location, so they must be doing something right. I suppose the equivalent where I am now would be Katsuya or Nobu."
4,Decided to splurge a little here. I had a delivery order of sushi and sashimi. Food was packaged very well to protect the contents and liquids were double packed to prevent leaks. The food was delivered fairly quickly and I was very happy with the food. I took out one star because I was expecting the food to wow me esp because of the price. Food was excellent nonetheless. Will have to try dining at the restaurant in the future to gain the full experience.
4,"My dream is to do the tasting menu at Morimoto someday. The pandemic forced me to do takeout and it&apos;s a great preview of what to expect. I got the sushi sampler with the ramen upgrade. Personally I would not get the ramen upgrade again-good flavor but the broth was too salty. The noodles were also regular noodles(rice noodles?) but definitely not ramen shop ramen. Go to your nearby ramen shop for ramen needs. 

However the sushi sampler with premium tuna and a small cake piece on the side were amazing. Would definitely do this again!"
5,"When I lived in Philadelphia, I would pass by Morimoto&apos;s, and wonder if I would ever be able to afford the omakase menu. Now, over ten years later, I made my first reservation, and made sure I was hungry before attending. 

I was promptly seated at the sushi bar, and was given excellent service by the staff. Watching the food get prepared was a great way to heighten my excitement for each upcoming dish. Each plate was presented with gusto and style, and the flavors expanded with each bite. The fish dishes had that lovely, clean, &quot;ocean water&quot; flavor that comes from obvious freshness, and the grilled and poached dishes were delicate and brimmed with umami. 

Each successive dish seemed better than the last, although some were particular standouts, including the sashimi salad, the carpaccio and the toro tartare. Paired with sake, this was quite a meal to enjoy, although I did not have the stomach capacity (and nor the will/ability) to have the dessert, which my server kindly preemptively packed when I mentioned I was getting excessively full. 

Overall, excellent service, interesting decor, and delicious food. It definitely met my expectations, and I would love to try the omakase again when I return to Philly."
4,"The crab and shrimp tempura sushi were good. Wasabi rice was surprisingly flavorful, was not sure what to expect. The kani salad was really good, my favorite of all the items. The summer ramen noodle was bland and I did not finish it. House salad was good and the dressing had a nice fresh flavor. I will say that I did not know what bonito was and just assumed it was a vegetable, since it was a house salad. Nope, it&apos;s fish flakes so if that is not your thing, let them know. I don&apos;t eat fish, clearly. 

This was a delivery order. Panna Cotta was missing from my order but I am not sure if it was not put in the bag or if it was out of stock. Caviar does not specify why an item was missing but they refunded it."
5,"I came to Morimoto during the summer of last year for a birthday event; I knew I wanted to come here after hearing many great these regarding the Omakase. 

The restaurant offers both traditional dining options where you can order dishes individually, but I personally recommend the tasting menu. The Morimoto Omakase is $125 per person and will take you through a journey with a variety of fish, beef, and vegetables. My personal favorites were the tartar and wagyu, which I believe you can also order independently, but I thought including this in the tasting helped balance out the delicacy of the sushi! The sushi plate included a variety of fish that were freshly cut, but I honestly felt that this wasn&apos;t the star of the meal. The plates are quite small, but I felt sufficiently full at the end of all the courses. I also appreciated that they inserted a palette cleanser in the middle of the experience. 

Next time, I&apos;m hoping to try the beverage omakase along with the chef&apos;s tasting menu; I can imagine the restaurant put lots of thought on which drinks to pair with what course. I found the service here to be top notch with the team checking in to ensure everything came out great. Definitely a spot to recommend."
5,"Wow wow wow.

I went here for my birthday one year ago, and I can still remember so many little touches from the absolutely incredible dinner we had that night.

From the cocktails upstairs before we were sat at our table, to the impeccable service from a superbly coordinated waitstaff, to the simple flute of champagne on the house, to the actual dinner courses - the food - oh, what food.

Please do not come here and *not* do the chef&apos;s tasting, unless of course, you hate flavor and incredible dining. (Or you&apos;re on budget, which - respect.)

We experienced so many different flavors in the space of 2 hours - the way the chef combines ingredients is unlike other restaurant, be it Japanese, Asian fusion, sushi, or other small plates spots that have come to be. The remixing and reforming of things we&apos;ve all had before (fresh fish, vegetables, potato, fish eggs, vinegars, spices, sauces, fruits and gelatins) was phenomenal, and I cannot do them justice with any of my own words.

Whenever we can get back here, we will. And I send the chef, sous chefs, and staff both applause for what we were so grateful to experience, and positivity for the the future."
