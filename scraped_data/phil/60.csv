5,"I wanted to try a different cheesesteak spot this time in Philly and so glad I stopped at Sonnys. I placed an order on a cold Saturday afternoon and the food was ready 15 mins after. Their online ordering system is really easy to navigate. My friend and I shared the loaded cheesesteak and fries whiz wit. The bread was an amoroso roll and the steak was cooked fresh. The combination of fresh peppers, grilled onions, perfectly cooked steak and a slather of whiz was amazing. The fries themselves were fried just right and you could dip it in the creamy whiz. Great combination of textures. 

Covid measures here they have the conditions down pat. Everyone is wearing gloves, masks, fiber glass around the cashier and they have sanitizer every where. Highly recommend ordering online via their website and doing pick up. Perfect if you want limited interaction. No indoor seating and plenty of street parking. If you want quality cheesesteaks at great value this is a great spot"
5,"A solid cheesesteak option! I&apos;m sure an life long Philadelphian will disagree but that&apos;s the beauty of a city full of options. 

An easy place to order form during the pandemic. The online ordering is easy to use and gives you an estimated time to pick up your food. A place with online ordering that doesn&apos;t require me to talk to human is always my favorite. Sometimes you just don&apos;t want to people ;-) 

In normal times, they do have some limited indoor seating!"
5,"Sonny&apos;s is without a doubt a top ten Philly cheesesteak - no question. I have it ranked as my number seven, and it might dip one or two places when I try the highly regarded John&apos;s Roast Pork and Angelo&apos;s steaks, but it certainly has the qualities of a top-notch steak. 

The roll was an immediate standout. A great Philly cheesesteak, in my opinion, is defined by its roll. The roll embraces the juiciness of the meat, without making the bread too soggy, and Sonny&apos;s steak did exactly that. The meat was nicely sliced and held the flavors wonderfully. I won&apos;t say it&apos;s the best tasting meat on the market, but it&apos;s better than most. The provolone was also thick and tasty - a little bit too packed to the side for my liking, but still another strong facet to the sandwich.  

I picked up the steaks for my grandfather and I, and after a bad experience doing takeout from Max&apos;s, I was hesitant on how the warmth and tenderness of the steak would hold up during the car ride home. Unlike Max&apos;s, Sonny&apos;s steak was able to withstand the brief journey, and retain most of the heat packed within the wrapping. 

My grandfather doesn&apos;t venture out to many other steak shops around the city, and even he had great things to say about Sonny&apos;s. With all your options down in Old City, Sonny&apos;s Famous is the place to go, and you won&apos;t be disappointed."
5,"One of the best cheesesteaks I&apos;ve had in my life!! This was my first time at Sonny&apos;s and man was I impressed. I went with the regular philly cheesesteak (with lettuce, tomatoes, and onions) and a side of fries. Eating that in the dead of winter warms you up and hits the spot! Since I went during COVID times, I had to order on the phone and wait for pick up. It had quite a crowd even at 2pm on a Saturday! I could definitely see this becoming my go to spot whenever I&apos;m in town."
5,"One of my fav place, whenever I&apos;m in philly, I always get the Philly cheesesteak form this place. I am not an expert in Pilot cheesesteak but I have tried many other places and this is my fav place."
3,For a quick bite to eat around the neighborhood it&apos;s definitely the spot! They&apos;ve got different types of flavor cheesesteaks! I wouldn&apos;t mind coming back without covid and experience other types of subs! Service is quick and in point! Love the classic feel when you walk in! Quality of food is definitely worth a second visit!
5,"This is my first time actually going to Sonny&apos;s famous steak shop, but I&apos;ve been to Philadelphia many a time to get a good Philly cheesesteak. Without a doubt the service and the cheesesteak were unquestionably top notch. I would highly recommend this place to anybody that is in Philadelphia. They are definitely write their neck and neck with reading market cheese steaks. The only problem with this location is parking. Also for those out of Towners make sure you order a &quot;Beef wiz wit&quot;. Trust me you&apos;ll love it! It&apos;s so OG like Snoop Dogg!"
4,This was a good cheesesteak. From the sweetness of the peppers to to earthiness of the mushrooms. The cheese fries was an excellent addition as well. Will definitely swing by here again when in the mood for a Philly cheesesteak.
5,"Another Friday, another lunch out with my friend and coworker. Decided to try a new cheesesteak place for us, but Sonny&apos;s has been around for some time.

Oh, Boy! This was one of the best cheesesteaks I&apos;ve ever had and would be probably #2 on my list next to Joe&apos;s Steak (formerly Chink&apos;s and see my review!). Right amount of meat, cheese, and onions and shrooms. A little too much on the sweet peppers for me, but the roll kicked major butt. What a great combo to make an awesome sandwich. Had some fries and they got a little soggy back to the office, but still quite tasty.

Sonny&apos;s has plain, loaded (which is what I had and took a picture), bacon, hoagie with lettuce/tomato/red onion/mayo, pizza steak, and pepperoni cheesesteak. They also sell the right sides like fries of all sorts, onion rings, and mozzarella sticks. But, there&apos;s more! You can get burgers and, get this, grilled cheese in multiple styles!

In these COVID-19 times, they are limiting the numbers in the store, everyone wears masks, and you have to go outside to wait for your order until they call your number. There&apos;s also about four metal tables to sit at to eat if you wish outside. 

Overall, definitely five stars for this awesome cheesesteak. No peppers next time for me.

$12 for the ultimate cheesesteak, $10 for the plain, and $3 for fries. Not bad at all."
5,"What a cheesesteak! They refused to make a sandwich that was half fully loaded And half classic and that&apos;s how you know you&apos;re in a place with Philadelphia pride. The bread was soft and fluffy, perfect Philadelphia hoagie. The onions are cut into large chunks so if you like your cheesesteak &apos;wit&apos;, this place is got the other ones beat. They gave me peppers and mushrooms on the side and I fully loaded the other half. What a delicious departure!  Every time I&apos;m in Philadelphia I get a cheesesteak in a different place. Jim&apos;s is my go to, but this is what I will definitely return to.  A excellent Tuesday - I promised myself I would only eat 1/2 and keep the rest for tomorrow... So much for that!"
2,"Underwhelmed. Drove all the way up to Philly to enjoy a cheesesteak from Sonny&apos;s (it was recommended) and was disappointed. I almost wanted to toss it but wasn&apos;t going to let food go to waste. 

I ordered both the regular cheesesteak and a chicken cheesesteak. The regular cheesesteak was a bit skimpy in comparison to other places...and was just meh...the chicken cheesesteak was tossed. Zero flavor. 

Scratching this one off my list."
5,"While visiting Philadelphia, I decided to try an authentic Philly Cheesesteak, and Sonny&apos;s Famous Steaks came highly recommended by friends. They were so right! I ordered a cheesesteak with cheese whiz and grilled onions and a side of fries. Everything was delicious! The sandwich was filled with tasty chopped beef and the cheese whiz, which I never eat, was perfect. I wish the grilled onions had been more caramelized because they were a little too raw for my taste. The fries were crispy, hot and just all-around good. 

I suggest ordering ahead because you will encounter a line. The restaurant itself is very small, and only three customers are allowed in the restaurant at a time due to COVID-19. However, if you choose to wait, the food is definitely worth it. 

I can&apos;t wait to visit again in the future! Highly recommended!"
5,"Best Philly cheesesteaks I&apos;ve ever had! Get it with cheez whiz. Highly recommended, I&apos;ll definitely come back"
5,"Made a run to Philly for a good cheesesteak. First stop was Sonny&apos;s Famous Steak. 

This was a very delicious cheesesteak. I kept it classic with cheese wiz, peppers, and onions. It was a melt your mouth type of cheesesteak. Every bite was such an adventure in mouth and I cherished it all. 

Must get it and will come back for more."
4,Great cheesesteaks! Friendly staff. The only reason I don&apos;t give it more stars-you&apos;ll definitely be waiting for your cheesesteak.
5,"Little day trip to Philly wouldn&apos;t be complete without a cheesesteak so Sonny&apos;s was the choice. 

Placed an order for pickup over the phone. Very simple and the lady who answered the phone was nice. 

I got the chicken cheesesteak hoagie with red hots and it was sooo good. I inhaled my sandwich lol. 

Would recommend and return next time I&apos;m in Philly."
5,"Sonny&apos;s is one of the most famous Cheesesteak locations in Philadelphia. Their sandwich options are very customizable and their French fries are great too. If you are from out of town looking for a quintessentially Philadelphia experience, Sonny&apos;s is a great option. Their location also gives plenty of opportunities for tourist activities such as window shopping and visiting the Liberty Bell. Sonny&apos;s also offers gluten free rolls for those who have an intolerance! Their pandemic operation is seamless and efficient but be ready for a 20+ minute wait if you come at popular times...

Bacon Cheesesteak (5/5): This was a great take on the classic cheesesteak. I ordered mine with white American cheese and saut√©ed onions and it was great. It comes with plenty of steak, but it&apos;s not overflowing or unmanageable. 

Fries (5/5): Their fries are great. They are thin and just crispy enough. 

Sonny&apos;s offers pretty big portions for the price. Though this isn&apos;t a cheap eat, you surely won&apos;t leave hungry. Their staff is helpful, polite, and fast. If you are looking to have a unique culinary experience in Philadelphia, Sonny&apos;s is a great option for all."
1,"On to the next one, Sonny&apos;s was my third Philly cheesesteak experience on my trip. I was still on my mission to find that one Philly cheesesteak that would wow me.

I ordered a Philly Cheesesteak with mozzarella cheese, mushrooms, and fried onions. This cheesesteak was so disappointing. The meat had no flavor. The mushrooms were lightly cooked. The fried onions were super crunchy. The bread was basically a giant hot dog bun. It was not toasted like I thought the bun would be; instead it had that steamed taste to it. The only thing that was good about the cheesesteak was the mozzarella cheese. I only ordered the cheesesteak and a bottled water, and my total was $14.00. That was not worth the price.

Of all the Philly cheesesteaks I tried on my trip, Sonny&apos;s was by far the worst one."
5,"Must go when in philly!
Stopped by in the midst of COVID for takeout.

The cashier guy was extremely nice and order was fast. Felt they were careful and trying their best with sanitation and quick service!"
4,"When I visit Philly,  I always like to try out a different cheesesteak spot.  On my recent visit, I came to Sonny&apos;s. My girlfriend and I stopped here on a Saturday.  Luckly,  there wasn&apos;t too crazy of a long line.  I placed my order and waited outside for my number to be called when ready.  It was a smooth process.  I ordered my cheesesteak with onions and both american cheese and cheese wiz. This was another great tasting cheesesteak that Philly has to offer. The meat was cooked perfectly; nice and tender.  The double cheese combo made it extra cheesy, which i love.  The bread was very fresh and soft.  I loved everything about this cheesesteak.   As usual,  I ate the whole steak sandwich in one sitting,  so that&apos;s a sign this place is great.  You cant go wrong by stopping in this location if you&apos;re looking for a juicy cheesesteak sandwich.  I recommend giving it a try."
