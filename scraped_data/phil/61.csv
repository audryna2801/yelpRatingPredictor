5,"Had the best mango lassi I&apos;ve ever had! And I&apos;ve tried mango lassis at many locations. So refreshing, creamy and delicious! The person working the store is also very friendly and passionate - something that makes attending Mood Cafe even more worth your while. They also have a ton of flavors to try if you&apos;re feeling adventurous."
5,"AMAZING LASSIS OF ALL KINDS! Yes, this place deserves all caps. There are a million different flavors and combinations listed on the blackboard. I recommend trying something other than the classic mango lassi, though I hear it&apos;s fantastic.

My party of 3 each got something different: mixed berry, mango and guava, and pistachio cardamom. These were all BOMB in their own different ways. Also if there&apos;s extra lassi, the owner will give it to you in a separate little cup."
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! If you are from here or just driving through philly definitely stop by to get one of the 60 flavors of lassi. All can be made non dairy / vegan and it has absolutely amazing customer service. The price is tooo good for what you get will be absolutely coming back!
2,"Everyone&apos;s been raving about Mood Cafe and I finally got a chance to try it out! The food always looked intimidating to me, but I was down to try something new. They have plenty of options for chaats and lassi&apos;s. I decided to try the samosa chaat and mango lassi. It was good, but not good enough for me to want to get it again. I can&apos;t get with the mixture of cold and hot toppings. And I also felt like the chaat was missing something. Something to take it to the level of flavors I was looking for. Maybe I should&apos;ve gotten something besides the samosa chaat? Idk. The mango lassi however was delicious. 

Another reason for the lack of stars is because of the owner. He was definitely friendly as everyone suggested, but to me it came off as creepy. He took my debit card and proceeded to hold it, and look at it for like 2 minutes. Then asked me where I was from and just stared at me. Not sure how to take that or if I&apos;m looking into it too much, but it did make me uncomfortable. I was so glad that there was a couple in the restaurant because I would&apos;ve hated for that kind of interaction to happen to me while I was alone..."
5,"The place to go to get your Pakistani traditional drinks, desserts and authentic lassi!  Great menu variety, super friendly staff and reasonable prices. Very tasty &amp; super sweet food ( if you do not have a sweet tooth, probably not the place the place for you ).  Authentic taste and flavorful menu options.

PROS - Authentic menu, great variety, reasonable price, friendly owner

CONS - Parking"
4,"This is a pretty cool place to get some really authentic lassi! I&apos;ve never had the food so I can&apos;t speak to it. I&apos;ve tried mango, rose (which has really rose petals!), lychee, cardamom and they&apos;re all so good! The guy who runs it is super nice (although he wasn&apos;t wearing a mask today which I didn&apos;t love, I hope he normally wears one since he&apos;s handling food). The times i&apos;ve gone prior to covid he always give a cup extra to be nice."
4,"Second time coming here. Mango lassi is a must!!! 

Location: it&apos;s quite a walk from University City area-- past Clark Park. But will say the walk is definitely worth it!

Service: the owner is always so sweet. Grows his own roses and gives you extra lassi in a smaller cup with the leftovers. Size of lassi is pretty large for one person. 

Food: the chaat was cold (not sure if it&apos;s supposed to be) but it was my first time having chaat and I wasn&apos;t that big of a fan. Mango lassi was 10/10. Rose lassi was done with a combination of a recommended spices from the owner. It had an aftertaste I wasn&apos;t too fond of but still good overall. A clean taste."
5,"This place is a cute little place on the corner of Baltimore ave. I absolutely adore the owner as he is very friendly, helpful, and interactive. I went in here being short with a couple of dollars and he still took care of me and my requests. I&apos;ve never met anyone as nice and good hearted like him. Not only was he an amazing person but his food is one of the best I ever had. It&apos;s affordable and so flavorful. The meal isn&apos;t complete without his homemade lassi especially the mango lassis. I definitely recommend this place to everyone."
5,"Simply my favorite lassi and chaat in Philly!  You can customize the lassi however you want and there is a flavor combo menu if unfamiliar with them.  Mango lassi with mint and hint of cardamom is the bomb in a 95 degree day!!
The chaats speak for themselves. Sweet, spicy, crunchy, and soft all in one dish. Wish these were in every corner."
1,"Food is not good. Lassi is ok. I went after reading it&apos;s reviews, but they are just hyped unnecessarily."
5,"VISIT HISTORY: 
- Last visit: last Thursday with a friend 
- Frequency: this was my second time. First time I came with a foodie friend who had Mood cafe on her list for awhile.
- Next visit? Maybe once more before I leave Phily but it&apos;s kinda far. Distance is the only factor though.

FOODRINK:
- Mangk Lassi: my friend had been craving the Lassi for so long and we were so focused on getting this Lassi that we left our cards at the previous restaurant we were at. It&apos;s made right on the spot. I wish there had been more yogurt. The options for lassis are endless. 
- Crazy Chaat: its house specialty! The sauce is aaaaawwweesssoomee. It&apos;s the perfect amount of cool, chilly, and spice. The potatoes are diced tomatoes perfect bite sizes. Lovr the crunch mixed with the creamy sauce and the refreshing zeal of the chutney. I wished we weren&apos;t so full from dinner but we still finished 80% of it.

VIBE:
- Very casual 
- Pretty small 
- Unexpectedly cute 
- The type of authentic place that doesn&apos;t focus on decoration. 
- Sits maybe maximum 8 people. 
- Service was great. Guy smiled a lot and gave funny suggestions. 
- Wait time for food arrival: almost non-existent"
5,Owned by a very kind man! So many flavors! Snack on some chaat! Recommend the rose lassi and the chaat with samosa.
5,"Seriously an awesome place. Stopped in last weekend to try it out while I was waiting on laundry, and the owner was awesome. Made tons of suggestions, was patient while I decided (first time getting a lassi) what I wanted and even whipped up a few samples for me! Seriously a great guy and AWESOME lassis! If you stop in try the mango or rose+cardamom!"
5,"5.0/5 

The lassi&apos;s at Mood Cafe aren&apos;t just good; they&apos;re heavenly. What&apos;s more, there&apos;s more flavors than you could ever imagine. Upon entering the cafe, you&apos;re immediately greeted by a huge chalkboard with a listing of 60 lassi and &quot;lassi combination&quot; flavors. There are your standard options -- like mango -- but also many more incredibly unique and exciting flavors to try: rose, apple fig, date almond, spicy mint, &quot;salty queen&quot; (this one&apos;s a bit of an enigma), orange papaya, peaches &amp; cream...

But it doesn&apos;t stop there. The owner, Hassan, actually initially made a menu of 140 items, until he realized that customers were suffering from decision paralysis. If you ask, he&apos;ll craft an off-menu lassi custom made for you. After learning that I like nuts, he made me one of his own personal favorites, &quot;almond pistachio with a dash of cardamom&quot;. It -- and each of the ~8-10 flavors I&apos;ve tried so far -- was DELICIOUS. I would go so far as to describe Hassan&apos;s lassi combinations as an experience, not just a drink. In the first sip, you&apos;re hit with the whirlwind of different flavors in your mouth. It&apos;s surprising, so you sip again. Perhaps the flavor gives you an immediate joy, or perhaps you&apos;re not sure what to think. Nonetheless, you&apos;re intrigued. So you sip again. Soon enough, with sip after sip, you begin unraveling the complex tastes of the drink, until it gains a familiarity that makes the flavor even more delicious with every sip.

Protip: If you like the yogurt flavor of traditional lassi&apos;s, ask for a yogurt base. If you prefer something more like a juice smoothie, ask for a juice base.

Besides the tastiness of the drinks, I&apos;d also like to note that the owner Hassan is incredibly friendly. Every time I&apos;ve gone with friends, he&apos;ll give us an extra sample cup with each of our drinks so that we can trade and try each other&apos;s flavors. He promises not to charge us if we don&apos;t like our drink, though we&apos;ve never done that of course because every drink is delicious. The last time I went, he even gave my friend and I extra sample cups from a different customer&apos;s custom drink, so that we could try a new flavor he had never made before, &quot;rose mint&quot;. (This one&apos;s particularly special because it&apos;s made from rose and mint that Hassan grew himself!) Mood Cafe&apos;s massive menu is something Hassan has incredible fun with, and you can see it in the delight on his face when he gets to combine different ingredients in new and interesting ways.

While I usually go to Mood Cafe for the lassis, the chaat is also pretty tasty. Warning: If you ask for &quot;very spicy&quot;, it&apos;s ACTUALLY very spicy, not your typical Americanized &quot;very spicy&quot;. I consider myself to have a fairly okay spice tolerance, and I absolutely died. Thank goodness I had the lassi to save me from the fire ^^;; On the other hand, I didn&apos;t find the &quot;medium spicy&quot; to be spicy at all.

In summary, would highly highly recommend, especially the lassi combinations! And if you have the time, be sure to strike up a conversation with the owner too -- he&apos;s super friendly!"
5,"First things first, the food is really good. Enjoyed by Chicken Chaat and Strawberry Lassi. The other thing is that the owner is so nice. I was a klutz and dropped my Lassi on the way out the door. Literally spilled it on their front step. The owner felt bad for me and made me another one right away. I offered to pay for it and he wouldn&apos;t let me. Another worker cleaned up the mess on the front step before I could attempt to leave a second time. All in all, great food and great service."
5,"This was my first time trying Pakistani food! Chaat is very interesting - every bite gives you a different flavor due to the different layers incorporated into the dish. I tried the samosa chaat (the samosa was delicious!) and the dish was great! Know that this dish isn&apos;t hot (temperature-wise), the samosa or whatever add on you get is warm but the base is chickpeas and potatoes and they are cooked but not hot. Very interesting dish and I&apos;m so glad I tried it! I also got a mango lassi - very yummy! I tasted the fog lassi which I found delicious (it&apos;s yogurt based with chunks of fig!) 

The location is very cozy and the owner is extremely friendly and welcoming. We had no idea what we were ordering and he explained everything to us! Thank you so much for the hospitality and the introduction to a new and delicious food!"
5,"Dear Mood Cafe, I apologize it took me so many years to walk in your establishment and discover the clean eating awesomeness that awaited all this time....from the outside i swore it was just another coffee shop with overpriced desserts and &quot;sustainable&quot; coffee beans hand picked by artisans who left their investment banker careers to pursue their passion for high end coffee...but its not your story, just 80% of the other shops. 

Mood Cafe sits right in the heart of west philly around 46th and baltimore  Its a Pint-sized Indian place doling out lassis, ice cream &amp; other sweet treats, plus savory chaats but it packs a big flavorful punch!!.
Everything is made to order and their are an endless number of chaat options so i suggest you go with the pina colada or any flavor combos you&apos;re familiar with. 

I got the chicken tikka...i wish i could describe to you how fresh, light, and flavorful this was....but you just have to try it yourself. This place is easily my go-to for a light in hearty quick meal. Period."
5,"I&apos;m usually good with words but for once I don&apos;t know where to begin. 
Just go. Let the amazing owner work his magic. 

Get the crazy chaat. Let him suggest the lassi flavor. Sit back and enjoy the sweetest, most generous hospitality ever."
5,"Like many stores that line Baltimore Avenue in West Philly, Mood Cafe is privately owned and a sister store to Desi Village and Desi Chaat House. I have frequented Desi Chaat House more often because they have more variety of chaat, but Mood Cafe has more lassi options. I really like their lassi because it isn&apos;t that sweet, and my favourite is cardamom lassi. It has a slight tanginess from the yoghurt and just the right amount of cardamom flavour. It&apos;s actually really refreshing to drink on a very hot day. Mango lassi is very good also, once again with just the right sweetness and enough mango flavour. This time I ordered Kashmiri chaat and asked mine to be medium spicy. I love eating chaat during the summer months because it&apos;s refreshing and kind of helps my appetite when you don&apos;t want to eat anything. Just in case you don&apos;t know, chaat is one of the favourite Indian street food with all kinds of possible combination of veggies, crunchy Indian snacks, fruits, sauces, and yoghurt. The potential of combination seems endless. 

Mood Cafe is rather small for an eat in. They do have limited chairs and tables. I chose to do a take out (which most times seems more convenient). The service is really friendly and pretty efficient. I think they over made their mango lassi they gave me the extra portion in a small cup! If you are new to this area of West Philly you can choose to eat in, or take your food and drink over to Clark Park and have a picnic!"
5,"Really unique place with great Lassis! They have a whole board full of lassi flavors. Some were your standard flavors (mango, strawberry, etc) but they also had quite a few unique flavors. The servings are very big. Service and atmosphere was nice. Definitely recommend!"
