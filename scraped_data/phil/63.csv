5,"Best Halal in West Philly! 

They do great work ensuring they are taking every  Safety precaution and following cdc covid guidelines. As of now, they&apos;re only accepting phone orders. Debit cards only allowed for purchases greater than $30. As of two weeks ago they did increase their prices. For example, the falafel platter is now $13 whereas it was $12 previously. Not mad at all because they really are the best- and there&apos;s a lot of competition in the area. 
The food is fresh and big portions! As with what everyone else raves about, you have to try any of their sandwiches the Maroosh way. It&apos;s a cream tzatziki- like dressing with a garlic flavor."
5,"We travel from New York and literally order everything from the menu....this place continues to dish out really good food. You cannot go wrong....unfortunately due to Covid the dine is closed so it&apos;s order to go, otherwise it was always a pleasure to watch the lines and the service from the owner. Sometimes a lady taking orders at the counter can be a bit rude and less customer friendly....but it&apos;s about the food right?"
5,"Saad&apos;s started as a Halal lunch truck at 38th and Spruce and eventually turned into the thriving restaurant on 45th and Walnut. I have lived in University City for 25 years and I don&apos;t remember exactly when they opened, but I DO know that I&apos;ve been eating at Saad&apos;s for a very long time and I&apos;m not sure why I have never reviewed it. Well, here it is! Probably not necessary to say that this place is, &quot;the real deal&quot;. It serves a good purpose for the community and does so with efficiency, courtesy and very delicious food. Over the years I have had a variety of things on their menu and my three kids have their &quot;regular&quot; orders. One always orders the chicken wings and fries...the wings are fried just right, crispy, lots of flavor and not greasy and Saad&apos;s fries are some of my favorite. My oldest always orders the Greek salad. This is one of my favorite &quot;meal&quot; salads. It&apos;s packed with feta, grape leaves, sesame sticks, olives, creamy feta and pickles! So good! My middle child always orders the cheesesteak. Saad&apos;s rivals any in the city. And me? Chicken shish tawook the maroosh way. Oh my gosh. This sandwich is amazing. The garlic sauce alone is a reason to order it, but the fresh chunks of chicken, the pickles, tomatoes, parsley and the best hoagie roll...my mouth is watering just writing about it. In addition, Saad is doing an amazing job, keeping his staff safe and his customers safe during covid. He has installed a huge plastic divider with a small &quot;pick up&quot; door for no contact pick up. There is also a door for entering and a door for exiting that is enforced. Since the entrance into the &quot;yellow phase&quot; soon to be &quot;green&quot; there are bistro tables set up outside on the sidewalk. Saad&apos;s reputation for food and customer service stand for themselves and are pretty legendary in Philly, so really there is not a need for my &quot;glowing&quot; review. But I wanted to &quot;glow about it&quot; anyway. I appreciate Saad&apos;s and his steadfastness of good food and diligence for which he runs his restaurant. I&apos;m glad I am just a few blocks away."
5,"Delicious quality food. Clean. Quick service. 
Got cheesesteak from here. 

Will be back to try everything else."
4,"Good shawarma sandwiches. He gives them that additional press or toast to give it a nice crispiness. Extremely clean. I mean clean restaurant. The owner also doesn&apos;t allow you to order inside and have to call to comply with better covid guidelines. They do have a loooooooong wait. They are busy. The only kicker for me was the sauce was more of a mayo paste as opposed to the traditional tahini with the beef or garlic paste with chicken.
Owner is extremely friendly and apologetic when he found out we had issues calling in our order (line was disconnected)."
4,"We had to order using door dash for pick up. So I just grabbed and go. We ordered falafel sandwiches, Philly cheese steak sandwiches and fries. The sandwiches were good, especially the falafel. The serving sizes are large too. However I expected more cheese on the Philly like how other spots make it with cheese sauce. 

They could be better considering it&apos;s a staple in Philly and they&apos;re the only halal spot of its kind. You have to be very specific with the ordering otherwise they give you a plain sandwich. The owner was helpful and confirmed with me my order when I came in to ensure they&apos;re were no mistakes. 

Over all decent spot but I would not travel to Philly just for this. It was nice to try while there."
5,"My wife suggested I try here since her coworkers order from there about once a month and have nothing but rave reviews.

Boy were they right.  Their menu is interesting and you can get just about everything as a platter or a sandwhich.

We got the chicken falafel sandwhich, chicken shish tawook maroosh way, grape leaves, baba ghanouj, and chocolate baklava.

The chicken maroosh way is definately in the running for one of the best sandwhiches I&apos;ve ever had.  The chicken was seasoned nicely, and the toppings all went well together.  It was savory, creamy from the garlic sauce and tangy from the pickle. Its served on a long roll and pressed like a panini.  It should be law that the garlic sauce should be slathered onto every item on the menu.

The chicken falafel sandwhich was also delicious.  It might be my inexperience with this type of cuisine but I never thought of mixing chicken into the falafel. You get the delicious taste of the chicken with the texture of falafel. 

The grape leaves were a big hit for me.  They were seasoned incredible well.  You can tell who uses mass produced kinds because it is unbearably salty and tangy.  With these you could taste every ingredient and they were super fresh.

The baba ghanouj was also a nice side to have. Again seasoned well and tasted fresh.  Some other baba ghanouj I&apos;ve have were terribly bitter but theirs is well balanced.

I&apos;ve already talked my parents into ordering with us next week so I&apos;m looking forward to feasting on some of the items Saads has to offer"
5,"SAADS HALAL is one of the best restaurants. I originally went here for the halal Philly cheesesteak but I also tried the chicken Marouj. This sandwich is out of this world. It is a HUGE sub for $8-9, with high quality chicken, tomatoes, and a SPECIAL sauce. The sub is also nicely toasted with amazing bread. The owner and staff are extremely nice. 

Be aware that this place is closed during Ramadan."
4,"This is one of my favorite places to get cheesesteaks. It&apos;s not one of the more well-known or popular cheesesteak spots, but it&apos;s really good. The restaurant is pretty small-ish, but I&apos;ve usually been able to find seating on weekends/weekdays. 

Their sandwiches are great. My personal favorite is the Chicken Maroush, but their cheesesteaks are also delicious. The one annoying thing is that there is a $30 minimum for card payment (only debit, not credit) which is tough to get to unless you&apos;re ordering with a group together. There is an ATM in the store, but it&apos;s not convenient. The restaurant is also closed for the month of Ramadan, so just a heads up (this year it&apos;ll be end of April through end of May). I believe they are also closed on Sundays. 

Overall, I would highly recommend this place as a cheesesteak spot or just a Middle Eastern food place. Everything I&apos;ve had here is good, and I will continue to go back, especially for the Chicken Maroush."
1,I travelled 2 hours for their sandwiches which were basically a vomit of various sauces on a soggy bun. I&apos;m not zabiha-only and maybe this crap food is considered awesome by the zabiha crowd but there is much better / quality food out there. Shame on Saad&apos;s for pushing poorly prepared food on a zabiha crowd that simply doesn&apos;t know better.
5,"Their cheesesteak is the best cheesesteak I&apos;ve ever had, but in my opinion their chicken maroosh is even better. It&apos;s so good that it&apos;s worth driving an hour and a half just to eat it. If you are going with someone else, I would recommend one person ordering the cheesesteak, one the chicken maroosh, and splitting both. Definitely call ahead and order before going. It takes around 20 minutes to make an order."
3,"Was super excited to try their cheesesteaks as I heard that they were on of the best! However, it looked better than it tasted. I expected more cheese and juicer meat. I&apos;d say this meal with pretty average. I&apos;d order ahead of time because they are usually busy. The prices are reasonable."
5,"Great food, okay service. Sometimes you need to find for seating but it&apos;s all seems fine once you bite into their chicken maroush! Also heard their falafel was solid."
5,"One of the best falafel sandwiches out there, loaded with fries and hummus, it&apos;s hard to beat."
5,Omg this place is the best!!! I love their fries and chicken maroush!! The chicken is sooo flavorful and tasty!! I also had their lentil soup which is perfect and the spices make it the best!! I haven&apos;t had their platters yet or any other kinds of meats- but it&apos;s so good!! I highly recommend it!!!
5,Best cheesesteaks in Philadelphia hands-down I have been going here for the last two years
1,"Traveled from NY to try out the cheesesteaks only to find out they &quot;ran out&quot; of their cheesesteaks. I don&apos;t understand how you could possibly not pre-plan for a busy Saturday by ensuring you have enough of the MAIN reason why people come to you. 

We ended up trying the chicken maroosh, the kofta maroosh, and the chicken cheesesteak. The chicken cheesesteak was an absolute joke, it was BOILED shredded chicken in between bread! Absolutely no seasoning whatsoever, no sauces or anything. The chicken maroosh was your average chicken sandwich with white sauce, nothing to write home about. The same goes for the kofta maroosh which had extremely dry meat. I would not recommend traveling from out of state for this."
5,"Mando says, &quot;THIS is the &apos;Way&apos;&quot;.

Portions were huge and delicious and super reasonably priced. I ordered the Chicken Shish Tawook Maroosh Way and my wife had the Fish Wrap and fries. Everything was delivered via Uber Eats and surprisingly arrived to our place in Kensington hot and crispy. We covered everything in their garlic sauce. To die for!"
4,"Honestly pretty annoyed at myself for not discovering this hidden gem earlier actually! There are a lot of good things about this restaurant from their free samples of dessert to their extensive menu selection, but in all honesty the real kicker: the fries

Oh my goodness gracious.

They are so crisp and well seasoned you should definitely definitely try them if you ever make a stop by there! Their platters are enough to box up and take to work as lunch the next day! And their chicken cheesesteaks are pretty good, too. In my opinion I thought yelp hyped them up a bit, but still definitely a great experience. I&apos;ll be back!"
5,"This is hands down the BEST cheesesteak. I&apos;ve had my bites at a lot of different places and no cheesesteak beats Saad&apos;s. This is a hidden gem... well a lot of people know about it, but not for cheesesteaks. I cannot get enough of their cheesesteaks - the slightly toasted roll, the abundance of perfectly melted cheese, the way it all works together with the onions in perfection. This is a must try, you won&apos;t be disappointed. They will ask you if you want everything on it, which has ketchup, mayonnaise, salt, pepper, and onions. I&apos;m not a big fan of the ketchup on top.

The next item I always have is the chicken maroosh. Also a very delicious sandwich with the white garlic sauce and delicious chicken inside the toasted roll. The lamb maroosh is also pretty good, but I like the chicken better since the lamb had a softer texture. 

Their fries are delicious - perfectly crispy and fried, just the way I like them. I suggest eating them in person. If you take them out they may get soggy. 

I recently tried their baba ghanoush to try something different from my normal orders. Not bad for $4 for their small size, which is a decent portion. It was an average baba ghanoush. You can&apos;t taste the texture of the eggplant much, but the taste is delicious. The pita that it came with was disappointing because it was very thin and hard. Although this didn&apos;t fully stand out to me, the cheesesteak made up for it. 

Saad&apos;s is a calmer establishment than your typical restaurant for quick cheesesteaks or sandwiches. They put the effort into making sure everything is great. You can expect to wait about 15 minutes for your order. Usually they aren&apos;t THAT busy, but recently I was there on a Saturday afternoon and I had to wait about 35 minutes for my food. Don&apos;t worry, the wait is SO worth it. They are closed about a month each year for Ramadan and it was one of the most painful months of my life... which is why I got two cheesesteaks once they opened again! They also don&apos;t take credit card, so make sure you have cash or a debit card (over $30) available."
