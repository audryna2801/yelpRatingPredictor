5,"Came in to try the matcha crepe cake. WORTH IT! They didn&apos;t skimp on the matcha, it&apos;s no too sweet, just layers of creamy tea bliss. Would definitely come back again. Just had the cake as takeout, and felt comfortable ordering in store- lots of plexiglass and sanitizer everywhere. I&apos;d like to try the mango mousse next!"
5,"I have been ordering by using Uber Eats to take advantage of free delivery from sharing it with nearby orders. This time besides the bear dessert, I tried Matcha Chocolate Terrine. When I slice it, the sweet matcha filling flowed out from the center just like a lava cake. It&apos;s so good, there&apos;s no bitter taste of matcha, instead I find I quiet sweet that makes you want more. Highly recommended."
5,"If there is a 10 stars rating, I would give that! 5 stars aren&apos;t enough. Let me tell you why this is the best of the best bakery!
This is an extraordinary bakery that specializes in beautiful and very tasty cakes that are not common in other bakeries. One look and one bite, you are sold! The owner Wei Ling Chen @La Mousse is an amazing woman who went out of her way to provide the product and service. Let me tell you about her extraordinary service. She truly an extraordinary person who went beyond her call of duty since she has to stay behind the counter to conduct the business. She was supposed to deliver the birthday cake for my 90 years old father and the Uber driver was supposed to come to pick up the cake at 12:30 pm but the uber driver didn&apos;t show up. So Wei Ling Chen took the time off to drive up to my parents&apos; apartment and went up and she texted me to let me know she is at their door.    I was floored! I told my parents during the zoom party in progress that there is someone at the door. She gave the cake to my parents and then lean over to see me on zoom while she was wearing a mask of course. I took a picture of them!  She truly blew me away with her customer service.  The cake? It&apos;s a double chocolate mousse and my parents told me it&apos;s so good and that would outdo most bakeries. 
She has two locations at
1622 South St, Phila PA 19146
920 Montgomery Ave Narberth PA 19072."
5,"A great bakery if you&apos;re looking for a sweet treat. 
1) Matcha Crepe Cake: super sweet and rich. The crepes were light and sweet. The matcha icing/cream was light, but had the bold matcha flavor at the end. Definitely worth a try if you&apos;re a matcha lover!
2) Matcha cheesecake: super rich and dense, but not in a bad way! The cake actually made it feel more like a cake than a cheesecake, but it was definitely better this way. This dessert wasn&apos;t too sweet and wasn&apos;t too overpowering with the matcha like it did in the crepe. Definitely another staple item to try!
3) matcha peach latte: I got this iced and wow, so good! It tasted more like a tea than a coffee type of drink when you think of a latte. I barely tasted the matcha in it, but this wasn&apos;t a bad thing! The egg cream was super sweet, yet salty giving the drink such a great after taste.
4) mango lychee tea: very refreshing! A must try as well"
4,"A La Mousse is a beautiful little shop with incredibly delicate looking desserts that are more pleasing to the eye than the palate. I came here to buy my wife a set of delicious mini-cakes as part of her birthday surprise. I will admit that I was immediately blown away from the artistry, especially with a heavy dose of Asian-infusion. See the lantern-inspired cake. I tried a series of cakes, and while they all tasted...fine, all the flavors just blended together, but none felt unique. We tried the tangerine, the hazelnut cheesecake, sweetheart, mango mousse. Of them all, what caught my attention was the harvest (the one that looks like a potted plant) and I am, to this date, regretful of that decision, just because it looked so cute!

Anyway, I definitely got the wow-factor in getting these cakes, but with a bill of $50, I don&apos;t know if this is a sustainable shop to return to for any occasion."
3,"A La Mousse is a very cute dessert and tea cafe in Chinatown. 

You have the option of eating in or take-out but they&apos;re known to charge two different prices for the same food based on eat in or take out. This is the first I&apos;ve seen a restaurant do this and they do not warn you ahead of time.

They try to use fresh and natural ingredients and you can really tase it. The food all looks beautiful and makes a great dessert to bring over to a friend&apos;s house. They make quite the impression. 

The service here is very slow. We waited for a really long time for 2 teas. And when I finally got mine, I had the wrong drink (I ordered a peach mango tea and had something that only tasted like jasmine and honey). Since my order was to go and I was already in my car when I tried it, I don&apos;t know if they would have done anything to rectify the issue.  

They do require masks and have outdoor and indoor seating options during COVID."
3,"Nice and clean interior. The cakes were fine. Asian inspired French desserts and cakes. They were heavily focused on matcha and chocolate. I wish there was more pronounced matcha or chocolate flavor, but everything seemed a bit muted"
4,"I&apos;ve been here a few times since their opening. Yes, their prices are a bit high but they are beautifully crafted edible pieces of art! Most of the treats taste as good as they look. The only dessert I am not a fan of is their mango mousse - the outer shell tastes like plastic."
5,"Some of the cakes are a bit expensive but they are soo good!! I love these types of bakeries that have a homey atmosphere. It&apos;s a great place to grab a table and relax with your friends. 

I usually get the match mousse cake with ice cream. It&apos;s super soft and practically melts in your mouth. Their ice cream flavors are also very good and pairs well with their cakes. The match cheesecake is also delicious and none of the flavors are too overpowering. Honestly, any of their matcha stuff is really good."
5,"The birthday cake I got was very beautiful. You can find the designs you want on the Facebook page and Instagram. The lady who helped me was helpful. We used iMessage to contact and she helped me with some recommendations for the cake. The sponge was soft, matcha cream tasted nice, not too sweet. It&apos;s a pricey but worth it"
4,"COVID Time Review: I stopped by A La Mousse for dessert this past Saturday around 7pm and parked in the lot a few stores down from the dessert place as most parking was taken nearby (10$ for an hour). We were able to walk into the store and look at the menu, and there was both indoor seating as well as outdoor with several tables set up outside (with really cute fairy lights and surrounded plastic covering). There&apos;s also a clean bathroom inside if you need to use it as a customer. We chose to sit outside and scanned the QR code to look at the menu. Service was very prompt and friendly, and we were checked up on several times to place our order as well as see if we needed anything else. 

My boyfriend and I ordered the matcha cheesecake, buttercream oreo milkshake, and matcha peach latte. My friend ordered the vanilla crepe cake and a mango milkshake. I personally really enjoyed both milkshakes, and thought the matcha peach latte was just decent, but nice for fall weather. There was a hint of peach taste and a stronger matcha taste which felt unique and unfamiliar to me. My friend thought that the vanilla crepe cake was too sweet with too much cream, but we thought the matcha cheesecake was pretty good (not amazing) and the ice cream was a nice complement. 

Overall, the experience was very nice but the food was a bit overpriced for its quality and taste. (For perspective, one slice of the crepe cake is $12 while the famous delicious Lady M crepe cake is $8.95 a piece.) This is my second time here, so I have tried other delicious things like the brown bear small mousse cake and the lava cake which were both good! This place is worth stopping by to try once or twice, but I don&apos;t see myself coming here regularly due to price vs quality I could get elsewhere."
5,"Amazing birthday cake. Best I&apos;ve had for a while. If you&apos;re not a fan of heavy cream or super sweet frosting cake, this mousse cake is the way to go! We came in last minute for a cake, and luckily they were able to make this full cake in just 30 minutes. The result was lovely. It has a simple esthetic appearance; the berries were glazed and fresh, and the cream was light. After a filling dinner, I totally still had room for a slice this dessert (2 or 3 if I don&apos;t control myself). Would definitely go back for more."
4,"Solid dessert spot in Chinatown. The room itself is a bit small but the atmosphere is very cute! We ordered the matcha and hazelnut mousse cakes. While they were delicious, I think they were both (particularly the hazelnut) a bit too rich for my liking. The first bite is delicious but it feels super heavy/sweet after a few mouthfuls in. Ice cream is solid. 

Overall had a good time here, but I don&apos;t know if I can handle the sugar level. Maybe for fun every once in a while."
4,"Pretty decent Asian dessert spot in Philadelphia. Haven&apos;t found anything like it in Philly. A lot of their desserts are similar to Spot dessert bar in nyc. I recommend the chocolate ball, pretty interesting presentation."
1,"Tl;dr at bottom. 

There was hair in a cake I purchased for a friend&apos;s birthday. I took a video of it and called them back a week later since I was out of town. Didn&apos;t think much of it.  

I called a la mousse and told them about hair being INSIDE the cake (I literally had to pull the hair out of the slice, &amp; also have a video of me pulling it out). The employee begins interrogating me as to why I didn&apos;t call earlier and I explain to her that I had to deliver the cake for a birthday and was out for a few days before I got back home. She continues to reiterate herself multiple times that I didn&apos;t call back earlier, how I should&apos;ve called earlier, why didn&apos;t I call back earlier since she has to now call her manager and find receipts because I didn&apos;t call sooner.  At this point she was getting a bit snappy and I felt like she&apos;s blaming me for a problem they caused and I explained to her that although I probably should&apos;ve called earlier, they should also not bake a cake with hair in it and I wouldn&apos;t need to call at all. She finally moves on with the conversation and says that she has to contact her manager so I asked if I could just speak with the manager because it didn&apos;t seem like it was going anywhere with her especially since I have a video. I send her the video and then she hangs up.  

I get a call back and she asks if I wanted a 25$ gift card or another cake. I asked if she can give me a gift card (not a refund, a gift card because I do like this place) but for the amount I paid for the cake, which was around 50$, and also because I have no use for a cake right now since I usually only purchase it for birthdays. She asks if I finished the cake and I told her that I did not finish the whole cake and she said that I&apos;m lying and that in the first phone call, I said I ate the whole cake? I told her that I never stated that at all because she was stuck on asking why I didn&apos;t call sooner for 15 minutes and thinking about it now I&apos;m not even sure why it even mattered.. She continues to say that I said I finished the cake and I told her that this is getting ridiculous and if I can just speak with her manager directly instead of calling each other liars and playing whisper down the lane with her and her manager.   

She hangs up and calls me back 10m later and says her manager is busy and asks if I wanted to wait for a follow up with her manager. I said sure and gave her my contact. I ask the employee on the phone for her name and she snaps at me and asks me why I needed her name. I said in case I don&apos;t get a call back, at least I&apos;ll have a point of contact and might not have to re-explain everything. She continues to not want to give her name and I asked why is getting a name such an issue. She was very adamant on not spelling her name. She puts me on hold for like 5m and ended up giving me her name. I told her that I feel a bit weird that it was that difficult to get her name when they know my name and contact.   

I love a la mousse but I definitely did not expect this much retaliation, effort, confusion, and interrogation for something I thought would be resolved within 5 minutes, especially when I sent them a video of it, not even an apology. Kind of ashamed but I obviously don&apos;t know what&apos;s going on in the back ground.   

If there&apos;s hair in your cake, and you call them days later about it, I guess make sure you have a concrete alibi and expect to talk to a part-time FBI agent. I still like this place and I&apos;m sure this is a rare occurrence. I hope to hear back from the manager but very disappointed in how they handled a simple issue. 

Tldr: hair in cake. Got interrogated. She calls me a liar. I literally just wanted a gift card for the amt I paid."
4,"For yummy matcha flavored desserts, this is the place to go! I love their matcha mille feuille cake, made with layers of thin crepes sandwiches between perfectly light and sweet matcha cream. I also love any of their mousse cakes, which I think are not too sweet. There are also a number of exciting options, like a &quot;tea-ra-misu,&quot; but I honestly prefer their more normal options. 
The last few times I have come here, service has been a bit slow. I also wish they would change up their menu more! Otherwise, an overall great place to visit."
5,"I&apos;m a huge matcha fan so I had to stop here during a brief trip to Philly. We ordered the green tea-rimisu to share and it was heavenly. The dessert was so light, it wasn&apos;t overly sweet or heavy. Even the scoop of ice cream that accompanies the layered dessert was a perfect complement. 

Service was quick and the employee was very helpful in suggesting which desserts to try. I highly recommend trying A La Mousse!"
4,"Parking is not the easiest to find for this location. But they have a large menu and lots to select from. Everything looks so cute to even eat, but I would love to come back here to try everything. I love it here because you can&apos;t find what they sell anywhere else. The indoor seating is cute/modern as well. I tried a Mango smoothie and cherry blossom matcha iced tea and both were very tasty. This is a place you have to try at least once."
5,"Great dessert spot in China town. Cozy, with the cutest desserts. Typical of many Asian dessert cafes the desserts aren&apos;t overly sweet so keep that in mind. I tried 3 things, the Strawberry cream cheese cake, Hazelnut chocolate cake, and Double chocolate cake. All 3 were moist, great filling and icing, and a nice size. I will return and at least I don&apos;t feel as guilty when I eat here.

Overall:
Hazelnut Chocolate 5/5
Double Chocolate 5/5
Strawberry Cream Cheese Cake 4/5"
5,I came here for some birthday treats and a la mousse did not disappoint. Amazing creations! I can&apos;t wait to try more
