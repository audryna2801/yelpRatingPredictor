5,The best banana pudding I&apos;ve ever had!!!! Definitely worth the drive through Philly to try!
5,Im craving a strawberry &amp; sweet potato cupcake as I type. Can&apos;t wait for you all to reopen : )
5,Got a customized cake for a friend&apos;s birthday and it looked even better in person than the picture I provided. Thanks for the great work!
4,My coworker got cupcakes from here for a work event and they were so so moist and frosting was really good! i looked up the place and saw they are known for their banana puddings. I decided to give them a try and got the strawberry and banana and the salted caramel one. Both taste so good and perfect balance of sweetness and fruits. I cannot wait to get these delights again!!
4,The salted caramel banana pudding was very tasty and I will definitely be back to try their other flavors.  The staff was also very friendly.
5,"Was looking up local bakeries for a cake/cupcakes for my girlfriends birthday and this place drew my attention because they had puddings which I appreciate. Although I didn&apos;t end up getting any puddings I did get a 6 pack of cupcakes and a peach cobbler. Cashier was very friendly and personable and they had everything that I was looking for. What I appreciated most is the variety of cupcake flavors without getting too crazy. All the classic cake flavors with a few more non conventional ones. My favorite were the sweet potato cupcakes with the cream cheese frosting. The cupcakes were exxxxtra moist and topped with the light whipped frosting, not too heavy. I bough the cupcakes Friday and even on Wednesday of the next week the last cupcake still had moisture and was just as delicious as the day I bought them"
5,"I wish I didn&apos;t love this place as much as I do, my waist line with thank me, I&apos;ve now limited my husband to stopping only on weekends. 
They would be on my A/list for being one of the few places I know where I can get white cupcakes with chocolate frosting. Most other bakeries do white frosting/white cake or chocolate frosting:chocolate cake. I like my cupcakes like my family; mixed. 

But even better than that, the sister makes a hell of a pudding. My husband&apos;s partial to the peanut butter while this girl with Southern roots, loves banana pudding, although today I&apos;m branching out and trying the peach. They are located right off 8th  and South  so if you want a fabulous homemade dessert but don&apos;t want to deal with the crazy pedestrian traffic that tends to overwhelm the street on a nice day, especially on the weekends, you can easily pop in before dashing down eighth Street away from the sturm und drang . 

Go for the cupcakes, stay for the pudding"
4,"The salted caramel banana pudding is absolutely positively divine! It&apos;s really authentic to what I&apos;m used to eating at home or at family gatherings.

I love that all the ingredients in their products are real and not imitation. My banana pudding was filled with lots of love! It was filled with bananas, cookies, whipped cream and overall salted caramel goodness. I also purchased the peach cobbler which was okay, nothing to rave about but their banana pudding is definitely the star of the show.

The sweet life bakeshop offers different varieties of their banana pudding such as strawberry banana, peach cobbler and snickers. The owner Maggie was really nice and personable, she thoroughly explained all her products and kindly answered all the questions that I had as well as provided background info on how she started her business.

Overall I look forward to returning especially since I was sad to see my banana pudding come to and end - sad face emoji!"
2,Cupcakes were too dense and cold. The staff seemed uninterested that we were there and they had a very limited selection. We stopped by on Saturday and there were only 5 types of cupcakes available. Very disappointed that we drove all the way there to barely finish our cupcakes. Never again.
5,"I love this place! I have been here at least 4 or 5 times and it will singlehandedly increase my waistline. The banana pudding is so good, I have had the original, strawberry banana, and chocolate chip versions and all were perfectly sweet, creamy, and filling. I have also had a handful of cupcakes, red velvet, chocolate chocolate, strawberry, cookies and cream and they are all delicious. Do yourself a favor and let&apos;s be fat together, so visit this place ASAP. The workers are also sooo nice and patient."
4,"It&apos;s hard to type because i&apos;m in a sugar coma right now. I got the large banana pudding with no bananas. Let me just say how GRATEFUL I am that they have a banana pudding with no bananas. I despise brown soggy bananas in my pudding. As a banana pudding lover, it has been a big obstacle in my life. The pudding was creamy and loaded with nilla wafers. It was on the verge of being overly sweet though - i think if they cut back on the sugar a little itd be a total winner. Still very good and I&apos;d get again! 

I also got a vanilla cupcake. The cake was moist and flavorful but the frosting wasn&apos;t my favorite. It was more whipped than a thick buttercream, and me likes thick. That&apos;s just personal preference!"
5,"10 out of 5
Stumbled into the shop walking down South Street.
The aroma that greeted me at the door... I just KNEW at that very moment everything was going to be bomb.
The CUPCAKES are to die for. The crumb of the cake is perfect and moist. Generous with the frosting, all of which were delicious. We tried the strawberry, banana cream, sweet potato, salted caramel, red velvet, and funfetti. All were delicious. Would recommend the first five as they were exceptional."
5,"Get the BANANA PUDDING!  It&apos;s the best I&apos;ve ever had and I&apos;m not even a fan of banana or pudding.   
I happen to come here with some friends while just walking down South St and randomly checking out different places.  We got the magic pudding, banana pudding, and a tray of the cupcake variety pack.  The cupcakes are dry, so I don&apos;t recommend this. The magic pudding has some chocolate, some peanut butter, it was good, but then I tasted the banana pudding and this was amazingly good!  The banana pudding is light, creamy, not too much banana or vanilla taste, not too sweet but just sweet enough, my only regret is not getting more of it."
5,"BEST BANANA PUDDING! Hands down! Truthfully, I wasn&apos;t completely sold when my friend said that this place had amazing banana pudding. After a great lunch, my friend had recommended this place for dessert. It&apos;s seriously a hidden gem!! I got the banana strawberry pudding and it was absolutely everything that I wanted in banana pudding. The texture was soft but not too thick. The inside was filled with pieces of bananas and strawberries. I loved how it wasn&apos;t overwhelming sweet and everything just mixed so well. You must try the different kinds as they were amazing! I will definitely be returning every time that I am in the area. They also had cupcakes and pies which also looked delicious! There is limited seating but a great spot for delicious desserts."
5,"I spent my pre- Birthday weekend in Philadelphia.  Because it&apos;s my birthday, I have been indulging in sweets. I googled bakeries in the Philadelphia area and came across this one.  I was already in the area so that was perfect- and how could you go wrong with 5 stars? 

Parking can be a challenge and I had my dogs with me so I had to be swift with my choices. I selected the PB banana pudding, the strawberry banana pudding a PB and jelly cupcake and a celebration cupcake.  I had the strawberry banana pudding yesterday and IT WAS AMAZING!  Creamy, rich and decadent! It was perfection! Today I had the PB banana pudding. Again, amazing!  I&apos;m surrounded by bakeries in the NYC area but traveling to Philly for this banana pudding is worth it! I don&apos;t see myself going to the Philadelphia area and not stopping by this bakery. I haven&apos;t tried a cupcake but I feel they&apos;ll also be delicious. They look good!

As I mentioned, I had my dogs in the car and it was a hot humid August afternoon.  The gentleman working in the shop provided me with a bowl of water to give to my pups! They and I appreciated it!"
3,"Hello Philly!

I am a huge red velvet cupcake fan so I couldn&apos;t wait to try Sweet Life Bakeshop&apos;s version.

The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating. 

The cupcake was delicious.  The cake portion was moist and the frosting wasn&apos;t too sweet.  On a whole I would say that it satisfied my craving.  

If I&apos;m ever back in this area I will try the banana pudding, I have heard that it is delicious. 

I will note that my Uber driver told me to hold on to my purse when I got out of the car.  I&apos;m not from Philadelphia so I can&apos;t comment about the area on a whole, but I didn&apos;t have any problems when I was there."
5,"So , I moseyed on in for a sweet bite not really knowing what to expect. I make banana pudding myself so I was super hesitant to try. Well HONEY, this banana pudding is it! I tried the banana pudding with strawberry and I didn&apos;t want the little dessert to finish. I&apos;ll be back for sure."
5,"Banana pudding is their specialty. Get the banana pudding! I didn&apos;t even know I liked banana pudding, but Wow. Being first timers, we went with the original banana. There are maybe a dozen other choices that Sabrina, the super friendly and helpful sales rep, described in mouth-watering detail. The pudding was so creamy, dense, flavorful and full of bananas and vanilla wafers. The consistency reminded me of cream cheese cake or mousse."
5,This place is fire just make sure you put your order in at least two weeks early place is popping
5,"I have basically made it my life&apos;s business to try cupcakes in every major city I visit, and well, this one takes the cake. 

Nothing beats this place and the sweet gals who run it. They are kind, hard-working and they make the best damn dessert you have ever had. Holy cow. 

I would pay to have these shipped across the country rather than have a mediocre dessert somewhere else. Eat the pudding. Eat the cupcakes. Your life will never be the same. Thanks Sweet Life!"
