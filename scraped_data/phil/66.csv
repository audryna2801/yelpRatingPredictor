5,"Giorgio is our go to restaurant. It&apos;s both a fantastic neighborhood Italian restaurant and an incredibly Gluten Free friendly establishment. Generally, everything we get at Giorgio has been good. The veal, the pork chop, the steak, even the GF pizza! I can&apos;t speak highly enough of Giorgio On Pine. Every once in a while, they even give us a little desert in the house. 

My only warning is that the place gets very busy (pre-covid) and very loud. When that happens, the environment is high energy and the staff moves very fast to keep things going. It&apos;s not a quaint, relaxing meal. But that should be expected at one of the best restaurants in town."
5,"Holy my gosh!!! Truly was the best meal I&apos;ve had this year - ah! that&apos;s not saying a whole lot cause ya know, 2020, soo fine, the last 2 years! 

My husband and I walked 20 min in the rain today to eat a Sunday lunch there. However, when we arrived, we were told they didn&apos;t open until 4pm.. so note that their hours may be different than listed right now with the pandemic! However...I was persistent in going there so we asked for a 4pm reservation the same day. Thankfully it wasn&apos;t raining the second time we walked back! 

To start, they set you up with some sliced bread, garlic infused olive oil, and parm  

We ordered the lobster ravioli (not on the menu, was a special, and was $25) and the spaghetti a la vodka. The lobster ravioli had huge chunks of lobster! And dang, the sauce is to die for. My taste buds were jumping and dancing! 

The spaghetti a la vodka was great too, it was my husband&apos;s dish but I stole some forkfuls :)"
5,"If you&apos;re in Philly you need to stop here for the food and to experience an old Italian style meal. Hearty, good prices, and good outdoor heaters during the cold. Get out and live life! 

10/10 the first time we went on a Friday night. This is a BYOB place so stop at the liquor store and grab a couple bottles of your favorite wine or whiskey. They will bring you a bucket of ice for the whites and a glass of ice for your bourbon. You can drink 2 bottles of wine for the price that you&apos;d pay for 2 glasses at other places nearby. Always bring an extra bottle because you&apos;re going to love this little joint. 

You&apos;ve got to try the clams and mussels. Take off one side of the and turn the other into a little cup with the meat inside to dip in the cream sauce in the bowl. Then grab one of the FRESH rolls. Same thing - dunk that bad boy right in that wonderful sauce. The lobster ravioli and sweet potato gnocchi are amazing, which they are known for. I should have grabbed a pic of the clams - NEXT TIME. Oh by the way, the old man Giorgio hangs around outside (with a mask) and he is great company. Very friendly and he&apos;ll randomly hand out free deserts to people. The cannoli and the tiramisu are great with a cup of coffee or red (I love Pinot Noir - watch a YouTube video or two in basic wine tasting. You&apos;re life will change). You&apos;ll sleep and dream of the food at Giorgios for weeks to follow."
4,"The cutest hole in the wall Italian restaurant. Owner is a sweet older Italian man who clearly puts his heart and soul into the restaurant. I definitely recommend! 

Pros - 
Food is outstanding. 
Casual and cozy atmosphere. 
Reasonable prices and fairly large portions. 
Menu has great variety of pasta dishes and meat entres. 
It&apos;s BYOB with no corkage feee.
Tiramisu is AMAZING. 

Cons - 
Limited seating (small space)... definitely make a reservation.
Very busy and possibly understaffed... service is on slower side"
5,"Always love coming here when in Philly! Giorgio the owner is so sweet, he checks on all the customers to make sure everyone is enjoying their food, it gives a personal touch to the experience. I got their signature sweet potatoe gnocci again, and just like the first experience, I closed my eyes and enjoyed every bite (they are LIFERALLY like pillows, so soft and yummy). Please check this restaurant out if you haven&apos;t and live in the Philadelphia area!"
5,"Delicious lobster ravioli save appetizer!! Roasted garlic infused olive oil is amazing!!! Small, quiet atmosphere! Phenomenal service. Food came out quick, but was still fine dining quality! Definitely recommend"
4,"This is a family owned Italian restaurant in the heart of where all the restaurants are. The portions are huge, so be prepared to walk out really full with a whole meal&apos;s worth of leftovers. 
I got the bucatini with pancetta and the special for the night: lobster ravioli in a vodka sauce. The bucatini was good, but it was just nothing special or memorable. The lobster ravioli, however, was absolutely delicious. It came with chunks of lobster with tomatoes and asparagus. 
The tiramisu for dessert was delicious. Probably one of the best tiramisus I&apos;ve ever had. 
Overall, I&apos;m happy with my experience here. The food came out slow, but understandable because I came in a large party."
5,"Amazing food, limited waiters and waitresses. But excellent authentic Italian cuisine! Definitely recommend and I would go back for sure!! You have to try their special Lobster Ravioli it&apos;s not on the menu"
4,"Nice Italian restaurant in the heart of Philly. There are a lot of good options to choose from, depending on your preference. The pasta dishes are pretty filling. You will probably have leftovers. I had the lobster ravioli special and bucatini pasta. I wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the bucatini but the lobster ravioli was pretty good."
4,"It&apos;s been a while since I&apos;ve been here, and I don&apos;t remember much when I was in college with this being a byo and all. But this was a great meal with a lovely waitress lots of wine and great food. 

Seating is tight be we managed well. We called earlier to get a reservation, but on a Monday night it wasn&apos;t super crowded. 

First comes the bread. Crusty yet soft with amazing garlic infused oil, yes we ate all of it. 

For the appetizers, we got the sautéed calamari and the grill sweet sausage. Both were really good but I definitely loved the calamari the best. With a squeeze of lemon the calamari was super fresh and complex.

Entrees were the ribeye, linguine with clams, and the fish special bronzino. We got the ribeye cooked rare and wow, I think I&apos;m a rare convert. Best steak I&apos;ve had in a long while. It also comes with a side of sauce and together they were amazing. The linguine with clams was good, cooked in a white wine sauce with plenty of clams. The bronzino was also pretty good.

Had to order dessert so we agreed on the tiramisu and the creme brûlée. Both were amazing but tiramisu took the cake. Super strong coffee flavors, super rich and melded together. 

Next time you need a byo come here."
5,"I&apos;ve been looking forward to trying Giorgio on Pine for quite some time and am really glad we finally did. We came in with a reservation on a Sunday night, and the place was packed. We were seated immediately, put our BYO wine on the table, and it was opened before I could even get my coat off! My kind of spot. Our server came over quickly and rattled off all the specials from memory, and each one sounded better than the next.

Now for why you came here! The food. The table bread was really tasty - I love how the bread was in knots without seasoning, and you get to dip and spread however much garlic and garlic oil you want.

For appetizers, we went with the burrata and grilled caesar salad. The burrata was a good portion, and the tomatoes, roasted red peppers, arugula, and balsamic glaze were the perfect accompaniments. The grilled caesar was an elevated version of a traditional caesar and was really yummy, too!

For entrees, I ordered the seafood pasta which usually comes gluten free, but I subbed in regular pasta without an issue. The pasta was cooked perfectly, and the amount of seafood was generous. My boyfriend ordered the chicken parm which came with veggies and potatoes. Both were good portions and tasty.

For dessert, we went with a cannolo, a slice of cheesecake, and two decaf cappuccinos. The cannolo cream was so good, and the cheesecake was really creamy. The cappuccinos were also tasty and had the perfect amount of foamed milk.

The atmosphere, service, food, and price points were fantastic. We spent less than $100 for an incredible meal and left feeling beyond satisfied. I told my boyfriend Giorgio&apos;s needs to be added to our regular rotation and he agreed. I&apos;m excited to come back soon!!"
5,"Giorgio&apos;s was a great BYOB before the Rona with amazing staff and delicious food and with outdoor dining, they have stepped up and accommodated very well. Nothing major to talk about. You walk up, reserve, and enjoy some of the best Italian in Center City"
5,Great little Italian restaurant. I would call ahead for reservations because they get very busy. The owner is so old school. He writes down your reservation on a piece of paper and I love that! I love all of their pastas. They always have the pork chop as a special and I order it every single time. Their mussels appetizer is delicious as well! My favorite Italian restaurant in philly.
5,"Our not so easy to please group of 12 arrived for an early dinner and from the moment we stepped in, we felt well taken care of.  We were seated in the separate little dining area up a few steps, so no worries about the cold coming in through the door.

We have a few picky eaters, a few paisanos (you know, the gravy vs. sauce people), even a few gluten free diners, and they accommodated everyone. The timing of service was impeccable - appetizers came out en masse, the main dishes served in two waves.

After rustic bread with garlic infused olive oil was set down, I loved tasting the different appetizers - the calamari is not fried; it&apos;s sauteed with shrimp and beans. The leftover sauce was delicious sopped up with the bread. Loved the sweet sausage with polenta, the grilled cesar salad, and finally the traditional caprese salad.

For my main, I chose the rib-eye. So yummy and the size was incredibly generous. The roasted potatoes was done perfectly.

For desserts, I saw cheesecake, canolis and creme brulee flying up and down our table. No crumbs left behind.

Thanks to our boss man for a generous Christmas treat and to the staff at Giorgio&apos;s for a memorable evening."
5,"Spectacular group dining experience!

My GF was celebrating a milestone birthday, and some of her oldest friends hatched a plan to make it a surprise. Ideally we wanted a BYOB that would also permit them to bring in their own cake (for a reasonable cutting charge).

When I initially called GoP, I was informed they were fully booked for the selected Friday evening. It&apos;s not a huge establishment, so seating (particularly for a party of 8) was unavailable. *However* they indicated should there be a cancellation, I would be on their callback sheet. Low and behold, I was greeted with a voice message 24 hours later indicating they were happy to accommodate us.

As far as the surprise itself, it pretty much went off without a hitch. Giorgio himself escorted my GF to the table on the higher level. She was recoiling in shock and laughter - let the party begin!

Our server had the specials committed to memory (and it wasn&apos;t a short list). She clearly knows her Italian cuisine. After she had a chance to catch her breath, our table ordered several appetizers to share (burrata, calamari, prosciutto), and then our individual entrees. I went for the traditional gnocchi w/ ragu sauce, my GF the lobster ravioli. My buddy across the table ordered the specialty sweet potato gnocchi in a white cream sauce. I was able to sample their dishes as well, and I cannot over-state just how appetizing the plates were. Pretty generous portions too.

The tab came out to less than $70 a couple - crazy the value you receive! And the top notch hospitality sweetened our experience on a special night. The sentiment around the table is we will be back to dine soon!"
5,"I looked this place up on yelp and was not disappointed! I walked over a mile from my hotel just to try this place! I was the only one there at the time &amp; I think the owner came out and seated me and sprayed/wiped off my table and chair! 

My waiter was Giovany and he was absolutely fantastic! I had the mussels appetizer, the prosciutto and pasta in a spicy sauce, and the tiramisu!! 10 out of 10 overall! I wish I would&apos;ve known that it was BYOB, because I would&apos;ve stayed longer!! Bravo and cheers!"
4,"First thing is, this place is usually busy - so make reservations if you can! I believe they only take reservations during certain times. 

The pasta is amazing - I love vodka sauce and this place has an amazing vodka sauce dish, Spaghetti Vodka. Another thing I like about this is place is that its BYOB. I also got the sweet potato gnocchi and realized gnocchi is probably something that I don&apos;t really like. However, I do have to say it did not really taste like sweet potato - just mostly like a gooey chewy pasta texture. The sauce was amazing though. 

Service is amazing here - the wait staff is so nice and so are the managers on the floor!"
5,"I love it here! I always have such an amazing experience at this cutie little spot. The wait staff is amazing and the owners and managers are on the floor as well continuously checking up on us. Your water glass will never be empty. Service is exceptional. 

The place is small so I definitely recommend a reservation especially on the weekends when it gets busy. 

The food is so good! Everything is very fresh from their pasta to their bread to their cannoli filling. Everything I&apos;ve ever had has always been delicious. Portions are huge and prices are affordable. 

It is BYOB which is great and there is no uncorking fee. The last time we came, the wait staff encouraged us to stay and finish our wine even after we were done eating. We never feel rushed out which I appreciate. I highly highly recommend and cannot wait to come back!"
5,"Fabulous food and service!!!! I made my reservation last minute so we went in at 4pm for dinner. The older man at the entrance is very sweet and lovely to talk to. Our waitress was very attentive and friendly. She delivered complementary bread and oil with garlic in it shortly after we arrived. 

My friends and I shared the sweet potato gnocchi, rigatoni with sausage, and linguini with clams. All items were delicious. The rigatoni did not come in a creamy sauce because my friend ordered the wine sauce, however it was still delicious. The portions are huge. Get ready to take some home. 

At the end of the dinner we were seriously considered dessert but eventually decided not to get anything. However, the waitress gave us a free piece of chocolate cake!!! How awesome! Loved this place and will definitely be going back again."
5,"Have walked by Giorgio millions of times and finally had the chance to go for Valentine&apos;s Day. Made the mistake a couple years ago and tried to show up without a reservation and was basically told not to let the door hit you on the way out (fair enough). 

Our dinning experience was top notch. We were seated promptly at the time of our reservation and our bottle of wine was opened seconds later. 

Our waitress was extremely helpful guiding through the menu and offering her own personal recommendations (lobster ravioli). We started with the burrata and grilled Caesar salad, which were both excellent. The burrata was my favorite of the two. 

I elected to go with the pork chop, which I had heard was a staple at Giorgio, and I was certainly not disappointment. Served over a mushroom ragu, every bite was as good as the last. My beautiful date decided to go with a seafood pasta surrounded with shrimp, mussels, and clams. All delicious. 

Had to save room for dessert! Tiramisu and chocolate cake were exactly what we needed."
