5,"A Philly restaurant that reminds you of eating in Paris...

Yes, Bistro La Minette is it. Chef Peter provided me Paris Restaurant recommendations years ago. When I returned home from Paris, I realized that Paris cuisine and culture was right in my backyard.

Every dish is cooked to perfection. The bread and butter to start kicks off a fantastic evening. The butter is ROOM TEMP - that is the only way restaurants should serve butter with bread. A little sprinkle of salt and spread over a fresh piece of bread. *Poof* you just time traveled to Paris by food. Never had a disappointing dish and would order every item if I had 6 stomachs to fit it all - including dessert! I look forward to returning to Bistro once Covid-19 is over, and I hope to see you there!"
5,"We have been missing dinners from Bistrot la Minette, so when we saw that they were now offering takeout, we were delighted. We weren&apos;t disappointed. They&apos;re offering 3-course dinners for $35, including the amuse bouche gougére, their excellent baguette and butter, and the chocolate truffles they always placed on the table with the check. 

We chose warm potato and leek soup, Boeuf Bourguignon, Poulet a la Catalan, Chocolate torte, and créme caramel. Everything was prepared to their usual high standards. Portions were generous, enough for my husband and I to each enjoy a second dinner the next evening. I&apos;m editing to say that for some reason Yelp didn&apos;t include all of our photos. Sorry. 

They are also offering a la carte appetizers, salads, and sides. 

It is a bargain at this price, for this quality. We will be ordering again."
5,"We just finished finished our first pandemic take away meal from Bistrot la Minette.  Other than providing our own ambience and adult beverage the meal was, as the French say, parfait.
The entire experience was recreated.  Amuse Bouche, the most authentic baguette and butter in Philly, 3 delicious courses, complimentary truffles.  The portions are very generous.  We added a couple of ala carte sides to our 2 entree orders and easily ended up with 4 meals total.  
Most of the standards are on the menu, so if you&apos;re a regular, you we won&apos;t be disappointed.  Help keep Philly dining alive and give it a try.  You won&apos;t be disappointed."
4,"If you are looking for a place to wine and dine, you already know there are certain cuisines that cater to that atmosphere. This little French bistro in Bella Vista is certainly one of them.

We had reservations during their happy hour (which at the time, was running half-price menu) - so definitely keep an eye out for that.

Really great wait staff, extremely friendly as soon as we walked in the door. They have coat room to make your sitting feel that much more comfortable. This is important to point out, because it is a tight space, but that just makes the whole atmosphere feel that much more warm and exciting. 

Their plates are all very elegant and true to french fashion - they are very creative and focus on combinations with fresh herbs and vegetables to go with their meat entrees. I would argue that if you are looking for just a classic/plain-jane meal - you won&apos;t want to come here. This is an opportunity to try some things outside of the norm, whether it be rabbit, snail, or quail. 

All of their food was just downright delicious, I think we would have just liked to see more vegetarian entree options on the menu. Their dessert menu is definitely something you can&apos;t pass on, with lots of options that have fruit (personal fav.)  

Check this place out!"
5,"This is my special occasion meal in Philly. You have to order the right things but if you do your meal will be incredible:

For appetizers, get the escargot and the fisherman&apos;s poached egg, skip the foie gras

For main, get the lamb, duck, beef, and I hear the trout is excellent too, skip the rabbit

For dessert you can&apos;t really go wrong, but I would definitely go for one of the classic French specialties to really appreciate the delicate flavors and textures that they&apos;re famous for

I would describe the ambience as intimate with an older Victorian-style decor."
5,"Love love love this place! I&apos;ve been here at least 4-5 times during restaurant week over the past two years and every time was better than the last. 

Overall, I&apos;ve had Escargot, Duck Confit, Lamb Shank, Beef Bourguignon, Mille Feuille, and Pot de Creme. 

- Escargots are always my go to appetizer and the garlic flavor they add here is fantastic. 

- The Duck Confit is my favorite main dish and I highly recommend it. The meat is very tender and basically falls off the bone. 

- The Lamb Shank is huge and pretty much two servings worth so nothing to complain there. 

- The Beef Bourguignon is good but average. The beef is very soft though. 

- For dessert, both the Mille Feuille and Pot de Creme are delicious but I usually go for the Mille Feuille because it&apos;s so pretty. 

The atmosphere of this restaurant is also great and the decorations makes it feel extra magical."
4,"This is a review of the five course tasting menu, touching upon the wine pairings.  

While this restaurant is good -- actually very good -- their structure is somewhat different than what we prefer.  Our server Cornelia -- who was lovely and great -- asked if there&apos;s anything we wouldn&apos;t eat.  Not thinking to inquire what we might be served,  we didn&apos;t claim allergies or aversions.  (When we ordered the tasters menu at a wonderful restaurant in Charleston, the server primed us.  &quot;Would you eat venison?  Is lamb to your liking? How about sturgeon?&quot;)

So ... we ended up trying escargot and rabbit -- items we probably would have rejected had we been apprised.  For what it&apos;s worth, both were very good -- the garlic sauce with the snails excellent.  And yes; they&apos;re not kidding when they say rabbit tastes like chicken.

With the exception of the amuse bouche -- a delicious celery soup -- the oeuf du pecheur (poached eggs with mussels) and escargot, the three of us were served different items. Their thinking is that we could try more things by tasting each other&apos;s dishes.  Trout with haricots verts was exceptional as was the salmon appetizer, so delicate and tasty.

For dessert, we were served two orders of poached pears -- another thing we would have nixed, had we known -- along with a tart.  I didn&apos;t like the pear at all, so Cornelia very kindly swapped mine out for &quot;Financier aux Mures&quot;: almond cake, whipped goat cheese, blackberry puree.  Much better!

As far as the wine pairings, were they really &quot;paired&quot;?! Since we  were served different, unrelated dishes for several courses, how was the wine synched to the food?  While we were told WHAT we were drinking, we weren&apos;t told WHY -- which is always a nice touch.  The port, of course, served with the sweets made sense. (Including the port, we were given two reds, three whites.)

Bistrot&apos;s tasting menu is $55.  The wine pairing is an additional $20.  While it was a fun evening, I wouldn&apos;t whole heartedly recommend doing as we did.  When we go back -- and we look forward to returning -- we&apos;ll order off the menu."
3,"Good, but Hurt by the Price Point

Expectations for a place like this are always sky high. The food is really good but there are better places in the city for the amount of money that you&apos;ll spend here.

For a high end place, service was good but not great. I do notice things others may not, though, having spent five years in the hospitality industry at a high end country club. So it may not be anything at all for others.

My entree was beef (something I can&apos;t spell). It was really salty but cooked well. But really, really salty. The appetizer (in photo) was the best thing. Dessert was a wine soaked pear. It didn&apos;t taste anything more than just a pear.

Drinks are expensive, even for the type of restaurant.

Overall, food is good but not great. It&apos;s hurt by some other things, though. I probably wouldn&apos;t go back."
5,"One of my favorite cute little French restaurants in Philly! Strongly recommend with friends and definitely get the tasting menu so you can get a great sample of all of their specialties!

Must get: raw salmon salad, burgundy snail, fisherman poached egg with muscle, mustard braised rabbit
Meh: beer braised beef, mocktails, dessert
Missed out: everything else

What can I say aside from the fact that we had the best double date dining at Bistrot. Everything, from the bartender, to the plating to each dish was perfect. I think my favorite was still the raw salmon and poached egg with mussels, as the servings were very reasonable and well seasoned. I was not a big fan of the beef, as the broth was overwhelming and robbed the meat of its inherent texture and flavor. 

Food: 5 stars
Service: 4 stars
Price: 4-5 stars
Ambiance: 4 stars"
4,"Great service, decent food, good atmosphere. We came on a Tuesday night and we&apos;re the only patrons at 6:30pm, although there were 2 more tables by the time we left. The cheese bread ball gouter before dinner was nice, as was the post dessert chocolates. My duck was tasty, just a little dry, but I loved how the skin crisped. Our desserts, the mille feuille and almond cake dessert had fruit and were nicely balanced instead of overly sweet.
Great place for dinner and drinks if you want to relax and converse!"
5,"My new go-to dinner spot in the city for French food! Loved the atmosphere - music, lighting, service, and food were amazing - probably the first place I&apos;ve been to in the city that creates the feeling you&apos;re in France. 

Atmosphere: This was probably the highlight. Servers were so friendly! The space didn&apos;t feel overcrowded, and the music was a great volume (not too loud). It&apos;s a great spot for a romantic dinner date - lighting wasn&apos;t too dark, but slightly dim. Seating was also very comfortable, and the interior was well decorated.

Food: Start off with bread as an appetizer - I&apos;ve had better bread in the city, but decent; some pieces tasted a bit stale. Essentially, everything else we ordered, I loved. Recommend the escargot and the pork cheeks - both were very flavorful dishes! The pork cheek dish also was a very large portion size - combined with brussel sprouts, polenta, and mushrooms. I also loved the goat cheese flatbread. Their ice creams are home-made, and the apple tart paired with caramel ice cream was a delicious mix. These were all recommendations from our waiter as well! 

Overall: 5/5 - I haven&apos;t been to another French-inspired restaurant that I liked so much in the city. Highly recommend for a nice date, but not crazy pricey (around $35pp in total; with no drinks)."
5,"Came here for restaurant week and I was very impressed by the quality of the food and attentive service. 

My friend and I got the mussels and foie gras as appetizers. The mussels and egg felt like a take on eggs benedict and the sauce was delicious. The foie gras was buttery smooth and came with a portion size that was large enough to split.

For entrees, we got the duck confit and lamb shank. The duck was well cooked and juicy but the star of the night was definitely the lamb. The lamb was a huge portion (enough for 2 on its own!), tender and falling off the bone.

After a satisfying two courses, we ended with the mille and chocolate mousse, which were both delicious and surprisingly a nice and light end to the meal. 

I will definitely be back here to dine again, one of my new favorites in the area!"
5,"This place is just stunning. It is adorable inside and the service is attentive and friendly. I went with a friend for restaurant week and we wisely got all different things to share.

Course 1: foie gras and mussel/poached egg/toast. Hard to choose which was best, the former was like meaty butter on toast and the latter like a creamy dance party on my taste buds. We had some interest in the escargot and salmon apps but alas had to choose and I believe chose well.

Course 2: duck and trout: I love a good duck and this was a solid piece of duck. Is it as good as my favorite meal in Philly, a roast duck on rice with veg meal from sang kee for $8.99? Hard to say but it was great. The trout was the real star, perfectly seared, crispy with a creamy lemony butter sauce. So, so good.

Course 3: dessert, cheese plate and the chocolate mousse. While I loved the cheese I maybe would just do two traditional desserts in hindsight because the chocolate was to die for.

Go, especially go during restaurant week, and make sure to make a reservation because they fill up!"
5,"The people have said it:  Bistrot is a Philly gem, and one of my go-to favorites for special occasions (&apos;cuz $$$).
My one time here is honestly my best dining experience as of yet, for Bistrot La Minette checks all the boxes:

Warm, top-notch service. 
Inviting, cozy atmosphere (lots of wood) that works across dates, friends, and family. 
Delicious food.  Simple, but artfully prepared. I doubt you could get anything bad here, and I do not say that lightly.

The layered mille dessert with the strawberries is on my short list of most memorable desserts I&apos;ve ever had.  The delicate textures of creamy to crisp...it&apos;s perfection.  

Absolutely fantastic."
5,Might be the best state-side dinner I&apos;ve had since Inn at Little Washington.  Terrific garlicky escargots; fabulous Green salad; beautifully done trout with the most perfect green beans ever; bœuf brisket so tender you wanted to cry; incredible desserts including the mousse au chocolate to die for.  Service was seamless: Absolutely attentive but never intrusive.  Lovely environment but rather high noise levels.
5,"When I first sat down for dinner, I immediately felt like I was back in France, sitting in a restaurant off the Seine River. As with several other reviews, I cannot emphasize this enough: the atmosphere of this restaurant is amazing. 

To start off the night, the server brought each of us a tiny cheese puff as an amuse-bouche, which was a great way to start the meal. While we waited for our entrees, there was plenty of bread and whipped butter to go around and servers constantly stopped by to refill our glasses.

The highlight of dinner was my entree - the truite meunière (trout on a bed of fingerling potatoes, green beans, and lemon-brown butter) absolutely blew my mind. While the potatoes and green beans weren&apos;t standout, the trout was fantastic - incredibly tender and flavorful. However, the star of the dish was the lemon-brown butter, which I would have gladly paid for on its own.

TLDR: atmosphere was fantastic, service was quick, and the trout and lemon-brown butter combination exceeded all my expectations. Take my 5-star rating, Bistrot La Minette - you absolutely deserve it."
5,"Although we have returned to Bistro La Minette several times since my last review, I hadn&apos;t taken the time to do an update. Well - update time!

Any time is a good time to go to this Old World-feeling Paris restaurant - but when they&apos;re running one of their special dinners, it&apos;s definitely the place to be.  We went for their Tartiflette dinner.  The very reasonable fixed-price dinner for 2, with a bottle of wine, before tip, ran about $110.

The 4 course dinner started with a delicious Root vegetable soup followed by a Dijon vinaigrette Bibb lettuce salad with ham &amp; Comte cheese. The main dish was the Tartiflette - which was a baked &quot;gratin&quot; of potatoes, bacon, onions and Reblochon cheese and wine.  This is something like the very best au gratin potatoes that you&apos;ve ever tasted. It was so large, we could only eat half, so I know what we&apos;ll be enjoying for dinner tonight!  For dessert, a delicious Mixed Berry Tart was served.

The atmosphere, the staff, the food all make this place a destination for a very enjoyable evening."
4,This quaint little French restaurant is decorated so well and feels so nice inside. The outside is kind of unassuming but the interior feels really nice. The waiters are all so kind and enthusiastic and the dishes were prepared surprisingly quickly. I ordered the duck confit which had an amazingly crispy skin that paired well with juicy meat that was all marinated in some of the jus that the duck cooked in. This place is splendid and I hope to be back soon
5,"Reminds me of all the bistros in Paris. Food was delicious, authentic, service was great. I got the duck and my husband got the trout.
Fabulous and we will be back for sure!"
5,"We made reservations about a month ago, because I was told over and over that I needed to try their famed duck and lamb cassoulet. Well, I&apos;m officially sold. 

Dinner began with a bottle of red wine, salmon tartare, escargot in a garlic butter sauce, and pan seared scallops topped with a lemon sabayon for starters. We also received refills of complimentary French bread - I have no idea if the bread is made in house or not, but it is absolutely delicious! The escargot was so flavorful and tender, served in individual small containers filled with a decadent garlic butter sauce, topped with a small crouton. I absolutely love it each time I order it here. For the scallop appetizer, you get three pan-seared scallops served with a lemon sabayon - a citrusy complement to the briny seafood. The scallops were seared to perfection and very well seasoned. 

For the entrees, we split the lamb prepared two ways, the duck and lamb cassoulet, and the trout. The lamb prepared two ways was EXCELLENT. I&apos;m not the biggest fan of lamb, but I appreciated that the lamb was not gamey in the least bit. The pan seared lamb was cooked medium rare and incredibly tender. The other portion of the lamb was braised and melt in your mouth perfection. The trout was seared with skin on. The skin was crisp, the fingerling potatoes and haricot verts were perfectly cooked, and the fish was flaky and moist. The cassoulet, with each savory bite, felt incredibly homey and tasted like the ultimate comfort food. The beans in the rich tomato sauce were just so buttery and soft, the lamb was tender, and the duck leg confit tied the entire dish together. The dish was served in a bowl topped with duck fat breadcrumbs. I see what the big deal was now! 

For dessert, we decided to split the Mille feuille and the tarte au citron served with a cassis sorbet. The lemon tart was to die for!! I mean, I appreciate a good Mille feuille - loved the cream, but the tart was the dessert star of the night. 

Our service was outstanding and our server had a wonderful sense of humor. What a wonderful way to spend Saturday night!"
