5,"5 stars for great taste and price, I just wish their food wasn&apos;t so good that I didn&apos;t want to keep ordering more!

The falafel sandwich is so delicious - it&apos;s got a great balance of flavors and textures, it&apos;s filling, but I think getting an extra bag o&apos; balls is so tempting. 

I got the Original Tehina shake and it&apos;s not my favorite, I will admit, but I&apos;m also not a huge fan of chocolate or coffee. My roommate loved the Coffee option. I think it&apos;s got an interesting texture and doesn&apos;t make you miss your classic dairy-filed shakes. I found it sweet and refreshing.

Tips/Takeaways:
Overall, they are quick with their orders, they usually have a long line, but the prices and food are pretty great.
-Would recommend checking out for some falafel!
-Support local!"
5,"For years now I&apos;ve been itching to make my way over to Goldie, but yesterday the opportunity finally presented itself as my bestie and I wanted to grab some takeout and enjoy it social-distancing style. 

Goldie&apos;s online ordering system was super easy to navigate and the order was ready in 15 minutes at their cute little front door/pick up table. 

We both had the falafel sandwich combo (sandwich+fries+beverage). The falafel was fresh and flavorful, and not greasy at all. The dressing on the sandwich itself had the perfect amount of spice to it, which was a nice pairing with the crunchy veggies that filled the pita. We tried two of their sauces on the side. The harissa had a bit of a kick and a pleasant smokiness to it. The amba was perfectly balanced, not too much garlic, not overly mango. Each sauce was a compliment to the perfectly cut and crisp fries that came with the combo. We tried both the regular and that shawarma spiced fries - the spice amps up a bit on your taste buds as you continue to eat, HOWEVER you can cool that fire with what I consider to be Goldie&apos;s crowning gem: the shakes! 

I opted to try the OG tehina shake as I am lover of all things sesame, and my bestie tried the banana. Sweet baby jesus, those were some DAMN good shakes. I was a little hesitant about a vegan shake, and wasn&apos;t sure if the tehina flavor would really come through. Boy, was my doubt unfounded because the shakes were perfect in both consistency and flavor. 

Goldie is the best plant-based lunch to grab and go in this COVID era."
5,"When do I not love this place. Correct. The answer is NEVER. Very tasty, full menu for your curb-side pickup and online ordering, attentive staff, reasonably priced, great menu options, and vegan. I do believe this place currently has a delivery option too. My breakfast craving fix up was Tahini shake and pita tops. But I do love its falafel pita sandwich and falafel salad. Give it a try! So worth it!"
5,"If you like falafel or just great food in general, make sure you come to Goldie! Their falafel is simply heavenly; beautifully friend and bursting with flavor. The sauces pack a punch and are a great way to spice up your falafel sandwich or &quot;bag of balls.&quot; Yes...it&apos;s on the menu. 

The tehina shakes are a unique and tasty addition to your meal!

As with Mike Solomonov&apos;s other places around Philly, you&apos;ve gotta try Goldie!"
4,"Excellent falafels in really great pita sandwiches. We tried all three sauces, and I really enjoyed all three, with the harissa probably being my favorite. My wife got her sandwich without the Israeli salad because she was worried about the parsely (she hates herbs), but it was very mild and next time she&apos;d probably include it. The fries with the shawarma sauce were excellent as well and definitely worth ordering next visit."
5,Their milkshakes tho! SO GOOD! The Original tahini milkshake is delicious. Their falafel is very fresh and tasty
5,"I dream about Goldie&apos;s tahina shake on a weekly basis. So simple yet uniquely delicious, the cup is cute and all around it&apos;s the perfect sweet treat.

Mediterranean food is typically not my favorite, but I loveeed Goldie. The falafel were crispy and light, without that oily heaviness that falafel can sometimes have. Go with the harissa sauce and add shawarma fries!!

During COVID times they have an online system set up for you to place your order ahead of time or you can also order in person. There&apos;s always been a line when I&apos;ve went, but it goes pretty quickly."
4,"We ordered food from Goldie&apos;s last Sunday mainly because I really wanted to try the Turkish coffee Tehina shake. The Tehina shake was the absolute BEST and the perfect cure for the hot weather. There are some crushed nuts in it, so I wouldn&apos;t recommend it if you have a nut allergy. I&apos;m also just realizing there are other flavors like banana, coconut, mint chocolate in addition to Turkish coffee and the original. I can&apos;t wait to try their other flavors.

We picked up our falafel sandwiches and Tehina shakes and drove over to the Rail Park for a picnic. The falafel sandwiches were huge and each had three large falafel balls. It was refreshing to eat but so messy. One falafel ball rolled out of my pita pocket into the inside of my elbow onto my shirt. I know, I know. It&apos;s a falafel sandwich, I should&apos;ve brought tissues. 

The fries with Schwarma Spice was really delicious. I liked the little cups of chutneys the staff packed for us to dip the fries into. 

FYI, only the Sansom Street location is currently open, and they&apos;re only open on Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays."
5,"When our dinner plans quickly got cancelled during my sister&apos;s recent PHL visit, we had to think on our feet - luckily, we both had Goldie on our list, so it was an easy choice! We ordered online for pickup later in the afternoon, which was extremely easy - I always appreciate easy transactions in the time of COVID. Their takeout menu offers incredible deals - my fiancee went for the sandwich combo, while my sister and I went for the salad combo. Each came with either a sandwich or salad, fries, and a drink for only $12-13 - and it included a ton of food! Our salads were excellent - I loved all the flavors, especially the beets and the lemon tehina dressing. The salad itself was pretty filling, but the falafel added that extra touch - they were perfectly flavored and not too overly fried. You could tell it was great quality! I opted for the hamba sauce, which balanced the sweet mango with savory garlic + onion - well done and not spicy at all. Between my sister and I split an order of regular fries and shawarma spiced fries, which were delish as well. The shawarma fries had a nice level of spice without being too powerful, but the regular fries were also really nicely seasoned, especially with the unique tehina ketchup. My fiancee really enjoyed his falafel - he went with the harissa sauce on the side, which was pretty spicy but added a nice complement to the falafel in the pita. He devoured the meal, which was an awesome sign! The sauces we all got were on point, and we wound up saving the tehina sauces to use on other dishes - excited to add that spice to our repertoire! 
Overall, Goldie is another excellent addition to the Solmonov restaurants. Definitely a more casual vibe than Zahav and Abe Fisher, but well done and delish nonetheless! We will definitely be back to visit again so we can try the tehina shakes (great reviews on these guys!) and hopefully some of the other sauces with the meals. Thanks for a great last-minute dinner, Goldie!"
5,"Tahini milkshakes. That&apos;s it. That&apos;s the review. 

(Actually everything here is good with an emphasis on the milkshake... if you come through, your meal will not be complete without it.)"
5,"Love this place, the sandwiches are always consistent and very tasty. I could eat their fries everyday of my life!"
5,"Goldie&apos;s falafel and sauces are dreamy. 

Such a great afternoon snack or hardy meal. Great location and beautiful restaurant, too. Highly recommend."
5,"I&apos;m low key obsessed with Michael Solomonov. It&apos;s literally on my bucket list to eat at Zahav one day.

I saw Goldie on Eater&apos;s Dining on a Dime and had it bookmarked for years. On my short weekend trip to Philly, I wasn&apos;t able to snag a reservation at Zahav so I knew I had to at least try Goldies.

Parking was a bit of a pain in downtown philly but we eventually found one.

The three of us shared a falafel sandwich with everything, fries and a tahini shake because we ate a lot before and we were going to continue to eat a lot after.

The falafel was delicious. I&apos;m not usually a falafel person. I usually get the meat options at middle eastern spots. Anyways, falafel was crisp and tasty. The accompanying veggies are perfect with the fried balls. Sauces are good.

Fries - they are seasoned with the schwarma seasoning and are fried to golden perfection.

Tahini shake - star of the night. I love anything sesame-y. This shake was thick and so nutty. We got the original.  I&apos;m sure the other flavors are superb.

Definitely worth hitting this place up for a meal."
4,"Shawarma fries and falafels are delicious. I like the crunchy falafel balls instead of in the sandwich, because it gets mushy due to all of the sauces. And the best thing on the menu is the tehina shake. Omg, get the shake, whatever flavor you like. I usually get the date one...it&apos;s so good!"
5,"I absolutely enjoyed my meal from Goldie!

I was really craving a milkshake and fries so I thought this was a good time to finally try Goldie after hearing so many good things about it. I didn&apos;t check out the menu beforehand so I took some time to figure out what I wanted but I eventually ordered the schawarma fries and tahina milkshake.

The fries were amazing and the schawarma seasoning complimented it very well. Also, I have tried many vegan milkshakes and the tahina is my favorite one so far. 

I will definitely be coming back to try another type of milkshake and the falafel sandwich."
4,"Order the Tehina shakes!! They are divinely creamy with a nuttiness that cuts through the sweetness. Falafel was a tad bit dry and and nothing to write home about, but it gets the job done if you&apos;re craving some fried chickpeas."
5,"Goldie is definitely some of the best falafel I have had! Everything is prepared right after you order, so you know it is fresh. The falafel is crispy but definitely doesn&apos;t taste over-fried or greasy. You can also add fries or pickles in your pita for $1. I haven&apos;t had a salad yet, but they look great as well. I&apos;ll definitely have to try one soon.

I&apos;ve gone during the weekday lunch rush, and the wait still isn&apos;t too bad. They are definitely moving quickly behind the counter!

For the price point (about $9), you definitely get a very big sandwich. You will be full for a while!

The mint chocolate tehini milkshake is delicious too-looking forward to trying a new one. 

Overall, I&apos;d recommend Goldie to anyone!"
5,"One of my favorite lunch spots in the city! You definitely need to they there early, there is always a line. But it is worth the wait!

I like the salad but the pita sandwich is my usual go-to. The falafel is one of the best around and is always light and fluffy, never dry. They offer a few different types of sauces for the sandwich. The original or the harissa tahini are my usual go-to&apos;s, but they are all delicious.

The &quot;bag of balls&quot; is also a nice size for lunch. You get a bag of falafel with dipping sauce!

The seasoned fries are also awesome. 

You really can&apos;t go wrong for a delicious lunch."
5,"The schawarma fried is pretty good. It&apos;s not too greasy but still crispy and not dry. The schawarma seasoning on top gives a Mediterranean flare to it.

I recommend adding the soft pita for the salad. It&apos;s sliced in several pieces and you can stuff the soft falafel in it."
5,"The falafel sandwich here is to die for. Crispy falafel with fluffy center, on soft warm pita, filled with creamy hummus - you can&apos;t go wrong. The fries here are also coated the seasoning that is unique and a perfect side to the sandwich. Affordable, quick, easy, delicious, and makes the perfect to-go meal for a picnic at Rittenhouse park. Can&apos;t wait to go back soon any try the Tahini milkshake!"
