5,"Omg this is the best breakfast I&apos;ve had in a long time. My husband and I waited over an hour for a table here, which we never ever do, and it was totally worth the wait! (Not in his opinion, but mine :) 

I am absolutely obsessed with the blue yogurt berry and granola bowl. This is by far the BEST yogurt bowl I&apos;ve ever eaten!! See photos.. you&apos;ll be amazed. I have since dreamed about this yogurt multiple mornings for breakfast and sometimes am tempted just order it for delivery halfway across the city. 

We also had chicken and waffles which was pretty good, but not nearly as good as the short rib huevos rancheros, which to me looks more like quesadillas (see photos). This was also some of the best huevos rancheros I have ever had and the serving size was huge enough to feed two people! 

The cappuccino was delicious and the service was speedy fast because they were trying to turn tables over very quickly since the wait got up to over two hours long. 

I have worked in the food industry so I knew to eat quick and get out but others who were lingering around and drinking their coffee slowly could be annoyed at how they were being rushed to eat and leave. But because of Covid restaurants have restrictions on how many tables they can have outside so it&apos;s critical that people be aware that every minute equals money, and they should not sit and linger when done eating if there is a wait for tables. 

The owner was funny, A little rough around the edges, but I enjoyed watching him keep track of a two hour long wait on nothing but yellow Post-it notes. Maybe an upgraded computer system would do them good! 

But the food was so delicious it outweighs everything else to a 5-star rating. Bravo chef!"
5,"Absolutely spectacular service! Covid conscious, safe, clean, and convenient! This place has it all! 

Let&apos;s jump right into it:

The staff is super friendly and family oriented and we felt so welcomed the moment we walked up. The seats are spaced appropriately apart and there&apos;s hand sanitizer on every table. Some cars are going by during your dining experience but they aren&apos;t going super fast so you don&apos;t really notice them. And they even brought a little bowl out for our dog to drink out of. 


The menu is small but packed with flavor and choices. And you will certainly find some thing you&apos;re craving! Or something you didn&apos;t even know you were craving!

Our server was so sweet and gave a great recommendation after appropriately gauging &quot;how hungry are you?&quot; The Roti did not disappoint!

I ordered the A La Maude salad and I wanted to lick my plate! Chic pea galore!!! And fresh avocado. 

And the salmon dish (see photos) was spectacular.

If it wasn&apos;t for Covid they could&apos;ve just put our plates back on the next table because they were that clean after we were finished. Everyone of us eat every morsel!

Absolutely a place to stop by for some thing special and something different!"
5,"We had a delicious brunch here yesterday. We came expecting a long wait for brunch since the weather was beautiful and it was a busy Sunday morning, and they told us it would be around 35-40 minutes to be seated. It really ended up only being 20 minutes before we got a table, which was a pleasant surprise! Just be sure you have your entire party there to be seated or they won&apos;t seat you. 

The food was really delicious and the outdoor setup is great. The tables were well spaced and they had hand sanitizer on every table. My only tiny complaint was that we felt a bit rushed -- we had four waiters in 5 minutes asking to take our plates -- but I understand that times are really tough for restaurants and they were eager to sit their long line of waiting customers. 

Overall, the food was fantastic and the outdoor ambience is top notch."
5,"Absolutely love this place.

BYOB option is fantastic. We got the OG and mango pineapple juice which were great.

Ordered the heuvos rancheros brisket, the shawarma, the hummus, and the red velvet tiramisu pancake. Everything was cooked well, flavorful and amazing. 

The staff was great! Super friendly and attentive.

Honestly, I&apos;ve been here multiple times and the food, ambiance, and staff are amazing and everyone should come here. It is honestly the best place for breakfast, lunch, or brunch!"
4,"Food: 4.5/5 loved everything ordered! The sauce on the huevos rancheros were delicious and the brisket was so soft and well marinated. Underneath the eggs there were potatoes and a side of guac. The petite steak was delicious as well. The meat was tender and not overly well done (medium). Bread was a bit cold and didn&apos;t go all too well with the steak, but added substance. The shawarma meat and sweet potatoes went well together. Portion sizes were definitely filling. 
** Chai latte is a MUST! So so good. Some of the best chai I&apos;ve had! 

Location: near some other local restaurants. Outdoor seating is divided, but still quite crowded. The wait on a Saturday afternoon was around an hour. Staff was friendly and all wore masks, but there were so many people waiting outside near the outdoor dining huts that it was almost ineffective in social distancing."
2,"Visiting the city of Philadelphia, we decided to look for a place to have breakfast, we chose this place because of the &quot;good&quot; reviews it has, but honestly it was not what I expected, from my point of view the ingredients they use are not of good/high quality for the price that they charge, I was expecting something healthier and more delicious.

What I do recommend is the coffee they have, although they should include almond milk."
4,Wowwwwww!!! The food here was amazing! Even the chai latte was just perfect and creamy. We got red velvet tiramisu pancakes and some fries with aioli. The outdoor seating is great with partitions between each party and nicely heated. It did get pretty crowded so I&apos;d say if you&apos;re going for brunch on a weekend get there on the earlier side. One thing - I felt a bit rushed by the waiters and not surprised because the line was long but given that with Covid I don&apos;t eat out much anymore just would have appreciated a bit more time to catch up with my friend. Otherwise highly recommend!!
4,"Great outdoor dining meal during a windy day. A group of us dined in the partitioned and heated structure. This is my second time visiting so I knew there were no reservations, but even at 12 pm on a Saturday we were seated in 30 min, although quoted 1.5 hours. 

Service is great and the owner is personable, you can tell he takes pride in this being a community restaurant. 

Highlights were the Berrylicious Pain Perdu (with Nutella) and the N-Liberties. The plating and bright colors were beautiful and the flavor was on point! I&apos;m typically a sweet brunch eater, but I decided to deviate a bit with the N-Liberties and it did not disappoint. Lamb, Smooth hummus, Flavorful cauliflower, eggs, and potatoes, it was healthiest brunch dish I&apos;ve eaten in ages. The French toast was right up my alley and very filling.

The Gauffre Chicken Cordon Blue had good flavor, but a fairly soggy waffle and was made with chicken tenders, so it did not top my list of brunch renditions of the famed classic, but the French twist was interesting. On a separate occasion I tried the Green Shakshuka and was not that impressed, I imagine the classic Red Shakshuka is much better.

The lattes are all delicious, plus this place is BYOB, so that&apos;s always a win."
4,"Cafe La Maude has a truly filling menu. We got the foul to share which had a wonderful medley of beans, eggs, hummus, and tomatoes. The bread on this dish was scrumptious topped with Mediterranean spices and the perfect, warm temperature.

Moreover, the brioche with mascarpone and berries had a wonderful fluffiness and which I normally prefer savory breakfast foods to sweet ones, I enjoyed this dish a lot. We did ask to get the dish without bananas and the server forgot to note that. The creme brulee crust on the bananas was delicious, but I was disappointed that we had bananas on the dish when we asked not to have any. The server did not write our order down including the drinks, but overall the space was distanced for COVID-19 and the brunch was super filling!"
4,"Cafe La Maude is the quintessential Philly destination for an excellent weekend brunch. The service was fast and efficient. They have outdoor booths open that allowed for fairly spaced out outdoor dining. The food was excellent. Between the two of us, we shared the Red Shakshuka and the Apple Pie Banana Pancakes which were excellent portion sizes. The red shakshuka was an excellent blend of Lebanese sausage and tomato flavors with a delicious touch of Harissa Labneh; the entire meal was hearty but not too heavy even with the pita bread. The Apple Pie Banana Pancakes were an interesting combination of green pancakes with bananas inside and caramelized apples with blueberry cream cheese yogurt. Overall we felt safe and had an excellent meal, would definitely go again."
4,Definitely worth the hour wait! Brunch was exceptional. The Fromage really hit the spot. Ordered more than I could chew. Will be back when I come back to Philly.
5,"I came here because I wanted to support small businesses during the pandemic. They have seating outside and everyone was wearing masks. I was seated promptly and multiple people made sure we were serviced with drinks first. I got a dirty Chai and it was amazing. It was exactly the drink I needed to start my lazy Saturday morning. 
I have allergies to wheat and sesame (recently) and the waitress was kind to help me through the menu. She knew exactly what to avoid and made sure my meal came out without any conflict. I would say the service was overall spectacular. 
The food came out and I was amazed. The steak was cooked well. The potatoes tasted amazing. My egg was cooked to perfection. I got a really good instagram out of it (that&apos;s how you know it&apos;s the perfect runny egg). Overall, I left with a happy tummy."
5,No surprise that this is a five star restaurant! Lebanese spices combined with American breakfast standards made my morning quite the treat! The place is very respectful of Covid safety standards while also eager for your business. Thank you for a great morning everybody!
5,"Although service was nice last time, I feel that this time was more memorable. A couple with a toddler across us was having issues with a wobbly table. One of the employees, helped the couple stabilize the table and commented that he would come by and restabilize it whenever the temporary stopper falls out of place. The food we ordered was a Sweet Potato Benny and Chicken  Cordon Blue. The chicken cordon blue was sandwiched by waffles and served with fries seasoned and crisp to be like long potato hashes. I liked how the fries were, but the combination of fried chicken breast along with two waffles was a bit too much for my preference. It came out to dry my mouth a bit too much, and I think next time I order it I would ask for extra sauce or maple syrup and maybe eat the chicken together with one slice of waffle rather than both. The sweet potato hash for the Sweet Potato Benny was a sweet crisp, and matched with the sausage and egg yolk. Unfortunately, I didn&apos;t order that dish for myself. Overall yet another delightful experience."
5,"Came here for brunch with a group of friends during the COVID-era. We came early on a Thursday morning and were lucky that there wasn&apos;t any wait to get seated. I imagine on weekends this place might be much busier. They have a few tables outdoors and a few limited tables indoors (now that indoor dining is allowed).

I had heard this cafe toted as a mix of american-lebanese cuisine and we were not disappointed. They have many choices for every savory and sweet craving that you might have. They&apos;re also BYOB so don&apos;t forget to bring some booze! We brought some prosecco and ordered a carafe of orange juice to accompany. The food arrived very promptly (yay, we were starving) and the I was very pleased with the size of the portions. My friends tried a number of dishes but the favorites were the green shakshuka and the brisket huevos rancheros. The huevos rancheros are honestly similar to quesidillas but I loved that there were so many different elements on the place. The prices are a little high ~20$ a dish but for the portion size I think it&apos;s pretty reasonable. 

Overall, I was very pleased with this brunch. If you&apos;re looking to dine somewhere with filling, delicious dishes, with prompt service and a BYOB option - this is the place for you!"
5,"People keep telling me how great Café La Maude is, and I&apos;ve always been reluctant to go because there&apos;s always a long wait.

This past Saturday, we called ahead of time and were surprised that there was no wait. There were many patrons already seated and eating, and only a couple of empty tables. 

As I looked at what other people were eating and perused the menu at the same time, I wanted to order everything. Eventually I decided to go with one of the signature dishes, the N-Liberties while my husband had the Parisian Za&apos; (also a signature dish). He also ordered one of the iced cappuccinos. 

Our food came out quickly and was so beautifully plated. The N-Liberties was delicious. The grounded Lebanese sausage had a mixture of spices and was so flavorful. The little side of fried cauliflower was amazing too. I&apos;m glad to know you can order this as a side dish. My husband also enjoyed his Parisian Za&apos;, which looked like the crowd&apos;s favorite, as everyone was ordering it. The iced cappuccino was okay, not the best cappuccino he had, but not bad.

Throughout our meal, our server kept coming to refill our waters, which was great, because it was such a hot day. The umbrellas helped a lot, but it&apos;s always good to stay hydrated!"
4,"We were seated quickly and service was fast. There are soooo many options on the menu, which is great, but makes it tough for an indecisive person like me! 

I&apos;ve been here many times before over the years and I always loved the flavors of the Lebanese dishes. 

Covid era, i went for brunch. The chai latte is phenomenal. On the menu only the dirty (Cappuccino) option was available but I just asked for it without. So so good. For our mains, we ordered sweet and savory. The berrylicious and the burrito. The burrito was fresh and yummy. And berrylicious is very sweet. Large portions."
3,"Hmmmm. A tough one. I want to give this one a ton of love but it just didn&apos;t have what I expected. The service was great! They were fast without rushing you through your meal or making you feel unwanted. There was hand sanitizer at the table which I think was a great touch, and there were heaters right next to each table. Which is why I gave 3 stars and want to give more. 

The food wasn&apos;t what I was expected and neither was the cappuccino. They weren&apos;t terrible but they didn&apos;t blow my mind. The menu was limited, and for a brunch place there were no morning cocktails. After a tough thanksgiving I needed a mimosa! It is BYOB for those looking to give this place a shot however! 

I would say give it a go if you&apos;re in northern liberties, BYOB, and expect a great staff!"
5,"My go to brunch spot, the staff is very friendly and helpful. The atmosphere is lovely and more importantly, the food looks great and taste amazing. I like to order something savory and share something sweet with my daughter. Probably the best chai in the city."
5,I haven&apos;t had the opportunity to enjoy Cafe La Maude&apos;s food since the pandemic began but will definitely be ordering brunch soon! The food is excellent!
