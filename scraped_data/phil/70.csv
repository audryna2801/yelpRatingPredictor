5,"What a cute little hidden lunch take out spot!
Sandwiched in between Di Bruno&apos;s &amp; the corner spot (formerly Sandler&apos;s) this place has great salads, I recommend the Sweet Beet, sandwiches and breads to take out. Everything we had was really excellent so if you are looking for a fresh lunch spot this is a good choice."
5,"As far as &quot;dining out&quot; is concerned, High Street on Market being open has been one of those &quot;luxury&quot; things we were most thankful for throughout this pandemic.

As fans of their sister restaurant, Fork, next door, we were grateful to be able to still get our hands on their incredible baked goods, and order takeout meals of a quality that made us almost feel like we were still living a pre-pandemic lifestyle...at least on the plate.

Oddly enough, we had never really eaten at High Street prior to the closures, but we had purchased plenty of bread for takeout, and had numerous pastries while dining at Fork. The bread is top-notch, and they have a great selection of consistent varieties, while throwing a few curve balls in there from time to time, as well. At the moment, the options aren&apos;t as numerous, but they&apos;re still wonderful and we tend to get at least one each week. Their potato bread is perhaps the most uniquely-memorable, but in a town with a lot of great bread bakers, all of their options can hold their own with the best of them! Their pastries are also wonderful. We&apos;ve yet to have one that we didn&apos;t enjoy! The prices for all of the baked goods are super fair, too, and thankfully are easier to get than finding your own flour to bake yourself!

As for the meals, we can only comment on the takeout options currently available, which have all been great! There have been mostly savory options, which have been perfect for the cooler, early-Spring weather, combined with cabin fever we&apos;re experiencing. It should be interesting to see if there&apos;s a shift in the menu direction or not with the warmer months approaching, but either way, it&apos;s tasty! The price points for the family meals have been more than fair, too, offering sizable portions that should leave you full and happy!

As if the food wasn&apos;t satisfying enough, their staff has been incredible every time we&apos;ve gone in, pre and post-pandemic. They&apos;ve always been really excited to answer questions about their breads and are really knowledgeable about what&apos;s happening in the bakery and kitchen there. During these crazier times, they&apos;ve continued to be really friendly every time we&apos;ve picked some food up. You&apos;d think there&apos;d be a bit more edge with so many changes to the rules and regulations right now, but nope, they&apos;re shifting with the times and still offering up the positive energy that makes us think there are definitely smiles under those masks! Regardless, they&apos;re definitely keeping the smiles in our bellies!

Keep up the great work!"
5,"The breads and takeout I&apos;ve gotten here have been consistently excellent. Some of the more memorable items were fried chicken, which had a rich and complex seasoning I&apos;ve never experienced with fried chicken dishes. The spiced molasses cookie that came with it was equally delicious. Another time, had the anadama miche bread - very unique and you could taste the cracked corn in it.

Wonderful service, consistent quality is what keeps me coming back. I am sad to hear they will be closing soon, and hope that are able return with their reopening."
3,"First I&apos;d like to point out that High Street on Market is located at 101 S. 9th St.
(?).  A friend introduced me to this great take out place (right next to DiBruno&apos;s)    About 2 months ago we had a delicious lunch.   My friend and I  had  Thai style chicken sandwich and it was really great.  (no longer on menu)
Today I was looking for a repeat experience and a friend and I ordered our lunch.   The process was easy and went smoothly.   My friend had ROAST PORK  broccoli rabe, kimchi rabe, provolone, sesame hoagie roll.  Unfortunately she did not enjoy the taste.   I had GRILLED CHICKEN BANH MI  chicken liver, jalapeño, cilantro, cucumber, pickles and I found that somehow the ingredients did not blend together well.   I had the sweet potato salad.  I enjoy sweet potatoes, but they were overwhelmed by the large quantity of raisins and spices.  The salad was overly spiced so that I could not taste the potatoes at all and barely tasted the raisins.  It was more like a chutney than a sweet potato salad.   Most unattractive to the eye and the palate.   Very disappointing.   So one wonderful lunch....one terrible lunch.   I am giving 3 stars.  Hoping for a good experience next time, if not it will surely be my last visit to High Street on Market which is located on 9th. Street."
3,"Defintiely not what one would expect.
This restaurant is quite competent, my son had a grilled cheese and mushroom soup, well executed, but... different.
I&apos;d ordered 2 reubens, and it was definitely a West Texas take on deli cusine.  The meat was well, but extremely heavily smoked, very thickly sliced, lightly sauced and garnished.
If you&apos;re up for a West Texas take on Acela Jewish cusine, this is the spot for you.  If you&apos;re looking for the authentic thing, Famous 4ths, Herschel&apos;s, Schlesingers, and several other spots are FAR better choices."
4,"Came in with my boyfriend for the last day of restaurant week and had a great time! 

We were seated right away since we had a reservation and I can not say how  wonderful the staff was. The waitress was on point with service and was so pleasant. We  started off with drinks,  I got the Neshaminy Brewing Company IPA, and my bf got a rum and Coke. 

The drink prices were great too- we have been to other restaurants downtown and rum and coke was like 10,11 dollars, here it was only 7! When I needed a refill  I was shocked that the waitress came over and refilled it for me.... definitely not something I&apos;m  used to but I  liked that touch. 

They brought out bread and butter which was warm and tasted so good to start, and I got the salad, the roasted chicken and carrot cake. My bf ordered thee pork belly, crab spaghetti and he got the lemon dessert. The salad I had was incredibly delicious and had just enough cheese and Caesar dressing, it was a large salad too so I shared it. The chicken was so tender and juicy- I was surprised about how juicy I it was, one of the best chickens I&apos;ve had in a long time. 

The carrot cake though was lacking otherwise I would&apos;ve given this place 5 stars. It was pretty to look at  and looked like it was going to taste good, but it lacked flavor and sweetness like I&apos;m used to. I tried some of the lemon dessert and wasn&apos;t a  fan of that either/ it had a strange aftertaste I didn&apos;t care for. My boyfriend was raving about his meal and was very happy with it."
5,"High Street continues to be one of our top neighborhood spots. Let me explain why. 

First - the food is delicious. From the breads to the sandwiches, cinnamon buns, potatoes with brunch, pastas and pizzas, everything here is great. There&apos;s really nothing that you can go wrong with. 

Second, the people and service. At all High St Hospitality Group restaurants, they really get it. They know what it takes to deliver a great experience and they deliver on it every single time. Even in the midst of the pandemic where things have been forced to change. 

I am disappointed that it will be relocating - and hope it stays in the neighborhood. I don&apos;t know what I will do without their bread in my life!"
4,"I&apos;ve been to High Street on Hudson in NY a bunch of times, and I finally got to try the original Philly location. My boyfriend and I got takeout for lunch one day and the employees were super friendly. The roast pork sandwich was great, and the trottole pasta was incredible. Lemon tart was also excellent. Definitely get that pasta!"
3,"I visited high street for outdoor dining on a Saturday. They had proper distance between tables and the staff was following mask wearing and cleaning protocol. 

On to the food. I heard great things about this place, but maybe the brunch is better than the dinner. I started with the kale salad and and the tuna crudo. The Kale salad was good, not great, it needed a bit more dressing and was lacking some lemon for acidity. The crudo was delicious, well presented and all of the elements worked really well together. 

Next up the Allium pizza. This was awful, it&apos;s difficult to understand how the dish was so bland and the raw onions overpowering the pizza was too much. So much so that I sent it back for a Margherita which was better, but not great. The tomato sauce was flavorless, no herbs, no garlic, no salt. I also had the Trottole pasta which was nothing to write home about. 

I finished with the Chocolate cake and Lemon tart. The dessert is large for the price. The tart was wonderful enough said, perfect sweetness, tartness, and a great crust. The cake left a lot to be desired. There is a thick rich ganache on top which is hard to cut into and the actual cake was soooo dry. How disappointing. 

Final review: 
Kale salad 3/5
Tuna crudo 5/5
Allium pizza 0/5
Margherita Pizza 2/5
Lemon tar 5/5
Chocolate cake 1/5"
4,"Happy I finally got here! Their bread is so lovely we almost asked for more before we started eating the first serving. We started with the charred broccoli and brussel sprouts, and both of them were perfect. The Brussels had a fish sauce on them, which was reminiscent of Sampan/double knot. The high quality of the veggies made me think about vedge (high praise). We also got the short rib lasagna, crabmeat spaghetti and braised short rib. The crabmeat spaghetti was good; the pasta was done well, and there was a decent amount of crab. Our table was a fan of the short rib dishes as well. They also had quite a few American wines/spirits on the menu.

Our server reminded of us of a little kid except he was a grown man with a beard. He kept apologizing for interrupting, but that&apos;s his job. He actually took more time out of the meal prefacing each statement with &quot;sorry to interrupt&quot;. It was funny and somewhat sweet in a weird way.

I heard this place is bomb for brunch so I&apos;d return to try that!"
5,"This past weekend, we ordered a handful of sandwiches and bread for my sons birthday party. There was a slight mix up with the order. I didn&apos;t catch the gentleman&apos;s name who I spoke with on the phone, but he was very professional and quick to make the situation right. I really appreciated his honesty! 

Our family was very impressed with the sandwiches and we will definitely order delivery via their website again in the future. Thanks, again, to High St on Market!!!"
5,"Restaurant came highly recommended by a family member as well as many websites and Yelp. Also featured as one of the best Philly restaurant week deals. It did not disappoint. The restaurant week deal was 3 courses for $35. Considering the main menu items are in the 20s and low 30s this is a great deal.

Started out with some of their famous bread which was laced with orange peel. It was a nice change from plain bread. It was fluffy on the inside with a crispy crust as bread should be. I had the negroni. We also got some apps including burrata, cheese curds with shishito peppers and Damariscotta Maine oysters - loved all of these! The oysters were so fresh, burrata was creamy, and the addition of shishito peppers to the cheese curds was nicely balanced.

For our mains we chose the steak and mushroom and corn pasta. I am a sucker for mushrooms and pasta so I was a happy camper. My husband&apos;s steak was perfectly cooked and tender.

For dessert we tried the banana pudding that was topped with peanut brittle and a Boston cream cake. By this time we were struggling to finish our meal. The banana pudding was good but it was a little thin compared to what I&apos;m used to but flavor was there on both desserts.

The service was excellent even though they were swamped they still managed to frequent our table and refill waters as needed. I liked the outside seating area where we people watched and enjoyed the breeze."
5,"Philly has another 5 star restaurant and it&apos;s in my Old City neighborhood. Why haven&apos;t I been here sooner? A tragic oversight on my part.

I went to High Street for a restaurant week dinner. The meal started off with bread service. The house made bread with a soft butter was outstanding. My entree was pork belly over a bed of black eyed peas. I always enjoy eating pork belly but don&apos;t generally like black eyed peas. But both were surprisingly delicious. At that moment I knew the chef at High Street was truly gifted. My girlfriend had a caesar salad.  But it wasn&apos;t iceberg lettuce. She shared it with me. It had cheese, dressing and croutons on I think romaine lettuce. The proportion of every ingredient was perfect, making this possibly the best Caesar salad I&apos;ve tasted. My entree was the crab spaghetti. I had heard how great it was and it lived up to the hype! Spaghetti with crab, covered in bread crumbs in a delectable crab flavored sauce. It was like no other spaghetti dish I&apos;ve tried and I loved it. My girlfriend had the chicken entree and I tasted that as well. It was a reminder of how good chicken can be in the hands of a master. It was unbelievably juicy. Even my rum &amp; coke was the perfect mix of rum &amp; coke. For dessert we shared the carrot cake and a lemon something. Both were a nice sweet end to the meal but nothing special this time. The service was 5 star quality as well. Everyone from the waitress to anyone bringing out a dish was friendly and made us feel welcome.

I&apos;m looking forward to my next visit to High Street. They understand and embrace the original purpose of restaurant week. To the majority of restaurants these days it&apos;s a money grab, with cheaper dishes, or poorer quality dishes that dont make you want to come back. At High Strret they understand that if u use the discount to attract new customers but then show them how awesome the food is, they will come back again and pay full price. And for a restaurant to survive among all the competition  they will need repeat customers. High street now has another repeat customer!"
4,"A cute, farm to table style restaurant with the best quality meats, bread and veggies. This sounds fancy but I promise you could make it as special or as casual as you&apos;d like. I&apos;ve been plenty of times and for many different occasions. 

My last visit was the day after new years day. If you&apos;re from Philly you know the Mummers Parade can be an all day extravaganza and when I woke up I knew I wanted some good food in my belly. So I walked over to High Street around 8am, alone, and enjoyed a delicious breakfast by myself. High Street has that vibe, where it is like a cafe but you&apos;re being served with an amazing dish and excellent customer service. Sit back, relax, and let them take care of you while you sip your cappuccino. 

For breakfast I would strongly recommend the Forager with mushrooms, egg and cheese. I love their new addition of the early bird special, its a bit more affordable and would have me coming back more frequently. I even splurged and got the old bay hash browns which are amazing! I would suggest getting the aioli on the side because it was a little hard to reach underneath all the potatoes. 

For lunch I am a big fan of the turkey, with green goddess dressing. Everything is made in house with love and dedication. What I loved the most about going to High Street for lunch, which they no longer offer sadly, was their sides. The absolute BEST potato salad, or Sicilian Cauliflower. This style of cookie cauliflower truly changed my life (in a small but significant way). 

One thing to note is that their menu can change frequently and the one online may not be up to date. Regardless you will enjoy what you order!"
3,"I went to High Street on Market spur of the moment for brunch with a friend. Considering it was a Sunday morning at 10:30am, I was surprised we did not have to wait. I ordered the Nutella waffles which were appropriately portioned and perfectly crispy. Of course, more Nutella never hurts!"
5,"Had a great experience last night at HSOM. We had a reservation for 8:15, however the table in front of us was running behind. The server kindly sat us outside for the time being and took our drink order as we waited for the table to open. 

My GF had a glass of wine and I went with the dads vacation cocktail (rye whiskey, jalapeño shrub, and pineapple), which was very refreshing. My only complaint was my server didn&apos;t ask if I wanted another one when I was finished. 

For starters we went with the soft shell crab, which are nice and big this time of year. Also, went with the burrata with jersey blueberries, which was amazing...could have had 5 orders of that alone and been happy.

FRESH FRESH FRESH FRESH! My GF went with the local catch, which was said to be line caught only. I had a bite and it was delicious. They are known for their grains, which were paired perfectly with the fish. I went with the smoked beer can chicken, again which was also awesome. Great scent of thyme and amazing corn bread muffins and jalapeño Mac and cheese to go along with it! 

The bill can definitely get a little pricey here, but well worth it for a special occasion or date night in old city!"
4,"Cute spot in Olde City that serves locally sourced foods - We came here for brunch on a Saturday around 11 am. There was a short wait,  but it wasn&apos;t too bad.  We were seated about 10 min after arriving.  I ordered the BEC (bacon, egg &amp; cheddar). It was tasty and the portions were just right - not too much, not too little. They serve good quality loose leaf tea. The staff were all really friendly and attentive. I&apos;ll definitely be back a second time!"
3,"Cute place with good energy and friendly staff. Lots of interesting items on the menu. Loved the charred broccoli. Scallops and Caesar salad were both good. Ricotta was a generous serving, a bit on the sweet side, but served with some fantastic bread. Pasta in the Crab spaghetti dish was cooked perfectly, but the dish was too salty for me. Maybe I&apos;m just not a fan of the Old Bay seasoning. Good place for a group that likes to share a bunch of small plates."
4,"Refined eats in relaxed digs. High Street on Market is a versatile restaurant in Old City serving creative and approachable American food along with a drink menu that highlights local distilleries, wineries and breweries. A nice place to come with a group of friends or a less-than-high maintenance date (I don&apos;t want to say *low* maintenance but we&apos;re not talking about Laurel or Vetri Cucina here). Everything here is fresh and seasonal and the general energy is open and welcoming. While the food didn&apos;t blow me away, everything was solid at the very least with a few standouts along the way. 

Came here with the parents and bf at 8pm on a Friday night. Though it feels casual (wear whatever your heart desires), don&apos;t underestimate what the kitchen is capable of. Normal tables, high tops and booths, but make sure to make a reservation if you plan to come at peak time, as High Street isn&apos;t too big of a space. 

The drinks at High Street are just as noteworthy as anything else here. For starters, there&apos;s clearly been a huge effort here to feature local distributors. I hadn&apos;t heard of most of the breweries, wineries and distilleries on the menu. Now, I&apos;m not sure how excited I am by Pennsylvanian wine, but again, I appreciate the effort. I&apos;ve now discovered quite a few new bourbons and ryes that I&apos;d like to sample in the future and I can do so as a proud Philly girl.

Low key, High Street has an outstanding mixology program. All cocktails, across the board, are fantastic. Creative, delicious and executed flawlessly. I went into the evening expecting to their three-for-30 deal (one cocktail, one glass of wine, one digestif) but I couldn&apos;t get enough of the mixed drinks here. Between the four of us, we sampled most of the (small but mighty) cocktail menu. My first drink was the Dad&apos;s Vacation (dad&apos;s hat rye, cucumber-lemon-jalapeño shrub, pineapple), tied for my favorite of the night. That shrub is a thing of the heavens. Sweet, spicy, paired perfectly with the rye. A wonderfully transitional drink.

The bf&apos;s first drink (and my second) was the Four Leaf Laura (st. george terroir gin, raspberry cordial, lo-fi amaro, lemon, egg white), which was reminiscent of a Clover Club. And now that I&apos;m seeing the name, perhaps this was a subtle nod to one of my very favorite classics. Something about gin, raspberry and egg white just make for an excellent flavor profile--impeccably balanced and tasty as heck. 

The other two cocktails our group tried were the All the Colors (créme de violette, green chartreuse, bluecoat gin, cherry herring, lime) and the Bitter Queen (don ciccio limoncello and amaro ferro-kina, lemon and sugar). Both very creative and interesting. I preferred the All the Colors but both were yummy. 

Food-wise, there&apos;s a nice mix of everything. Nothing too exciting or daring but all-around well-executed and satisfying. Splitting small plates is a nice route, as even some of the entrees are quite shareable. Dishes are fresh and seasonal, everything feels very local and homey. Eats, below:

Pennsylvania Meats and Cheese Board: A
Thought it took awhile for this to arrive (more on that later), everything was delicious. Two of the three cheeses were a bit milder than what I typically prefer, but that&apos;s not their fault. Still tasty. All of the charcuterie was delicious. The scrapple, though certainly not the healthiest option, was a fun change of pace. Don&apos;t forget to make use of the onion jam. 

Roasted Carrots w/ crispy polenta: A-
Pretty straightforward, not too exciting. Seasoned well, paired nicely with the spinach and pine nuts. The crispy polenta was just okay and left much to be desired--if done correctly, it could&apos;ve added a lot to the dish.

Crispy Mixed Vegetables w/ chow-chow, white bean hummus: A-
Basically glorified vegetable tempura. The presentation is a bit odd: a tiny cup of fried veggies and a large plate of hummus served on the side. Someone in the kitchen should perhaps adjust the proportions here. The vegetables themselves were nothing special but the hummus was quite tasty. I&apos;d request extra bread. 

Beet Salad: A
Yummy and fresh. Came with some candied walnuts and a whipped dip. Tried and true combo of flavors and textures.

Steak &amp; Potatoes: B+/A-
We ordered this medium rare and it was solid, not outstanding. More straightforward than I was expecting and the steak was just a hair too salty. Beautiful presentation, though, and the shoestring potatoes made for a fun take on a classic. The sauce beneath the potatoes was tasty on the steak but too heavy for the potato laces themselves.

Small note on service: touch-and-go, though our waitress was super helpful and friendly. We just waited a comically long time for our first plate (the meat/cheese board) to arrive, which felt silly at the time given nothing actually needed to be cooked to prepare the dish. Our waitress did apologize, citing that the kitchen was backed up. It&apos;s a small operation, though, so don&apos;t want to fault them too much."
4,"Great place for brunch and I&apos;m super glad I brought my mom here with me when she visited. 

We came in on a holiday actually and it seemed many people had the same idea we did as the amount of people picked up exponentially after we got there.

The place is charming, but quite small so ideal part would be max 4-5. Now that it&apos;s summer, there are a couple of tables outside but inside was great for us. 

For breakfast, we got the sourdough waffles with rhubarb compote, the Italian market breakfast, and a side of the old bay potatoes and bacon. I loved the sourdough waffles and the in combination of the seasonal tartness of the rhubarb, ah divine. I definitely snitched a lot off of the Italian market breakfast bolongna, broccoli rabe and eggs. And of course the old bay potatoes! I loved the seasoning and they were the perfect amount of crisp and soft complimenting each other. Although I never met a potato I didn&apos;t like, these are a must try.

Eager to come back again. And as always their bread is amazing, I always go to HeadHouse farmers market to buy their bread or snag a pasty on Sunday&apos;s."
