5,"Ordered: Macarons (Matcha, Pistachio, Milk &amp; Honey, Almond Praline, Honey Lavender, Rose Lychee, Mango, Dulce de Leche) ($2.50 each)

I come here every time I&apos;m in Philly to satisfy my craving for their delicious macarons. I&apos;ve tried the majority of the flavors they offer and I can definitely say that the quality and taste surpass all others. They have so many different flavors that you&apos;re bound to find a few that you love. My favorite flavor is definitely Pistachio, but not far behind are Rose Lychee, Honey Lavender, and Matcha. Not only is this my favorite macaron place by far out of all the ones I&apos;ve tried on the East coast (and I&apos;ve tried more than I can count), their service is outstanding! This time I ordered through Uber Eats for pickup. I was excited to have their macarons again, but was blown away once again by their service. They are the only place I&apos;ve gotten takeout from during COVID that seals their boxes for orders made through delivery services with tamper evident stickers. This way their customers can be sure their food hasn&apos;t been tampered with, which may be a concern when using delivery services. Although this may seem like a small gesture, it shows that they truly care about their customers and want to provide them with the best and safest experience especially during these times. Definitely recommend coming here for their delicious macarons and pastries, but more importantly, to support a small business who cares about their customers!"
5,"ICI macarons....it&apos;s the first time I went since COVID, 2nd time ever I bought macarons from them. You can order online and pick up in store. They have a counter with shield up and hand sanitizer right next to it so, pretty good covid measures.

The macarons are delicious and I got 7 flavors this time, the vanilla, pistachio and rose&amp;lychee are as tasty as usual. The orange blossom is perfect. The strawberry and hazelnut are good as well but their flavors are a bit too intense for me. What I am unsatisfied about, both last time and this time, is the earl grey macaron doesn&apos;t really taste like earl grey. The flavor of the tea is too faint and it really just taste like a mild chocolate macaron. It might be a personal preference thing tho. 

Everything&apos;s tasty and ordering is easy. If there&apos;s anything to complain about, it&apos;s that the macarons are expensive and I can&apos;t find any promo code....but yes, I&apos;m still going to buy a dozen of them or so every time I&apos;m near the cafe."
5,"I&apos;m honestly upset that it took us so long to discover ICI, especially when we live so close! I think they&apos;ve upped their pastry game during COVID, and everything we&apos;ve tried so far is great. My favorite savory item is the mushroom cheesesteak pastry. I&apos;m certainly not a vegetarian, but this thing makes me forget all about meat... Their cruffins (croissant/muffin) are also really good and stuffed with different tasty fillings. Actually haven&apos;t tried any of their macarons, but I&apos;ll give it a shot the next time I don&apos;t fill myself up on the pastries."
5,"I love their macarons! They are fresh and a large size so I find even just one to be satisfying. Their pastries are amazing as well. I&apos;ve enjoyed the Bavarian cream croissant muffin thing they have, it&apos;s perfect for one. Their service is always very friendly and you can get a hot coffee beverage to go as well made with quality beans. 

They are currently only open Fri, Sat Sunday and depending on the time of day you might have a little wait. That said, you&apos;re across from the Betsey Ross house and on a beautiful block so lots to look at while you wait."
5,"an updated review:
Just letting everyone know that amidst the hardships of COVID, ICI is standing strong and SO consistent with their amazing macaroons! 
I&apos;ve stopped by like a million times the past week and today to pick up these beautiful little gems! chewy, sweet, and so fragile, these macaroons are literally the best in the whole city. 
my favorite is earl grey! i also love fig, milk and honey, and chocolate, but i always make sure to pack at least 3 earl greys each time. fabulous!"
4,"Updated for Covid:

They are only open on the weekends: Friday, Saturday, Sunday. 

You are not able to go in which was a relief considering it&apos;s a small store. 

They have the door closed and have created a walk up takeout station. The menu is posted on the window on the right. Other pastries can be seen from
The window on the left. They have hand sanitizer on the counter. 

The employees were minimal and they were wearing masks. 

There were lots of flavors of macarons available. They weren&apos;t limited in any way because of covid. There were some new flavors that I don&apos;t remember. 

They close at 5 and we got there at 3 on a Saturday and there was still a good selection. We got two chocolate croissants and 14 macarons which cost $45 which is insane but we don&apos;t come often so I sucked it up. 

The one downside to ordering this way is that I couldn&apos;t see what all of the flavors looked like since they were inside in the counters. I wasn&apos;t really paying attention as he picked them up because I wanted to keep things moving and not monopolize the takeout window or the employee&apos;s time by looking as he picked up each macaron. So when we got home, it was hard to know which was which. Some we didn&apos;t know until biting into them. I would rather be safe and healthy and know that people aren&apos;t in and out of the store all day so I would take this over the alternative. 

I just wish there was some way for us to know which was which once we were home. Maybe a color print out of all of the macaron flavors that go home in your bag with you so you can tell which is which? Some other type of labeling system? At $2.50 per macaron I don&apos;t think it&apos;s asking too much to have something like this considering the circumstances we are in. Some flavors I didn&apos;t like at all and my husband did so we chose totally different macarons and when we got home, we were guessing which was which. A printout would be a welcomed solution to this. 

The flavor and texture were fabulous as always. The service was quick and friendly. The preventative measures taken again covid were on point. I felt safe ordering from here. The price is still a bit high in price. It always is. The chocolate croissants could use more chocolate."
5,"This place is FANTASTIC, the chef&apos;s hands have been blessed from the man above. During the pandemic they are only open Fri-Sun, but you can preorder and you should. The most popular pastries are sold out at least a day in advance, so plan accordingly or you&apos;ll be sorely disappointed. There are also two small tables outside so you can enjoy your food.

The croissants are perfection. I got 4 things, the Almond Banana Chocolate Croissant, Mocha Chocolate Cruffin, Lemon Meringue Crossiant Tart, and Pineapple Shortbread cookie.

The Cruffin is delicious, flakey, and the mocha chocolate cream is fluffy and just the quantity to let the croissant shine!

The Twice baked chocolate almond banana croissant is sooo good. My two favorite croissants are chocolate and almond, so mix them together with ripe bananas and I&apos;m in heaven. This is a MUST.

The lemon meringue croissant tart is pretty, but tastes even better. The lemon curd has the right amount of tartness and that fluffy meringue on top just brings it all together. I was sad when it was gone.

I didn&apos;t care for the shortbread cookie, so I won&apos;t get that again, but otherwise I&apos;m sold.

Overall:
Chocolate Mocha Cruffin 5/5
Almond Chocolate Banana Croissant 5/5
Lemon Meringue Tart Croissant 5/5
Pineapple Shortbread Cookie 3/5"
4,"There are so many varieties of macarons you see upon entering. Some flavors tasted a little bit stale but some are fresh. The good ones have good  texture and good amount  of fillings. Decent size.

The pastries are by the register. All of them look very inviting. They have innovative croissants such as peanut butter and jelly. Lots of peanut butter. I tasted the jelly at my last bites.

Kouign Aman: apple pie is filled with sweet small dices of sweetened apple. It&apos;s like eating apple pie. THe lemon cream cheese   KA is ok. I didn&apos;t taste the lemon curd until the last bites.

Nutella pudding crioche has lots of fillings but I didn&apos;t taste the signature Nutella flavor.

All of the croissants have great crunchy exterior. 

Cruffins are ok, not much  cream fillings."
5,"Well this is embarrassing. I put it up all those photos last time I went to buy six croissants and single-handedly ate them. Today I went but neglected to take pictures before I ate all the croissants I bought today as well the shop has macaroons during the week but croissants macaroons and other pastries on the weekends. Owners are very nice and have socially distant take-out options available. There&apos;s also outdoor seating if you want to stay and have coffee with your baked goods. Their pineapple shortbread was basically similar to a pineapple cake from Taiwan. We really enjoyed their mushroom cheesesteak croissant, Which was generous with ingredients and very full of flavor. The Masha craft and was also a specialty item that was bursting with much a flavor. If your PB and J Fan definitely do not miss the PB and J croissant. The only thing is I prefer my Allman croissants without the top white beach layer which is what they do here, but everything is so delicious it&apos;s just a matter of personal preference. Highly recommend supporting our small local business and these difficult times and the lovely owners."
5,"The Earl Grey macaron is delicious and not too sweet! The tea/Bergamot taste could be a little stronger but that is my personal preference. 

2 macarons for $5.4 is a reasonable price.

Service was quick and efficient."
4,"Such a cute little cafe. I came here to escape the rain one early evening and it was the perfect place to just have a quiet moment to myself. 

Whenever trying a new cafe, I always order a cappuccino to gauge the ability of the barista. Let me tell you, ICI didn&apos;t disappoint -- it had been awhile since I had a good espresso drink so I was very pleased. My only complaint would be that they only serve cappuccinos in 8 oz servings because it was so good! 

I take clay classes at the studio nearby and usually have some time to kill before class starts, so I&apos;ll definitely be back soon."
4,"Finally made it to this cute French-inspired bakery in Olde City. The young man behind the counter provided excellent service and patiently answered all of our first-timer questions. We didn&apos;t try the coffee concoctions, but the baked goods were pretty good. We sampled: various macarons, almond/banana/chocolate croissant and the plain and apple kouign amann (puff pastry butter cake).

The croissant and kouign amann were as delicious as they looked--flaky, buttery, crispity outside and pillowy interior (forgot to take a photo before going in). We agreed that the banana in the croissant was a little too sweet (maybe from overripe banana), but the dark chocolate was perfect. 

The macarons, while very good, were not the same as you might get in France. The thickness of the exterior and filling was perfect, however, the shell did not deliver that crispy bite that just makes a French macaron the perfect treat. They do have a wide variety of flavors. 

The $1.25 per macaron will cost you a bit less when you purchase a certain number (7 or 8, can&apos;t remember), and even less when you buy a large amount (40? I think)"
5,Loved this shop! So many macaron varieties to choose from. They were fresh and delicious. I think my favorite was the salted caramel. I also had a caramel latte and it was yummy. The workers were very friendly. I&apos;d love to come back if I&apos;m in the area again!
5,"I was craving for a good hot chocolate and stumbled upon this gem while roaming alone on the streets of Old city on a Sunday evening. Their hot chocolate is rich with perfect sweetness unlike many places that offer a watered down extremely sweet version (which I hate). 

Both guys at the counter, one taking the order and the other making it, were super friendly. 

I&apos;ll be back to try some of their macarons - which they are known for and have a pretty wide selection of."
5,"These macaroons are amazing!! So many different flavors. Very unique flavors that you won&apos;t find elsewhere. 

I stopped in to pick up a box of macaroons as a gift and couldn&apos;t help getting some for me also and wow I wish I got more. They were super fresh and flavorful. I already can&apos;t wait to go back and try more. 

The cafe is really cute also and the staff are friendly and give great recommendations."
4,"I live clear across the city and have come here exclusively for their cruffins (which they only serve on the weekend). Everything is made fresh - so if they sell out, they&apos;re out! I&apos;ve come at 10 am and they&apos;ve been completely out before, other times I&apos;ve come at 5pm and been lucky! It&apos;s just the luck of the draw. My two favorites are the matcha and the coffee. I&apos;ve yet to try the coconut since that matcha has my heart. 

I haven&apos;t actually tried their macaroons only because I stuff my face on cruffins. But I will definitely be back! 

It&apos;s not cheap - but it&apos;s worth the cost imo."
5,"Best macarons I&apos;ve had in the city. Nice shell with chewy interior. They are bursting with flavor and have a full variety of flavors to keep you busy. Our favorites are pistachio, lavender and honey, lime basil, and passion fruit. The pasties are also excellent and worth checking out! 

Enjoy!"
5,I love macaroons and these were fantastic! Maybe two dozen different flavors to chose from. The mint chocolate tasted like a Girl Scout Thin Mint. Yum. The texture and consistency are spot on. The seem to be slightly larger than typical.  We ordered four and ended up back in line for a few more  They make espresso drinks as well. I ordered a cappuccino which I found to be well balanced and a little fruit forward. Five star service from both of the staff members handling the orders and coffees. Highly recommend.
5,"While walking around exploring my new surroundings for work, I came across with my friend ICI Macarons &amp; Cafe.  Since my daughter is infatuated with macarons, I had to stop and check it out.

You enter a wonderful dark wood room with a center display cabinet completely filled with so many flavors of macarons! A couple of dozen flavors are all stacked on edge next to each other in perfect formation like a marching band or Army soldiers awaiting orders to be packed and enjoyed by the customers. Staff said that they are all homemade in the basement of the building each day.

I decided to go with a dozen, and it was hard to choose what flavors to purchase.  After making one round throughout the whole cabinet, I had to go back for round two and ended up with some repeats.  

When I got home with the macarons, it turned out that my kid already knew about ICI because when she wanted some and my wife did some research, this is where she ended up for the best macarons! Now, my wife knows that I am walking distance from ICI and my wallet will be a bit lighter.

The flavors from the regular to the interesting were all extremely good.  I loved the intensity of the honey/lavender.  A great dessert.

A dozen set me back just about $30.  They are slightly discounted if you buy more than eight, I think. Don&apos;t forget about tax. Definitely worth the walk!"
5,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE ICI.  They are much more than Macarons, they have incredible pastries!  I&apos;ve never had their Macarons (personally not a fan of Macarons  and they&apos;re just an expensive pastry anywhere you go IMO and so small) but I get the same thing every time. Almond croissant. Best almond croissants I&apos;ve ever had so I never change my order. My husband does so I&apos;ve tried lots of other stuff and it&apos;s all great. The pastries are LARGE as THEY SHOULD BE. When you&apos;re paying premium pastry prices, you want to feel like you&apos;re getting your moneys worth and I feel that way at ICI which keeps me coming back. THANK YOU for not shrinking down the croissant sizes like other places do! 
I almost always take things to go but there&apos;s always plenty of seating inside when I&apos;m there. The shop itself is cozy and inviting. The staff is always friendly and they are dog friendly, too."
