5,"When in Philadelphia...getting a cheesesteak is a MUST!  But then its the all-time debate of who has the best cheesesteaks...and my pick is always Pat&apos;s!  

Upon arrival, there was one barely a line which was great!  There are 2 windows to order from.  One window is to order the cheesesteaks and then the other window to order fries and drinks.  I&apos;ve been here many times before and already knew my order--whiz wit!  My usual is cheez whiz with grilled onions.  Btw it is cash only so have cash on hand if you plan on grabbing a cheesesteak here.  My cheesesteaks were made in minutes and then moved to the next line to order drinks and cheese fries.  

The cheesesteak tasted great.  The meat was cooked perfectly and was very juicy and that cheez whiz was covered throughout the entire sandwich.  With each bite you can taste the meat, cheese, and grilled onions.  Delicious!  And the cheese fries were covered in cheese....yassss! It was not just a few fries covered in cheese but all of them has cheese!  And you know that never happens at any other restaurant.  

They do have some outdoor seating so you can enjoy eating outdoors.  There is only street parking so just be on the lookout for parking as you approach Pat&apos;s."
5,"Well during Covid19 what is there to do not much but you can take road trip and grab a great Philly cheesesteak. This one was my sons favorite and mine too the original. Quick to take you please 
bring your cash, it&apos;s cash only but there&apos;s an ATM. I got one with onions my son without but both are so good. Since 1930 it&apos;s been around and I can see why. Be prepared to search for parking and I&apos;d go in a group but enjoy it it&apos;s so worth it!"
4,"Trying several while in town, and I have come to the conclusion it may not be taste as a preference, but rather if you like your meat chopped or more in strands. Flavor comes from the cheese/ toppings added, meat in general is not flavored as it relies on the whiz or provolone. 
I prefer the longer strands vs chopped. Also whiz def makes the entire experience on the saltier/ flavorful side. Cheese fries at the bottom were def saltier than expected. 
Pay in one window, pick up in other, def good ordering system. Has bench seating, first come first serve, but did not have any issues getting a seat"
5,"I&apos;m not one who travels all of Philly, looking for the best cheesesteak. I&apos;ll be honest- I haven&apos;t even tried Geno&apos;s. I was born into a Pat&apos;s family so that&apos;s where I go and I have no complaints!

My mom and I go to Philly every couple months for an appointment of mine and it is always a tradition to sit down to cheesesteaks and cheese fries after. My mom taught me that a Hi-C goes best with this combo and I&apos;ve come to learn that it is delicious!

We always get cheesesteaks wiz wit! I&apos;m personally not the type of person to get anything besides cheese wiz because it ends up being too dry for me. The onions and mushrooms top it off! Their fries are always so warm and delicious and there is cheese throughout! I love that there is cheese on the bottom and that you don&apos;t run out of cheese and have dry fries!! 

I&apos;ve only been here about 20 times in my life but every single time I&apos;m in damn heaven! It is my favorite treat ever when we travel to Philly to get cheesesteak and fries! 

I cannot wait to be back and cannot express my love for this messy delicious sandwich!"
3,"Every now and then I have to try the tourist traps just to see how they&apos;re doing. 

I don&apos;t come here often anymore. Pat&apos;s was the first cheesesteak place I ever came to as a kid. It was a mainstay for me into my 20s. Then I learned that the city actually has other cheesesteaks. 

I&apos;ve had a lot of those other cheesesteaks. My tastebuds have reset. How would those tastebuds react to the Pat&apos;s of today. 

They&apos;re ok. 

They&apos;re just ok now. 

It&apos;s still a good amount of juicy meat. It&apos;s still a half decent roll. 

But it&apos;s no longer special to me. 

Now it&apos;s just an overpriced sandwich that I can get better at 13 different places in the city now."
2,"Thought it&apos;d be cool to have a &quot;battle of the cheesesteaks,&quot; as Geno&apos;s Steaks and Pat&apos;s King of Steaks is directly across from each other. 

We ordered a cheesesteak with provolone and onions. I preferred the cheesesteak from Pat&apos;s over Geno&apos;s, but still disappointed. The cheesesteak wasn&apos;t as dry, but still not flavorful (maybe it was fat juices). The bread got soggy as well. 

This place is cash only. Prices are listed to the nearest dollar with tax already included (no need for coin change). 

Not sure why Pat&apos;s neon signs weren&apos;t on at night on the day that I went."
5,Pats is a great greasy spot for classic chopped cheesesteaks. I got the cheesesteak with American cheese and onions. They are generous with their steak and the bread is excellent. It&apos;s also super fast- I hadn&apos;t even told them my order and my sandwiches were already ready. My only criticism is that they were skimpy with the cheese for a cheesesteak-- you have to order extra cheese. They were a bit dry too but overall super delicious.
4,"First visit to Pat&apos;s, it&apos;s the originator of Philly Cheesesteaks so this was a no brainer.

Ordered the wit onions and cheese wiz which I could be totally butchering. I really do require the instruction sheet or a 101 on ordering these things.

I liked this cheesesteak second best to the three I tried on a short weekend trip.

I liked the bread and the meat but I think I&apos;d order extra cheese wiz next time.

The meat is chopped which definitely seems to be the way I prefer it vs sliced.

Service is top notch, arrived to no line, ordered and was handed the cheesesteak in less than a minute. Serious 5 STAR service, the cashier was also wearing a really cut cheesesteak hat. I may need to Google it, I don&apos;t even really eat meat, or white bread but yet I want a cheesesteak hat (i don&apos;t even bother trying to understand my thought process anymore).

I&apos;d return but there&apos;s another spot I did like better than this one.

CASH ONLY."
5,"Loved Pats!! Loved the workers (who were so friendly, welcoming and funny) as well as the food. Got the steak sandwich with onions and whIz. No wait and once ordered I got the sandwich in less than a minute. The steak was your typically shredded beef for Philly cheesesteaks, which was delicious. The whiz didn&apos;t overwhelm the sandwich at all and the bread was very good. Not too soft and not too hard. Can&apos;t wait to come back soon."
4,"Pat&apos;s sells a good steak. Went down for the first time in two years w my aunt to do a little comparison between the two staple cheesesteak spots. I think that&apos;s probably the best way to enjoy coming down to Pat&apos;s and Geno&apos;s.

Pat&apos;s is by no means the best steak in Philly, but it slides into my top 10 for now. The roll was excellent and the seasoning of the chopped ribeye enhanced the flavors nicely.

A knock against the steak that I would say is that is got colder more quickly than Geno&apos;s. I like when a steak stays thoroughly warm, and the sandwiches heat only lasted so long.

For all the hate both of these spots get, neither are as bad as you hear. Pats reminds me of a how a good Philly cheesesteak should taste: lots of meat, good presentation, strong flavors. For future reference, I&apos;d recommend Pat&apos;s over Geno&apos;s, but it&apos;s really closer than I thought."
3,Came for the history but quite disappointed with how incohesive this sandwich was: unmelted cheese and large pieces of onion. At least you can watch the basketball games at the park while eating.
5,"Pat&apos;s King of Steak or their rival, Geno&apos;s Steak? Each across the street from one another, I had both and the consensus with my two other companions made this one a clear cut WINNER!! The super tender and juicy steak is more chopped up. We added mushrooms, onions, green peppers and provolone. For me, the green peppers and the chopped steak did it for me. I also think the steak was a bit more juicier than the one at Geno&apos;s.

I think it&apos;s just a matter of preference. Both of these places deserves to be named Best Philly Cheesesteaks. How else would you explain people coming from around the world just to try it. It&apos;s been in many Food Network&apos;s shows. 

Come, enjoy and judge for yourself. It&apos;s worth a visit in the heart of Philadelphia."
5,"Forget what the locals say. Pat&apos;s was the best cheesesteak I had in Philly so far. It&apos;s exactly the gooey cheesy one your looking for. They all have good steak, but it&apos;s really about the wiz they use. Pats cheese is the best. Go here and don&apos;t share"
3,"Pat&apos;s is one-half of the draw to Passyunk Square.  Tourists want to experience the infamous cheesesteak rivalry between Pat&apos;s and their counterpart across the street.  Personally, I don&apos;t believe either are the best in town.  However, it was a fun experience that I&apos;d recommend for those visiting the city.  While in the area, check out the historic brownstones and vintage shops.  Don&apos;t be deterred by the line, it moves quickly.  Know what you want, order it correctly.  It&apos;s cash only and outdoor seating. Between the two, Pat&apos;s is my preference.  The meat is seasoned more and there was more of it."
4,"Pats is obviously famous for cheesesteaks. It&apos;s a great place to go for food. I&apos;d like to be able to try many places and compare them all, but for now pats is a great starting point for diving into the land of cheesesteaks in Philadelphia."
4,"I have been going to Pat&apos;s since a little girl with my whole family. We would eat on the benches. I still go there today, although the prices have risen a lot, but the amount of steak remains the same. You have to get the hot sauce on the side.  It hott, bur good."
4,"Ugh.. where do I begin? As an out of towner the first time I was introduced to a Cheesesteak I was brought to Geno&apos;s so for years I only went to Geno&apos;s then I was told that Pats &amp; Genos werent even the best and I needed to go to South Street and find other places, so then I found Ishkabibbles and for years that was my only place to go. 

THEN... I happened to be visiting with my Sister in law and she wanted to get one from everywhere, so I took her to Geno&apos;s and she was like, &quot;What about Pat&apos;s&quot; and I was like Ooh no I dont go there, but we did, and OMG IM SO GLAD...  First off, WAY BETTER than Geno&apos;s and almost if not better than Ishkabibble, Im shocked, because In my mind I was always a Geno&apos;s person, but who needs all the lights &amp; signs (well I guess they do because their sandwich is garbage)  

So now Pat&apos;s will be my forever stop, No drama, no lights, just a REALLY GOOD Cheesesteak!"
5,"Absolutely best cheese steak, fast service, you see a line but don&apos;t be worried moves super fast!  This place has master the science of pleasing there customers.. oh and don&apos;t be afraid of the wiz"
2,"Mehh. This was my first time getting a Philly cheesesteak in Philly and it was okay. My boyfriend and I were on our way to New York from Virginia and decided to do a pitstop along the way so it was like an early grub for us at like maybe 7:30AM. 

I do like how the location looked with the lights and everything but the food itself wasn&apos;t anything spectacular. We ordered the Philly with steak, onions and cheese wiz. I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s because the bread was just cold and I&apos;m sure that&apos;s the way to eat a cheesesteak but I wasn&apos;t into that. 

Maybe I need to try another one next time I&apos;m there or at another location."
5,"After a 7 hour drive, this was everything I had hoped for.  Tasty steak in a very fresh roll, topped with onions and cheese wiz.   Had the cheese fries, too.  Better than I expected, as I&apos;m not a fan of battered fries, but these were really good.

Came in on a Sunday afternoon and only had to wait a few minutes."
