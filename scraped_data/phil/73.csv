5,"Pho 75 is, hands down, the best place to get pho on Washington Ave. Their menu is simple- pho is the only option here (no summer rolls, broken rice, bun bo hue, etc.), but they do it exceptionally well. (Sidenote: my personal pet peeve is when pho places have shrimp pho as an option on their menu. That is not a thing! Luckily, you won&apos;t find it here.) I always get pho with pretty much all the meats, tendon, and tripe. My non Vietnamese husband loves his pho with eye round steak, brisket, and meatballs. Their brisket in particular is always less fatty than other pho places around here.  

Thank goodness they&apos;re still open for takeout during COVID. It takes less than 5 mins for you to order and for them to pack up the food. I would suggest keeping the noodles separate or else they will clump together by the time you get home. It&apos;s also still cash only. Prices are a bit higher now but the pho is so worth it. Anything to keep our favorite pho place open!"
5,Excellent broth. Very flavorful. During Covid they do have indoor and outdoor dining options. Customer service is two thumbs up. New to the area and I will be back again and again.
5,"This is some of my favorite pho I&apos;ve ever had. The broth is so delicious and the portion size for the large is especially worth it for the price. 

I ate there once pre-Covid and was craving pho, so wanted to return recently. 

I ordered for pickup (mainly due to Covid concerns, have not been eating in too much) and the meal was impressively still great to eat even when I got home after a 20 minute drive. They package the broth, the noodles, and the toppings separately so nothing becomes soggy."
5,"I don&apos;t even like Pho and I would drive from north Jersey to Philly just to eat pho75. I can&apos;t even describe the taste so I won&apos;t try. Just come here and try it. Yes, the parking lot is a funking nightmare, but it is so so worth it. Just trust me, I was a nonbeliever before too.

Also get the iced coffee because it&apos;s second best thing on the menu."
4,"Came here on a Sunday with husband, parking lot was jammed since there was a supermarket in the plaza as well. Biden behind the outdoor seating cover you gotta search for the sign. Got seated quickly we both ordered #1 Large came out very quickly since they only have pho on the menu.

Overall I gave the Pho 4/5 meat quality wasn&apos;t the best but it was also only $9 for a bowl a lot cheaper than other pho spots in Philly. I did get that msg after taste but overall it&apos;s a great place to get pho if you don&apos;t want to pay lot for it. Wish they had more appetizer options though."
5,"The pho here hits different!! 

Confession time: I love noodle soups but not for the soup part...mostly just for the noodles LOL. Therefore, whenever I have noodle soups I end up with a big bowl of broth once I finish eating (yes I know I&apos;m the worst). Despite this, I could not resist drinking all the broth while I was here.

I don&apos;t know if it was because I was hungry, it was cold, or I just hadn&apos;t eaten pho in over a year but really this pho was amazing and dare I say some of the best I&apos;ve had! The broth is so flavorful and anything but generic. I came to Philly to eat my weight in cheesesteaks but this pho was an unexpected winner in the best thing I had eaten during the trip."
5,Came from nyc to Philly for the day to visit some places. Decided to come here for dinner before heading back and boy are we glad we did! The pho was amazinggggg. The broth was flavorful and the beef brisket was perfect. I wasn&apos;t even hungry like that when I got there but I ate everything and wanted more. The staff there is also super nice!
5,This is hands down the best place you can get Pho in the Philly area.The broth is rich and deep in flavor. The meat is also fresh and very delicious. Both my non- Vietnamese and Vietnamese friends have tried and loved the Pho here. The service is also very quick.
5,I came here last night and it was probably the best thing I&apos;ve eaten in months. The broth of the pho was just so complex and delicious. It tasted like home and comfort summarized into a meal. Can&apos;t wait to return again soon.
5,"I came here for the first time and was pleasantly surprised. They took our order extremely promptly. All of the waiters were very funny, which was nice. 
Our noodles came out extremely quickly, which is great if you&apos;re particularly hungry. The broth and noodles were all cooked to perfection. 
One thing that may be lacking is their menu. They are known for the Pho noodles, but if you&apos;re coming with people who want other options, this may not be the place right now. 
Overall, I left happy."
5,"We were looking for the best place to get some Pho.  Multiple articles--including Philly Magazine--said the best place for Pho was Pho 75 at 11th and Washington.  We were not disappointed.  It was the best Pho we&apos;ve had in Philly in the 17 years that my husband and I have been together.

There are 2 sizes of Pho: regular and large.  I got the regular and my husband the large.  We ate all of the ingredients, but I would estimate that we could finish only about 1/2 of the broth; there was just so much of it.  

Things to know about Pho 75:

(1) Appetizers are not offered.
(2) Pho is the only entree; you have the option of chicken (all white meat) or several types of beef.
(3) You can get Vietnamese drinks if you want, but they are all non-alcoholic.
(4) It is a cash-only operation.  Tips go in a tip jar in front of the cash register.  Oh, and you don&apos;t get a bill at the table; you must walk up to the cash register to be shown what your total is.  For us--one large eye round and flank and one medium chicken--the total bill was $18.04.  It was worth every penny and then some.

Will we be back?  Absolutely!"
5,"This is a no frills PHO only shop. No spring rolls. Just PHO. We had this on a super cold day and this perfect! 

Soup was clear, well balanced, and full of umami. It wasn&apos;t salty or sweet which some pho places tend to lean towards in NYC. 

The meat was a good cut of eye of round and brisket. The tendon was super tender. The meat ball which I generally don&apos;t eat was peppery and good. 

Noodles were al dente. 

Restaurant was big but busy when we were there. Service was quick and responsive. Would def come back if I&apos;m in the area."
4,"No frills Pho noodles spot in a small strip mall in Philly.

They have noodles and that&apos;s all, no spring or summer rolls, just Pho noodle soup.

I got the big bowl of beef rib eye sliced noodles soup and it hit the spot on a cold day.

Service is attentive and this place is CASH ONLY.

Not sure if it was the Philly Cheesesteak I had prior, or if it was the noodles, I had the stomach virus for a few days.  Strangely, I was the only one in my group of 10 who had such issues.  But next time, I would skip the raw ingredients like the basil, sprouts and jalapeno peppers.  The way they plate and clean their stuff must&apos;ve had some cross contamination of bacteria and germs floating around; just saying.."
5,"Hit. The. Spot. 
I was in town to run the Philadelphia Marathon and after being downpoured on 26.2 miles later, all I wanted was a piping hot bowl of pho. This was it. Fresh, not greasy, generous with toppings, clean taste. No funny business."
5,"A must-try pho spot in Philly. Definitely at the top of my list for amazing beef pho and quick service! Perfect for meeting up with friends for lunch or dinner, or just stopping by the neighboring supermarket on your own!

Atmosphere: Casual seating for around 40-50 on long rectangular tables. Came in around ~6 for a dinner on Sunday evening. The speed of the service is incredible - our food came out maybe 5 minutes max after we ordered. 

Food: Highly recommend the beef pho - the quality of meat is high, and the portion size is large. You&apos;ll definitely feel full after drinking all the broth from one of those huge bowls.

Overall: 5/5 - definitely my go-to pho spot in Philly - so convenient, and incredible pho. I&apos;ll be back!"
5,"Incredible value, the regular is plenty of food for me! It is cash only so be aware of that. Also don&apos;t stress too much about what meat you choose, they are all good."
5,"5Chicken Pho - Simple and Delicious 
5 Slices of Eye Round Steak and Well-Done Flank Pho - Simple and Delicious 
Overall 5 The &quot;hangover cure from heaven&quot; is true, I felt like I could have been coming down with something and the next day felt amazing!

Suggestion: Cash only but they have an ATM"
4,"WOW!!! Broth (soup) is amazing along with noodle and meat!!!

Perfect combination! Noddle tenderness great meat not chewy like other places.

FOOD:   5
SERVICE:    4

*TIP*  If your in hurry or very hungry eat here! Food comes out in 5 min! Bad thing is they only sell noodle soup. Wish at least they had egg roll."
5,"The staff was friendly and efficient in taking our to-go order. The to-go packaging was perfect to customize your pho how you would traditionally for dine-in. We went with the beef pho, as it was considered the most popular, great choice!!"
5,"Very good as always. Comments largely in previous review but had small custom pho with eye round, lean brisket, and flank steak. Meats are always outstanding with a very clean, but thin, broth. Noodles are always really good here too. If you like Vietnamese coffee, theirs is better than most too for whatever reason. One of my favorite places in Philly (along with John&apos;s Roast Pork) for comfort food, and have been a fan for about 17 18 years."
