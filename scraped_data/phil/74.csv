5,"Work has moved to a new location and because of it, I now walk past Tinto every day. A friend of mine and I decided to stop in before commuting back home and we are so glad we did. 
They had a HH special going on: $5 Sangria (YASS), $7 House Wine &amp; $1 Pintxos which were displayed at the bar (see pics for reference). 
For the sangria, they had (2): red and a white and since I don&apos;t discriminate, I tried both and of course loved them both (red a little better though). The $1 Pintxos were Chorizo Pamplona and Egg Salad. I tried them both and they were very good. 
Occasionally, someone will walk around with a plate of some sort of meat. I can&apos;t remember what it was specifically but that was another HH special.

Lastly, to add to the the great HH deals, on a side wall past the bar, there was a table full of different ham, cheese, grapes, olives and nuts - COMPLIMENTARY (Double YASS)!!! The ambiance was nice, the service was great and we loved everything about it. We did say we would go back; hoping things get back to &quot;normal&quot; after COVID and we can enjoy some HH inside again."
5,"We came in just before it was closing, about 20 mins. We were warmly welcomed and addressed by our waiter within a couple mins. He was friendly and helpful as my wife and her friend tried to decide what wine to get. We ended up ordering the Pulpa (octopus), monkfish, and chocolate shrimp on toast. I really enjoyed the latter 2, but the octopus - not that it wasn&apos;t good - it wasn&apos;t as flavorful as hoped/expected. The Gin &amp; Tonic w/Rosemary and Blood orange were 

 Chocolate w/ Shrimp was unique and delicious. Salty sweet, and the toast added a welcome crunch."
4,"Great experience here. We went for brunch, and their entire menu looked so good. We want to go back for brunch again &amp; to try dinner 

Decor inside is worth commenting on. Cool frame displays of wine openers, and walls lined with wine bottles."
5,So delicious and I am a huge tapas fan. Everything was so great especially the octopus. This place was also used to film a movie which is cool!
5,"Had a lovely time dining at Tinto for restaurant week with 5 friends of mine. Just a heads up, they required a credit card when we booked the reservation on Open Table. The setup was spacious enough to not feel like you are dining with your neighbor. Greatly appreciated. Restaurant week menu consisted of two items for the first course, two items for the second course, and a dessert.

- Spanish omelette: it was a little on the bland side to me. The goat cheese cream was what saved it.
- Bruselas: it was a huge portion! The whipped idiazabal was what made it tasty. Perhaps there was more cabbage than Brussels sprouts, but still a good starter.
- Pork belly toast: LOVE their pork belly toast. It was literally cooked to perfection. I wish it came with more than 2. do not miss out on this!
- Roasted pork chop: this was bigger than I anticipated! Good portion alone for a dinner serving. A little on the salty side, but still good.
- Flan: great way to finish dinner. It&apos;s different than your typical flan because it&apos;s made of goat cheese. I think this is why I loved it so much. The huckleberry jam was a nice pairing to give it a tangy taste. Can someone please give me the recipe!?

Some side notes about the meal: they bring out the food family a style. My group shared the first course, but ate our own for the second course. They change your plates and silverware after the first course. They wipe down the table. (Kudos to the staff for being so quick and efficient with the transition!)

Our server was the absolute best! I never caught his name because he was usually at the other end of the table =( He was very attentive and answered all questions that we had. He was very knowledgeable about his wines, gave excellent recommendations on the menu, and even talked about other great places to eat. I had a lovely time at Tinto and didn&apos;t feel rushed to leave. I&apos;ll admit, I initially thought I wouldn&apos;t feel full from tapas, but I left completely satisfied. Highly recommend, especially for restaurant week! Thanks, Tinto!"
5,"I was really craving paella and tapas which is how I stumbled upon this establishment. Much to my chagrin, they only offer paellas sometimes (at the time I went, it has been around a year since they had it on their menu which was a little disappointing). 

I tried the Montadito De Pato (duck toast), Montadito De Panceta (pork belly toast), Brochetas De Cordero (lamb brochettes), and the Pulpo (Spanish octopus). The duck toast seemed to be a popular dish. I definitely really liked the duck and found the black cherry flavor and the toast to really bring in all the tastes and textures together harmoniously. But the spread with blue cheese really ruined it for me mainly because I really dislike blue cheese (but that is only due to personal preferences). The pork belly toast really hit the spot. The pork belly itself was so tender and flavored extremely well. The lamb brochettes turned out really delicious as well (and this is coming from someone who does not particularly enjoy lamb). The octopus was also flavored perfectly but not as crisp in texture as I would have liked.

The service was super helpful and very easygoing. Overall, this is a great place for food and drinks, and I would definitely recommend this place to others."
3,"I was so psyched to have discovered a new tapas restaurant in Center City, but this place fell short of expectation. Granted, I went there during Restaurant Week, which sometimes causes restaurants to take a turn for the worst, but it didn&apos;t seem like this was the root cause of the lackluster food. For the first course, I had meat on a stick that was a little salty and croquettes that were a lot salty. I tried a friend&apos;s brussels sprouts/cabbage order, which was good, particularly the sauce. For the next course, the pulpo was a bit too chewy and the green sauce it came with didn&apos;t really mesh well with it. The second part of the course was a fish in a thin sauce and some garnishing. It was, by far, the best part of the meal. The flan dessert was also good but I&apos;ve never had flan that wasn&apos;t.

Service wise, our server was *excellent*. It had been a while since my friends and I took a Spanish class so it was a bit of a struggle to understand the menu options (the ingredients are listed in English but understanding how they&apos;re prepared takes some deciphering). Our waitress was super patient and popped in at good intervals to check up on us. We also stayed until very late and she didn&apos;t rush us out, even when we were the only remaining diners in the restaurant.

I would go back for happy hour or any other situation where the tapas are discounted, but overall, good but not great."
2,"This review is for the bar only. Stopped in here on a Sat night for a cocktail. I&apos;ve had warmer receptions being pulled over by state troopers on the NJ Turnpike. Wow. Do you dislike your job (or people) that much? Drink menu looked promising, but only one of our two cocktails was good. The other was a twist on a gin &amp; tonic which just didn&apos;t work, despite the cool goldfish bowl glass. About 8:30 on a Sat night and the bar area was almost empty. Huh. Wonder why? See above. Ambience at the bar was also forgettable. Not cozy or warm. Can&apos;t recommend this for drinks.
My wife &amp; I love Jose Garces&apos; restaurants, so we were puzzled by our experience here."
2,"Tinto has a new menu and I don&apos;t love it. Came here tonight for the paella and scallops, left without both. 

1. Pulpo is now thick and over cooked - neither me or my friend finished it. I actually spit a piece out in my napkin

2. Chorizo and beef sliders were OK - nothing worth re-ordering

3. Meatballs were OK

4. Pork belly toast - over cooked and not flavorful 

I used to gather a group and come here often. Don&apos;t think I&apos;ll be back. 1 star for a roof over our head and a second for the sangria."
5,"I came here for restaurant week and the $35 for 2 firsts, 2 seconds, and 1 dessert was a great deal considering the quality and novelty of the dishes!

We started with a classic manchego plate - good, but unmemorable compared to what came next.  The strawberry gazpacho with crab was incredible! Savory, sweet, bright, refreshing, perfectly balanced. The brussels sprouts and cabbage salad with walnuts was also incredibly tasty - crunchy, creamy, with no trace of cruciferous vegetable flavor.  

We then moved on to a wildly innovative dish - perfectly juicy battered shrimp served on toasted baguette with lemon foam, spicy chorizo buttons, and a sweet but slightly acidic chocolate sauce.  It sounds crazy but it worked.  Next was the grilled octopus (pulpo), which was meaty and served with a red sauce, spring pea puree, and smashed potatoes and was also delicious.  We also ordered two duck dishes: a canneloni with thick and chewy pasta, and a confit served on toasted baguette with maraschino cherry. I loved the take on the classic duck and cherry flavor combo, and still remember the intense whiff of duck when I first cut into the meat. 

For dessert, there was yogurt panna cotta with strawberry gelee, basil sorbet, and a flaky Spanish cookie.  The second dessert was a dense flan with peppery berry jam and crispy puffed rice. 

Stuffed and satisfied from a spectacular meal, it wasn&apos;t until later that night that I realized we never got the jamon serrano dish! Though I realized I didn&apos;t miss it in comparison to the more innovative dishes we tried.  I can&apos;t wait to return to Philly to dine at Tinto again!"
5,"Basque region inspired tapas, and fuller sized entrees with an extensive wine list of Spanish wines. 

When debating on what wine to order, our waiter inquired of our likes and desired wine body and palate&apos;s he made a few suggestions and brought out several options to sample until we were satisfied.
Customer service 5-Stars!

Food ordered:

Camaraones en chocolate - 5 stars
(Pescatarians be aware that there is sausage in this dish, make sure to order without so you&apos;re pesca-happy)!  If you&apos;re into savory/sweet dishes and or Mexican mole you&apos;ll love this seemingly mismatched pairing. 


Monkfish con Alcachofas - 5 stars
A little spicy not overwhelming, perfectly seasoned and prepared. A great dish to share as monkfish is quite filling.

Pulpo- 5 stars well seasoned and tender accompanied with two plated sauces. Zero complaints!"
5,"I&apos;ve been to Tinto three times, most recently as a part of a bachelorette dinner, and two out of those three times I&apos;ve been vegan. AND although there is nothing strictly vegan on the menu, I&apos;ve nevertheless had excellent dining experiences on each visit. .

Tinto is probably more well known for meat and seafood, but they also make really yummy vegetables (that can be adjusted to be vegan - while still being delicious)! For my last visit I had veganized versions of a bean dish, mushrooms, and shaved brussel sprouts - they were all fantastic. The mushrooms are INCREDIBLE. They&apos;re some of the best mushrooms I&apos;ve ever had, and I eat a lot of mushrooms. 

The non-vegans with me loved their meals as well - some highlights were the octopus, calamari sandwich, and duck and ham sandwich. 

Regardless of your dietary needs or preferences, tinto is a safe bet."
4,"Came for restaurant week ($35 per person for dinner) with my boyfriend, and would love to come back! So many other tapas I&apos;d like to try! 

Atmosphere: Relatively dim lighting (the menu was a bit tough to read), but made for a pretty romantic and cozy ambiance! All the food and drinks came out very quickly.

Food: surprisingly, we really liked the arugula salad - probably one of our favorites! We also really enjoyed the octopus. The only downside of the meal was the paella we ordered - the overall taste was quite bland, and you couldn&apos;t taste the different ingredients mixed in; would not recommend this. The cheese option for restaurant week also came in a very small portion, along with a few slices of apple - not the best bang for your buck, but it was tasty.

Overall: 4 / 5; great ambiance and wine, and we loved a few of the tapas. Would come back, but will need to be a bit pickier with our choices next time!"
5,"I almost never give 5 stars but this place blew all expectations out of the water. It is a MUST VISIT for a nicer dinner in Philly. 

I have trouble choosing which tapas to not recommend, they were all absolutely delicious. The standout favorites among my group were the pork belly, the duck confit, the truffle mushrooms, the Brussels sprouts, the albondigas meatballs, and the chorizo sliders (if you can handle the spice!). But really, everything was delicious. 

Dessert may have been the best part though, especially if you have a major sweet tooth like I do. Chocolate mousse was EXCEPTIONAL, but the vanilla almond tart was also delicious, and quite unique. The tart came with a sour cherry sauce and olive oil ice cream, so you definitely need an adventurous palette, but it knocked it out of the park. 

Lastly, get the white wine sangria pitcher!! Enough for 5 and again, impeccable. Great food, drinks, dessert, service, one of my new favorites!"
5,"Came here for happy hour on a Friday afternoon. The bar area was a bit crowded but the bartender moved a couple over so we could have seats by the window bar area. We got a bunch of different tapas and both had sangria. The white and red sangria&apos;s were refreshing :) The tapas came out fast and were all so delicious! We got pork belly, chriozo, mussels and chriozo/beef burger sliders. The mussels tasted fresh and we&apos;re amazing! The pork belly so tender and decadent. The chriozo was my least favorite it was good but alittle salty for me. The chriozo/beef sliders were also juicy and seasoned well. The service was excellent and I would love to come back to try their dinner menu one day!"
5,"The food here is EXCELLENT. You can tell that they put a lot of care into the food by the flavors and the taste of the food! With that being said, this is a tapas place so portions are a lot smaller. They are definitely a quality or quantity kind of restaurant. Some come with only 2&apos;pieces. We did learn however that some pieces are modifiable so that there will be enough pieces for everyone at your table. 

I came here with a group of 7 people to celebrate a friend&apos;s engagement. The staff here is nice and very helpful. Although our waiter was kind of pushy and a little aggressive, noting that each person should order 2-3 dishes or more and kept giving us looks when we ordered less, he was still helpful in letting us know that we can modify some pieces. 

My friends and I ordered the scallops for 2 people (comes with 4 pieces of scallops) to share as not everyone in the table was a fan of seafood. I wish we got more of these because they were soooo good! The flavor was PERFECT! We also got the pork belly toast for 7 people which was really good! It came with a thick piece of pork belly on each toast with green apple, chickpea purée and honey glaze. 
Other things we ordered were 2 orders of Pulpo (octopus), 1 red Chile braised chicken (with Swiss chars and Quail egg), 1 roasted pork chop, and 2 grilled wild mushrooms. 
The braised chicken was so soft and the red Chile gave it just the right amount of flavor. The pork chop was the most tender pork chop I have ever had. It was definitely not over cooked like most restaurants do and I really appreciate that.
I could definitely eat those grilled wild mushrooms allll day - they were so flavorful and good!

All in all our experience here was good and the food was all so good! Every dish was great and none of them disappointed us. I think the amount we got was just enough for 7 girls."
4,"Excellent and tasty food. Friendly and professional staff. The waiters and bartenders were very friendly and knowledgeable and helpful. The drinks here are really reasonable and delicious. It&apos;s a very cool place for cocktails and tapas, the employees are really good with service and very accommodating. The food is tad expensive but its worth paying for."
4,"We came here on a Monday, with 15 mins remaining of happy hour and the place was empty! The hostess was very sweet and accommodating as we sat ourselves at the bar and ordered a couple of wines and some $5 tapas. My husband and I both had the red house wine at $7 each. The happy hour menu also offers a white house wine for the same price as well.  The house red was a tempranillo that was decent and easy to drink. As for the tapas, we shared three plates of: the Montadito De Mejillones, the Montadito De Pancita and the Chorizo a la Plantxa. The Montadito de Mejillones is a bunch of preserved mussels laid atop two pieces of toast, and was very refreshing and flavorful, we really enjoyed it. The Montadito de Pancita was served with two thick slices of pork belly laid atop two pieces of toast and was excellent and absolute must. The Chorizo a la Plantxa was kinda disappointing, literally four pieces of sliced sausage on two skewers and most of it was burnt. Other than that, everything was great, looking to more future happy hours at Tinto!"
5,"I came here for restaurant week and I was also celebrating my anniversary with the Mr.! This is the perfect place for a date or more romantic dinner! Especially since it is tapas style and you can share plates/try different things. Friends and groups are definitely welcomed, but the ambience with candlelight lighting (and wine bottle selection!) have total date vibes for trying to impress someone.

Restaurant week First Course: We ordered Serrano ham, manchego cheese, olives, and the paprika garlic chorizo! Wow, the chorizo was flavorful and seasoned perfectly. All items complimented each other. The first course is served with a little bread too

Second course: We orders the duck montadito, Pulpo (octopus!), the green beans, and beef brochettes. The beef brochettes were tender beef skewers, and octopus was on point in their thick marinade. The winners for the course was surprisingly the duck! I don&apos;t believe this is a regular menu item but if you get the chance, definitely order it!! It was incredibly rich and served on a small piece of baguette with a sweetened cherry. All the flavors complimented each other and reminded me how delicious duck can be when done right! Last, the green beans may be the best green beans I ever had. They were served with almonds, in a balsamic vinaigrette-oil with additional seasoning that were absolutely delicious. You know if they make green beans as it&apos;s own dish, then they have to be pretty incredible. 

Dessert: goat cheese flan and an ice cream yogurt fruit dish! Absolutely delicious, light and sweet. We were also served two sweeten pears at the end of the meal as a last goodbye treat.

Overall the food was incredible! Service was really quick, if I had to give one negative it is the size of the tables. Especially with tapas, there were a lot of plates and little space. Everything else was stellar.

When making the reservation, I noted it was for an anniversary dinner... to my grateful surprise the restaurant gave us complimentary champagne for the celebration! It was greatly appreciated and thoughtful. Restaurants that go that extra step is why this place deserves the five stars!"
4,"Tapas on tap! 

What a great experience at Tinto! I came here for a group dinner on a weeknight and it&apos;s just what we needed to break up the week haha. It&apos;s located west of Rittenhouse park but I didn&apos;t risk looking for parking anywhere close. From where I found parking, I ended up walking about 15 minutes between parking and the restaurant. I think if I had more time on my hands I would&apos;ve tried my luck closer to the restaurant, but overall parking in the area is sparse. 

Our group of 10 was seated in their private space up stairs. The room was well lit and the table seatings was perfect to allow for good flow for conversation.

The menu is mostly small plates, and Tinto being a Garces restaurant, it was all Spanish inspired.

I started off the evening with a great arugula salad that was dressed with just the right amount of dressing. The salad also included bits of cheese puffs - savory and warm without feeling too heavy. 

Next was this roasted sweet potato dish that was covered in a spicy blend and served with a chipotle cream sauce - I liked this dish a bunch, got my senses tingling! 

I ordered a vegetarian paella as my main dish and it was really well developed! There was equal amounts of savory and comfort and I ended up cleaning up the whole plate! 

I passed on dessert since all the small plates had me satiated but if I had a larger appetite, I would&apos;ve definitely entertained the idea.

Overall the service was great and the waiter we had was well versed in all the Spanish wines. I was drinking the red but switched to white later in the evening and each selection was very enjoyable. I found that they were able to accommodate for my vegetarian needs and I still felt all the dishes I was served were great! 

Looking forward to another excuse to come back here and maybe hit up the dessert menu first hehe!"
