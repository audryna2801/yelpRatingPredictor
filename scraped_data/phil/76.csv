5,"I&apos;m not a big foodie dork but got dang if this ain&apos;t the best BBQ in Philly... me and my girl would go a few times a month pre-Covid when we wanted to pretend we were royalty. She would get the Friend Green Tomato BLT, I would get ribs and brisket, then we would share beans, fries, mac n cheese and cole slaw. Always good beers on tap and the list is always up to date, I&apos;ve never ordered a beer they had just run out of. It&apos;s one of the only restaurant I bent my personal rules to go to during the pandemic and it&apos;s still as good as ever. The staff is awesome and knowledgeable, I&apos;ve seen them deal with a lotta dumbos (I mean it is smack dab in old city) in stride and I just love it there."
5,"The best pub for veggie, vegan, and meat eaters alike. I love their vegetarian selections, the subs and burgers are incredible - if you go, you must get the Brussels! They also have great drinks! The outdoor seating on the street is really great, but their food also travels well for takeout and/or delivery. One of my favorite local spots for comfort food!"
5,Went here last night after going on a ghost tour in old city they didn&apos;t have any tables left outside and no indoor seating but I was craving a poboy so we waited. Luckily the waitress was very friendly and accommodating she offered me a beer while we waited which was nice not only that she set us up a table on the sidewalk and charged my phone for me since it died that&apos;s what i call service you rock Stephenie We&apos;ll be back really soon. Thank you!!!
1,"Came here a few days ago, and this service was not good. I ordered the Khyber Burger; which was listed for $14 on their menu with a picture of the burger and fries, my friend also ordered a sandwich that appeared to come with fries.

When the waiter brought out our food, it was just the sandwiches! When I asked him if my burger came with fries, because the menu had a photo of a plate with fries he seemed annoyed. I can&apos;t possibly be the only person who has ordered the burger and assumed it came with fries, because it was $14 and there was a photo with fries in it on the menu. He begrudgingly brought me out some fries that the restaurant comped, which was good, but the service was not good at all and we waited a long time for food and service. Would not recommend, when there are so many places nearby."
4,"I got the Khyber burger which I really enjoyed - very juicy, fresh bun. I was able to sit outside in the street seating, felt safe, socially distanced. The service was good, very quick and prices are decent. Would go back again!"
4,"Came for outdoor seating during COVID times; the whole old city street is filled with seating for all the restaurants. We looked at an online menu and ordered in person; the food was not bad, but a little bit pricey (to be expected). They have some cool vegan options, like I got the vegan sloppy joe and it was pretty good!"
5,"While I didn&apos;t have a restaurant dining experience here, I feel obligated to tell people about the delicious food and drink! I won a 25$ gift card for OldCity Fest and got a chance to try the pulled pork sandwich and a Tito&apos;s Apple Cider cocktail.

It was the perfect fall season combination of food and drink and definitely satisfied my appetite. 

The pulled pork sandwich was fresh and delicious and the fresh coleslaw topped it off. 

One of these days I&apos;ll have to dine in and try out some of the other items on the menu!"
4,"I think I love this place.  Very cool old building.  Watching the video I was definitely excited to be there.  The banana split craft beer may have had something to do with that.  I was having some difficulty with the draft beer list and that led to some confusion in my ordering and I ended up with the brisket platter and not the brisket sandwich.  The nice bartender had someone bring me out one of the rolls they use with the brisket sandwich.  I wish I thought to ask for a side of the horseradish sauce that comes on the brisket sandwich.  Everything had a nice taste and made with love.  However, a bit pricey, the brisket may have been a touch dry, the roll was probably a little too delicate for a meaty sandwich and the (one) bartender should have been nicer.  With that said, I bet with the horseradish sauce this sandwich is very good."
5,"Though it looks like this spot has some good drink specials throughout the week; I went just for the vegan food options. I cozied you to a spot by the window which has a view of those coming in and the bar. I ordered a small vegan nachos with the vegan pulled pork added. The portion was a nice size for one to eat as a meal. It was so good the green salsa was super flavorful and the v pulled pork was saucy and well-seasoned. Overall, all of the flavors were a hit. I never thought to have pulled pork on nachos, but it work so well."
5,Very cool little bar to visit. The drinks were awesome and they pretty much have everything you could think of. The bartender was friendly and accommodating. I would definitely recommend stopping by if you&apos;re in the area. I didn&apos;t get a chance to try their food but I would look forward to that on the next trip.
4,"Khyber and I have a long history dating back to the &apos;80s. I really loved the place then. And since returning to the city, find it just as much fun. 
You can&apos;t beat Khyber for its beer selection. But more importantly, Khyber still has good food at moderate prices. 
Few clubs endure these days, but Khyber continues to find a way of bringing in newcomers. 
You always feel comfortable here. 
Best to hang out at Khyber on weekdays... weekends tend to be crowded."
4,"Let me say that I think this is probably a great place because they had some of the best fried okra I have ever had. However, they did not have Chardonnay and yet they are a full service bar. My daughter didn&apos;t  care for the chicken rice soup because it was bland with almost zero broth ( it is a soup?) But we all agreed that the okra was DIVINE! I&apos;d eat it every single day!"
1,"I am really disappointed and hate to be leaving this review.  We tried to go weeks ago and the service to even figure out a seat was absolutely terrible and rude.  We were ignored by staff. This surprised me as the service here has always been top notch.  When we were going to order to go instead and finally got the attention of one of the staff they said they no longer have brisket nachos, no substitutions.  Lose-lose.  The days of coming from NYC just for this spot is no more."
4,"Still my go to place for authentic New Orleans poboys. The roast beef is my favorite, but I love the shrimp poboy too. I&apos;m so happy I live close to Kyber!"
2,"My experience at Khyber wasn&apos;t a good one. I couldn&apos;t really figure out the vibe, and the service and food were both quite disappointing. 

I was with a party of six and we arrived at about 5pm for an early dinner. We were there on a Saturday so it was pretty crowded, as expected. During the approximate two hours that we spent there, the music kept fluctuating from soft to loud which definitely made an impact on the overall vibe. I felt like I was continuously changing my voice because I was either trying to yell over the music or trying not to scream into my neighbor&apos;s ear. 

My table started with a few appetizers: Bbq pulled pork nachos, fried green tomatoes and wings. The nachos were alright. The portion is huge so it&apos;s a good choice for a group. I was really excited to try the tomatoes but I actually didn&apos;t like them at all. They were way too salty for me. I skipped out on the wings but a few people at the table enjoyed them. 

My other half and I shared the fried shrimp po&apos; boy for our entree. Another food item that I was really excited for only to be disappointed by. It didn&apos;t have much of a taste to it. I was underwhelmed. The sweet potato fries that I got as a side might have been the best part of the meal and even they weren&apos;t anything to rave about. 

Although our waitress was quick with serving us, she seemed so unpleased with our table and it definitely showed. 

Khyber has made a good name for itself so maybe I just happened to be there on a bad night but regardless, I&apos;m in no hurry to return."
4,"Second time here and both times our waiter has been spot on with recommendations. First time I went with his recommendation of brisket and ribs, which was some of the best BBQ I&apos;ve had in Philadelphia. Second time I went with the hickory smoked beef short rib platter, which was extremely satisfying after a couple happy hour drinks! My girlfriend loves the Carolina BBQ pulled pork as well! 

Great vibes in this place, which serves up some great BBQ right in Old City. A little dark in the eating area, and quarters can get tight by the bar."
5,"The one thing I hate about vacation is when I find a spot that is &quot;the one!&quot; This restaurant is worthy of that title. &quot;Khyber Pass Pub&quot; was on a list of places to eat at in Philadelphia, so I made it my business to get here. From the outside it looks like a small bar, that if you walked to fast you may not even see it. But heading inside, judging by the loud music upstairs, I knew this is a very hip spot. It&apos;s low lit, with a comfortable vibe. It has two floors and a bar on each. Downstairs is the restaurant, where you can eat and socialize. Upstairs is where they have a live band, where you can dance the night away. But dancing would wait because I was hungry. When I got to the hostess stand, I was told to find a seat and I did. My waitress, Mikaela, came over and she was amazing. She was friendly and recommended all the best food. She joked about not knowing about them being on the best spot list. But after a short conversation I ordered the Mac &amp; cheese to start. Those Mac balls were incredible! The were placed on a home made sauce that seemed to bring all the flavor out. I asked for a side of the sauce for my sweet potato fries it was so good. I told her I wanted the burger because it came highly recommend. That recommendation was on point. I didn&apos;t change anything about the burger, I got it according to the menu. I&apos;m so glad I did. The beef was sensational, the bacon crunchy, and the dry cheese complimented the entire burger. Topped off with the pretzel bun and sautéed onions, and you got the best burger in Philadelphia. I will make it my point to come again. Atmosphere, food, and service! Who can beat that?"
4,"I like this bar! Last time I was there it was a little too loud. But I like sitting at the bar.

I LOVE That&apos;s there&apos;s vegan options. I had the vegan bbq sandwich and it was great. They also have the option of sweet potato fries."
4,"Great place for food and drinks. It&apos;s super casual and the staff is kind. 

We came here on at 10pm on Halloweekend. We immediately we&apos;re seated and able to have food/drinks. I loved their Pim&apos;s cocktail! It was ginger ale, lemon and Pim&apos;s. Super delicious. 

We ordered their vegan popcorn for the table and it was tasty. A little oily but I enjoyed the Cajun seasoning. I had the vegan pulled pork sandwich with sweet potato fries. I really loved the fries and the sandwich was pretty good. The texture of the seitan was a little strange but the BBQ sauce was tangy and sweet. The coleslaw on the sandwich was good too. I don&apos;t know if I&apos;ll be rushing back but it was a good meal."
4,"On a Sunday night we were trying to find a late night food spot that was REAL food and not McD&apos;s or a greasy pizza joint. We walked into Khyber Pass and were excited to find out their kitchen was open late!!! 

I went for the pulled pork sandwich with a side of sweet potato fries. It was super good, but in the future I&apos;d opt to not eat it on the bun because the pieces of meat were SO big that they kinda fell out while I was eating.

We were all happy with our food (even the vegetarian with us). I&apos;d definitely come back again!!"
