5,"Having lived in Morocco for some time, I can say that walking into Marrakesh truly felt like being transported back to that country. Everything from the decor to the food to the super dim lighting was super authentic.

We had the 7-course meal which was really fun. I loved tasting the flavors of the bastilla (Moroccan chicken pie, both savory and sweet) and the tenderness of the lamb (I normally hate lamb--too gamey for me)--really brought me right back to Morocco!

Our waiter was fantastic and so hospitable. Unfortunately since we went during COVID, we didn&apos;t get to see the belly dancers perform, but I plan to return when things are back to normal so we can get the full Marrakesh experience!"
5,"Didn&apos;t realize this place was a full 7 course meal but it was a wonderful surprise. The outdoor seating in the street is really well done, cute and creates a vibe that fits the restaurant. 

They&apos;re very accommodating with diets (vegetarian versions) and the service staff was exceptionally nice, polite and caring. 

The food was a lot, a lot. Big portions and many courses so if you come here plan to EAT. They give you lots of variety of sweet and savory. Variety of grains, veggies (and meat if you&apos;re into that thing). 

Really yummy spot and a nice gem in the city"
5,"Had one of the best date nights in awhile last night. Marrakesh had been closed for the past 6 months, and I am so excited it is back in business!

Walking into the restaurant felt like we were being transported to Morocco. It was really nice, since with COVID, any traveling plans we had are pretty much out the window. 

From the start of our meal to the end, the owner was super hospitable and nice. He poured rose water over our hands from a teapot as we washed them and it smelled amazing. Even though the entire meal lasted 1.5 hours, it didn&apos;t feel like it. We were so immersed in the whole experience that time just flew by. The best part of it was, we had the entire place to ourselves, which would never happen pre-COVID, because this place was always packed.

The 7 course meal was delicious, authentic, and sooooo much food. We enjoyed it immensely, and ate till our tummies felt like they were going to burst. Some highlites of the night were:

Three-Salad Platter - Huge platter, and actually serves as three courses. The eggplant was soft and flavorful. The cucumber salad, and carrots refreshingly delicious and help cleanse your palates in between bites of pita and eggplant. 

Spicy Chicken in Cumin Sauce - chicken cooked so tender, it was like eating a steamed white fish. And the cumin sauce was not overpowering, just enough to add flavor to the dish.

Tajne of Lamb with Almonds and Honey - best dish of the night. Slow cooked and only tasting slightly gamey.

Couscous Grand Atlas - a simple dish with couscous, vegetables, chick peas and raisins, but so good.

Except for the owner, we did not see any other staff on site, and it wasn&apos;t before long that we realized this man was putting on a one man show. He was cooking all 7 courses in the kitchen, while playing the roles of server and host. And he did such an incredible job at it too!
 
After chatting with the owner for a bit, he told us with restaurants resuming indoor dining, they are still working on bringing the staff back on full-time. On weekends when it&apos;s busier, he will have more help.

At $35 per person, this was so worth it and so much fun. If you&apos;re looking for an escape or change of scenery for a couple of hours, Marrakesh is a great spot. So bring your biggest appetite, a couple bottles of wine, and some cash because it is BYOB and cash only, and you&apos;re ready to go!

Note: reservations are required, so make sure to call ahead to make one!"
5,"Absolutely amazing!!!! The man who owns this establishment is the most friendly, hard-working, and caring human. Not to mention the food is absolutely delicious!! 

We did the multi course dinner for two and couldn&apos;t have been happier. The food was perfectly spiced, authentic flavors, and substantial enough for leftovers. 

If you are in the mood for something new, you&apos;ve GOT to give this place a try!!"
5,"We love it here. The cozy atmosphere is very welcoming, with warm lighting and vivid Moroccan colors with yummy food. Would definitely recommend this place for a unique cozy  dinner."
3,"I loved their beautiful outdoor seating, the music and the vibe. Such a gem in Philly. I just don&apos;t think the meals are justified. We got FAR too much food for just two people, walked out stuffed and couldn&apos;t take much to go as we were traveling / visiting from out of town. The total bill was reasonable for the amount of food, but I just think that much food and money for two people is ALOT. The food was good. Nothing out of this world. The chicken, however, was my favorite. It was tender and juicy and cooked to perfection. The lamb was good but a little too fatty. Dessert on the other hand was really really disappointing. The baklava is probably the worst I&apos;ve ever had. I took a bite and couldn&apos;t finish it and thought it was because I was so full. I tried to eat it the next day with my coffee and there were (white) sugar chunks in it and it was just pure disappointment.  I expect more of a middle eastern restaurant. 

Lastly, we were unaware that we had to pay in cash without previous warning, and there was a bit of panic to collect the cash at the very end. So beware of that. I would come back for the lovely vibe, and I would recommend trying this place out despite not giving it 5 stars. It might have just been a bad day for the restaurant. I just hope that they work on improving. Best wishes!"
4,"This is one of THE iconic restaurants of Philadelphia. Hard to get reservation, so please please please book in advance. This is one of the few authentic Moroccon restaurants you will come across.  Food is served as big single platter 3-4 person) which may sound weird but in reality one of a kind experience. 
Excellent for celebration of events for small groups upto 25. Price-wise it&apos;s a little on the higher end but its worth because of the unique feel and warmth  of the quality of food.

The 3 salad platter is a perfect way to start your meal.  People who hate carrots will fall in love with it. The eggplant is just wow!
I never had something like B&apos;stella before. Never thought this mildly sweet pie-like preparation can taste this awesome. 
The slow cooked chicken is extraordinarily soft and juicy with bursts of flavour. 
The Tajne of lamb is a rare combination of savour and sweetness of honey. Mouthwatering!! 

Only thing is parking; there is a parking lot near, which is the best option as parking on south street is almost impossible. 
P.S. It&apos;s kid friendly as well!"
2,"Went here for a friends birthday with a group of 8 people. It&apos;s BYOB so make sure to bring your wine! Everything is served family style, so there are no individual entrees. You have two starters and three entrees to share as a group. Food is served on one big serving plate and everyone eats off the plate. You don&apos;t get utensils until the last course so be ready to eat with your hands.

We got the Three Salad platter, B&apos;Stella, spicy chicken in cumin sauce, lamb tajine and couscous. The eggplant in the platter and  the spicy chicken in cumin sauce were delicious but everything else was mediocre, at best. The B&apos;Stella tasted like a funnel cake with chicken underneath. It was basically a chicken pot pie layered with powdered sugar on top, which was not that appetizing. The honey in the lamb tajine was too overpowering, making the meat taste very sweet, which was not that enjoyable. The dessert was also a disappointment. They gave us a fruit basket of apples, oranges and bananas. There was nothing unique or exciting about the dessert. 

I heard many good things about this resturant so I was very excited looking forward to this dinner beforehand. This resturant did not meet my expectations. The food was disappointing. The inside was also unpleasant. The lighting was dark, and not too welcoming. I wouldnt recommend this place, there a lot better options for middle eastern food."
5,"We ended up at Marrakesh after we couldn&apos;t get into Zahav (if you want to walk in there, show up before 4 pm, 5 pm was too late to get in at any point that evening) and did a quick yelp search for somewhere nearby that we could walk.

I have to say, I&apos;m actually glad that we didn&apos;t get in to Zahav because we had such an amazing experience at Marrakesh. First thing to know: Ring the Bell to get in. We stood outside for a while waiting for them to open the door before I decided to ring it.  We were the first ones there when it opened at 5:30 pm and at first they weren&apos;t sure if they could accommodate us without reservations, but when we told them we had just arrived from out of town, they were very kind and squeezed us in to one of the best tables downstairs. They said they were fully booked that night, but if we were able to eat quickly they could get us in.  

With no menus and no prices, we had no idea what we were in for and just went with it.  They told us it would be 7 courses, and 7 courses it was. And this is not one of those tastings where each course is a bite of something.. each course in itself was enough for a full meal.  

The meal starts with them washing your hands in rose water - you are going to  be eating with your hands, after all, so this is the only civilized thing to do.

Courses:
1- eggplant, carrots, and cucumber salad that you eat with pita bread (which they bring out in large tins and you can have unlimited quantities of) - LOVED the eggplant so much I almost filled up on Course 1
2- some sweet chicken pastry thing - we didn&apos;t care much for this one just because we aren&apos;t fans of mixing sweet into our salty
3- chicken on the bone, cooked to such perfection that it comes right off the bone - some of the best chicken I&apos;ve ever had, and that&apos;s saying a lot
4 - couscous and chicken - also amazing
5 - a spanokopita thing
6 - an entire bowl of fruit that we couldn&apos;t even touch - a full apple, banana, orange, grapes, strawberries - does anyone eat this, I wonder?
7 - baklava served with some of the best tea I&apos;ve ever had

Note: We don&apos;t eat beef so they switched out the beef/lamb kabob, not sure which dish they switched.

The bill came and we braced ourselves - and it was $25 per person, with tax and tip (automatically added at 18%), the total was $64. One of the best deals ever.

As we got up to leave, they brought out a big doggy bag with the leftovers from each of our courses wrapped nicely up for us. What a nice touch!  We were hurrying to free up the table as we knew they did us a favor, but they did not make us feel rushed at all, and even wouldn&apos;t open the door to let us out until we were completely fully bundled up (&quot;it&apos;s cold outside!&quot; they said).

Some of the nicest people I&apos;ve ever met, definitely the nicest in Philly, and such an amazing experience overall. Loved it!"
1,"A few major problems with this place. First of all from the second you walk in you feel like they are rushing you. The place closes at 10:30 according to the website and I made a reservation over the phone wanting to come in at 9 as I was driving from almost 2 hours away. Immediately the owner basically begged me to come in at 8:30 or 8:45 and I said I&apos;d try. By the time I got there it was 9:20 or so which was later but once I got in and with only one other table there and an hour until closing they didn&apos;t want to seat us unless we had reservations and then were very bugged we were there although it was over an hour before closing.

Second of all this place is cash only but they do not tell you when you first sit down it&apos;s not written on any menu or on their website. I did see however that it is on Yelp but you have to look for it. I was in the embarrassing situation of having to look for cash after eating because this place has no ATM and the one across the street was broken.

The poor waiter we had was such a great person. Kind and nice. Very patient and with top quality service. If I could give him 5 stars I would. I don&apos;t think it was his fault at all. But these are just issues with the restaurant.

Overall if these two issues were fixed I would come back but not until then."
4,"First things first, it is $25 per person. All tables are served the same food (aka no menu, you eat what you&apos;re served -- but you do have the choice of meat and can mention dietary restrictions i.e. gluten free).

The night starts with everyone in the group putting their hands in the middle of the table, over a bowl, as a waiter pours rose water over everyones hands. This is their way of washing hands - as you are about to eat your meal with no utensils!!! Yes, the entire meal is meant to be eaten with your hands. However, if you can&apos;t eat without a fork/knife, the staff can provide you with them.

Seems as though there are two different seatings. When making the reservation, they said availability was only 6-6:30 or 9-9:30. I like this idea of having a time window for being seated.

A belly dancer gave a two song performance during the night - great entertainment!

The food includes pita bread, vegetable appetizer, a couple of meat platters, fruit platter, and finally a dessert platter.

When we received the bill, it seemed a bit high. The waiter, while  stumbling over his words, said the corkage fee was $18, $6/bottle. This was a shock to us as all Yelp reviews said there is no corkage fee (and the waiters didn&apos;t mention it when they opened our bottles). Disappointed by that.

ALSO - IT&apos;S CASH ONLY!!!! Come prepared.

One star off for corkage fee miscommunication and we felt a bit rushed."
5,"Great food, great owners, great restaurant!

My husband and I walked from city center hoping to dine in, but the option was not available unfortunately.   Instead we were greeted by the owner, Samir, who told us we could get the food to go. He was very sweet and kind. He gave us morrocan mint tea while we waited. He even gave us metal spoons to go together with the provided plastic forks. He really went all out.

When we got to the hotel and opened the three huge bags of food, we were surprised to see a 7 course meal that would have probably fed 4 people at least. It very adorable for the amount of food we got.

It was one of the best meals I have had in a while. The whole Lemon chicken is TO DIE FOR!

Please support this business and these good people during this hard time!

We will for sure be back!"
3,"This restaurant was definitely a very unique experience. You have to ring the doorbell to get in first, like a speakeasy. The decor inside was authentic; however, I&apos;ve seen better Moroccan decor and also the restaurant felt like it was slanted. You&apos;ll understand when you walk inside. There&apos;s only two bathrooms for the whole restaurant. The restaurant is BYOB. 
All food is served family style and you do not get utensils or your own plates. Be prepared to share. We first started off with the three salad platter which came with eggplant, carrots, and a cucumber salad. The eggplant was AMAZING, probably one of the best eggplant I&apos;ve ever had! The carrots and cucumber were tangy and  refreshing too. Next came an egg meat pie, I was not really a fan of it. It was sweet yet had meat inside, it overall was a really weird and unpleasant flavor combination. Next came a spicy chicken dish, super flavorful and soft and juicy!! The sauce was to die for. After that, came a sweet lamb dish. Sweet lamb is just not my preference. It came with almonds and honey. Lastly came baklava which was good and then a fruit plate that you could just buy at the grocery store. 
Overall, the experience was just okay. An entertaining belly dancer comes out which is fun. However, only two dishes really hit the spot. The rest were just weird or mediocre. This is a fun spot to go to with a group and it&apos;s a cool experience; however, there&apos;s better Moroccan food out there."
5,Such a good experience at this place. We had a reservation at 9 on Friday night. 7 course meal for 25$ was incredible. Everyone is served the same food. The food was just great. The belly dancer was just great. Entertainment throughout the meal. The chicken was really flavorful. I enjoyed all the dishes served by them.
4,"Made a reservation for 6pm on a Friday a couple days before with no trouble. We arrived approx 15 min late due to city traffic but they had no problem accommodating us. The restaurant had a few empty tables when we arrived but seemed to fill up most of not all by the time we left (7:30 ish).

The restaurant itself is very interesting. It&apos;s decorated from the ceiling to the floor with lots of cultural decor. Colorful tapestries, times with intricate designs, carved archways, etc. However, I found the seating at this restaurant  uncomfortable -- the dining table and the dining stools were approximately the same height so I had to lean over quite a bit to eat. Additionally, the floor isn&apos;t level everywhere so watch where you walk, you might trip otherwise.

When we sat down, the server asked us if it was or first time here and we said yes. He explained the menu to us but no physical menu was given to us which was a shame because I could only make out partially what he said. I don&apos;t eat red meat so I told him I couldn&apos;t have the second course of beef/lamb so he offered to double our portions for the first course. A reasonable replacement but after reading other Yelp reviews about course replacements I wish I had asked about the spinach pie instead. 

Also a wierd thing, he never mentioned the price of the meal nor was it written anywhere. ‍ And the menu online mentions main course choices, the server didn&apos;t offer us choices, he just told us the set menu.

Okay now on to the food:

Three Salad Platter: It was delicious but they could&apos;ve gone easier with the salt on the cucumbers and carrots. The eggplant was great though!

B&apos;stella: Fantastic! This plate felt kinda more like dessert because it&apos;s covered in powdered sugar and cinnamon and my sweet tooth loved it. The menu online states that there&apos;s chicken in there but the pieces inside had a texture and taste of scrambled eggs.

First Main Course: We got two times the portion (so a four people portion instead of a two people portion!) of this since we opted out of the second main course. Oh my goodness, this plate had a two halves of a chicken on it. A whole chicken for two people? That&apos;s so much food. The chicken was fall off the bone but could use more marination -- the meat closer to the bone was blander. The sauce on top of the chicken was delicious but a bit too sour for our taste.

By this time we were already stuffed, we could only finish half of our first course.

Third course: Couscous. This was great as well!

Dessert: Baklava and fresh fruit. Baklava was delish. I&apos;d stay away from the fruit. I took one bite of a strawberry and it was dry and did not take like a strawberry. Also, I can&apos;t believe they give a giant fruit bowl at the end of this meal, we barely even finished our last two courses, there&apos;s no way we could&apos;ve even thought about eating the banana, orange, or apple in the group bowl. Also, no mint tea was served. :(

This place is CASH ONLY btw. Found this out at the end of our meal -- the server didn&apos;t mention anything, there was no physical menu, nor were there signs stating that.

Overall though, the meal was fantastic and really cheap for the crazy amount of food we got. There&apos;s an 18% gratuity they add to the check so it came out to $63 for the both of us, $31.50 each.

One last thing, there was so much food we didn&apos;t finish because the sheer amount of food they give is ridiculous. I wish we could&apos;ve taken the uneaten food home. :( food waste makes me sad"
4,"After hearing about this place for the entire time me and my wife have known one another I was excited to finally be at the place she always talked about. There I was standing in front of the legendary wooden door in the middle of a dark alley ready to embrace a piece of the Moroccan culture. It&apos;s small in here but very intimate. We were lead up to the third floor to a sort of private dining area where there was one other large party that was seated next to us. 

     After shuffling some bodies and pillows around we were ready to chow down on some food. The waiter informed us there&apos;s no menu they bring out all the meals in courses one at a time on huge plates. We were then told that there&apos;s no silverware only hands so we all placed our hands in a giant dish for washing before our dinner. First came out the huge basket of pita bread to scoop up our food we could have at least had plates in my opinion we had to put all you can grab bread on our napkins. Then came a huge plate of food which was the starter. It was scoops of different beans an salads that were all very delicious. 

     After the second course came out it was time for the main course which was the chicken. The chicken was good I enjoyed the tenderness and seasoning of the chicken and the spicy sauce that came with it. It was dry in the breast though. So dry I almost choked no lie. I was grabbing for my wine trying to hold composure and not panic. I was able to pull it off cause no one noticed and we were at a table full of people. I didn&apos;t want to make a scene like the lady that kept falling in the restaurant. 

     The desert was good although I&apos;m not a fan of baklava it tasted like any other baklava I&apos;ve ever tasted mediocre and bland but it was soft and warm so that kicked it up a notch. The dinner was finished with a plate of fresh fruit. The best part of this meal was the atmosphere and the wine. Man the wine was good. The worst part was the belly dancer I&apos;m sorry she was terrible and she wasn&apos;t even Moroccan and she couldn&apos;t dance. Everything else was worth the wait."
5,"Highly recommend for take-out during the pandemic. The food was still delicious, and they wrapped everything up very nicely for take-out. We especially loved the lamb tagine and spicy chicken entrees."
5,"O.M.G. We tried getting reservations earlier in the week and they were totally booked but ended up squeezing us in on a Saturday night. Such an authentic environment that far exceeded our expectations. Eating with our hands and the belly dancer for mid-meal entertainment definitely added to the experience. 

The set menu was amazing and captured a plethora of flavors and consistencies. The cucumber and tomato salad, eggplant, and carrot starters kicked off the meal with a bang. The chicken was so tender it just fell off the bone and right into my mouth. Probably the best baklava I&apos;ve ever had and the Moroccan tea was the perfect finisher. Highly recommend! BYOB!"
3,"In all honesty, I was expecting a lot more. Of the 6/7 courses, we only enjoyed about 3 of them. Also i think some of them would have been enjoyed best together. Bread, salads, chicken and dessert were very good. The rest wasn&apos;t great. Great ambiance. Felt like I was in a Lebanese home"
4,"I came here in a group of 4 on a Thursday night around 6pm and we had a great 7-course meal! Walking up to the front door, we could already catch amazing smells coming from the kitchen. The space is dimly lit and super cozy; the lighting and the amount of food made me incredibly relaxed and very sleepy by the end!

I love the fact that they have you wash your hands at the very beginning of the meal at the table - it&apos;s a great start to the experience. Marrakesh is a BYO, so we brought a bottle of red wine to share. Our waiter asked us if we had any allergies or dietary restrictions ahead of time, and I had a different menu than everyone else since I&apos;m a vegetarian.

My favorite course was definitely the first - cooked eggplants in tomato sauce, cucumbers and bell peppers in Mediterranean seasoning, and oasis carrots with cucumber. The eggplants and carrots were both standouts; I could have eaten the entire plate of them! The rest of the courses were good but nowhere near as flavorful as the first course. The desserts were also great - fresh fruits, baklava, and mint tea. The baklava was so sweet (which was a welcome change after so many savory courses!)

Marrakesh is a great place for a meal and a unique dining experience!"
