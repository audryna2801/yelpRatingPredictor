4,"I came here in the summer (disclaimer: this review was about my experience back in July) with a couple of girlfriends for lunch on the rooftop.
Yes the tables were spaced out, all the staff was wearing face masks, everything felt very clean and safe.

Food- My favorite thing there: CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA.
Yes this is an American restaurant and yes I&apos;m indian but let me tell you...this was honestly probably the best chicken tikka I&apos;ve ever had! I don&apos;t know if they did some fusion ingredients to it or what but it was a 10/10. The chicken tikka was so creamy, the cucumber raita was so fresh, and the basmati rice was just right. 
Hummus and pita was good too, didn&apos;t &apos;wow&apos; me as much as the entree but definitely could tell it was all made to order.

Environment/Vibes- spectacular. The decor, lighting, and overall ambience was just such a good mood. 

Return? yea sure if I&apos;m ever in Philly again
Recommend? Yes"
2,"The place has a good look and I like the nest chairs on the 2nd floor. The food was decent, coffee alright.

However, their utensils were DDIIIRTTYY. From forks to spoons to glasses, it was obvious someone really did not care about washing! Really ruined our appetite for this place, for I definitely can&apos;t trust them to provide properly cooked safe food if a clean fork and knife is too much for them!"
4,"I&apos;ve frequented this location of the Continental about five times in the last year and every experience from food to service has been wonderful. 

Most recently, my husband and I did outdoor dining. Although the location at the intersection of some busy streets is not ideal, you do what you need to do during these times.  

We ordered a hamburger and a turkey burger. Both came with the option of a side salad or french fries. We were surprised on how large and delicious the side salad was and French fries were great too. We both enjoyed our burgers. 

We&apos;ve been here for brunch a few times and had great food and service during that occasion. I&apos;ve had the Crunchy Brioche French Toast and omelette.  Additionally, we&apos;ve also been here for New Year&apos;s Eve last year.  We appreciated the fact they were serving their regular menu and not a pricey NYE 3 or 4 course prix fixe.

We had a wonderful evening. The food was awesome, service was great and I really love the ambiance here.  It was a very busy night given the occasion, but the entire staff and our waitress were on the ball.  The staff was all dressed in sparkly party attire, which was a nice touch for the night.

I ordered the Baby Kale and Beet Salad and the Spinach Ravioli.  The salad was great, but I especially loved the Ravioli.  I&apos;m not one for thick heavy pasta dishes, but this Ravioli was prepared very thin. In fact you could see the spinach right through it.  It was really tasty! 

The rest of the table ordered the Seared Tuna, Salmon Sashimi Poké Bowl, Braised Short Rib.  Everyone enjoyed their meal. 

Dessert was the only thing that did not impress me too much. We ordered the Smores Cheesecake, and the Cookie and Brownie Sundae.  The desserts were good, but nothing to write home about. Most recently, my husband and I did outdoor dining. Although the location at the intersection some busy streets is not ideal, you do what you need to do during these times"
5,Love this place! Love the retro vibe and the menu is always so delicious. Recommend the cheesesteak egg rolls and kale beet salad
3,"Best part of dining at Thai establishment was their attention to public safety during the pandemic.  On this lazy Sunday we shared a 3 course meal  starting with the French onion dumplings- baked with gruyere cheese,very interesting, creative and tasty meal. Next we shared the cheese steak egg roll,surprisingly very tasty amd not as crunchy fried as anticipated... better this way. Lastly, we shared the Turkey burger but changed it up to Presidential style. All in all, a relaxing tasty lazy afternoon outing."
4,"So color me surprised this place cen is actually pretty good. We had a big group so it was difficult to get a reservation at other brunch places and also not have to get super early to go at opening. 

Super nice decor. I thought it would be more doner like but it was super nice all around. 

We got a mix of brunch, lunch stuff from the salmon hash, omelettes, lox bagel plate, Belgian waffles, to the rad na, lobster Mac and cheese,and the French onion soup dumplings.

Everything was good, not mind blowing, but good honest food.  

We were surprised by the diversity and range of the food so that was a plus. 

So yeah will definitely come back if we have this kind of need again."
4,"come to continental for drinks, not really food. their main entrées tend to be soaked in sauce or actually too dry, there&apos;s no middle ground. also their portions tend to be veryyyy tiny, the only thing that was good in my opinion was the fries that are cut very thinly and fried to the crisp. 

for drinks though, a 5/5! they have fun cocktails and i love the twizzler because they give it to you in a separate little can that surprisingly holds a lot of liquid. i enjoy hopping up to the rooftop, but also the upstairs area with dinosaur cushions is fun too. again, continental doesn&apos;t have great food for me, so i usually just get the hummus plate to munch on with drinks."
4,"I&apos;ve frequented The Continental in years past, but I have not been there in quite a few years. However, I was in downtown Philly on a Saturday afternoon with a good friend and we decided to stop off at Continental.

I sat down and we were given our menus. They were still serving brunch when we were there, so the lunch options were somewhat limited. After concurring with our waitresses, we decided to just get entrees.

I ended up getting the crispy calamari salad. As we waited for our food, we ordered some pita bread for the table. Unfortunately, they did not have any hummus ready at the moment, but they brought out some olive oil, which was nice. The pita bread was quite good. It was soft, warm and had a nice, unique baked taste.

I just got a salad for my entree because they are quite big. I went with the crispy calamari salad, which came out in about 15 minutes and was topped with vinaigrette dressing. The calamari was pretty heavily fried, so I removed some of the bread. I do prefer grilled calamari, but the fried calamari that continental served was still tasty. As I stated before, the salad was quite big and I was actually unable to finish the whole thing.

The ambiance here is quite nice and has a fairly hip feel. There are hanging overhead lights and on the second level there are hanging chairs.

Our waitress was nice, helpful in making meal suggestions and served our food in a timely fashion. 

Altogether, The Continental is a very nice restaurant that is a fairly nice spot to get a tasty bite to eat in Center City."
3,"I&apos;ve always wanted to come here because the large olive on the storefront always intrigued me. However, I was quite disappointed by the quality of the food. We ordered Crispy Brussel Sprouts, Cheesesteak Eggrolls, and Braised Short Rib. 

- The Brussel Sprout were amazing and a very large portion for an appetizer. The yogurt sauce that went with it was delicious. However, the meal went downhill from there. 

- The Cheesesteak Eggrolls were so incredibly dry I could barely swallow it without water. I felt like I was eating sandpaper. In fact, I had to drink two glasses of water to get it down but the waitress never came by to refill my water again so I had to go the rest of my meal thirsty. 

- The Short Rib wasn&apos;t too bad but it was unexpectedly chewy and hard to break apart even with a fork and knife. 

The place where I was seated was also very dark and for some reason, the lights above me kept on going on and off so we would occasionally sit in darkness. Very strange experience and perhaps it would have been better if we sat upstairs or near the window."
5,"Awesome location right in Center City near everything. It&apos;s close to my job so I frequent often. The restaurant inside is fairly big with several floors and seating areas including a roof deck. Some are booths, some are tables, there&apos;s lounge areas and they even have swinging chairs which are my favorite. 

The food is delicious, don&apos;t think I&apos;ve disliked anything I&apos;ve eaten here in the many times visited. The staff is very friendly and polite. They check on you often and provide great service. They also have an amazing happy hour, everything is so cheap. Overall, would highly recommend."
4,"I just love the vibe of this place. It&apos;s like a hip, modern diner serving Asian fusion style food.  And love that they serve food super late - I always seem to end up here, well super late.  After having a drink at 1 Tippling, we walked down to Continental (around 11 pm) because they were no longer serving food at Tippling (they stop at like 8 pm).  

Even though it wasn&apos;t on the menu, they made me an old fashioned that was actually better than the one I&apos;d had at Tippling.  My friend ordered the fries and quesadilla, and the fries were insane. I don&apos;t remember them always being so intense, but they are super skinny almost like potato sticks and served as a huge mound with a wasabi mayo that clears your sinuses.  Definitely share these. I wish they were a bit less thin because they weren&apos;t that easy to eat and were a bit unsatisfying, but still very good, and definitely has that &quot;wow&quot; factor in terms of presentation."
4,This place has an awesome atmosphere! It&apos;s somehow takes you back to a different decade while being futuristic. Their drinks were fun and inventive to match the decor. The servers were extremely attentive and the other staff members were friendly. I had the calamari salad which was delicious. The menu here is a little all over the place. I would definitely come back again!
3,The food was fine but not worth the price in my opinion. A lot of the food is Asian fusion food which is fun. You&apos;re definitely paying for the good service and nice dining ambience. I am pretty disappointed in their seating arrangement with covid. Their booths were all full for dinner so you are dining back to back with people with a plexiglass separating the booths which is better than nothing but the proximity was still uncomfortable. Probably wouldn&apos;t recommend coming here if you&apos;re trying to be extra cautious with Covid.
3,"Overall the continental has a pretty cool vibe. Love the decor of the place. It gets crazy busy on weekends so don&apos;t even bother stopping by without a reservation. While waiting for our table on a Friday night we watched multiple people get turned away because they didn&apos;t have a reservation. 

Drink: the twizzler was my personal fav. If you like the candy you will def like the drink. Also cool that you can get a large shaker/ party shaker which is like their version of a pitcher of their signature cocktails. Def recommendation

Food: I got the crab pad Thai and my friend got the cheesesteak egg rolls. Overall pretty average. I mean food was good. Nothing to complain about but not really like WOW either. 

Philly has a lot of really great places to eat and in my opinion the continental isn&apos;t one of the best but it does have some cool drinks and decor so worth checking out in my opinion."
4,"I stopped by this spot a couple of times recently thinking it was a cafe... let&apos;s be honest, it looks like a really nice cafe. But it is t open for breakfast. I decided to stop in for lunch and it was great. I had a curried chicken salad sandwich on nan bread. Wasn&apos;t sure if it could taste as good as it sounded on the menu, but it was actually better. The only thing I didn&apos;t like were the odd 2 way mirrors on the restrooms. I walked down and there was a lady fixing her makeup with absolutely no concept of the fact that folks could see her on the other side. Kind of creepy folks. 

Overall, great food, uncomfortable restrooms, and I still wish they had been open for breakfast. But I will be back for that sandwich!"
4,"I&apos;ve been to the Continental a few times, but most recently for happy hour. Happy hour is served at the downstairs bar, upstairs bar, and the roof deck bar from 5pm-7pm. Although you do have to sit at the bar to get happy hour pricing, there is some lounge type seating behind the upstairs bar that is included in happy hour. 

During happy hour we got a few drinks as well as some small plates to share and I couldn&apos;t believe how inexpensive our bill was! For regular meals, I think this place is a bit overpriced. This is definitely a perfect happy hour spot for a small group. 

I&apos;ve been to the roof top once during the summer, but I did not realize it is also open during the winter. We couldn&apos;t go up due to a private party, but I would definitely come back to try out that scenery!"
5,"I recently went to Midtown with my gf and we had a wonderful time! She was having a bad day so I requested to have the chairs that swing from the table to have some fun while I took her to dinner (note: tables with the hanging chairs are for two people only). The hostesses made sure I had the table I asked for and were very nice. 

We enjoyed the appetizer selection so much that we decided to order all appetizers! We ended up choosing the French onion soup dumpling, the tuna tartare, a BBQ chicken quesadilla, and two Korean pork tacos. They were all amazing and I would reccomend the quesadilla as it was very well presented as well as put together (lots of quesadillas can be messy and fall apart but this one did not). We finished off our appetizer dinner with a round of banana cream puffs and a deep dish cookie. They were both as good as they sound! 

I can&apos;t wait to come back and try out more of the menu!"
5,Evan L. Is such a cool bartender. He has so much knowledge about the city and his drinks are on point. I had such a fun week in Philly. Thanks Evan!
4,"Upon arriving we were greeted by friendly staff. Our waiter was really nice. He made sure our food was ok. However I didn&apos;t get any refill on my water. That&apos;s why I took a star down.

Lobster Mac and cheese is very good. There are chunks of lobster in it. What is unique about it is that it uses orzo instead of elbow pasta. Not too cheesy but enough so that it doesn&apos;t become a heavy meal.

Tuna with mushroom risotto is really good. It&apos;s a medium size meal. Tuna is crusted with sesame rare in the middle. Risotto is perfectly cooked with balanced flavor of soy sauce underneath it.

Calamari salad is huge. Calamari I lightly breaded. Perfectly cooked, tender, and not rubbery at all.

Overall there&apos;s nothing negative I can say about the food"
5,"Wow!  During my stay in Philly, I stopped by the Continental because it looked so groovy.  I was glad I did, as it prompted me to make a return visit!

On the first visit, I enjoyed the Hot Roast Beef sandwiches.  I can say without hesitation that this was one of the best sandwiches I&apos;ve ever had.  You have to try it!  When I returned for dinner, I enjoyed the Peruvian Skirt Steak, which was also excellent.  

First and foremost, I love the atmosphere here.  From the sunken dining area to the swings upstairs, it is so much fun. On top of everything, the service was friendly and efficient.  

I can&apos;t wait to return!"
